At the same time, the distribution of funds provided by the Exchequer must be subject to prudent management and financial controls and to criteria which provide for accountability and auditing. </p><p>In the case of small businesses, the controls that have been put in place for payment under the scheme are considered reasonable, including that the business must have been trading at the time of the flooding incident and that the business must have been operating in a rateable premises.</p><p>Applications under a threshold of &euro;5,000 are being paid following a quick verification process between the Irish Red Cross and the local authority responsible for the area in which the business was flooded.</p><p>The second stage of the scheme provides a means to seek further support of up to &euro;20,000 per property.  This involves a more lengthy process requiring a detailed assessment by loss adjusters appointed for this purpose by the Irish Red Cross.</p><p>I have visited a number of sites affected by the flooding in recent weeks and have seen at first hand the difficulties many small businesses have experienced. In cases of particular hardship I am open to having the criteria reviewed where exceptional circumstances arise.</p></reply>

Significant precautions are taken by Irish Defence Forces Medical Officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of our Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications.    </p>  <p>  It is the policy of the Irish Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability.  I am advised by the Director Medical Branch that this has been the policy since the Defence Forces first embarked on overseas service.</p>  <p>  Where the overseas mission is to a malaria-prone region, a medical risk assessment for Lariam is carried out on an individual basis.  The Irish Defence Forces policy in relation to the use of anti-malarial medication is in line with current Health Products Regulatory Authority approved summary of product characteristics. Every effort is made by Defence Forces Medical Officers to ensure compliance with this screening policy.</p></reply>

The scope of the project is to develop mobile, remotely-controlled technologies to enable an improved identification and detection of Chemical Biological Radioactive Nuclear (CBRN) materials and collection of forensic evidence in a variety of situation and conditions.  The overall goal of the project is to fundamentally change how CBRN events are assessed and ensure the safety of Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel and crime scene investigators by reducing the need for them to enter a dangerous scene to gather evidence.</p><p>The role of the Ordnance Corps is to participate as &quot;end users&quot; and they will assist in developing scenarios and assessing results.</p><p>The project will be led by NUI Galway and involves a number of Irish entities.  A number of other countries are also represented in the consortium.  While the project has been main-listed for funding, no contract has been awarded yet, and it would therefore be premature to disclose further details in relation to the project and other consortium members at this time.</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution being made by Defence Organisation in its engagement with Irish-based institutions for research purposes.  These collaborations contribute to Defence Forces' capabilities and also support Ireland's economic development.</p><p>This latest achievement will undoubtedly open doors for further collaborations between the Defence Organisation and Research Institutes and Companies.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Military Authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force, at 31 December 2015, the latest date for which details are available, was 9,140 whole-time equivalent personnel.  This figure comprises 7,309 Army, 748 Air Corps and 1,083 Naval Service whole-time equivalent personnel.  </p><p>The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services. <font color="#FF0000"> </font>Personnel are posted on the basis of operational needs across the organisation both at home and abroad.  The significant turnover of personnel that is the norm in military services, requires targeted recruitment so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels.</p><p>A General Service recruitment campaign was launched on 4 August 2015 and is ongoing.  As of 31<sup></sup>December 2015, 49 Cadets, 307 General Service Army &amp;amp; Navy recruits and 50 other personnel including apprentices, instrumentalists and doctors were inducted into the Defence Forces.  Further recruitment campaigns are planned for 2016.</p><p>With the support of the Chief of Staff, I am confident that we will retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</p></reply>

It comprises of those Ministers and senior officials that have a lead or support role in Government emergency planning.The Government Task Force co-ordinates and oversees the emergency management policy and activities of all Government Departments and public agencies. It is supported by the Office of Emergency Planning, Department of Defence.  </p><p>The Government Task Force continues to meet on a regular basis, meeting on 5 occasions in 2015.  I chaired the last meeting, which was held on 12 November 2015.  At the last meeting, in addition to the normal agenda and attendance, other ministerial colleagues also attended to receive briefings on winter preparations by the relevant Departments/Agencies.  The meeting was followed by a joint launch of the annual &quot;Be Winter Ready2 Information Campaign.  This provides practical advice on how best to prepare for the winter; ensures the public are aware of where advice and help can be found and aims to reassure the public that preparations are being made and arrangements have been put in place to ensure that there will be a co-ordinated response to severe weather events.</p><p>While details of matters discussed at meetings are confidential, I can confirm that the Government Task Force continues to examine current risks and supports the co-ordination arrangements for emergency planning across a &quot;Whole of Government&quot; approach.  Meetings provide briefings on matters such as current security threats, cyber security and horizon scanning across the lead Departments, as well as regular briefings on topical matters.</p><p>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is the lead Department for flooding response in accordance with defined roles and responsibilities contained within Strategic Emergency Planning Guidelines.  During the recent severe weather and flooding the Department chaired the National Emergency Co-ordination Group (NECG), which managed the national level response and provided media briefings.  A wide range of senior officials and experts met almost daily, with 30 meetings held between 3 December 2015 and 13 January 2016.  I was kept regularly briefed during this period.</p><p>The work of the NECG nationally and, particularly, the work of the Local Authorities, Civil Defence, the Defence Forces, and many other public, community and voluntary organisations locally, in managing and responding to such events is to be commended.  While flood levels have not fully subsided, there is ongoing monitoring and assessment of the situation and Government and the relevant Departments/Agencies continue to be briefed and updated, as required.  </p><p>A further meeting of the Government Task Force would, in the normal course of events have been held in December 2015.  However, in view of the ongoing meetings taking place of the NECG, this was postponed and will now take place in February.<b></b></p></reply>

The Regulations provide that a recommendation for the award of the Distinguished Service Medal must be made and forwarded to the Chief of Staff not later than four years after the performance of the act in respect of which the recommendation is made.  </p><p>I have been advised by the military authorities that there is no record of such a recommendation having been made, at the time of the event or at any time since, for the actions taken by the two individuals that have been the subject of a number of representations that I have recently received on the matter.  </p><p>The report into the incident acknowledges the performance of these two men, along with the rest of the ship&rsquo;s company, in extinguishing the fire on the L&Eacute; Cl&iacute;ona in May 1962.

Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.      </p>  <p>  There is ongoing and close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters, including ATCP deployments and a wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies.  Regular co-ordination and liaison meetings also take place between the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues. </p>  <p>  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment are available for deployment in response to any security and other emergencies that may arise. Within the Defence Forces, both the Ordnance Corps and the Army Ranger Wing specialise in providing an immediate response to emergency incidents that might require their highly specialised capabilities.   </p>  <p>  The Ordnance Corps consists of a number of Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams which are on standby 24/7 to respond when a request for assistance is received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with suspect devices.   </p>  <p>  The Army Ranger Wing is an integral unit of the Defence Forces whose roles include provision of specialist ATCP support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The need for a high level of preparedness to deal with any requests for special forces operations is inherent in the unit&rsquo;s mission.  Members are trained to the highest levels of motivation, physical fitness and skill at arms for their specialist role.  The ARW is on standby to be called upon to undertake duties in any part of the country. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that the Defence Forces keep their operational plans and response capabilities for dealing with a wide range of threats under constant review and I can confirm that a further review of operational plans has been instigated by the Defence Forces in light of the dreadful terrorist attacks that recently occurred in Paris. </p>  <p>  It is my priority as Minister for Defence to ensure that the operational capacity of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible.  On an ongoing basis I receive advice in this regard from the Chief of Staff and he has confirmed to me that he is satisfied that the Defence Forces are equipped and resourced to respond as appropriate to any such events were they to occur in this State.    </p></reply>

With regard to any future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I recently attended the meeting of Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers, which took place in Brussels on 17th November 2015 at which my French colleague, Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drein, invoked Article 42.7 of the Treaty on European Union, following the tragic events in Paris on 13 November. </p>  <p>  Following that invocation there has been ongoing liaison between officials from my Department and French authorities at which various options for how Ireland could be of assistance are being explored.  One option being explored is examining what support Ireland may be able to offer to missions which suffer gaps as a result of France or other nations withdrawing forces to undertake alternative operations.  This includes the possibility for the potential enhancement of our current deployment to the EU Training Mission in Mali to which 10 members of the Permanent Defence Force are deployed. </p>  <p>  The purpose of any deployment of additional Defence Forces personnel would be to ensure the continued effectiveness of UN mandated missions.  To inform my consideration of this issue, the military authorities recently visited both the UN mission (MINUSMA) and EUTM Mali.  I plan to bring forward proposals to Government for approval to allow for the deployment of some additional trainers and mission support staff in the EU Training mission in Mali.  The issue of providing support to the UN peacekeeping mission MINUSMA will be kept under review.      </p></reply>

Planning is now at an advanced stage to ensure appropriate levels of involvement by the Defence Forces in many of the events that are scheduled for the year ahead as part of the State Centenary Programme. </p><p>The role of the Defence Forces will be extensive and central to the State Ceremonial events.  This commenced on 1<sup>st</sup>August 2015 when the centenary of the funeral of O&rsquo;Donovan Rossa was marked with a State ceremony at Glasnevin Cemetary.  On 1<sup>st</sup>January 2016 the Defence Forces played an important ceremonial role in a Flag Raising event held in Dublin Castle.</p><p>The Commemoration at the GPO on Easter Sunday 2016 will be followed by a parade which will entail a full military display including peace keeping elements. There will be approximately 2,500 Defence Forces personnel marching in the parade including three bands and horses and a range of Defence Forces vehicles. The centre piece of the parade will have a peacekeeping theme.</p><p>A wide range of other State events are being organised to mark the centenary and many will involve participation by the Defence Forces.  For example, on Easter Monday, synchronised wreath-laying ceremonies will be held at iconic sites in Dublin and at key locations countrywide and all will incorporate a formal military ceremonial element.  They will participate in State ceremonies to mark the 1916 rising anniversary date on 24<sup>th</sup>April 2016 in Arbour Hill and at events on the anniversary dates in May of the execution of 15 of the leaders of the 1916 Rising that are being held at both Kilmainham Gaol and Cork.</p><p>There are a number of other events with significant Defence Forces involvement, such as a comprehensive programme of events relating to the National Flag including flag raising ceremonies in Dublin and elsewhere, and the presentation by members of the Defence Forces of the National Flag to all of the Primary schools in the State.  This element of the Programme has already commenced and will continue up until March this year. </p><p>Overall, it is clear that my Department and the Defence Forces will play a very central and important role in many of the historic Commemoration events that will take place during 2016.  </p></reply>

It only applies to premises that have been flooded and it is intended as an emergency humanitarian assistance contribution rather than compensation for loss of earnings, loss of business goodwill or as replacement for the cover provided by insurance.</p><p>The emergency nature of the response to the difficulties of organisations affected by the flooding required a speedy process in order to meet their needs.  In this regard a two step approach was taken, involving an initial application which, if successful would lead to a quick payment, capped at &euro;5,000 per property.  Applications under the &euro;5,000 threshold are being paid following a quick verification process between the Irish Red Cross and the local authority responsible for the area in which the business was flooded.</p><p>The second stage of the scheme provides a means to seek further support of up to &euro;20,000 per property.  This involves a more lengthy process requiring a detailed assessment by loss adjusters appointed for this purpose by the Irish Red Cross.</p><p>The Red Cross is continuing to process applications and is making payments on a daily basis.

The visit afforded us an opportunity to see, at first hand, the tremendous work done overseas by the Irish Defence Forces.  On the 21st and 22nd December respectively, we met with Defence Forces personnel serving as part of a joint Finnish/Irish battalion with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in south Lebanon and personnel serving with the 50th Infantry Group with the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) based in Camp Ziouani on the Israeli side of the area of separation.

In this regard, the Defence Forces hold a wide range of engineering and transport plant and equipment for military purposes.  All such plant and equipment suitable for use in emergency situations is made available as the need arises.    </p>  <p>  During the recent period of severe weather from 4 December 2015 the Defence Forces responded positively to all requests for support received from the three principal response agencies.  Most requests were from the Local Authorities, given their central role in the flood response. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces have a wide range of high-axle 4x4, 6x6 and 8x8 vehicles capable of lifting personnel, stores and equipment into and out of areas affected by flooding or other weather conditions.  The Defence Forces also have a small number of 4x4 Ambulance vehicles which also can be made available if required. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces Engineering Corps has a number of flat bottomed and inflatable boats and trained crews that can be deployed to assist in flooded areas. The Defence Forces have a large number of life jackets which can be made available to assist in the movement of persons from flooded areas by boat or vehicle if necessary.  They also have a number of high pressure pumps and a number of mobile lighting units and generators which can be made available when required.  Engineer plant such as dump trucks, and bulldozers etc. are also available in limited numbers, as are other light engineer stores such as sandbags. The Defence Forces also have the capacity to maintain water pumps and to aid in the construction of flood defences.   </p>  <p>  The most important asset that the Defence Forces can provide is personnel, equipped with personal protective equipment, to operate during extreme weather events and with the capacity to support and sustain those personnel if deployed.  As was the case in the recent flooding, 3,096 numbers of Defence Forces personnel were made available countrywide for such support when required. </p>  <p>  The Air Corps operate a small fleet of eight light and medium lift twin engine helicopters which can provide a capability for helicopter support services when required.  Typical tasks might include the movement of essential personnel into inaccessible flooded areas, aerial reconnaissance of the extent of flooding, the movement of specialised equipment (such as pumps etc.) into confined or inaccessible locations and the movement of fodder for farm animals that are inaccessible by other means.   </p>  <p>  The Naval Service and the Naval Reserve is well versed in the operation of plant such as pumps and generators etc. and is able to provide same if required in emergency situations.  They also have Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats and other watercraft providing a localised capacity to assist.     </p>  <p>  I should also mention that over 700 Civil Defence volunteers assisted the principal response agencies across the country during the recent severe weather events.  Members of Civil Defence were involved in a wide range of activities including sand-bagging, pumping water, evacuating people from their homes, rescuing motorists from flood waters, getting patients to hospital, checking up on vulnerable people and transporting children to school.  Civil Defence equipment deployed in these efforts included four wheel drive vehicles, boats, portable pumps, fire tenders, an all terrain vehicle, floating pontoons, command and control vehicles, vans and trucks.   </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources available to them, including specialised equipment, to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government including the provision of assistance in emergency situations that may arise.  The equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and the Naval Service will be considered in the context of the lifetime of the recently published White Paper.  It recognises that there are several new and or enhanced platforms to be procured to ensure that the Defence Forces are fully equipped to meet the roles required by Government.    </p></reply>

In July 2014 the alleged perpetrator, Mr. Mahmoud Bazzi, who had been residing in the United States was arrested for administrative immigration violations.  Following an immigration court hearing in August 2014 the Judge ruled that Mr. Bazzi be deported to Lebanon as he admitted that he entered the United States in 1994 without proper documentation.  He was deported from the United States to his native Lebanon on 30 January 2015.  On arrival in Beirut, Mr. Bazzi was arrested and detained by the Lebanese authorities where he remains in custody.  </p>  <p>  On 26 June 2015, the trial of Mr. Mahmoud Bazzi commenced before the Military Tribunal, in Beirut, Lebanon.  Following deliberations the President of the Military Tribunal, adjourned the Session to 25 November 2015.     </p>  <p>  When the Military Tribunal resumed in November 2015 it heard evidence from Ex-Private John O&rsquo;Mahony who was seriously injured during the incident in which his colleagues lost their lives.  Mr. O&rsquo;Mahony was cross-examined by defence counsel.  The case was then adjourned for a second time and with the next hearing scheduled to take place on 20th April 2016.  The Department of Defence has engaged the services of a senior legal adviser in Lebanon to support the Department and the Irish Government in advancing this case.  He has advised that the trial proceedings are a matter for the President of the Tribunal similar to the role and prerogative of the Judge in Irish Courts.  He has indicated that there may be a number of reasons the adjournments have taken place including the need to bring further witnesses before the Tribunal. </p>  <p>  During my recent visit with the Taoiseach to the Lebanon last December, I met with the Lebanese authorities at the most senior levels of Government and highlighted the Irish Government&rsquo;s continued commitment and interest in progressing this case.  </p></reply>

At the informal meeting of Defence Ministers in Luxembourg on 3rd September 2015, I had discussions regarding the Defence Forces participation in UN peacekeeping operations including the UNDOF mission, with the UN Under Secretary-General, Mr Herv&eacute; Ladsous.<i></i>I confirmed Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to UN operations but stressed the importance of Ireland being involved in active rather than passive peacekeeping.  In relation to UNDOF, I pointed out that if Ireland was not required in UNDOF in the future, then consideration would be given to other options for deployments on behalf of the UN.  At this point in time, however, the presence of the UNDOF mission remains an important element in ensuring stability on the Golan Heights and in the Middle East region.  </p></reply>

Though the costing model accurately reflects the increased full year cost for the scheme, the likelihood is that there will be little additional supply achieved for persons seeking rent supplement support due to the constrained market.  There is also the additional risk in a market with such tight supply that rent supplement limits would generate homelessness for low income/single earner families who could no longer compete with the higher rents on offer for rent supplement recipients.</p>  <p>  In view of these difficulties, the Department has implemented a policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits for both existing customers and new applicants to the rent supplement scheme.  The circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits, as appropriate.  In addition, the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute, with plans under way to extend this to Galway city. </p>  <p>  This flexible approach has assisted over 6,100 households nationwide to retain their rented accommodation through increased rent payments.  Persons in receipt of rent supplement who may be at risk of losing their tenancy as a result of increases in rent are urged to contact their local Community Welfare Service or the Threshold Tenancy Sustainment Service without delay. </p></reply>

The main exception is carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA), which is paid at half-rate when a person who has an underlying entitlement to CA is also in receipt of another social welfare payment or where an increase is being claimed in respect of that person on their spouse, civil partner or cohabitant&rsquo;s social welfare payment (IQA).  </p>  <p>  In this specific case, the spouse of the person concerned is being paid an IQA of &euro;209.00 per week in respect of the person concerned on his State Pension Contributory (SPC).  It is open to the person concerned to request to be paid a full-rate CA but that would not be financially advantageous to the couple because the IQA would have to cease.  To receive full-rate CA in place of IQA on the spouse's SPC would result in a net loss to the couple of &euro;88 per week.  Consequently, the Department advises that the person remain in receipt of half-rate CA along with the IQA on her spouse's pension.</p></reply>

It provides financial support to community companies that provide revenue generating services of a social inclusion nature.  Many of these companies are also funded from other sources and generate revenue from the public use of their facilities and services.  The CSP provides a contribution to the wage costs of the companies on the basis that the services are not fully self-financing or the cost of provision would be prohibitive on users.  The Department does not set the wage rate but requires the payment of appropriate wage rates, consistent with local norms.</p><p>At December 2015, 398 companies employing some 2,800 employees were directly supported by the CSP.  The Department estimates that, at the end of 2015, some 60% of these employees were being paid above the level of the minimum wage, in keeping with the social inclusion and social benefit objectives of the programme.  The Department is committed to working with the remaining companies to achieve the objective of paying a reasonable wage.  The Deputy should note that the CSP accounts for less than a third of the resources generated by these companies.</p><p>Contracts of up to three years duration are provided for under the CSP.  Arrangements whereby individual companies will be able to access additional financial resources to compensate for the welcome increase in the minimum wage are being put in place.  Submissions will be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the annual funding commitment being adjusted accordingly, where it is found to be warranted.  An advance of 25% of the contract value for 2016 has been, or is in the course of being, paid to companies currently in the programme.  This ensures that immediate cash-flow requirements are supported.</p><p>Overall, I am satisfied that the level of resources available to the CSP in 2016 at just over &euro;45m will be adequate to meet the on-going funding needs of the programme.  I have no plans to change the current arrangements whereby the level of resources to support services is determined on a case by case basis, based on individual company and service circumstances.</p></reply>

An additional &euro;3 million was allocated to the programme as part of Budget 2016, bringing the allocation to &euro;42 million in 2016. </p>  <p>  There are two schemes operated under the school meals programme.  The first scheme is the urban school meals scheme which is operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department.  The second is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects. </p>  <p>  The urban school meals scheme is processed on a financial year basis. In 2014, approximately &euro;1m was provided by the Department to the local authorities benefiting over 62,000 pupils in some 330 schools.  In 2015 &euro;1.1m was provided benefiting over 55,000 pupils in 300 schools.  It is likely that a similar amount will be expended in 2016.</p>  <p>  Funding under the school meals local projects scheme is provided over the course of an academic year. In the academic year 2014/2015, funding totalling some &euro;32.5m was provided to over 1,100 organisations, benefiting in excess of 155,000 children in 1,340 schools, pre-schools and other groups.  For the 2015/2016 academic year, which generally finishes end June, approximately &euro;37m has been committed to date to some 1,090 organisations.  The Department continues to receive applications under the scheme. </p>  <p>  Following the provision of additional funding in recent budgets, the Department has been in a position to grant increases to DEIS schools and special schools for the current academic year where sought.  There has been a particular focus on the promotion of breakfast clubs within the programme, which provide very positive outcomes for vulnerable children in terms of their school attendance, punctuality and energy levels.</p></reply>

The EEC Equality Directive 79/9 and the subsequent Supreme Court case (Hyland <i>v </i>Minister for Social Welfare, 1989) led to the change in treatment of non-married cohabiting couples in the social welfare code.  The Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were cohabiting.  Accordingly, couples who are married and cohabiting are treated identically to couples who are cohabiting but not married for social welfare purposes since the Social Welfare Act No 2, 1989. </p><p>The tax treatment of married and cohabiting couples is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

However, the Department of Social Protection has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as flooding.</p><p>In early December 2015, the Department activated its humanitarian assistance scheme, administered by the local Community Welfare Service (CWS), to assist householders affected by the severe weather conditions.  Since early December 2015, support has been provided to some 400 households at a cost of &euro;439,000. </p><p>In dealing with emergency events of this nature, the Department generally adopts a three stage approach as follows:</p><p>-  Stage 1 is to provide emergency income support payments (food, clothing and personal items) in the immediate aftermath of the event.  A relatively small amount of financial assistance is generally provided initially with payments around the country ranging from &euro;100 to &euro;500 depending on family size.  A person may get an emergency income support payment under the scheme without regard to their income as the primary objective of these payments is to address the person&rsquo;s immediate need.</p><p>-  Stage 2 generally involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items.  It is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes will become known.</p><p>-  Stage 3 is to identify what longer term financial support or works are required. It could take several months before this stage of response commences and this involves a cross Departmental/Agency response.  Works carried out can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring and painting.</p><p>The scheme is demand led and there is a time lag between the flooding event and actual claims for financial support.  It is to be expected that the number of claims increase in the weeks following a flooding event with a move into stage 2 and stage 3 supports which cover the replacement of furniture and white goods and longer term financial supports.</p><p>The income test for stage 2 and stage 3 of the humanitarian assistance scheme is fair and the means assessment is significantly more generous than that which applies in the case of means tested social welfare schemes generally.  The basic principle of the income test is that individuals and families with average levels of income will qualify for assistance.  The income test determines the household&rsquo;s ability to meet the costs of restoring their home to a habitable condition and all household income will be considered as part of the assessment.  For example, a family consisting of a couple and two children with a gross household income of &euro;70,000 or less will receive 100% of the amount allowable in respect of their application.  A reduced level of support can be provided in cases where such families have income over &euro;70,000.</p><p>Assistance is not provided for losses which are covered by insurance or for commercial and business losses, or generally any loss or damage to private rented accommodation or local authority accommodation.  The scheme is confined to assisting persons who have suffered damage to their homes.  As the person referred to by Deputy Aylward is not residing in the premises affected, assistance is not available under the humanitarian assistance scheme.  The Irish Red Cross is operating a separate scheme for small businesses and Community, Voluntary and Sporting Bodies affected by the recent flooding.  The qualifying criteria for small business under that scheme is a matter for the Irish Red Cross and the Department of Defence.</p><p>People seeking assistance under the humanitarian assistance scheme should contact their local DSP Intreo Centre or CWS office who will be able to offer assistance.  Department contact phone numbers for persons in affected areas are available on the Department&rsquo;s website, as follows:</p><p>.</p></reply>

In terms of supervision and oversight, the Pensions Act provides the framework for the regulation of occupational pension schemes.  The Act requires that trustees of pension schemes carry out the duties imposed on them by all law (including the Pensions Act) including the schemes trust deed and rules.  Therefore, the trustees of occupational pension schemes hold overall responsibility for the correct payment of pension benefits and for member communication regarding benefit entitlements (and any change thereof).  Accordingly, scheme members with queries should contact their scheme trustees in the first instance.</p>  <p>  In order to seek recourse for any perceived breach of entitlement, the nature of any breach must first be identified.  Any matters relating to compliance with the provisions of the Pensions Act can be referred to the Pensions Authority for investigation.  Complaints appropriate to the Pensions Authority will be investigated by the Authority where there is evidence that a breach of the Pensions Act has occurred and the extent of such a breach.  </p>  <p>  This responsibility does not extend to the supervision of the trust deed or scheme rules.  Remedies exist within trust law for any breach of the trust deed.  A breach of the rules of the scheme resulting in a loss for the member would typically be handled by the Pension Ombudsman.  Pension schemes are required to establish internal procedures for the resolution of disputes.  These procedures must be exhausted before a complaint can be referred to the Pensions Ombudsman for investigation.</p>  <p>  In relation to the State pension, to safeguard the sustainability of the pension system in the context of increasing life expectancy, the age at which a State pension may become available was raised from 65 to 66 from January 1st 2014.  Whilst the State pension is not available before the age of 66, subject to the normal qualifying criteria, where people leave paid employment prior to reaching State pension age, they are entitled to apply for another social welfare payments (such as a jobseekers payment), which may be available until they become eligible for a State pension.</p></reply>

Following a full examination of its operations in 2013, a number of concerns were raised relating to the outputs being achieved by the company when compared with similar operations nationally.  The company was informed that the Department could not sustain the level of financial support should the level of outputs not increase.  The funding contract included conditions relating to the need for the company to generate additional income and diversify its services to improve performance.  Improved financial monitoring, risk strategy, structures, policies and procedures were also recommended to the board to improve the company&rsquo;s operations.  Pobal provided supports and feedback subsequently to staff to assist in meeting these conditions, including the offer of training.</p>  <p>  Regrettably, there has been no noticeable improvement in the level of outputs achieved.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To allow the individual to maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. </p>  <p>  To qualify for a state pension (contributory) a person must:</p>  <p>  - have at least 520 paid contributions, and</p>  <p>  - satisfy a yearly average condition (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is required for a full rate State pension (contributory), and reduced rates of payment may be payable for pensioners with lower averages).</p>  <p>  There are no legislative provisions which are in place, or which are proposed, to change these rules before 2020.</p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will more closely reflect the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical components to be put in place prior to its implementation.  There has been no decision on the number of contributions that will be required for a contributory pension under such a system.  Any changes proposed will be subject to substantial discussion and consultation.  </p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances. </p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied. This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.  The scheme does not involve the award of credits.</p>  <p>  The 2007 Green Paper on Pensions estimated an annual cost of backdating the Home-maker's scheme, at that time, as &euro;150 million (if to 1973) or &euro;160 million (if to 1953).  However it described those estimates as &ldquo;extremely tentative&rdquo; due to a number of factors, e.g., the fact that the cost would include, not just people resident in the State, but also many others resident in other countries, such as the UK.  Backdating the scheme now, for existing pensioners, could be expected to be significantly more expensive because (a) there are some 50% more contributory State pensioners now than there were in 2007, (b) the rate of the pension has increased since 2007 by 11%, and (c) the current cohort of people reaching pension includes more women who have had a significant level of insurable employment and would therefore be in a position to benefit from the home-maker's scheme.  The cost would also be expected to increase each year in the coming years. </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the distributive nature of the Fund.  For example, those with a yearly average of only 20 contributions (38% of the maximum) may qualify for 85% of the maximum rate.  The Review also examined the changes in the contribution rules and the associated rates of payment which were to be introduced in September 2012.  The Review found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories still obtain the best value from their contributions. </p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives may not qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical components to be addressed prior its implementation.  The position of women who were home-makers will be considered very carefully in developing this reform.</p></reply>

To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. </p>  <p>  There are a number of conditions which must be met in order to qualify for a State (contributory) pension.  One of these is that a minimum number of reckonable contributions have been paid by the claimant since entering insurable employment, before they reached pension age.  Previously the number of paid reckonable contributions required was 260.  However, Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997 increased this to 520 contributions, with effect from April 2012, and this has applied to new claimants from that date.  Another condition is that a person should start paying social insurance before age 56.</p>  <p>I understand that, according to the records of my Department, the person concerned first became liable for PRSI in 2006, shortly before her 61st birthday, approximately 5 years (or some 266 weeks) before she reached State pension (contributory) age of 66 in February 2011.  I understand that officials in my Department have disallowed claims from her to State pension (contributory) on three occasions since then.  On the first occasion (10 January 2011), her disallowance was on the basis that there was PRSI outstanding.  It is not possible for claims to be processed and put into payment in such circumstances.  Her second disallowance issued on 22 February 2011.  This decision stated that she did not enter insurance before 56 years of age, and she did not have 260 paid contributions.  Her third disallowance, on 23 May 2011, re-stated that she did not enter insurance before 56 years of age (I understand additional contributions had been awarded since her second disallowance). </p>  <p>  The conditions for entitlement to social protection benefits are not fixed, and legislation may be passed by the Oireachtas to vary the basis upon which someone may qualify for such a pension.  This applies to all such benefits.  My Department does not, therefore, contact people entering insurable employment or self-employment, to advise them of their future entitlement (or non-entitlement) to a pension or any other social protection payment, as to do so may create expectations which might not apply.  Nor is it the case that, where a person has an outstanding PRSI liability, that they are offered comprehensive advice as to what benefits they may attract if they pay the money owed.  The position, generally, with PRSI is that it must be paid as set out in legislation, regardless of whether it will result in a benefit or not.</p>  <p>  The existing conditions for State pension (contributory) are, however, widely disseminated, not just by my Department through leaflets and on its website, but also by the national network of Citizens Information Centres.  Self-employed contributors may also be advised of the current position by their accountants, if they are financially planning for their retirement.</p>  <p>  The home-maker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  However, this scheme does not involve the award of paid or credited contributions, and if a person does not satisfy the general conditions to qualify for a pension, such as the age of entry into social insurance, this scheme will not assist in meeting that qualification.</p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.

I did, however introduce an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% for 2014 and 2015. I did this to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative. I confirmed in my Budget 2015 speech that the additional 0.15% levy would expire at the end of last year and this has now happened. As both levies have ceased no more payments will be due in respect of them. </p>  <p>  The chargeable persons for the pension fund levies are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. The payment of the levies is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levies. </p>  <p>  It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levies should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.  While the final levy expired at the end of 2015 the manner in which the trustees choose to pass them on may entail a longer term but lesser reduction in pension payments to retired members than would have been the case if the reductions were made over the temporary period when the levies applied. This could potentially take the form of a lifetime reduction. I do not have specific information in relation to the decisions of individual trustees regarding the passing on of the levy. However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, in no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levies. </p></reply>

The emphasis in the legislation is on the registration status of the vehicle and the question of ownership is not material.  I am satisfied that the levying of the tax is compatible with the provisions of the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>  <p>  In the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruling referred to, Staatssecretaris van Financi&euml;n v L. A. C. van Putten (C-578/10), P. Mook (C-579/10) and G. Frank (C-580/10), the CJEU examined a situation where a tax was levied by a Member State on a loaned foreign-registered vehicle upon its first use of that Member States road network.</p>  <p>  Irish legislation provides that a person has 7 days to make an appointment for registration and 30 days before the vehicle must be presented for registration. This gives the user a 30-day period within which an unregistered vehicle can be in use in the State. The CJEU case referred to addresses a situation where a person is required to pay the tax on first use of the vehicle on a national road network, a provision that exists in some Member States, such as the Member State in question in that case. </p>  <p>  In contrast, the Irish system is significantly different from the first use principle considered in the case and the 30-day period provides a person with a generous amount of flexibility within which to use a vehicle before registering it or removing it from the State.  The CJEU case was referred to Ireland by the European Commission in June 2013 requesting that Ireland consider the ruling.  Ireland responded, raising the points set out above, and the Commission accepted Ireland's position on the issue raised.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to introduce an exemption from VRT for vehicles on loan from other Member States.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-01-26a.229.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016012600057#WRE00300"><p>Under the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), Ireland is obliged to be at or make rapid progress towards its Medium Term Objective (MTO) of a balanced budget in structural terms.  This obligation also stems from the Fiscal Compact, to which Ireland acceded following the referendum in 2012, and has also been enshrined in domestic legislation through the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012. </p><p>As Ireland is not yet at its MTO, it must improve its structural balance by more than 0.5% of GDP per annum until the MTO is reached.  In the Country Specific Recommendations (CSRs) adopted by the Council on 14<sup>th</sup>July 2015 an improvement of 0.6% was stipulated for 2016.</p><p>The required adjustment for 2017 will be set in the CSRs to be adopted by the Council next July on the basis of a European Commission recommendation.  The Commission has clarified over the last year the basis on which it will make its recommendation for an appropriate improvement in the structural balance for each Member State.  Its analysis takes account of the debt-to-GDP ratio, the size and sign of the output gap and whether the economy is growing faster than potential.  The matrix describing the required structural adjustment based on these criteria has been published by the Commission and is outlined below.  The rationale for the differentiated approach is to better align the required fiscal adjustment with the prevailing economic environment.</p><p><b>Matrix for specifying the annual fiscal adjustment towards the Medium-Term Objective (MTO)</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th></th><th>Required annual fiscal adjustment*</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>% GDP </td><td>Condition</td><td>Debt below 60 and no sustainability risk</td><td>Debt above 60 or sustainability risk</td></tr><tr><td>Exceptionally bad times</td><td>Real growth &amp;lt; 0 or output gap &amp;lt; -4</td><td>No adjustment needed</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Very bad times</td><td>-4 output gap &amp;lt; -3</td><td>0</td><td>0.25</td></tr><tr><td>Bad times</td><td>-3 output gap &amp;lt; -1.5</td><td>0 if growth below potential, 0.25 if growth above potential</td><td>0.25 if growth below potential, 0.5 if growth above potential</td></tr><tr><td>Normal times</td><td>-1.5 output gap &amp;lt; 1.5</td><td>0.5</td><td>&amp;gt; 0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Good times</td><td>output gap 1.5</td><td>&amp;gt; 0.5 if growth below potential, 0.75 if growth above potential</td><td>0.75 if growth below potential, 1 if  growth above potential</td></tr></table></p><p>Accordingly the minimum level of the required improvement in the structural balance is set for each Member State in the CSRs addressed to them by the Commission and Council in accordance with the above matrix of requirements.  So a 0.6% of GDP annual improvement would only be appropriate if Ireland's output gap falls into 'Normal times' in the above table.  However, this may not be the case in any given year.  The Deputy should also note that the structural balance does not have to be improved each year once the MTO has been achieved.</p><p>The fiscal space, as set out in Tables A8 and A9 of the Budget 2016 book, is calculated using the expenditure benchmark as this is a better guide for fiscal planning purposes in Ireland.  The walk from gross to net fiscal space, which is set out in Table A9, takes account of planned expenditure on demographics, the Public Capital Plan and the Lansdowne Road Agreement as well as the possibility of not indexing the taxation system, which would count as a discretionary revenue measure if the Government of the day so decided.</p><p>The calculation of fiscal space is only affected by the structural balance in two circumstances.  The first is if compliance with the expenditure benchmark does not also result in the required annual improvement in the structural balance, as discussed above.  If this is the case, then use of the available fiscal space under the expenditure benchmark may have to be adjusted.  However, over-achievement of the annual improvement in the structural balance does not change the amount of fiscal space available under the expenditure benchmark.</p><p>The second circumstance is that in the year following the achievement of the MTO, the convergence margin used in the calculation of fiscal space under the expenditure benchmark ceases to apply.  A document outlining the 'Forthcoming Revisions to the Medium Term Budgetary Objective' was published on my Department's website on the 21<sup>st</sup>January 2016.  This explains that the European Commission is currently updating the minimum Medium-Term Objectives (MTOs) of Member States in line with the three-year evaluation cycle.  Due to the improvement in Ireland's debt ratio and other factors, it is likely that the MTO for Ireland (covering the 2017-2019 budgetary cycles) might be slightly less stringent than is currently the case.  Staff in my Department estimate that, following technical discussions on the matter, a structural deficit of approximately -0.5 per cent of GDP rather than the current target of 0.0 per cent will need to be attained.  Should the MTO be readjusted to such a level, thus making it more likely that the MTO will be achieved earlier than currently projected, there would be additional fiscal space in the year after the MTO is achieved.  The resulting increase in fiscal space is estimated to be in the region of &euro;1 to &euro;1.5 billion.</p><p>New fiscal space projections which will take account of updated assumptions, as well as any update to the MTO, will be in the <i>Stability Programme Update 2016</i>which will published in April 2016. </p></reply>

However as explained in parliamentary question 208 of the 17th of November 2015 these amounts are not final and are underpinned by a number of assumptions which are likely to change over time</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that since the publication of this document, the end-2015 Exchequer position has been published and there have been some developments concerning ongoing discussions with the European Commission regarding the States obligations in relation to attaining fiscal targets.</p>  <p>  While the end-December 2015 Exchequer returns show that 2015 tax revenue was &euro;3.3 billion ahead of expectations, there will be no consequent impact on the fiscal space available since it was generated by overall economic growth and buoyancy rather than through additional income generated via discretionary measures.  Exchequer spending, which is the largest component of expenditure, was in line with Budget day projections and will have little impact on the availability of fiscal space.  </p>  <p>  A document outlining the 'Forthcoming Revisions to the Medium Term Budgetary Objective' was published on my Department's website on the 21st January 2016.  This explains that the European Commission is currently updating the minimum Medium-Term Objectives (MTOs) of Member States in line with the three-year evaluation cycle. Due to the improvement in Ireland's debt ratio and other factors, it is likely that the MTO for Ireland (covering the 2017-2019 budgetary cycles) might be slightly less stringent than is currently the case.  Staff in my Department estimate that, following technical discussions on the matter, a structural deficit of approximately -0.5 per cent of GDP rather than the current target of 0.0 per cent will need to be attained.  Should the MTO be readjusted to such a level, thus making it more likely that the MTO will be achieved earlier than currently projected, there would be additional fiscal space in the year after the MTO is achieved.  The resulting increase in fiscal space is estimated to be in the region of &euro;1-&euro;1.5 billion.</p>  <p>  New fiscal space projections which will take account of updated assumptions, as well as any update to the MTO, will be included in the Stability Programme Update 2016 which will published in April 2016. </p></reply>

In addition a rebate of &euro;5 million was agreed with KPMG following  discussions at the request of the Minister.</p><p>KPMG rates are based on NAMA rate cards for the relevant services.

The Special Liquidators can confirm that the rates per the NAMA rate cards are reduced hourly rates or fixed costs for specific pieces of work.  The Special Liquidators can also confirm that they have successfully negotiated fee rebates from many of the legal firms.  The Special Liquidators cannot disclose information on the particular rates being charged as this is confidential to each of the legal firms. </p><p>While it is too early at this stage to advise on the likely timeframe for conclusion of the liquidation of IBRC, I can confirm that the liquidation of IBRC can only be concluded once all assets are realised, all creditor claims have been resolved (including those subject to litigation) and all surplus funds have been distributed to creditors.

Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.  The current central rates, of 0.18% on values up to &euro;1 million, where LPT applies at the midpoint of a valuation band, and 0.25% on any portion of the value over &euro;1 million, where no banding applies, are significantly lower than the rates of property tax in most other countries.</p>  <p>  There is no relief or adjustment to the charge to LPT based on the number of occupants in a property.  As a matter of Government policy, and in order to keep the rate of the tax low, the Government agreed that reliefs should be targeted at owner occupiers where there is inability to pay the tax.</p>  <p>  The system of deferrals provided for in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) is more targeted at cases of need than a relief based on single occupancy of the property.  A deferral is a relief in that it enables persons who are not currently in a position to pay the tax to postpone payment until such time as their circumstances change, or until the property is sold or transferred.  There is particular provision for deferral of LPT for income stressed households who are meeting high levels of mortgage interest.  This applies to single occupancy households as well as those with multiple occupants.  </p></reply>

Irrespective of the number of members involved, a scheme will also be regarded as small at any time when 65% or more of the value of the investments of the scheme relate to the provision of benefits for "20% directors" of the sponsoring employer(s) and their spouses, civil partners and dependants.  A "20% director" is someone who, directly or indirectly, at any time in the preceding 3 years owned or controlled more than 20% of the voting rights in the employer company or in the parent company of the employer company.</p>  <p>  In order for the SSAPS to be an exempt approved scheme it must appoint a Revenue approved Pensioner Trustee who has to give certain undertakings to Revenue in the prescribed form.  These include a commitment not to consent to any action which is contrary to Revenue regulations; to supply annual accounts, periodic actuarial reports and any other information required by Revenue; and not agree to the termination of any scheme of which they are a Pensioner Trustee otherwise than in accordance with the terms of the approved winding up provisions.</p>  <p>  In relation to the investment in property by a SSAPS, once the proposals meet certain conditions imposed by Revenue an investment of this nature is allowed.  The Pensioner Trustees are fully aware of the conditions and these include the following:</p>  <p>  - The vendor is at arm's length from the scheme and the employer including its directors and associated companies</p>  <p>  - The purpose of the acquisition is not for disposal or letting to the employer, including its directors and associated companies</p>  <p>  - Disposal of the property is on an arm's length basis</p>  <p>  - The scheme has sufficient liquid investments to ensure that the requirement to provide benefits, including ill-health and early retirement benefits can be met</p>  <p>  - Purchase of overseas property will only be permitted where there are appropriate arrangements in place to enable the Pensioner Trustee to maintain control of the asset to ensure that Revenue rules are complied with</p>  <p>  - A transaction which involves the scheme trustees directly in the acquisition and development of property with a view to its disposal will mean this investment will not constitute an investment exempt from taxation granted under the provisions of section 774 (2), Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  In addition to these rules, there are also rules regarding self investment, which is the investment by the scheme in its sponsoring employer.  In the case of a SSAPS the acquisition of property or other fixed assets from an employer is not allowed.  Revenue does not hold specific information as to how many of these SSAPS have invested in property, however, once the conditions outlined above have been fulfilled the SSAPS can invest in commercial property. To date there are a total of 13,758 approved Small Self Administered Pension Schemes in existence. </p></reply>

I did, however introduce an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% for 2014 and 2015.  I did this to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative.  I confirmed in my Budget 2015 speech that the additional 0.15% levy would expire at the end of last year and this has now happened.  As both levies have ceased no more payments will be due in respect of them. </p>  <p>  The details supplied include correspondence outlining the assertion that the reduction made to an individual's pension cannot be reversed.  The chargeable persons for the pension fund levies are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. The payment of the levies is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levies.</p>  <p>  It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levies should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.  While the final levy expired at the end of 2015 the manner in which the trustees choose to pass it on may entail a longer term but lesser reduction in pension payments to retired members than would have been the case if the reductions were made over the temporary period when the levies applied.  However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, in no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levies.</p></reply>

It remains a key part of the overall set of public service pay and pension retrenchment measures legislated over the period 2009 to 2013 in response to the fiscal crisis under the FEMPI Acts.</p>  <p>  I am required by legislation to review the FEMPI measures annually. My most recent such review, which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 29 June 2015, concluded that because of the economic and fiscal improvement of recent years, this Government was in a position to, and intended to, ameliorate some of the FEMPI measures. The amelioration of the FEMPI measures was negotiated and agreed by public service employers with the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions representing public servants, under the terms of the Lansdowne Road Agreement. These ameliorative measures are provided for in the FEMPI Act of 2015.</p>  <p>  With regard to PRD, the FEMPI 2015 changes are delivering significant income increases to all affected public servants by way of increase of the PRD exemption threshold, to &euro;26,083 from 1 January 2016 and again to &euro;28,750 from 1 January 2017. This two-stage part-restoration will remove some lower-paid public servants from the impact of PRD entirely, while meaning that those who continue to be impacted by PRD will receive an effective annual pay boost of &euro;733 in 2016, rising to &euro;1,000  from 2017, by comparison with the pre-FEMPI 2015 Act position. In addition to the PRD changes, public servants on annual salaries up to &euro;24,000 received a pay increase of 2.5% on 1 January 2016, while those on annual salaries from &euro;24,001 to &euro;31,000 received a pay increase of 1% on the same date. On 1 September 2017 all annual salaries up to &euro;65,000 will be increased by &euro;1,000.</p>  <p>  Economic and fiscal progress in the years ahead will determine the scope and timing for further changes to the financial emergency measures, including the PRD.</p></reply>

In that regard, a Public Consultation Day was held in Banna Beach Resort on 1 October 2015.  Following finalisation of the mapping and the identification of feasible flood risk management options, the outputs from this important Study will be published as part of an integrated Flood Risk Management Plan.  Further information is available on the Study website .</p><p>Investigation of flooding, in the first instance, is a matter for each local authority to investigate and address. Kerry County Council may carry out flood mitigation works using its own resources.  The Council may also apply to the Office of Public Works (OPW) for funding of flood mitigation works under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor works to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects that are estimated to cost no more than &euro;500,000.

It is very important to Ireland as it will build on our already rewarding economic relationship with the US and create new opportunities to stimulate growth, create employment and continue to grow our economy.     An independent study commissioned by my Department, carried out by Copenhagen Economics, found that almost half (49%) of Irish exports outside of the EU end up in the US, compared to the combined average of 16% for all Member States, and 25% of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Ireland comes from the US.  </p>  <p>  Owing to our position as a small open economy, Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises are particularly well placed to take up opportunities to trade more easily with the US.  The key findings of the Copenhagen Economics study, published on the 27th   March 2015, are very positive for Ireland.  The study estimates that the benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole.  </p>  <p>  It suggests a boost to GDP of 1.1%, growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5%, and an increase in real wages of 1.5%.  It estimates a jobs gain of somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs.  The study predicts new opportunities for many Irish industry sectors including pharmaceuticals and chemicals, Agri-food (notably dairy and processed food), insurance and machinery.</p>  <p>  This means that every day an EU-US free trade agreement is not signed costs the State the possible benefits and advantages of an agreed deal.</p>  <p>  The EU-US trade negotiations herald the start of a new style of trade agreement that not only covers tariffs, trade and investment but also includes regulatory coherence and cooperation, setting global standards, for half the world&rsquo;s GDP and one-third of the world&rsquo;s trade.  An EU-US trade agreement will tackle a whole range of issues to make business with the US easier.  It will remove customs duties, end limitations in access to public contracts, open-up services' market, offer predictable conditions for investors and will also contain guarantees to ensure that economic gains do not come at the expense of democracy, the environment or consumers' health and safety.  </p>  <p>  The EU-US Free Trade Agreement will open up further opportunities in the US market for Irish companies in particular SME&rsquo;s.  I will continue to seek an agreement that is both comprehensive and balanced and that will deliver real trade and economic potential for our country, bearing in mind our defensive interests, in sensitive areas such as the beef sector, and offensive interests to open opportunities, in areas such as our important dairy industry.  </p>  <p>  In assessing the potential cost to the Exchequer of any implementation of a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership Agreement it should be noted that customs duties are assessed and collected by Member States on behalf of the EU and are remitted directly to the EU.  </p></reply>

The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is the national statutory body with responsibility for ensuring that approximately 1.8 million workers (employed and self-employed) and those affected by work activity are protected from work related injury and ill-health.The HSA does this by enforcing occupational health and safety law, promoting accident prevention, and providing information and advice across all sectors, including retail, healthcare, manufacturing, fishing, entertainment, mining, construction, agriculture and food services. For example in relation to manual handling, the HSA developed a manual handling training system, which includes a Level 6 Manual Handling Instruction and People Handling Instruction Awards managed by Quality and Qualifications in Ireland (QQI).</p><p>The HSA&rsquo;s BeSmart () is a free, easy to use, online tool to assist small businesses in generating their own risk assessments and safety statements as required under health and safety legislation. The use of BeSMART can significantly reduce the administrative burden on businesses by:</p><p>- Reducing the amount of time employers spend preparing their risk assessments and safety statements;</p><p>- Reducing the dependence of many small businesses on costly external assistance for the production of safety documents;</p><p>- Eliminating the perception many employers have that they are not competent to develop their own safety documentation; and</p><p>- Increasing small business compliance levels as owners take more responsibility for day to day safety management.</p><p>In addition to the BeSMART programme the HSA has produced an on-line training management system () to reduce the cost of safety and health training to business, this has created further reductions in costs and improved competitiveness. </p><p>In addition there are Agencies under the remit of my Department who develop indigenous Irish businesses: Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs). Enterprise Ireland is responsible for the development and growth of Irish enterprises in world markets.

If the consumer had the right to reject the goods and repudiate the contract under the provisions of sections 12 to 15 of the Sale of Goods Act 1893 on the quality and other conditions with which goods must comply, he or she is entitled to a refund of the price rather than to reimbursement in the form of a credit note or store gift voucher.  Section 11 of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 makes it an offence for a business seller to display or publish a statement that money will not be refunded or that only credit notes will be given unless the statement is so clearly qualified that it cannot be construed as applicable in circumstances in which the buyer is exercising a right conferred by sections 12 to 15 of the 1893 Act.     </p>  <p>  If, however, the goods were returned under a goodwill or no-quibble returns policy operated by the retailer, the right to a cash refund would not apply and the retailer would be entitled to offer reimbursement in the form of a credit note or gift voucher.</p>  <p>  The draft Scheme of a Consumer Rights Bill issued for public consultation by my Department in May 2015 includes a provision on refunds which states, among other things, that if the consumer paid money under the contract, the trader must, unless the consumer expressly agrees otherwise, give a refund using the same means of payment as the consumer used. While this is in accordance with existing law, it is a clearer, more accessible statement of the right of consumers, and the obligation on businesses, in respect of this aspect of the provision of refunds.   </p></reply>

In 2015 exports recorded double digit growth to reach an estimated &euro;410 million in value. In volume terms exports are likely to rise from 7 million cases in 2014 to 12 million cases by 2020 and 24 million cases by 2030. </p>  <p>  In order to meet the international demand for Irish Whiskey there has been significant investment since 2011 both in expansion of existing facilities and development of new distilleries. The number of distilleries has increased from four to twelve and further projects are at planning stage. As whiskey must, in accordance with EU and national law, be matured in wood for a minimum of three years, release of additional capacity on to the market will take time and the product of distillation in 2016 and 2017 will come on the market close to 2020.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the recent report by Dr. Pat Massey on the Irish Whiskey sector and the recommendation regarding the development of a wholesale whiskey market, which would allow for the development of Irish Whiskey brands by businesses which do not themselves have distilling capacity. Indeed this was also a recommendation in the Vision for Irish Whiskey published by IBEC and presented to the High Level Implementation Committee for Food Harvest 2020, which I chaired. I accept that there would be merit in the establishment of such a market. I would encourage distillers to consider such a development over time, particularly where it would help to meet the development goals for the sector set out in FoodWise 2025. However I do not have the power to compel Irish distilling companies to set aside a portion of their production for a wholesale market.   </p>  <p>  Irish whiskey is a recognised EU Geographical Indication and my Department has promoted its inclusion in international bilateral agreements between the European Union and third countries. Bord Bia has actively promoted and supported companies, including new entrants to the sector, with market and consumer insight, branding, international trade shows, Marketplace and routes to market. Enterprise Ireland has funded 5 new entrants in the whiskey sector, not all of which are operational just yet. Enterprise Ireland continues to liaise with its client companies in the sector regarding any support that it can offer within its remit to assist the companies to develop their businesses and create employment in the sector. </p>  <p>  I am heartened by the developments in the Irish Whiskey sector since I became Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in 2011 and I with my Department will continue to do all we can to ensure that the world wide demand for Irish Whiskey is met to the fullest extent possible to the benefit of the industry and the Irish economy generally. </p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the flagship project under the 2015 Fishery Harbour Capital Development Programme run by my Department was the &euro;6.3m dredging project at Dunmore East. </p><p>On the 11 January this year I announced funding of &euro;1.16 million for the ongoing maintenance and development of Dunmore East Fishery Harbour Centre during 2016. Significant works in this year&rsquo;s capital programme include the West wharf upgrade, Harbour Office Upgrade and Harbour Road re-surfacing. </p><p>Also included in this year&rsquo;s programme is a &euro;160,000 project to design a breakwater in Dunmore East. It is envisaged that a new breakwater would protect the existing harbour, and provide a safer haven for fishing and leisure vessels alike. During the coming months, it is envisaged that consultants will be working on various design options and breakwater layouts. When a few designs are developed substantially, the proposal would be to undertake a consultation process with local interests and statutory bodies to finalize a potential suitable layout.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres, including a possible breakwater project, or the provision of pontoons and a marina inside of a completed breakwater at Dunmore East Fishery Harbour Centre will be considered under future Capital Programmes on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing priorities. </p><p>The question of parking facilities at Dunmore East Fishery Harbour Centre will be considered in light of a report, due shortly, into overall traffic management measures in the harbour which was commissioned in 2015. </p><p>The upkeep and maintenance of leased properties within the Harbour are the responsibility of the tenant. There can be properties within the Fishery Harbour Centres which may appear vacant, however, some such properties can technically/legally be occupied and therefore are not in a position to be considered for tender. Progress is being made to regularise all these property arrangements.</p></reply>

The changes in administrative staffing levels in this office will not negatively impact upon local access and services for local customers.  Department veterinary inspectors, technical officers and a small number of administrative staff will remain in place, frontline services will be fully maintained and public access for all of the Departments stakeholders will continue to be available.</p></reply>

HSI has received an approval from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for this purpose. Commission Decision 92/353, which lays down the criteria for approval for bodies to maintain a studbook, requires the authorities of a Member State, i.e. the Department, to grant official approval or recognition to any organisation or association which maintains or establishes a stud-book, provided it meets the conditions laid down in the Annex of this Decision. In this Annex, legislation places the onus on a breeding body to develop and formulate a breeding policy for the breed. In relation to Irish Draught and Irish Sport Horse breeds, the breeding policy is devised by a Sub Board of the HSI which deals specifically with breeding and related matters.  Stallion and mare inspections are normally part of HSI&rsquo;s Breeding Policy but for 2016 the Breeding Sub Board has decided to conduct a fundamental review of this process for the Irish Sport Horse and Irish Draught Studbooks. Pending this review, the Sub Board decided to suspend the normal spring stallion and mare inspections. </p>  <p>  Horse Sport Ireland invited submissions in relation to the review, with a closing date of January 11, 2016 and it is expected that the review will be completed by the end of February.   </p>  <p>  I am aware of the concern among certain stakeholders in relation to the decision to temporarily suspend inspections, and in that regard my Department has received assurances that the review of the inspection regime will be expedited. </p></reply>

In this regard I am aware of the difficulties that have been created for many forest owners as a result of the storms of late 2013 early 2014.  The frequency and ferocity of these storm events, compounded by waterlogged soils on many forest sites, led to extensive damage on both private and State owned forest lands.  While estimates indicate that less than 1% of the national forest area (approximately 8,000 hectares) has been blown down, the damage has been extensive at a local level, especially in the south and parts of the midlands where substantial quantities of timber have been blown down. </p>  <p>Financial support for a replanting grant for privately owned forests affected by the winter storms of 2013/2014 only is currently being considered by the Department.  A final decision on this matter can be expected shortly.</p></reply>

The aim of this initiative was to create 250 cross sectoral jobs in the Killybegs area by 2014.  Seafood processing was just one of the areas identified as having the potential to create additional employment.</p><p>To drive forward the initiative, I established a High Level Group on Job Creation in the Killybegs Region and requested that the Group identify the potential actions required to deliver job creation in the following five key areas, that is; promoting seafood value added activity; enhancing ancillary services; developing offshore supports; promoting tourism and marine leisure; and promoting the green economy and renewable energy.</p><p>The High Level Group comprised representatives of the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation (who chaired the Group), Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Donegal County Council, Letterkenny Institute of Technology, Enterprise Ireland, local industry and from my Department.  BIM provided secretariat services to assist the chair.  The High Level Group finished its work in 2011 and had its last meeting in November 2012.  Its Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: </p><p>Since 2012, a local implementation group reporting to Donegal County Council has taken on responsibility for driving forward the initiative. Donegal County Council may assist the Deputies with any requests for information on the Local Implementation Group and its activities.  My Department does not attend meetings of that Group.  In relation to jobs created, I am informed by Bord Iascaigh Mhara that during the period 2010 to 2014, seafood processing companies in the Killybegs region invested &euro;16.5 million with state supports of &euro;3.56 million.  During that time, the companies created 89 net new jobs and estimated additional revenue of &euro;84.4 million.  These companies are forecast to generate an additional 23 jobs by the end of 2017.</p></reply>

This ambitious action plan for forestry covers 11 different measures and has a budget allocation of &euro;482m to be spent over six years.    </p>  <p>  The aim of the new programme is to plant almost 44,000ha of new forest over the period 2015-2020. In order to achieve this target the afforestation scheme was restructured to encourage more landowners to convert land from agriculture use to forestry. First of all, the grant rate for establishing forests was increased by 5% across all planting categories; this means that the entire cost of establishment is covered by the grant. Secondly, the annual premium rate was increased by 20% across the board and non-farmers are now entitled to the same premium rate as farmers. These premiums are paid at the same rate each year for 15 years. Up until now non-farmers received a fraction of the rate paid to farmers.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, new planting categories have been introduced to provide additional options to landowners who may not otherwise have been interested in planting their land. The new Agro Forestry and Forestry for Fibre measures are targeted specifically at farmers, providing them with options for grazing livestock alongside forestry and, in the case of Forestry for Fibre, the option to harvest timber after 10-15 years rather than 35-40 years as is the case with other types of forestry. These are significant developments as the measures present real options for farmers for alternative income sources.   </p>  <p>  Separately, the Government introduced a new taxation provision in Budget 2016 which makes the income from forestry clear-felling free from income tax. </p>  <p>  Increasing the planting target in itself will not deliver higher afforestation levels. The key to achieving this ambition is to create the conditions for landowners where the decision to plant is a good option for the landowner. In this regard data concerning planting levels for a single year is not enough information on which to make changes to the scheme. A comprehensive review of the scheme will however take place as part of a midterm review of the entire Forestry Programme; this review will take place in 2017.</p></reply>

Farms in western counties and those located in the catchment areas of larger rivers including the Shannon were most significantly affected. The main issues affecting farmers are loss of fodder, damage to sheds/milking parlours and additional challenges in managing livestock during the flooding.    </p>  <p>  My Department is urgently addressing these problems through a range of actions. </p>  <p>  The most serious consequence of the flooding for farmers was the immediate risk posed to the safety and welfare of livestock. The Animal Welfare Helpline operated throughout the period of the floods, including on Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Arising from farm visits by Teagasc and Department personnel, as well as requests to the animal welfare Help Line, emergency arrangements were put in place to provide feed under Department Emergency Feed Provision Arrangements to the worst affected farms. More than 380 tons of concentrate feed has now been provided to 141 farmers, avoiding welfare issues arising. </p>  <p>  Department staff continue to monitor the situation at farm level. Where the welfare of animals was threatened, it has been possible to relax some rules around the temporary movement of livestock in some situations. In the case of some very badly affected holdings guidance was issued to allow for the removal of flood water from overfull slurry tanks.   </p>  <p>  In addition to these emergency provisions funding has been provided by the Government for a new Fodder Aid scheme for farmers who have suffered fodder losses as a result of this flooding. </p>  <p>  Support under this scheme will apply to the loss of silage, hay, straw and concentrates where there is evidence of damage caused by flooding during the months of December 2015 and January 2016. Assistance under this scheme is subject to the de Minimis provisions of EU state aid rules. In order to ensure swift payments under the scheme, the closing date for applications was Friday 22 January, by which date over 330 applications had been received. On-farm verification will take place in the coming week allowing prompt payment to follow. </p>  <p>  A further measure will be launched shortly to cover a very small number of farmers who have experienced extreme hardship, including through the loss of livestock.  Any such measure must comply with European Commission State Aid rules.</p></reply>

The aim of this initiative was to create 250 cross sectorial jobs in the Killybegs area by 2014. Seafood processing was just one of the areas identified as having the potential to create additional employment.  To drive forward the initiative, I established a High Level Group on Job Creation in the Killybegs Region and requested that the Group identify the potential actions required to deliver job creation in the following five key areas, that is; promoting seafood value added activity; enhancing ancillary services; developing offshore supports; promoting tourism and marine leisure; and promoting the green economy and renewable energy.  </p><p>The High Level Group comprised representatives of the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation (who chaired the Group), Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Donegal County Council, Letterkenny Institute of Technology, Enterprise Ireland, local industry and from my Department. BIM provided secretariat services to assist the chair.  The High Level Group finished its work in 2011 and had its last meeting in November 2012. Its Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:<i></i><i></i></p><p>Since 2012, a local implementation group reporting to Donegal County Council has taken on responsibility for driving forward the initiative. Donegal County Council may assist the Deputies with any requests for information on the Local Implementation Group and its activities. My Department does not attend meetings of that Group.  In relation to jobs created, I am informed by Bord Iascaigh Mhara that during the period 2010 to 2014, seafood processing companies in the Killybegs region invested &euro;16.5 million <font color="#FF0000"> </font>with state supports of &euro;3.56 million. During that time, the companies created 89 net new jobs and estimated additional revenue of &euro;84.4 million.

The frequency and ferocity of these storm events, compounded by waterlogged soils on many forest sites, led to extensive damage on both private and State owned forest lands. While estimates indicate that less than 1% of the national forest area (approximately 8,000 hectares) has been blown down, the damage has been extensive at a local level, especially in the south and parts of the midlands where substantial quantities of timber have been blown down.</p>  <p>  Financial support for a replanting grant for privately owned forests affected by the winter storms of 2013/2014 only is currently being considered by the Department.  A final decision on this matter can be expected shortly.   </p></reply>

The frequency and ferocity of these storm events, compounded by waterlogged soils on many forest sites, led to extensive damage on both private and State owned forest lands. While estimates indicate that less than 1% of the national forest area (approximately 8,000 hectares) has been blown down, the damage has been extensive at a local level, especially in the south and parts of the midlands where substantial quantities of timber have been blown down.</p>  <p>  Financial support for a replanting grant for privately owned forests affected by the winter storms of 2013/2014 only is currently being considered by the Department. A final decision on this matter can be expected shortly.   </p></reply>

The aim of this new programme is to plant almost 44,000ha of new forests over the period 2015-2020.  The scheme itself has undergone significant changes from the scheme which operated under the previous programme.  These changes which include for example an increase in the annual premium rate by 20% across the board are designed to encourage more landowners to convert their land from agriculture to forestry.  In terms of setting afforestation targets by county my Department has avoided doing this as the scheme is demand led and therefore it would be difficult to determine future planting levels at county level. </p></reply>

It is planned that the new arrangements for non-EEA workers in the Irish fishing industry will be operational very shortly. </p><p>The Task Force recognises the importance of employment in the fishing industry to Ireland&rsquo;s coastal communities. Therefore, in recommending that the number of Atypical Worker Permissions under the new Scheme, which applies to non officers, be capped at 500, the Task Force was cognisant that any mechanism designed to assist with the employment of non-EEA workers should not impact unduly on the employment of local populations in coastal communities. The Task Force based the cap on employment data from the Marine Survey Office and BIM and took account of the longstanding sea-fishing boat licence condition that at least 50% of the crew on Irish fishing vessels are EU nationals. </p><p>BIM is the State agency responsible for developing the Irish seafood industry. This includes providing training for workers in the fishing industry and delivering on Government targets for the creation of sustainable jobs including the Action Plan for Jobs coordinated by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. BIM delivers a range of courses, such as safety skills and navigation and the training required to qualify as a skipper or second hand of a commercial fishing vessel, thus allowing crew members the opportunity to progress in their careers in the fishing industry. BIM also offers support to entry level individuals who are interested in a seagoing career. </p><p>Investment in human capital is vital to the future competitiveness, economic performance, and safety of the seafood sector. The introduction of a <font color="#272627">certification system to cover crew training and qualification on board fishing vessels</font><font color="#272627">is identified as one of the actions in Food Wise 2025, the strategy for the sustainable growth of the agri-food sector over the next decade.</font></p><p><font color="#272627">  Furthermore, t</font>he Seafood Development Programme also provides for funding to support training and employment as provided for in the &lsquo;<i>Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth&rsquo; strategy, </i>which sets out a roadmap for the Government&rsquo;s vision, high-level goals and integrated actions across policy, governance and business to enable Ireland&rsquo;s marine potential to be realised.  <font color="#272627"> </font></p></reply>

The task force, which I chaired, was not intended as a comprehensive answer to all of the possible issues arising from the Guardian report, and while that report was specific to the fishing industry, efforts with regard to the wider issues across all sectors have been ongoing across a number of Departments and agencies for many years. For example, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have included human trafficking as a high priority in their Annual Policing Plan for a number of years with a focus on prevention and detection. Equally, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Health and Safety Authority have primary responsibility for inspection programmes regarding work and living conditions on board fishing vessels. </p>  <p>  Reflecting the complexities of the issues raised and the existing work ongoing concerning migrant workers across a number of sectors, the task force consisted of high level representatives from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; Justice and Equality; Transport, Tourism and Sport; Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Social Protection; the Health and Safety Authority; the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; BIM; the Naval Service and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.   </p>  <p>  The Task Force identified a specific issue in terms of non-EEA workers including those who may not currently be legally resident in the State, which required immediate action to minimise the potential for exploitation of such workers. In making its key recommendation for the introduction of an Atypical worker permission, the Task Force was of the view that the best way to ensure that abuses are minimised is to introduce specific arrangements which ensure that such workers are covered by the protections afforded to employees. T he establishment of a sector-specific Atypical Worker Permission system will provide a structured and transparent framework for the employment of non-EEA workers within defined segments of the Irish commercial sea-fishing fleet.   </p>  <p>  In making its recommendations, the task force was focussed on bringing forward practical arrangements which will enable the risks of exploitation to be minimised while ensuring that reputable employers are able to recruit trained and experienced crew members. The new scheme for migrant workers will also provide a mechanism to assist those currently in Ireland to enter a new employment relationship and these workers will be guaranteed all appropriate employment rights and protections during their period of employment. </p>  <p>  The Atypical Working Scheme is administered by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of the Department of Justice and Equality. It is planned that the new arrangements for non-EEA workers in the Irish fishing industry will be operational very shortly. </p>  <p>  Any allegations in relation to illegal activity or other wrongdoing within the fishing industry which are brought to my attention or that of my Department are sent to either the SFPA and/or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as appropriate, for investigation. Any policy and/or administrative issues arising will be dealt with as swiftly as possible as was the case with the allegations concerning migrant workers.   </p></reply>

The 2015 White Paper on Defence sets out a developmental path for the RDF.  It provides that the overarching establishment of the Army Reserve (AR) and Naval Service Reserve (NSR) is to be set at 4,169 personnel, consisting of 3,869 Army Reservists and the expansion of the establishment of the four NSR Units from currently 200 personnel to 300. A key challenge is to recruit and train sufficient personnel to meet the reserve establishment provided in the White Paper.  The Defence Forces will continue to strive to improve the level of RDF recruitment in 2016.The position with regard to the extent to which Reserve numbers have fluctuated over the past five years is outlined in Table 1 below.</p><p><b>Table 1: Reserve Defence Force Strength over the past five years</b><table><tr><th></th><th>31 Dec 2011 </th><th>31 Dec 2012 </th><th>31 Dec 2013 </th><th>31 Dec 2014 </th><th>31 Dec 2015 </th></tr><tr><td>RDF Strength </td><td>5,220 </td><td>4,978* </td><td>3,655* </td><td>2,302 </td><td>2,280 </td></tr></table><i>*Due to the reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force there is a significantly larger margin of error applicable to these figures.</i></p><p>With regard to the Permanent Defence Force, the strength figures for year-end 2015 together with the position regarding fluctuations over the past five years are set out below in Table 2.</p><p><b>Table 2: Permanent Defence Force Strength (by service) over the past five years</b><table><tr><th></th><th>31 Dec 2011 </th><th>31 Dec 2012 </th><th>31 Dec 2013 </th><th>31 Dec 2014 </th><th>31 Dec 2015 </th></tr><tr><td>Army </td><td>7,650 </td><td>7,510 </td><td>7,434 </td><td>7,457 </td><td>7,309 </td></tr><tr><td>Air Corps </td><td>791 </td><td>791 </td><td>779 </td><td>766 </td><td>748 </td></tr><tr><td>Naval Service </td><td>997 </td><td>1,058 </td><td>1,023 </td><td>1,057 </td><td>1,083 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>9,438 </td><td>9,359 </td><td>9,236 </td><td>9,280 </td><td>9,140 </td></tr></table><i>Strength figures from 2013 on are Whole Time Equivalents.</i></p><p>The Government is committed to maintaining the stabilised strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel, comprising of 7,520 Army, 886 Air Corps and 1,094 Naval Service as stated in the 2015 White Paper on Defence.</p><p>The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services.  Personnel are posted on the basis of operational needs across the organisation both at home and abroad.  As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force targeted recruitment takes place so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels.</p><p>A General Service recruitment campaign was launched on 4 August 2015.  As of 31<sup></sup>December 2015, 49 Cadets, 307 General Service Army &amp;amp; Navy recruits and 50 other personnel including apprentices, instrumentalist and doctors were inducted into the Defence Forces. Further recruitment campaigns are planned for 2016.</p><p>With the support of the Chief of Staff, I am confident that we shall retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks assigned by Government, both at home and overseas.</p></reply>

Additionally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may request specific assistance from the Defence Forces in the context of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP). The Defence Forces retains a wide range of specialist skills which can be deployed in such circumstances and are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies.</p>  <p>  Both the Ordnance Corps and the Army Ranger Wing specialise in providing an immediate response to emergency incidents that might require their highly specialised capabilities.</p>  <p>  The Ordnance Corps consists of a number of Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams which are on standby 24/7 to respond when a request for assistance is received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with suspect devices.   </p>  <p>  The Army Ranger Wing is an integral unit of the Defence Forces whose roles include provision of specialist ATCP support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The need for a high level of preparedness to deal with any requests for special forces operations is inherent in the unit&rsquo;s mission. Members are trained to the highest levels of motivation, physical fitness and skill at arms for their specialist role. The ARW is on standby to be called upon to undertake duties in any part of the country. </p>  <p>  In relation to non-security related emergencies, whilst the Defence Forces are not a Principal Response Agency as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, they provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) role.</p>  <p>  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is available for deployments in response to emergencies and natural disasters including flooding. In this regard, the Defence Forces hold a wide range of engineering and transport plant and equipment for military purposes.</p>  <p>  All such plant and equipment suitable for use in emergency situations is made available as the need arises. In relation to the Naval Service, all vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that, in addition to their fishery protection role, they also undertake general surveillance, security, pollution monitoring, and Search and Rescue in support to the Irish Coast Guard, amongst other duties while on patrol. These activities assist in detecting and preventing emergency situations throughout Ireland&rsquo;s maritime jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  The role of the Air Corps includes the provision of an emergency inter-hospital Air Ambulance service in support of the HSE. It is also supporting the HSE in an emergency aeromedical support service operating primarily in the West of Ireland. The Air Corps also has a maritime surveillance function undertaken by its maritime patrol aircraft and both it and the Naval Service provide support to the Irish Coast Guard in maritime Search and Rescue operations.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Defence Forces personnel have a modern and effective range of equipment, including telecommunications and logistical equipment, needed to fulfil all roles that are assigned to them by Government in any emergency situations that may arise.</p></reply>

Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement beneath.  The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 197 personnel and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in Syria with 139 personnel.</p><p>Following a Government Decision on 12 May 2015, the Irish Naval Vessel, L.&Eacute;. Eithne, was deployed to the Mediterranean on 16 May, 2015, to assist the Italian Authorities with the migrant crisis. Two further vessels were deployed, L.&Eacute;. Niamh and L.&Eacute;. Samuel Beckett, and the deployment was completed on 29 November 2015, with L.&Eacute;. Samuel Beckett arriving back in Ireland on 17 December 2015. The question of a further deployment to the operation in the Mediterranean in 2016 is being evaluated and will be considered in the context of the ongoing situation in the Mediterranean and the overall EU response thereto, the demands on the Defence Forces, our overseas commitments and available resources.  Subject to Government approval, it is intended to deploy a further naval vessel to the Mediterranean probably sometime in March 2016.</p><p>The Department of Defence constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas. With regard to any future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>The current contribution of some 423 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.</p><p><b><i>Members of the Permanent Defence Force Serving Overseas</i></b></p><p><b><i>As of 1 January 2016</i></b></p><blockquote><b>1.  </b><b><i>UN MISSIONS</i></b><blockquote><blockquote><b>(i)  </b><b>UNIFIL </b>(United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) HQ 9 <br /><br /><b>UNIFIL</b>51st Infantry Group 184 <br /><br /><b>UNIFIL</b>Sector West HQ 4<br /><br /><b>(ii)  </b><b>UNTSO </b>(United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation) Israel &amp;amp; Syria 13 <br /><br /><b>(iii)  </b><b>MINURSO</b>(United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara) 3 <br /><br /><b>(iv)  </b><b>MONUSCO</b>(United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic 4 <br /><br />Republic of the Congo)<br /><br /><b>(v)  </b><b>UNOCI</b>(United Nations Mission in Ivory Coast) 2 <br /><br /><b>(vi)  </b><b>UNDOF </b>(United Nations Disengagement Observer Force) HQ, 8 <br /><br />Golan Heights, Syria<br /><br /><b>UNDOF</b>50th Infantry Group 131 </blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p><b>TOTAL 358</b></p><p><b><i>UN MANDATED MISSIONS</i></b></p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><b>(vii)  </b><b>EUFOR</b>(EU-led Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina) 7 <br /><br /><b>(viii)  </b><b>EUTM Mali</b>(EU-Led Training Mission) 9 <br /><br /><b>(ix)  </b><b>KFOR</b>(International Security Presence in Kosovo ) HQ 12 <br /><br /><b>(x)  </b><b>RSM </b>(Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan) 7 </blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p><b>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING WITH UN MISSIONS 393</b></p><p><b><i>ORGANISATION FOR SECURITY AND CO-OPERATION IN EUROPE (OSCE)</i></b></p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>(i)OSCE Mission to Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina 1 <br /><br />(ii)Staff Officer, High Level Planning Group, Vienna 1 </blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p><b>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING WITH OSCE 2</b></p><blockquote><b>2.  </b><b><i>EU MILITARY STAFF</i></b><br /><br />Brussels 3<br /><br /><b>3.  </b><b><i>EU BATTLE GROUP</i></b><br /><br />German-led Battle Group 2016 - HQ, STRASBOURG 10<br /><br />UK-led Battle Group 2016, UK 5<br /><br /><b>4.  </b><b><i>MILITARY REPRESENTATIVES/ADVISERS/STAFF</i></b><blockquote><blockquote>(i)Military Adviser, Permanent Mission to UN, New York 1 <br /><br />(ii)Military Adviser, Irish Delegation to OSCE, Vienna 1 <br /><br />(iii)Military Representative to EU (Brussels) 4 <br /><br />(iv)Liaison Officer of Ireland, NATO /PfP (Brussels) 2 <br /><br />(v)EU OHQ Operation Althea, Mons, Belgium 1 <br /><br />(vi)Irish Liaison Officer to SHAPE &amp;amp; Military Co-Op Division, Mons, Belgium 1 </blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p><b>TOTAL NUMBER OF DEFENCE FORCES PERSONNEL SERVING OVERSEAS 423</b></p></reply>

The White Paper recognises that a minimum eight ship flotilla will be required.   </p>  <p>  The Army will continue to retain all-arms conventional military capabilities, and the principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas. There will be a focus on the essential force protection provided by armoured vehicles and the most cost effective option of upgrading or replacing the current fleet will be identified. A small number of armoured logistical vehicles will be procured for force protection overseas. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current provisions, together with the courses of action in the White Paper, will ensure that the Defence Forces are fully equipped to meet their assigned roles &amp;amp; taskings.</p></reply>

The new Strategy is being prepared on the basis of wide consultation with interested parties in a 3 Phase consultation process. Phases 1 and 2 involving the identification of key themes and building on those through a broad consultation process to produce high-level objectives for the years 2016-2019 have been competed. Phase 3 will commence shortly and focus on agreeing specific actions and time frames in relation to each objective. In summary, my aim is to ensure a rigorous focus on identifying the key themes that impact on the lives of people with disabilities, on identifying agreed objectives within each theme and on developing specific actions to be undertaken to achieve each of the agreed objectives, together with time frames and key performance indicators so that the new Strategy will make a real difference to the lives of people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  I welcome the positive engagement of all stake holders in the process so far including their participation in the first round of public meetings and in the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group and look forward to continuing to work with all interested parties in completing and delivering the Strategy. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in autumn 2014, I launched the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with Disabilities. The aim of this strategy was to ensure that the barriers faced by those living with a disability in finding employment could be addressed. I appointed Fergus Finlay as the independent chairperson of the strategy's implementation committee to ensure that the Government is provided with regular updates on the Strategy's progression.</p></reply>

The Act has been specifically devised to safeguard the rights of persons with capacity difficulties, including as regards their bodily integrity.</p><p>With regard to the specific matters raised by the Deputy, these are policy matters for the Department of Health who have provided me with the following responses:</p><p>&quot;On the issue of organ donation, section 4(3)(a) of the Act clarifies that any decision about the donation of organs from <i>living</i>donors who lack capacity will be determined by the High Court. Entrusting such matters to the High Court provides protection to potentially vulnerable people who are not in a position to make the decision about living organ donation for themselves.</p><p>On the issue of the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, the wording of section 4(3)(b) clarifies that where an application is made to the courts in the context of a dispute or where legal clarity is required about a decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment, then that case will be heard in the High Court. </p><p>On the issues raised regarding the definition of basic care, for the purposes of this Act, basic care includes (but is not limited to) warmth, shelter, oral nutrition, oral hydration and hygiene measures, but does not include artificial nutrition or artificial hydration. An advance healthcare directive refusing basic care would not be applicable and would not be upheld. </p><p>The legislative framework for advance healthcare directives outlined in the Act does not in any way pertain to euthanasia or assisted suicide. The provisions for advance healthcare directives do not affect the existing law in Ireland relation to murder or manslaughter or the operation of section 2 of the Criminal Law (Suicide) Act (1993). </p><p>With regard to the Deputy's query concerning clinical trials, there is an international consensus in relation to the participation of people who lack capacity in clinical research (including clinical trials). While it is essential that such vulnerable individuals are appropriately protected, it is deemed ethically problematic to unnecessarily exclude such categories of people from research that could potentially benefit them or others suffering from the same illness.</p><p>Clinical research involving people who lack capacity is covered by both national and international instruments, including the HSE's National Consent Policy. On the issue of clinical trials, the EC (Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products for Human Use) Regulations 2004 (SI No. 190 of 2004) (as amended) provides an extensive framework to protect all those participating in clinical trials, which includes people who lack capacity. In addition, the Clinical Trials Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 536/2014), which is due to come into force in 2016, also contains extensive provision relating to the protection of people lacking capacity.&quot;</p></reply>

Under the provisions of the EU relocation programme, persons considered for relocation who will be accommodated in EROCs upon arrival, must be from countries with a recognition rate for asylum of at least 75%.  Accordingly, the expectation is that a large proportion of relocated persons will qualify for refugee status within a relatively short space of time after which they can seek housing in the wider community.       In addition, the Government has committed under the Programme to take in additional resettlement refugees who must also be temporally accommodated in EROCs for the purposes of reception, orientation and integration training, prior to being resettled in communities across Ireland.  In this specific regard two EROCs were opened in the past year, one in County Kildare and one in Co. Waterford.   </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department, responsible for implementing the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), were tasked with the sourcing of further suitable accommodation and orientation services for the proposed network of EROCs. This involves an assessment of information regarding available State properties provided by the Office of Public Works and a request for expressions of interest from commercial accommodation providers.  The commercial expressions of interest are being evaluated alongside the information provided by OPW in respect of State properties.  As these processes remain ongoing it would not be appropriate, for reasons of confidentiality and commercial sensitivity, for me to comment further on the possible locations of such properties .</p>  <p>  As for the longer term housing requirements of people coming into the State under the IRPP, a sub-group of the cross-departmental Taskforce established by the Government to oversee the implementation of the Programme is in the process of developing a housing strategy for those leaving their temporary EROC accommodation to be resettled in communities across Ireland.  The process of developing this longer term housing strategy will also take into consideration the many pledges of accommodation received from members of the public in response to the migration crisis.  These pledges are currently being assessed on behalf of the Government by the  Irish Red Cross. This issue where persons arriving into Ireland under the relevant programmes will be ultimately be housed remains a work in progress and no overall decisions have yet been taken in this regard.</p></reply>

In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a point highlighted by the Garda Inspectorate in their third report entitled &quot;Policing in Ireland-Looking Forward&quot; in which they stated that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na now operates a new model of Community Policing which aims to build upon and enhance progress made so far. I fully support this renewed emphasis on Community Policing particularly in light of the priority given to this in the Programme for Government. The model is about renewing, reinvigorating and restructuring the community policing function within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver a consistent national structure to the community policing function, a more co-ordinated and efficient Garda service to the community and a spread of good practice and quality of service in community policing on a national basis.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>The Report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate <i>&quot;Changing Policing in Ireland - Delivering a visible, accessible and responsive service&quot; </i>which I published on 9 December recommends that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reviews the activities  of the Community Relations Unit to focus the unit on the key priorities of creating safer communities and improving customer service. It also recommends that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reviews  the approach to community policing and community engagement in urban and rural divisions and in particular, the deployment and tasking of resources to enforcement, prevention and community engagement. In order to progress  consideration of the report I have put in place a process to seek the views of the Garda Commissioner and other bodies to whom recommendations are directed. I have requested them to respond within a reasonably short period of time, having regard to the size and scope of the report. I expect that this consultation process will be completed in March. The outcome will then inform the preparation of implementation proposals for consideration by Government. </p></reply>

In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  The Programme supports the provision of a modern 21st century policing service for both urban and rural areas and allows front line Garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility, and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  As a result of the Programme, communities have benefitted from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which has enabled  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver an improved policing service to the public.</p>  <p>  It is understood from discussions with the Garda Commissioner that the current consolidation process is largely completed. There are no proposals to either re-open or close any Garda stations in the Policing Plan for 2016.</p></reply>

No.  569 of 2011) sets out the prescribed fees to be paid by an applicant for a certificate of naturalisation.  An application fee of &euro;175 is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a fee is payable by applicants on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is set at &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.</p>  <p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  Every application must be assessed to establish if the statutory requirements are met. As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process. I might also add that following the grant of citizenship it is no longer necessary for the person to register their presence in the State with the Garda National Immigration Bureau which requires the payment of a fee of &euro;300 per registration.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that formal citizenship ceremonies have been introduced at no extra cost to applicants. These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.</p>  <p>  All of the fees payable under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 are kept under ongoing review by my Department. However, there are no current plans to reduce or abolish these fees.</p></reply>

The Designated Judge may investigate the granting of any authorisation for surveillance under the Act and has full access to all documentation and personnel involved in that process.  The Designated Judge reports to the Taoiseach on at least an annual basis and a copy of his report is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The 2009 Act also provides for an independent complaints procedure whereby a member of the public who believes that they have been the subject of an authorisation under the legislation may seek an investigation of the matter by a Complaints Referee.

The request was made by the Coroner for the Dublin County area under Section 47 of the Coroners Act, 1962.  The then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, considered the request, and having weighed up all of the relevant circumstances, decided not to make an exhumation order as he was not persuaded that the making of an order would be warranted, proportionate or justifiable.  He issued a press statement to the above effect on 8 June, 2006 which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at .  In my view, the circumstances have not altered in the interim and I do not propose to make an exhumation order in this case.</p><p>The case was amongst those considered under the mechanism established for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which have been made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality, or the Taoiseach with a view to determining to what extent and in what manner further action may be required in each case. A panel consisting of two senior and five junior counsel was established for that purpose. </p><p>The Panel has provided recommendations to me in all 320 cases submitted to them and has therefore largely concluded its work.  The issuing of notification letters to complainants commenced on 29 June. To date, 307 complainants have been notified of the outcome of the review of their cases. Letters will continue to issue to all complainants, until the process is completed which I expect will be very shortly as we are nearing the end of the process.  The outcome of the review in this complainant's case issued last month.</p><p>I have repeatedly emphasised that the Independent Review Mechanism was not established to act as a Commission of Inquiry or Investigation.  Nor was it designed to make findings. Its purpose was to triage the allegations to see whether further action was needed and what that action would be. Accordingly, the question of the exhumation of the remains of the deceased in this instance did not arise.</p><p>I have previously assured Deputies that where further investigation has been recommended by the review then that will occur.  However,  I have also pointed out that in a large proportion of cases, counsel would be likely to recommend that no further action could reasonably be taken.  This has proven to be the case.  The crucial point, however, is that every case has been reviewed by independent counsel, who have made an objective recommendation.</p></reply>

Where the Agency has serious concerns for the care and welfare of a child, and where it is not suitable or the parent is not agreeable to a voluntary care arrangement, it may apply to the courts for a care order.  </p>  <p>  When a child cannot live with his or her parents either on a short or long-term basis, the Agency will, in the first instance, seek to place the child with a suitable relative - including a grandparent - or person known to the child. All foster carers, including relatives, undergo an assessment and training process to establish their suitability and competence. In making their decision about the relative becoming foster parent to the child, the Agency will decide what is in the best interest of the child.</p>  <p>  Overall, of the approximately 6,400 children in State care, 93% are in a foster care placement. Of those children in foster care, almost one third are being fostered by relatives. </p>  <p>  The decision to deem a person suitable and eligible to adopt is a matter for the Adoption Authority of Ireland and is taken against criteria outlined in Section 34 of the Adoption Act, 2010. These criteria include that an applicant or applicants be of good health and of an age so that he or she has a reasonable expectation of being capable throughout the child&rsquo;s childhood of providing the necessary health, social, educational and other interventions for the child, and having financial means to support the child. </p>  <p>  In order to get a declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt,  prospective adoptive parents should apply to Tusla for an assessment under Section 37 of the Adoption Act 2010. Grandparents may apply to be assessed  and  the special nature of the relationship between grandparents and grandchildren is acknowledged as part of the assessment process. The best interests of the child is the paramount concern in the adoption.</p></reply>

With this in mind, I requested that an Inter-Departmental Group, led by this Department, be established with a brief to bring forward recommendations to address this issue.</p>  <p>  The Group has concluded its work and its recommendations were fully accepted and funded by Government.  I announced, as part of Budget 2016, the necessary funding to implement the new model with costs estimated to be &euro;15m in 2016 and with full year cost estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards.  This Group has identified a practical, workable model for meeting the needs of children with a disability and the allocation of funding is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to supporting vulnerable children.</p>  <p>  When established, the new model will focus on the developmental level of children with disabilities, their functional ability and their needs. It will not focus on diagnosis, recognising that many children may not have a formal diagnosis at the time of presenting to pre-school. </p>  <p>  The model, when fully operational, will deliver seven levels of support to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE Programme. These supports, which move from universal to highly targeted supports based on the needs of the child, include: enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations, increased capitation for children with very complex needs, as well as access to therapeutic intervention. </p>  <p>  Two groups have been established to oversee and implement the new model; a Cross Sectoral Implementation Group will oversee and monitor implementation, while the second group, the Project Group, will implement the model for roll-out by September 2016.  Further details in relation to this measure are expected to be available in June this year. </p>  <p>  Until this new model is introduced, the ECCE programme continues to make special provision for children with a disability to access it. Measures include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification where a child would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  The County Childcare Committees continue to provide information and support for parents, and on some occasions assist in accessing supports locally and providing training for early years providers. </p>  <p>  There is no additional funding available to this Department to support the employment of special needs assistants in pre-school services.  The HSE, on an ad hoc basis, does make some supports available and it is expected that these arrangements will continue until the new model has been established.</p></reply>

The measure will come into effect from September 2016.</p>  <p>  The extension to the programme will cost an additional &euro;47m in 2016.  The full year additional costs of the extended programme will be in the region of &euro;114m.  These estimated costs include the restoration of capitation fees to pre-2012 levels with effect from September 2016 (i.e. &euro;64.50 standard capitation rate and &euro;75 higher capitation rate per child per week).</p>  <p>  My response to Parliamentary Question 358 of 24th November 2015 referred to an estimated additional cost of &euro;20m in 2017 arising from the hypothetical increase of the standard and higher capitation rates to &euro;67.50 and &euro;82.50 per child per week respectively.</p>  <p>  Currently, around 67,000 children participate in the ECCE programme.  It is estimated that the Budget 2016 initiative will increase the number of children benefitting from the programme to over 127,000 in a given year.  However, this increase will not happen immediately.  It is estimated that the maximum enrolment of 127,000 will not occur until the April 2017 enrolment.  The additional cost of increasing the standard capitation rate from &euro;64.50 to &euro;67.50 and the higher capitation rate from &euro;75 to &euro;82.50 was calculated on the basis of the additional numbers of children expected to be enrolled in the programme in January 2017 and in April 2017.  It should be noted that the extension to the programme will provide children with additional pre-school weeks, but the maximum number of pre-school weeks in a particular year remains 38.</p></reply>

Based on more recent (2014) current data, this target has been updated to 100,000 children.  </p><p>The Department of Social Protection have the lead role in coordinating government strategies on child poverty and are the Sponsor of outcome 4 of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>- economic security and opportunity.  The Department of Social Protection also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion. Its work is also informed by the European Commission Recommendation on 'Investing in children: Breaking the cycle of disadvantage'.  The Department of Social Protection have identified child poverty as a key cross-sectoral priority to be addressed in 2015 and 2016 under the <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>structures.</p><p>In support of the target, the Government is implementing a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty.  The whole-of-government approach includes: child and family income supports; prevention and early intervention services in disadvantaged areas; access to employment for jobless households with children; national programme to tackle educational disadvantage; physical activity plan and provision of school meals.  </p><p>To assist in this, the Advisory Council for <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Future,</i>which brings together key members of the community and voluntary sectors who work with and for children and young people, and the Department of Social Protection have co-convened a subgroup with officials from my Department and other relevant Departments to progress solutions to the issue of child poverty. The first meeting of this group was held in September 2015, the second was held in November 2015 and a third is scheduled for January 2016.</p><p>As part of this multi-dimensional approach and the importance accorded to the development of effective and quality focused services and support for children and young people, my Department in collaboration with the Department of Social Protection will hold an EU Peer Review next month to explore innovative responses in prevention and early intervention to improve outcomes for children in particular those experiencing child poverty and disadvantage.  This event will involve ten Member States and the European Commission and a number of key Irish Stakeholders.</p><p>My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Social Protection supporting this multi-dimensional approach to child poverty. There are also a number of areas of focus that support our response to child poverty within my Department.  My Department invests &euro;260 million annually on early childhood care and education and after-school support programmes which provide care to 100,000 children. A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes. In addition in early 2015, I established an Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education.  The work of the group was focused on identifying policy objectives to guide future investment in this area.  This report was published in July 2015 and informed the estimates process for Budget 2016.  Budget 2016 provides for an additional &euro;85 million investment in 2016.</p><p>My Department is also leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2017).  The ABC Programme is co-funded by my Department and The Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme aims to improve the outcomes for children, young people and existing service by drawing on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched.  It is overseen by an Inter-departmental project team.</p><p>My Department also provides targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people through a range of schemes. The allocation to support the provision of youth services by the voluntary youth sector for 2016 is &euro;51.03 million. I launched the National Youth Strategy 2015-2020 on 8 October, 2015. The strategy sets out Government&rsquo;s aims for young people, aged 10 to 24 years, so that they are active and healthy, achieving their full potential in learning and development, safe and protected from harm, have economic security and opportunity and are connected and contributing to their world.  The implementation structures established by my Department under <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures </i>will oversee the roll out of the National Youth Strategy.</p><p>Finally, as part of my Department's response, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency is also responsible for the delivery of a range of services focusing on the welfare, protection and support for children, young people and their families which are key to supporting outcomes which assist in actively mitigating the impact of child poverty.</p></reply>

While certain flexibilities had been built in to the Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability the <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter </i>Futures children and young people's policy framework contained a commitment to develop a plan to facilitate the full participation of such children in the ECCE Programme.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has lead responsibility for the implementation of this commitment and has concluded an intensive process of deliberation and consultation on the matter in conjunction with the Departments of Health and Education and Skills and has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.</p><p>As part of Budget 2016, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs announced the necessary funding to implement the new model of ECCE supports for children with a disability.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15 million has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33 million from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18 November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with my full support and the support of my Government colleague Jan O'Sullivan T.D., Minister  for Education and Skills. </p><p>It should be noted that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.</p><p>Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case she has raised.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them. </p></reply>

Furthermore, my Department is working on a number of measures which include legislation for calorie posting on menus, a Code of Practice for the food industry in relation to advertising, product placement and sponsorship and new healthy eating guidelines and food pyramid.

In 2011, the UK National Screening Committee commissioned a full and systematic assessment of the international evidence base for scoliosis screening based on international evidence.  The review concluded that screening for scoliosis was not recommended.</p>  <p>  There have been no significant additions to the evidence base since this comprehensive assessment which drew on studies from many countries.  The Irish epidemiology of scoliosis is not known to differ significantly from that in other countries, therefore this finding is also relevant for the Irish population. </p>  <p>  The US Preventive task force which reviewed screening for scoliosis also came out against screening.  They are in the process of updating this review, which is due to report in 2016, and any changes in that position will be noted.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, there is no evidence to support the re-introduction of scoliosis screening in secondary schools in Ireland at this time but as with all potential screening programmes this will be subject to review as new evidence emerges.</p></reply>

As with all capital projects, the further development of the health care infrastructure, including St Mary's Hospital and other projects in counties Louth and Meath, must be considered within the context of the overall capital envelope available to the health service. Plans for capital investment in public nursing homes between now and 2021 are in the course of being finalised, and details will be made available once this process is complete.  In the acute care context any future investment must be considered within the overall acute hospital infrastructure programme and establishment of hospital groups. Each hospital group will be required to develop a strategic plan to describe how it will provide more efficient and effective patient services and reorganise its services to provide optimal care to the populations it serves.    The HSE is concentrating on applying the funding available for infrastructure development in the most effective way possible to meet current and future needs.  </p></reply>

The title of <i>physiotherapist </i>will, as a consequence, will be protected under the Act for the exclusive use of the board's registrants when the register's 2-year transitional period ends in 2018. </p><p>In the rest of the English speaking world the titles of <i>physical therapist</i>and <i>physiotherapist</i>are interchangeable and their users are qualified physiotherapists.  In Ireland, however, the title is also used by a number of practitioners who are not physiotherapists but who have been providing musculoskeletal therapies in the private sector for many years.  Physiotherapists are trained to provide musculoskeletal, cardio/respiratory and neurological therapies, working in both the public and private sector.  </p><p>Last year, I consulted with the Physiotherapists Registration Board and thereafter I wrote to a number of relevant organisations about the question of also protecting the title of <i>physical therapist </i>under the Act.  In considering their views I endeavoured to take into account, appropriately and subject to ensuring public protection, the legitimate concerns of the current users of the title and the other parties that may be affected by my decisions in this matter.  I have come to the conclusion that protecting the title of <i>physical therapist</i>under the Act as a variant of the title of <i>physiotherapist</i>would be the best way to eliminate the ongoing risk of title confusion and the consequent risks to public safety. I have also decided to allow particular existing users of the title <i>physical therapist</i>who are not physiotherapists but who hold qualifications of a certain standard to continue to use the title. </p><p>New grand parenting provisions will allow such practitioners to apply, on a once-off basis and for a limited period, to register in the physiotherapists register.  After this period only qualified physiotherapists will be permitted to register. The registration board&rsquo;s code of professional conduct and ethics will oblige all registrants, including those registered under the new provisions, to act within the limits of their knowledge, skills, competence and experience.  In other words, and to ensure public protection, those registered under these time limited special provisions will be required to confine their practise to musculoskeletal therapies. </p><p>My Department will now prepare the necessary legislation to give effect to my decisions which were communicated to the Physiotherapists Registration Board and other interested parties last week.</p></reply>

The HPRA have been seeking to find an alternative supply of BCG that meets safety, quality and effectiveness standards and that could be used in Ireland. To date no appropriate alternative manufacturer of BCG vaccine has been found.</p>  <p>  In Ireland the number of cases of Tuberculosis (TB) has been falling and there were no cases of TB in young children in 2014.  Young children are not at risk of TB because of the delay in getting BCG vaccine in Ireland.</p>  <p>  There has been a number of issues that have delayed the production, release and delivery of BCG vaccine in recent months.  Consequently, supplies of the vaccine are not expected to be received in Ireland until February at the earliest.  When the vaccine is delivered there will be sufficient quantity to vaccinate all babies who have not received the vaccine.  The HSE will arrange appointments for vaccination clinics when the BCG vaccine supply is received.</p></reply>

The cost of private health insurance is influenced by a number of factors such as the number of persons in the market, the age profile of those holding private health insurance and ongoing medical innovations which can have an impact on the cost of care and the cost of claims. </p>  <p>  Since my appointment as Minister, keeping the health insurance market stable and increasing the numbers taking out health insurance has been one of my key priorities. An increase in the numbers taking out health insurance helps to control premium inflation, thereby keeping health insurance more affordable for everyone. Lifetime Community Rating Regulations came into effect from 1 May 2015 and late entry loadings now apply for people aged 35 and over when taking out health insurance for the first time. This encourages people to take out health insurance at a younger age, thereby avoiding loadings and helping to spread the health costs of older and less healthy people across all insured persons. In addition, new legislation effective from May 2015 provides for the introduction of &lsquo;Young Adult&rsquo; rates of premium, which are based on a sliding scale of maximum chargeable rates up to age 26. Without these measures, there would be a continued deterioration in the age profile of the insured population, which in turn would contribute to claims inflation and result in higher insurance premiums.</p>  <p>  The number of people now holding private health insurance is 2.118 million, or 46% of the Irish population (end-September 2015). This is an increase of over 93,000 since the start of 2015, which is extremely welcome as it helps to control premium inflation and thus keep health insurance affordable for all who wish to avail of it. </p>  <p>  We have a highly competitive insurance market and I urge customers to shop around for the best value for their desired level of cover. Many consumers can make savings on their health insurance premiums by reviewing the level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured. The Health Insurance Authority website is a good place to start as it offers a clear price comparison and can be accessed at www.hia.ie.</p></reply>

The 2016 Service Plan specifically provides for support for the new theatre capacity and the continued development of paediatric scoliosis services to address ongoing capacity deficits. </p>  <p>  In order to address waiting times in the interim, patients from Crumlin have been transferred to other hospitals where capacity is available and where that is clinically appropriate.  These include Temple Street, Cappagh, Tallaght and the Blackrock Clinic.  External capacity has also been identified at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore in the UK.

Once the implementation framework has been agreed by the Steering Group, it will go for consultation to the wider stakeholder interest groups.  Following this consultation, the framework will be revised and will guide and oversee the reconfiguration and development of Neuro-rehabilitation structures and services at national and local level, from within existing resources.</p>  <p>  In August 2015, my colleague, the Minister for Health, announced an additional &euro;15 million for the redevelopment of the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH) in Dun Laoghaire.  This allocation will enable the NRH and the HSE to proceed with a new 120 bed building on the Dun Laoghaire campus.  The redeveloped facility will be purpose built to accommodate integrated therapy services, hydrotherapy and sports facilities.</p>  <p>  Outside of the Clinical Programme, the HSE's Disability Services Division has a role in certain key aspects of Neuro-rehabilitation Services, primarily the provision of community-based therapy services and personal social services, often funded through partner service providing agencies in the non-statutory sector.  The Disability Services Division will focus on Disability funded rehabilitation services in 2016 and enable reconfiguration of existing provision through the establishment of demonstration sites.  Close links will be maintained with the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinical Programme to ensure that there is no duplication of effort and that all initiatives receive optimal support.  Demonstration sites have been identified by Disability Services and mapping has commenced.</p></reply>

Funding was allocated in 2015 for additional consultant posts including two consultant orthopaedic surgeons, anaesthetist and support staff at Crumlin  while capital funding was also provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further.

Ireland is a firm supporter of the European Court of Human Rights and the European Convention of Human Rights system and liaises regularly with the UK in relation to the Council on Europe Committee of Ministers&rsquo; supervision of states&rsquo; implementation of Court judgments. As I outlined in my speech to the Seanad last May, the protection of human rights in Northern Ireland law, predicated on the European Convention on Human Rights, is one of the key principles underpinning the Good Friday Agreement. As a guarantor of the Agreement, the Government takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles. The fundamental role of human rights in guaranteeing peace and stability in Northern Ireland cannot be taken for granted and must be fully respected. The Good Friday Agreement is clear that there is an obligation to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law and this is an ongoing obligation.  There is not at this time, any legislation before the British Parliament at Westminster to repeal the 1998 UK Human Rights Act. However, the British Government has announced its intention to bring forward proposals for a Bill of Rights to replace the Human Rights Act. These proposals have not yet been published. In the absence of any detailed proposal it is difficult to speculate on potential consequences. Obviously were any proposal to be made it would have to be carefully analysed.</p>  <p>  The Government continues to monitor the situation closely. I have raised this issue on several occasions in bilateral meetings with both Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, and Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, while my colleagues Minister Fitzgerald and Minister of State Murphy have raised the issue with the UK Minister of State for Europe David Lidington. Such contacts have provided an opportunity to convey to the UK our concerns that any proposals as regards the Human Rights Act must be consistent with the Good Friday Agreement.  The UK response has been to acknowledge that any such moves must be done in a manner consistent with the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  Placing human rights at the heart of the peace process in Northern Ireland has helped to ensure the participation and trust of all communities.  The Government will continue to work closely with the UK Government and with the power-sharing Executive in Belfast to ensure that the protection of human rights remains at the heart of civic life, politics and ongoing societal change in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

Since then, unrest, particularly in the south-east of the country, has seen the Turkish authorities impose curfews  in a number of towns and cities while militant groups linked to the PKK have erected barricades and used explosives against the authorities, resulting in deadly street battles. According to NGO reports, many hundreds have died since last July, including as many as 240 civilians, along with an estimated 230 Turkish security officers and hundreds more militants. As many as 200,000 civilians are believed to have been displaced. Ireland has been a strong supporter of the peace talks between the Turkish Government and the PKK. The current situation demonstrates further the paramount importance for all sides to cease hostilities and return to dialogue. I condemn in the strongest terms all acts of terrorism, including those acts carried out by Kurdish militants such as the bombing of a police station in &Ccedil;&yacute;nar on 14 January which resulted in the deaths of five civilians and one police officer. Any government operations against militant activity must, of course, fully respect Turkey&rsquo;s obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law.  It is vital that all sides exercise the maximum possible restraint and work immediately to de-escalate tensions and reinstate a ceasefire. I again reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s firm belief that a fair and lasting solution to this conflict can only be reached through peaceful and democratic means.</p>  <p>  I am aware also of the detention of a number of academics on 15 January on charges of engaging in &lsquo;terrorist propaganda&rsquo; and insulting the state after they signed a petition, along with as many as 1,000 other academics, critical of the authorities&rsquo; military operations. I understand that while these academics were released soon after, investigations against them and others who signed the petition continue. Freedom of expression and the media is fundamental to the functioning of any healthy democracy. It is critically important for Turkey, and for Turkish democracy, that these universal values be upheld, particularly given the current, very difficult situation.

The rent allowance is only provided to officers who are not eligible to reside in State-provided accommodation. The Department uses an independent advisory service to advise on appropriate rent levels in the locations in which it is based around the world.  The primary criteria in assessing rent allowances is the size of the officer&rsquo;s family (i.e. whether the officer&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner is accompanying them on post and whether some or all of an officer&rsquo;s children are accompanying).  Other possible considerations would include security requirements (in locations where additional security protection is needed), proximity to schools and the Mission, as well as health and safety issues.  Assessments are also made as to the representational/promotional work associated with particular posts and if the property is likely to be frequently used for promotional work.</p><p>Officers receiving a rent allowance remain personally responsible for all payments in respect of beneficial services such as heating, water, lighting, gas, telephone, TV, refuse collection, maintenance of central heating etc. in the same manner as would apply when they are stationed in Ireland.</p><p>Rent allowances are fixed for the duration of an officer&rsquo;s assignment abroad apart from provisions provided for in leases for mandatory cost of living index increases.</p><p>The following table details the total Vote 28 rental allowance outlay for the period 2005-15 in the locations abroad where our Missions are located.</p><p>Expenditure under A1-RENT subhead for 2005-2015 in respect of D/FAT staff serving abroad</p><p><table><tr><th>Name of

The Deputy will also be aware that Returning Officers are statutorily responsible for the conduct of elections and may, under electoral law, use school premises for this purpose.</p>  <p>  In relation to polling taking place in schools, for many years there has been an ongoing campaign for polling to take place on Saturdays which would prevent the loss of any school days for those schools which otherwise might be identified as polling stations.  In light of this, the Children's Referendum was held on a Saturday, with 33.5% of eligible voters taking part.  This was obviously a disappointing turnout, which raises further questions about the best day for polling to take place.  The most recent referendums took place on a Friday, with 60.5% of eligible voters taking part &ndash; the highest turnout in many years.</p>  <p>  In my opinion the establishment of an independent Electoral Commission will allow for a much more detailed analysis of electoral turnout on different days of the week, across different jurisdictions and it will also be best placed to advise on the most appropriate venues to be used as polling stations.  I look forward to engaging with the Commission in relation to the use of school premises for that purpose.</p></reply>

The previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable of all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011 and required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, following the public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments, the Government decided to withdraw or modify allowances for new beneficiary public servants with effect from 1 February 2012.  Under this decision, certain allowances were withdrawn for new beneficiary teachers, including qualification allowances.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.</p>  <p>  These measures were implemented at time of very difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.</p>  <p>  Alleviation of the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date began under the Haddington Road Agreement. Improved pay scales for post-1 January 2011 and post-1 February 2012 entrants to teaching were agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement. In addition, allowances payable to post-1 January 2011 entrants and such allowances as remain payable to post-1 February 2012 entrants were restored to pre-2011 levels.</p>  <p>  The Lansdowne Road Agreement will, through salary increases and a reduction in the Pension-Related Deduction, begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years.  The issue of equalised pay scales was not one which could be resolved in the discussions which lead to the Agreement.  However, the flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement will be proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.  Circular letter 0066/2015 which issued in December 2015 sets out the revisions to the thresholds for the Pension Related Deduction from 2015 and revised salary scales for teachers which take effect from 1 January 2016.</p></reply>

I can inform the Deputy that approximately 76% of the 2015 capital expenditure in the school sector was accounted for in the provision of permanent school places through the Large Scale Projects Programme and the devolved Permanent Accommodation Scheme.  Capital expenditure on the provision of permanent school places is expected to be at similar percentage level in 2016. </p><p>  Typically, applications from schools requiring additional accommodation to address increasing pupil numbers are received by my Department throughout the year and this pattern will continue in 2016.  Following assessment of the applications, schools are advised of the outcome and successful projects are listed on my Department's website.</p><p>Where smaller scale projects are involved, that are suitable for delivery by schools directly, these projects are delegated to the school authority concerned.  Schools are then in a position to follow the guidelines regarding the appointment of a consultant, obtain planning permission and enter into the tendering process to appoint a building contractor.  The process from approval of the project to commencement of works on site depends on the rate of progression of a project by the school concerned.  On commencement of works, the school is placed in funds by my Department.</p><p>  In the case of major school projects on the 6 Year Programme, the positioning of the school projects in terms of year to commence construction is informed by the anticipated progress that each project will make as it progresses through the various stages of the architectural planning process.  In that regard, it would not be feasible for a school authority to deliver a major school project via the devolved additional accommodation scheme.</p></reply>

In this regard, my Department is aware that there is existing capacity in primary schools in the Coolock/Darndale/Artane/Edenmore areas.</p>  <p>  My Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.  A new primary school will open in September 2016 to serve the Drumcondra/Marino/Dublin 1 feeder area (which is adjacent to the feeder area in which Gaelscoil Cholmcille is situated) to cater for the demographic growth in that area.  My Department will keep the demographic projections under ongoing review to take account of updated enrolment and child benefit data and also the impact of capacity increases to schools in these areas.</p></reply>

The first of these was received on 22 December, 2014 seeking funding to replace leaking pipes and carry out electrical repairs.  This application was approved and the grant has been paid in full.</p>  <p>  The second application was received on 22nd December 2014 seeking funding to replace the fire alarm system but this application was refused as it was outside the scope of works that would qualify for funding under the terms of the Emergency Works Scheme.</p>  <p>  The third application was received on the 9 June, 2015 seeking funding to replace the roof of the school building.  This application was refused as it was also outside the scope of the Emergency Works Scheme.  Following an appeal by the school in November, a grant was allocated to carry out repairs to the roof and the school was advised to apply under the Summer Works Scheme for a replacement roof as this is the appropriate Scheme under which funding could be available for this type of work.  It is a condition of the Summer Works Scheme that schools apply for the most urgently needed works at their school.  Under the current Summer Works Scheme, the school in question applied for an electrical upgrade.</p>  <p>  It is not intended that the Emergency Works Scheme, which is for sudden and unforeseen emergencies, will be used to supplement previous applications under other schemes that have not been successful in securing funding in the current year or to replace any other schemes provided by my Department.  The current offer of funding to the school to carry out repair works to its roof is consistent with this position and the fact that the replacement of a roof is outside the scope of the Emergencies Works Scheme.</p></reply>

This Council is comprised of representatives of the teacher unions, school management bodies, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Department of Education and Skills chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  In order for qualified teachers to be awarded incremental credit for previous teaching service applicants must complete Section 1 of the application form (FORM INCCR) and request their previous school authority to complete Section 2.

The previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable of all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011 and required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale.  Subsequently, following the public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments, the Government decided to withdraw or modify allowances for new beneficiary public servants with effect from 1 February 2012.  Under this decision, certain allowances were withdrawn for new beneficiary teachers, including qualification allowances.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.</p>  <p>  These measures were implemented at time of very difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.</p>  <p>  The figures sought by the Deputy in relation to the Gaeltacht and Teaching through Irish allowances to teachers are currently being compiled by my Department and will be forwarded to the Deputy shortly.</p>  <p>  Alleviation of the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date began under the Haddington Road Agreement. Improved pay scales for post-1 January 2011 and post-1 February 2012 entrants to teaching were agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement.  In addition, allowances payable to post-1 January 2011 entrants and such allowances as remain payable to post-1 February 2012 entrants were restored to pre-2011 levels.</p>  <p>  The Lansdowne Road Agreement will, through salary increases and a reduction in the Pension-Related Deduction, begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years.  The issue of equalised pay scales was not one which could be resolved in the discussions which lead to the Agreement.  However, the flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement will be proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.  Circular letter 0066/2015 which issued in December 2015 sets out the revisions to the thresholds for the Pension Related Deduction from 2015 and revised salary scales for teachers which take effect from 1 January 2016.</p></reply>

In late 2010, my Department issued Circular 0063/2010 which updated and clarified the requirements for Garda vetting as part of recruitment procedures for all teaching and non-teaching positions.  This circular also set out the vetting requirements of non-employees such as volunteers, sports coaches etc. In relation to non-employees, the key criterion in determining whether a vetting requirement arises is whether the person will have or may have unsupervised access to children in the school. This would not normally be the case in the case of members of the board of management.  </p>  <p>  The existing Garda vetting arrangements for the recognised schools sector operate on a non-statutory basis. However, the Deputy will be aware that the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, will, when commenced, put in place statutory requirements for vetting of persons involved in working with children and vulnerable adults, including those working in schools.</p></reply>

Public Service Agreements have been the primary vehicles used to implement these reforms. Consultative forums and other resolution mechanisms are an inherent and integral feature in the delivery of any reform programme.  Where the need has arisen, resolution mechanisms (both statutory and non-statutory) available under the various Public Service Agreements have been used to enable all parties to resolve any disputes encountered in the course of reforming public services. Common and widely-used mechanisms include local partnership committees and the recently established Workplace Relations Commission. Certain mechanisms are unique to particular agreements and have been successful in achieving positive outcomes. <i>The Irish Water Consultative Group provides a process for resolving disputes unique to the water services sector, and the Fire Services National Oversight and Implementation Group performs a similar function in the area of fire and emergency.</i></p></reply>

The charges structure was revised with a view to making it simpler and fairer, providing more clarity and certainty to households. The capped annual charge is &euro;160 for single adult households and &euro;260 for all other households until the end of 2018. All households now know what their capped bills will be until the end of 2018, which is particularly important for larger households or those with high usage due to medical needs. Section 3(5) of the Water Services Act 2014 allows for a capped charge to also be set for 2019 onwards.  In addition, a water conservation grant of &euro;100 per year is available to qualifying households.</p>  <p>  The overall cost for those who register with Irish Water, net of the &euro;100 water conservation grant, is either &euro;1.15 a week for single adult households or &euro;3 a week for all others. Water supply will not be reduced under any circumstance.</p>  <p>  When it comes to payment, a range of easy pay options are in place, including direct debits, electronic funds transfer, and payment by cash at any retail outlet with a paypoint or payzone sign or a post office where a bill can be paid in full or part payments of a minimum of &euro;5 can be made. Irish Water also intends participating in the Household Budget scheme.  This facility, operated by An Post on behalf of the Department of Social Protection, provides customers with a facility to have their household utility bills and social housing rents deducted directly from their weekly social welfare payment.</p></reply>

The issues arising with Shared Ownership Schemes require careful consideration and expert financial data analysis.  Arising from the findings of the examination to date, the Index Linked Shared Ownership Scheme which operated from 1999 until 2002 has been revised with regard to the annual indexation of the rental equity balance and rental payments.</p>  <p>  The amendments, which came into effect on 1 July 2015, reduce the monthly cost for these borrowers and avoid existing rental equity balances increasing for the remaining term. My Department has issued directions to local authorities outlining the measures and I understand that these changes are being applied to individual loan accounts.</p>  <p>  In addition, the most recent reduction of 0.20% in the Local Authority variable mortgage interest rate will also benefit many Share Ownership borrowers. This rate cut brought the variable mortgage interest rate charged to local authority borrowers down to 2.55% with effect from 1 July, saving borrowers around &euro;17 per month on a typical mortgage of &euro;100,000.</p>  <p>  My Department, together with the other agencies, is continuing to examine the operation of Shared Ownership loans and issues arising for some borrowers, with a view to exploring further measures that may assist with the affordability of these arrangements.</p></reply>

The NTA has assigned its function in relation to securing the provision of metro or light rail passenger services to Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) and TII is the relevant statutory authority for all construction, operational and maintenance issues relating to Luas.  Section 48 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 requires a competitive tendering procedure to be used in the award of any light rail public passenger transport services contract.  It is therefore not legally permitted to transfer operation of the Luas to any operator following the expiration of a particular contract period.  Any such contract can only be awarded following a competitive tendering procedure.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  Local authorities are required to have winter road treatment programmes (including salting/gritting of routes) in place and they carry out their operations on a priority basis.  The sequence is, national roads, major regional roads and finally, important heavily trafficked local roads.  In determining a precise salting/gritting sequence, local authorities take account of various factors including road category, traffic volume, public transport routes and topographical or physical constraints.  In this context I would expect Bus &Eacute;ireann to liaise directly with the Westmeath County Council in relation to any difficulties it is experiencing.</p></reply>

DRL involves motorists either using their dipped headlights during the hours of daylight or fitting dedicated daytime running lights in an effort to make vehicles more conspicuous and thereby reducing the number and severity of road traffic collisions.  An increasing number of vehicles have dedicated DRL fitted as standard, and it became mandatory on all new cars entering the national fleet from 2011 onwards in accordance with EC Directive 2008/89/EC.  Since August 2012 new trucks and buses are required to have dedicated DRL.  It is estimated that through the gradual renewal of the national fleet almost all vehicles will be equipped with DRL by 2024.    </p>  <p>  The RSA previously undertook a review of the policy options available for the mandatory introduction of DRL and concluded that DRL should not be made obligatory at this moment in time. Experience in other countries, especially Sweden where DRL has been mandatory since 1977, shows that mandatory DRL works best where all vehicles are fitted with dedicated DRL and where there has been intensive promotion and awareness campaigns prior to DRL being made mandatory. In Ireland most vehicles do not yet have dedicated DRL and the RSA analysis has shown that the costs of retrofitting DRL at the current time outweighs the benefits. Based on the RSA's review, I do not intend introducing penalty points for motorists who do not put their headlights on at all times of the day.</p></reply>

With economic recovery, I have however, been able to provide some additional support to the Film Board, including additional funding of &euro;500,000 in 2016.  The allocation to the Film Board in 2016 is almost &euro;14.5m, which shows an increase of 3.6% from last year.</p><p>This increased investment will help to maximise the benefits brought about by the Government&rsquo;s enhancement of the Section 481 film tax credit system, including the decision to increase the cap for eligible expenditure on film projects to &euro;70 million, as announced as part of Budget 2016.</p><p>My aim is to further enhance the supports for the Irish film industry as the economy continues to improve.</p></reply>
