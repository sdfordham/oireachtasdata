This includes responsibility for the allocation of funding for National Governing Bodies of Sport. The Sports Council monitors those bodies in order to ensure proper financial auditing and governance standards and my Department has no role in that process.</p>  <p>  The Council sets terms and conditions in relation to the funding provided, including financial reporting requirements. From the information they have given me, I am confident that they have good procedures in place for the audit of use of public moneys allocated to sporting organisations.  I will refer the Deputy's question to the Council to provide more detail directly to him.</p>  <p>  In relation to my Department's Sports Capital Programme, organisations in receipt of grants must comply with the terms and conditions of the Programme. These include the submission of three quotations, paid invoices, proof of payment of invoices in the form of bank statements and tax clearance certificates for the grantees and the suppliers.  All grantees must also provide a guarantee that grant aided facilities and equipment will stay in sporting use for a minimum period of time.  Any organisation that does not comply with the terms and conditions may have their grant withdrawn, may be required to repay a grant or be barred from making applications for a period . The Department also inspects a random sample of payments to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the Programme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-17a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015061700060#WRA00700"><p>With the return of economic growth, we must ensure that we have measures in place to deal with the consequent increase in traffic. It is a key objective of transport policy to encourage modal shift away from the car so as to improve economic competitiveness through reduced congestion, particularly in high density urban environments such as Dublin. This also supports climate change mitigation through reducing emissions.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority, working closely with the City Council, is responsible for the development of traffic management plans in Dublin. Together, they recently announced plans for an ambitious re-drawing of the city, which will encourage the use of public transport, cycling and walking.</p>  <p>  Tackling congestion requires choices to be made between competing demands for a finite amount of road space.  It is impossible to satisfy everyone.  The roll-out of the now extensive network of bus lanes in the Dublin area for example, was only made possible by the removal of cars from considerable sections of the road, a policy which received considerable opposition at the time.  Dublin today is very different from Dublin of 20 years ago.  It is clear that the car can no longer be king.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made by the relevant local authorities and the National Transport Authority to ensure that all traffic management measures implemented in Dublin will seek to reduce congestion, while supporting this Government's policy in relation to promoting continual economic growth and the creation of jobs.</p></reply>

Furthermore, in keeping with commitments under the Aarhaus Convention, my officials recently held an information exchange with stakeholders and interested parties on the measures being considered by the Department.</p>  <p>  These measures have emerged as part of a longer consultative process that began last year and represent a multi-faceted approach to cost-effective mitigation in transport.  The suite of measures currently being examined has a particular focus on policy development, smarter travel and modal shift, supports for alternative fuels and certain fiscal and taxation incentives to target behavioural change.  </p>  <p>  In terms of a future fuel profile for Ireland, the Minister of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has responsibility for energy policy generally, which includes fuel supply and security issues as well as policy on renewable energy for Ireland.  The latest publication of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan  estimates that 50,000 electric vehicles could be in circulation by 2020.  In addition, the draft Bioenergy Plan recommends the continuation of the Biofuels Obligation Scheme, which will be the principal means of ensuring that 10% of the energy in the transport sector in 2020 is from renewable sources. </p>  <p>  Both national and EU policy provides for growth in the alternative fuels market to 2020.  In order to support the policy for long-term oil substitution, and in line with the recently adopted EU Directive on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure, my Department is currently preparing a National Policy Framework to support the alternative fuels market in Ireland.  My Department expects to widen the consultation process on this Framework to the general public by the end of this year.</p></reply>

Donegal.</p>  <p>  I understand that the RSA has been supportive of the Programme and will continue to liaise with them through regular meetings, sharing of research and updates on RSA educational material and programmes.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will understand that as the initiative in Donegal has not been led or funded by the by the State I am not in a position to report on the detail of its operations.</p></reply>

The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Osberstown interchange and the Sallins bypass the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources, supplemented by State road grants.</p>  <p>  The reality is that the available funds do not match the amount of work that needs to be done to maintain existing road infrastructure or address demands for new road improvement projects. Funding this year is around &euro;730 million for the national, regional and local road network.  Unfortunately, the current financial realities are such that the budgets proposed for my Department for 2016 and 2017 indicate that capital funding will continue to be very tight, and my ability to progress new projects  is limited.  I acknowledge it is important to restore over time capital funding for the transport sector to ensure that infrastructure is maintained but, as of now, I am not in a position to give a commitment in regard to funding of the projects in question, although I acknowledge their national and local importance.</p></reply>

It was disappointing that lack of support for the planned Cork-Prague and Cork-Ibiza routes was the reason cited by Czech Airlines for its decision not to commence operations on the routes. </p>  <p>  The National Aviation Policy cannot address the issue of local support for the Airport. That is a matter for the people and businesses in the region. However, such support is critical to ensure the Airport's future sustainability.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.</p>  <p>  I am not in a position to provide additional funding to County Meath at present. In order to address the national finances there were substantial cutbacks in the funding available for State grants for national, regional and local road programmes and this has had a major impact across the board.  Funding in 2008 was &euro;2.3 billion while funding this year is around &euro;730 million to cover the entire national, regional and local road network.  I know that it is important to restore over time capital funding for the transport sector to ensure that land transport infrastructure is maintained and renewed to support economic development but as of now my Department is continuing to operate within a very constrained budget. </p>  <p>  Within the budget available to my Department I have tried to allocate funding on as fair and equitable basis as I can.  In this context grants in the three main grant categories (Restoration Improvement, Discretionary Grant and Restoration Maintenance) are allocated based on the length of regional and local roads within a local authority area.    </p>  <p>  It is important reiterate that State grants are intended to supplement own resources spending by local authorities and in this context I am emphasising to Councils that the commitment of local authorities to contribute significantly from their own resources towards the cost of improving and maintaining the regional and local roads network is essential.</p></reply>

I have stated publicly that this was not the intention of the Oireachtas when the legislation was passed.</p>  <p>  Government's policy is for the NTA to procure bus services through a combination of direct award and tendering in the best interests of quality services, integrated public transport and to serve the needs of the travelling public.  My Department has received advice from the Attorney General which states that Government policy can be implemented through the existing legislation and that the NTA is not precluded from entering into a further direct award contract with the two bus companies at the end of 2019.</p>  <p>  At the LRC discussion concluded on the 14th  May last to address Trade Union concerns on these matters, my Department committed to identifying how best to build confidence in the scope of the legislation, taking account of requirements of EU law and considering the views that have been expressed by the Unions. This process will be completed by the end of 2015 and will inform any actions that may be required to ensure that Government policy is implemented as intended. Appropriate clarification will be provided to the relevant parties upon completion of this process.</p></reply>

It will not prescribe the model of transfer but instead will allow for the most appropriate model of governance to be chosen in respect of each individual company.  The two possible models of transfer provided in the Bill are:  <blockquote>1.  Retention of the existing company structure and transfer of the Ministerial shareholding in the company to the local authority; or<br /><br />2.  Dissolution of the existing company structure and transfer of all assets, liabilities and employees into local authority structures, where the port will be administered as a functional area of the local authority. </blockquote>The manner of transfer selected in each case will be the one that finds broad consensus and agreement between the parties. </p><p>Dun Laoghaire Harbour Company and Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council have established an engagement team to discuss the practical issues associated with the transfer and consultants have been appointed to undertake a due diligence process, with the funding support of the Department. This exercise may assist in the decision as to the most suitable model of transfer.  </p><p>It is important that a secure and acceptable plan is developed for the future of Dun Laoghaire.

Research also indicated that there was potential demand for charter services, whereby holidaymakers would charter a sailing vessel, with or without a skipper, for a day or a short number of days as part of a wider range of holiday experiences.  Infrastructural requirements focussed on sufficient, well serviced mooring facilities such as pontoons rather than on larger marinas.</p></reply>

Funding under the ATT programme is being provided under two rounds. Round 1 of the programme was successfully completed at the end of 2013 and a new funding round was launched in 2014.  9 towns were awarded funding under this round following a competitive process. Two small towns were selected (Birr and Claremorris) and seven medium/large towns were selected (Ennis, Cavan, Sligo, Tralee, Wexford, Thurles and Clonmel) to develop walking and cycling infrastructure and softer measures to support behavioural change. This programme is currently underway and will be completed at the end of next year. There are no immediate plans to fund new towns while this programme is underway.   It is anticipated however that the evaluation of the Smarter Travel Programmes, including the Active Travel town programme when completed, will inform future policy in this area and provide direction to where future investment in smarter travel should be focused to yield the best impact on modal shift from car to either walking or cycling.  </p></reply>

On the basis of this review I have decided to give approval for this project to proceed. This approval takes account of the important safety considerations which the Council wishes to address through the provision of a realigned road and new bridge at Cockhill. These safety considerations in respect of a critical access route to the Inishowen peninsula (which has a population of 43,000) are paramount in my decision to proceed with this project despite the on-going financial constraints.</p></reply>

The post office is seen as a key piece of financial and social infrastructure for both urban and rural areas.  Part of the strength of the post office brand, and one of its chief selling points, is that it reaches all parts of the country and can be accessed by anyone. It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focussed network of post offices in the community.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s continuing support for An Post is apparent, both in terms of the cost of postage services and the value of the contract for welfare payments.  In this regard, we anticipate this year that we will pay over &euro;50 million to An Post under a contract for cash payment services to welfare customers.  This contract is very substantial in terms of its reach, value and impact.  </p>  <p>  As you are aware my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Mr Alex White, T.D., formally launched the Post Office Network Business Development Group under the independent Chairmanship of Mr Bobby Kerr in February, 2015 to explore potential commercial opportunities available to the post office network.  I look forward to viewing the report from this Group.  </p>  <p>  I understand An Post is anxious to grow its existing levels of services in the light of emerging market pressures which extend beyond the delivery of welfare payments.  In this context I am pleased to note An Post has tendered for the provision of a new payment and transaction account.  I look forward to that becoming available in the not too distant future as it will provide alternative payment opportunities for my Department&rsquo;s customers. </p>  <p>  In order to recognise the general societal trend to electronic payments the Department has been changing some of its application forms.  The option to be paid at the post office remains on the forms. </p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the amendments do not remove the option to be paid at the post office. This option will remain on the forms.  Therefore, customers are free to opt to receive their payment at the post office if they wish. I also want to emphasise that the department continuously reviews its forms to ensure that they are amenable and relevant to all customers.  I have asked the Department to review forms and update them to ensure that a more neutral wording in relation to payment options is provided.  </p>  <p>  The Department is conscious of the important role of the post office around the country, not only in respect of social welfare payments but also in offering other financial services such as paying bills and carrying out a range of banking services.  The Government has consistently stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network as set out in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-17a.135.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015061700063#WRD03600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 52, 62, 64, 65, 66 and 67 together. </p><p>The rent supplement scheme provides support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. There are approximately 68,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015.  In Dublin, there are currently over 25,300 landlords in respect of over 25,400 tenancies supported by a rent supplement payment. A detailed breakdown of rent supplement recipient numbers by county and information on expenditure for 2014 and to date in 2015 is provided in the tabular statements.</p><p>All prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, are finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties. In response to these difficulties, the Department has put in place a number of preventative measures to ensure that people at risk of homelessness or loss of their tenancy are supported under the rent supplement scheme where increased rental payments are required. The Department&rsquo;s preventative policy allows for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; individual accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework. Under this approach, each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis, and rents are being increased above prescribed limits throughout the country, as appropriate. Staff in the Community Welfare Service of the Department who administer the rent supplement scheme have a statutory discretionary power to award or increase a supplement for rental purposes, for example, when dealing with applicants who are risk of losing their tenancy. This flexible approach has already assisted over 2,100 rent supplement households nationwide to retain their rented accommodation through the payment of increased rent payments. The number of rent supplement recipients in Dublin who contacted the Department highlighting difficulties in securing properties is not maintained. However, a total of some 1,400 rent recipients in Dublin have been supported through increased rental payments.</p><p>A Tenancy Sustainment Protocol in conjunction with Threshold was introduced in the Dublin region and Cork city where supply is particularly acute. The primary objective of the Protocol is to ensure a speedy intervention to ensure that families and persons at immediate risk of losing their tenancy get rapid assistance.  Of the 2,100 households referred to above, almost 700 households in Dublin have been supported as a result of engagement under the Protocol and over 20 households in Cork City. </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s response to the current housing difficulties, including any extension of the Protocol, remains under review at this time to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided. The Department has also undertaken a communications campaign to ensure that persons in receipt of rent supplement worried about losing their home are provided with information on the supports available which includes issuing text messages to over 50,000 rent supplement recipients, issuing monthly tweets to Department followers, updating the website and the distribution of posters to Department Offices, Post Offices, Citizen Information Centres, MABs offices and Oireachtas members.</p><p>Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme. However, social welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement payment to a nominated payee such as a landlord on behalf of the tenant. This arrangement is entered at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the Department. Nominated payments are made under the rent supplement scheme in some 20% of cases. </p><p>The efficiency of the rent supplement scheme would be significantly affected if all payments were to be made directly to landlords, for the provision of short-term support. The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support by transferring responsibility for persons with long-term housing needs to the local authorities under the new Housing Assistance Payment Scheme (HAP). HAP is being designed so as to bring all of the social housing services provided by the State together under the local authority system and is currently being rolled out in selected local authority areas to over 2,200 households. Under HAP, the local authority pays the rent directly to the landlord.</p><p><b>Table 1: Rent Supplement Expenditure</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th><div>Cost &euro;000</div></th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td><div>338,3471</div></td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td><div>107,2022</div></td></tr></table></p><p>1. 2014 Revised Estimate</p><p>2.

It is a universal payment that is paid in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 16 years, or to the age of 18 who are in full-time education or who have a disability.  It is paid to over 615,000 families in respect of almost 1.2 million children, at a cost of &euro;1.9 billion. </p><p>The Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare examined the structure of child and family income support in Ireland.  The Group considered the means testing of child benefit would have considerable administrative consequences, as the scale of means testing would be greater than anything required by the current system.  Instead the Group recommended that child benefit should continue to be paid on a universal basis. </p><p>It is my intention to retain child benefit as a universal system to assist families with the cost of raising children.  A crucial element of a strong and sustainable welfare system is the principle that everybody contributes, and that the system is there in turn to support those contributors at key stages in their lives.  Child benefit is one of the few universal payments in the welfare system in that regard, and its universality has an important role to play in maintaining the sustainability of the system.</p><p>For that reason, child benefit was increased by &euro;5 a month, or &euro;60 per annum, from January 2015.  This recognises the sacrifices that families made during the economic crisis and the fact that families are continuing to face difficulties.  In the <i>Statement of Priorities</i>, the Government promised a new deal on living standards for hard-pressed families, and this increase is in line with that commitment. </p></reply>

People in receipt of the State pension may also engage in paid employment.</p>  <p>  There is no means test for the State pension (contributory), and so the personal rate applicable in respect of such a pension is not reduced by paid employment.</p>  <p>  The State pension (non-contributory) is means tested and takes into account both the income and assets of the claimant and his or her spouse or partner.  For this purpose, a formula is applied to the value of all applicable assets to determine a weekly means.  The weekly rate payable depends on the total weekly means, from both income and assets, of the person or couple.  The first &euro;30 of means is disregarded as part of the means test.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that there is no statutory retirement age in Ireland.  Responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer/employee relationship and the contract of employment.  As a result, people can retire before or after State pension age.  It is hoped that, where appropriate, workers will choose and be able to work to pension age (and beyond if that is their desire) and in such cases they will have a higher income than they would have from their pension alone.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-17a.177.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015061700065#WRF01800"><p>The price differential of fuel purchased north and south of the border is driven by a number of variable factors, exchange rates, taxes, reliefs and differing compositions of the products.  The exchange rate between the Euro and Sterling at any given point in time has a significant impact on the end price of solid fuel in both jurisdictions.  Since mid 2013 the sterling euro exchange rate has changed by over 14% in favour of Sterling. </p>  <p>  Taxes applied to solid fuels differ in both jurisdictions with different VAT rates in operation on both sides of the border, the VAT rate is 5% in the north and 13.5% in the south.  Since 2013 a carbon tax has been applied in Ireland while the UK apply a Climate Change Levy on non-domestic consumption of solid fuel.   </p>  <p>  With regard to the VAT rates, the UK can apply the 5% rate to coal and other fuels used for residential purposes on the basis that they had a zero VAT rate in place for those supplies on 1 January 1991.  This provision also allows Ireland to apply the zero VAT rate to certain foodstuffs, children's clothes and shoes, and certain medicines on the basis that the VAT rate in force on 1 January 1991 was zero.  However, it is not possible for Ireland to apply a zero rate or 5% rate to coal, as we did not apply a zero rate to coal on that date.  Nonetheless, as Ireland applied a reduced VAT rate to coal on 1 January 1991, this allows us to continue to apply a reduced rate to coal, but only where the rate is 12% or more. </p>  <p>  The introduction of Carbon Tax was about sending a price signal that there is a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment.  In this regard solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels.  As a result they are considered the dirtiest fuels and given the environmental impact it is important that they are taxed. </p>  <p>  The application of carbon tax to solid fuels was delayed to allow for the development of a robust mechanism to counter the large scale sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland where lower sulphur standards apply.  The Department of the Environment undertook to provide such a robust mechanism in conjunction with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI).  Such a mechanism is in place since June 2011 and the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 specify the environmental standards for coal placed on the market and provide the regulatory framework in relation to the distribution and sale of coal in the State.</p>  <p>  In particular, the Regulations require that all bituminous coal sold and used outside smoky coal ban areas for residential use must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%, which is lower than that in Northern Ireland and therefore bituminous coal supplied to Northern Ireland standards, for sale on that market, may not be sold in the State.  Compliance with the Regulations is being enforced by local authorities.  A verification mechanism, SWiFT 7, has been developed by the NSAI for the verification of sulphur content in coal.  This provides for a robust mechanism to verify the sulphur content of coal to national standards.  Suppliers who produce and supply solid fuels in contravention of the Regulations are subject to investigation and prosecution under the Air Pollution Act by local authorities charged with enforcing the regulations and preventing such supply.</p>  <p>  In the most recent cross border price comparison, which was carried out by the Revenue Commissioners in May 2015, petrol and diesel were significantly cheaper in the south whilst home heating oils were a fraction of a cent more expensive in the south.  Petrol was cheaper by 15 cent per litre and diesel was cheaper by 28 cent per litre in the south.  Kerosene was 0.16 cent more expensive per litre and home heating diesel was 0.02 cent more expensive per litre in the south.  Coal and peat are not among the products compared as part of this survey, however, this illustrates the price differentials that exist generally in fuel products.</p>  <p>  Coupled with the long lead in period to the implementation of carbon tax on solid fuels this Government has also provided, through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, generous grants via Better Energy Homes and also provides home energy upgrades free of charge to vulnerable households via Better Energy Warmer Homes to reduce dependence on combustion of fossil fuels for home heating.  In 2014 the Better Energy programme provided &euro;53m grant support towards &euro;118m energy upgrade works.</p>  <p>  These grants, together with the carbon tax, are key tools to reduce emissions towards meeting our climate change commitments.</p></reply>

To facilitate this, Government policy since 2011 has been focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources. </p><p>The Government understands the importance of the hotel and catering industry and have been supportive with measures such as the new 9% VAT rate, the Gathering Ireland 2013, the reduced 0% Air Travel Tax and the Visa Waiver.  In addition I extended the Employment and Investment Incentive to include hotels, guest houses and self-catering accommodation in recent Budgets.  </p><p>Recent CSO figures indicate that overseas trips to Ireland increased by 14.1% for the first quarter in 2015 while total tourism and travel earnings from overseas travellers to Ireland increased by 11.6% compared to the first quarter in 2014.</p><p>My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small and medium sized businesses, and the SME State Bodies Group, which includes representation from F&aacute;ilte Ireland, provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance.  </p><p>The following provides an overview of some other incentives introduced by Government to encourage access to credit for small business:</p><p>- The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been established to encourage small business, as an additional means of ensuring that SMEs are provided with sufficient access to credit, with increased flexibility such as loans of longer duration and loans with built-in payment holidays. SBCI loans are currently available through AIB and BOI and subsequent phases will see the SBCI supporting smaller, existing bank and non-bank funding providers and bringing in new participants to the Irish market.</p><p>- The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.  </p><p>- The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, was established under the Action Plan for Jobs and can provide loans of up to &euro;25,000 to small businesses who have been refused credit by commercial banks. Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices LEOs nationally to administer this fund.</p><p>- The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by either Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  The Ulster Bank have recently joined the Credit Review office on a non-statutory and voluntary basis.  The Credit Review Office also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Reviewer John Trethowan and his team have overturned 55% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.  Further details are available at </p><p>- With over &euro;2bn of Government supports available to small business in Ireland from over 20 Departments and Agencies, it is vital that SMEs can quickly access information on this range of supports available to them. With this in mind, the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014. On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at .</p><p>The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth. Consequently the Department of Finance, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit with a view to taking appropriate actions as warranted to ensure that SMEs in Ireland have the opportunity to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.  In this context, the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 includes a dedicated chapter and associated integrated set of actions to support the financing for growth in the SME sector.</p></reply>

All reliefs, including property related reliefs, are a cost to the exchequer and in a report on tax expenditures published by my Department last October I set out this Government's tax policy basis in relation to future tax expenditures. The Government will:</p><p>- Support economic growth by ensuring that any increase in taxation  be effected in the first instance by base broadening including through the elimination or curtailment of overly-generous, poorly targeted or otherwise unaffordable tax reliefs;</p><p>- Use tax reliefs only in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures and where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention;</p><p>- Time-limit all tax expenditures and subject those with higher costs to ex ante evaluation; and</p><p>- Conduct a regular programme of reviews of tax reliefs, engaging in public consultation as appropriate, and publish the results.</p><p>I propose to provide an analysis of the property reliefs under each Tax and Duty heading. Unless otherwise stated the figures relate to the year 2013.</p><p><b>Income Tax/Corporation Tax Reliefs</b></p><p>The following table is a list of the property based incentive schemes qualifying for capital allowances. It should be noted some of these figures are provisional. While the majority of these schemes have been terminated, (capital allowances have been retained for expenditure on hotels, holiday camps, holiday hostels, guest house and registered caravan and camping sites at a rate of 4% per annum over 25 years.) tax relief may continue to be claimed on expenditure incurred prior to the termination date in question.<table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>Number of Claimants</th><th>Tax Cost &euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>Urban Renewal</td><td>2,618</td><td>45.4</td></tr><tr><td>Town Renewal</td><td>739</td><td>10.6</td></tr><tr><td>Seaside Resort</td><td>272</td><td>2.1</td></tr><tr><td>Rural Renewal</td><td>2,098</td><td>17.9</td></tr><tr><td>Multi-storey car parks</td><td>57</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>Living Over the Shop</td><td>43</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Student Accommodation</td><td>522</td><td>11.5</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise  Areas</td><td>104</td><td>1.9</td></tr><tr><td>Park and Ride</td><td>19</td><td>0.7</td></tr><tr><td>Hotels</td><td>1,015</td><td>35.2</td></tr><tr><td>Holiday Cottages</td><td>572</td><td>11.0</td></tr><tr><td>Holiday Hostels</td><td>5</td><td>0.09</td></tr><tr><td>Guest Houses</td><td>6</td><td>0.07</td></tr><tr><td>Nursing Homes</td><td>411</td><td>10.7</td></tr><tr><td>Housing for the Elderly/Infirm</td><td>98</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>Convalescent Homes</td><td>12</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Qualifying Hospitals</td><td>357</td><td>9.2</td></tr><tr><td>Qualifying Mental Health Centres</td><td>*</td><td>*</td></tr><tr><td>Qualifying Sports Injury Clinics</td><td>81</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>Buildings used for certain Childcare Purposes</td><td>296</td><td>4.2</td></tr><tr><td>Buildings or structures in registered Caravan &amp;amp; Camping sites</td><td>* </td><td>*</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure Investment Scheme</td><td>*</td><td>*</td></tr></table>* is displayed in where the cost/number of claimants is negligible.</p><p>As statistics were not captured separately for Third Level Educational Buildings and the Countrywide Refurbishment Scheme (both now terminated) these have not been included.  Also not included are the ordinary industrial buildings e.g. mill/factory (4%), and airport runways/buildings (4%) as statistics are not captured separately for these either. </p><p><b>Home Renovation Incentive (HRI)</b></p><p>This scheme provides a tax relief by way of an income tax credit on repair, renovation or improvement works on principal private residences or rental property carried out by tax compliant contractors. In addition to providing an income tax relief, the HRI also aims to support tax compliance in the building industry by moving activity out of the shadow economy into the legitimate economy. </p><p>The year 2014 was the first full year in which the incentive operated. The incentive came into operation on 25 October 2013 and will run until 31 December 2015. Rental properties were brought within the scheme from 15 October 2014. </p><p>Since the introduction of the incentive, works on 21,722 properties have been notified to Revenue's HRI online system (as of 12 June 2015).  This represents more than &euro;458 million worth of works involving some 5,286 contractors.  The potential total cost to the Exchequer in respect of these properties is approximately &euro;31m. As a claim for the HRI credit can only be made in the year after works have been paid for, there was no cost to the Exchequer in 2014 (works paid for in the period from 25 October 2013 to 31 December 2013 were deemed to have been paid for in 2014).  The number of claims made in the period from 1 January 2015 to 12 June 2015 is 7,673, representing a total cost to the Exchequer of approximately &euro;14.69m.  This cost will be split evenly between 2015 and 2016.</p><p><b>Additional Income Tax Reliefs</b></p><p>Other property based reliefs include interest relief on loans to acquire a principal private residence, relief for rental payments on private tenancies (terminated for any new cases after 7 December 2010*) the rent-a-room relief and relief for expenditure on significant buildings or gardens. The cost of the reliefs and the number claiming the relief are set out on the attached table:<table><tr><th>Year 2013</th><th>Number of claimants</th><th>Cost &euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>Mortgage interest relief for PPRs</td><td>498,000</td><td>353.0</td></tr><tr><td>Rent paid for private tenancies</td><td>153,100</td><td>37.9</td></tr><tr><td>Rent-a-room relief</td><td>4,370</td><td>5.9</td></tr><tr><td>Expenditure on significant buildings or gardens</td><td>120</td><td>2.1</td></tr></table>*Individuals who were in receipt of the relief at 7 December 2010 may continue to claim it until 2017</p><p><b>Capital Gains Tax Reliefs</b></p><p>For the purpose of capital gains tax there are three significant property based reliefs, the property purchase incentive, the Principal Private Residence relief and the farm restructuring relief.</p><p><b>Property purchase incentive</b></p><p>This relief was introduced in the Finance Act 2012. The relief applies to properties purchased between 7 December 2011 and 31 December 2014. For the relief to apply, the property must be owned for a period of at least 7 years. The rationale for the relief was to encourage investment in Irish property at a time when the property market was at low ebb. </p><p><b>Principal Private Residence Relief</b></p><p>This relief is available for individuals disposing of a house which was occupied by them as their only or main residence. Full relief is given where the house has been so occupied for the entire period of ownership of the house apart from the last 12-month period which is deemed to be a period of occupation by the owner. Where the house has been occupied by an individual for part of the period of ownership, only the portion of the gain that corresponds to the period of occupation is exempt. The rationale for the relief is to ensure that the sale of a house, which will generally be replaced with another house, can be done on a tax-neutral basis.  </p><p><b>Farm restructuring relief</b></p><p>This relief was introduced in the Finance Act 2013. The relief applies where the first transaction in the restructuring - for example, the sale, purchase or exchange of landis carried out in the period commencing on 1 January 2013 and ending on 31 December 2016 and where the restructuring is completed within 24 months of that first transaction.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-17a.200.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015061700066#WRG01600"><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that &euro;356m was paid in respect of capital acquisitions tax for the year 2014. A breakdown of this total by gift tax, inheritance tax, probate tax and discretionary trust tax is available on the Revenue Commissioners' statistics website at . The most recent year for which this information is available is 2014 and updates will be published in due course. However, they are not in a position to provide the figure requested by Deputy Tuffy.  The source of their information on the value of inherited property are the returns that persons, who are liable for the payment of capital acquisitions tax (CAT), are required to make when property is transferred under a deceased person's will or intestacy. These returns do not contain information in respect of all such properties. There are a number of reasons for this.</p><p>In common with most other taxes, CAT operates on a self-assessment basis. Several of the tax exemptions that are available are taken on a self-assessment basis and the person who inherits the property is not required to submit a return to Revenue.  For example, information in respect of property transferring between spouses and civil partners, from deceased children to parents and to charitable bodies does not have to be submitted to Revenue as tax exemption is taken on a self-assessment basis. </p><p>The relationship between the deceased person and the person who inherits a property determines the maximum life-time aggregate tax-free threshold below which CAT is not charged. There are, in all, three separate relationship thresholds (set out below). The value of each of a person's inheritances since 5 December 1991 is aggregated and CAT is charged, where the aggregate value exceeds the relevant threshold, on any amount that exceeds the threshold. However, it is only where the value of property inherited by a beneficiary exceeds 80% of the relevant threshold (or the actual threshold) that a return has to be submitted to Revenue.</p><p><b>Group A: tax free threshold &euro;225,000 </b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the deceased person. This threshold also applies to parents where they inherit an absolute interest in a property from a child. </p><p><b>Group B: tax free threshold &euro;30,150 </b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, nephew, niece, lineal ancestor (for example, a grandparent) or lineal descendant of the deceased person.</p><p><b>Group C: tax free threshold &euro;15,075 </b>applies in all other cases, for example, from uncle to niece, between in-laws and persons with no relationship to each other. </p><p>Apart from the absence of the information requested by the Deputy, other considerations are also relevant. CAT is not an 'estate' tax in the sense that it does not apply to the value of a deceased person's entire estate. Rather, it is a tax on the value of property inherited by an individual beneficiary. This means that a high value property, if inherited jointly by several beneficiaries, may be below the individual tax-exempt thresholds for those beneficiaries and, therefore, not liable for the payment of CAT.  </p><p>Significant relief from the payment of CAT is available where farmland and other business property is inherited. Where certain conditions are met, for example, in relation to the use to which the farm/property is put following the inheritance, the market value of the farm/property may be reduced by 90% before CAT is charged.</p></reply>

While it is open to any taxpayer to seek an opinion from Revenue on the tax treatment of a particular transaction or activity, the circumstances in which a taxpayer should require an opinion from Revenue are relatively limited.  This is because Revenue already publishes extensive detailed information on the application of tax legislation in various tax briefings and guidelines which are available on the Revenue website. </p><p>An opinion will be provided by Revenue where the issues are complex, information is not readily available or there is genuine uncertainty in relation to the applicable tax rules as set down in the legislation.  An opinion will provide Revenue's view of the correct application of tax law to a particular transaction or situation so that the taxpayer can file a correct tax return as required under the legislation. </p><p>As statistics are not compiled on the number of tax opinions issued by Revenue each year, data on the number of opinions broken down between those issued to individual persons, small, medium and large enterprises, companies outside the jurisdiction and by type of transaction are not available.  However, I can inform the Deputy that, in responding to the European Commission enquiries in relation to tax ruling practice in the various Member States, Revenue identified that in the period 2010-2012 the total number of advance opinions issued to companies on various matters relating to corporation tax was as follows: </p><p>YearTotal</p><p>201099</p><p>2011128</p><p>2012108</p><p>In regard to transactions that may involve tax avoidance, the Revenue guidelines clearly state that Revenue will not provide an opinion where it is of the view that a proposed transaction is part of a scheme or arrangement the purpose of which or one of the purposes of which is the avoidance of tax.  While, in accordance with these guidelines, Revenue refuses to provide opinions whenever it considers transactions would facilitate tax avoidance, it does not record the number of such refusals. </p></reply>

As the Commission has acknowledged, Ireland has co-operated fully with the process to date and will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  For state aid to exist in this case, the company must have been charged less tax than should have been charged under Irish tax legislation.  As part of this formal investigation, the Commission wrote to Ireland to ask for our response to their concerns in relation to the particular case.  Ireland has responded to this letter, comprehensively addressing the Commission's concerns and making it clear that the appropriate amount of Irish tax was charged in accordance with the relevant legislation, that no selective advantage was given and that there was no state aid. </p>  <p>  This is a confidential matter between Ireland and the Commission and I am not in a position to comment on the specific details of our response as the matter is subject to a formal process of investigation and relates to a specific taxpayer.</p>  <p>  While it would not be appropriate to speculate on the outcome at this stage, I remain of the view that there was no breach of State aid rules in this case and that the legislative provisions were correctly applied. </p>  <p>  In the event that the Commission forms the view that there was state aid, as I and my colleagues in Government have already indicated Ireland will challenge this decision in the European Courts, to continue to vigorously defend the Irish position.</p></reply>

Ireland will only enter into bilateral APAs with its treaty partners.  As such, an APA involving Ireland will always involve two tax administrations, the other being a treaty partner country. </p>  <p>  Bilateral APAs are agreed in accordance with the mutual agreement procedure article of the relevant double taxation treaty. For all bilateral APAs, Revenue adheres to the detailed guidelines for concluding APAs which are contained in "Annex to Chapter IV: Advance Pricing Arrangements" of the TPG.  All of our bilateral APAs are negotiated on the basis of identifying an arm's length remuneration for the transactions covered by the APA and in each case the transfer pricing method applied will be in accordance with one of the methodologies contained in Chapter II of the TPG. </p>  <p>  In addition, when negotiating a bilateral APA with an EU Member State, Revenue will adhere to the best practices for the conduct of APA procedures which are set out in the Guidelines for Advance Pricing Agreements within the EU which have been published by the EU Joint Transfer Pricing Forum.</p></reply>

Other EU Member States have a similar confidentiality rule in relation to taxpayer information, so that taxpayers can be assured of strict confidence and trust in providing full information in their dealings with the tax authorities.  This assurance of confidentiality is subject to requirements to exchange information between tax authorities under bilateral and multilateral treaties and EU law. </p>  <p>  Because of the statutory requirement in relation to confidentiality of taxpayer information, details of tax opinions issued to taxpayers are not published by Revenue.  As Revenue opinions merely seek to apply the tax law to the particular facts and circumstances of a taxpayer, they are specific to the particular case and do not have general application.  However, where Revenue considers that the issue on which an opinion is given is likely to be of more general interest to taxpayers, it will publish a tax briefing or guidance note on the matter to ensure that taxpayers are fully informed of their entitlements and obligations under the tax system.  </p>  <p>  In March this year, the European Commission adopted a proposal to amend Council Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation to provide for mandatory automatic exchange of information between Member States in relation to advance cross-border tax rulings and advance pricing arrangements (APAs).  Although they are not referred to as rulings and are non-binding, Revenue opinions on the application of tax law to particular transactions or activities would come within the scope of the Directive if adopted by the Council. </p>  <p>  Ireland has welcomed the Commission proposal and officials of my Department and Revenue are participating in the discussions on this proposal that are currently taking place in the Council Working Group.  While the proposed Directive will require the tax authorities of Member States to share information on cross-border tax rulings and APAs, it does not provide for the publication of these and any information exchanged under the Directive will be protected by the confidentiality laws in the EU Member States that apply to taxpayer information.</p></reply>

Where a country makes an upward adjustment to a multinational company's profits then the relevant treaty partner country will typically make a matching downward adjustment to the multinational company's profits, to the extent that it accepts that the upward adjustment made by the other country was in accordance with the arm's length principle.  </p>  <p>   This bilateral, tax treaty-based, interaction addresses overstatements of profits by multinationals in one country as a corollary of examinations to identify and quantify understatements of profits in another country a multinational's profits will only be reduced in one country where they have been increased in another country. Transfer pricing law and practice does not provide for, or result in, unilateral downward adjustments to company profits, separate from matching adjustments under tax treaties, and it would be inappropriate to provide powers to unilaterally reduce the taxable profits of multinational companies.</p></reply>

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance. </p><p>For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold known as the &quot;Group threshold&quot; below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.</p><p>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.</p><p><b>The Group A tax free threshold of &euro;225,000, </b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.  Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p><p><b>The Group B tax free threshold of &euro;30,150, </b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p><p><b>The Group C tax free threshold &euro;15,075, </b>applies in all other cases.</p><p>Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold.In recent years these thresholds were reduced and the rate has been increased in order to maintain the yield from capital taxes in the face of falling asset prices and as part of our fiscal consolidation efforts.  In addition, taxes on certain capital are less harmful from an economic perspective than taxes on employment.</p><p>I am aware that property values have increased, with developments which had been restricted to the Dublin area now manifesting in other areas of the country, though not to the same extent in terms of price rises.  I recognise that this has a bearing on taxation of the inheritance and gifting of property with respect to CAT thresholds.  In this light, I will be keeping Capital Acquisitions Tax thresholds, rates and other aspects of the tax under review, particularly in the context of preparations for Budget 2016 and the consequent Finance Bill.</p></reply>

This process concluded last Friday 12 June 2015.  While this Directive provides less flexibility in transposition to Member States than the previous Directive governing the DGS, Article 13 provides some discretion for Member States on the calculation of contributions to the DGS where a lower level of contribution for low risk sectors which, if justified, could be put in place. In relation to the contribution amount, Question 6 in my Department's consultation paper specifically asks whether or not credit unions should be considered a low risk sector and thus qualify for a lower level of contribution, it also requests justification for the answer provided.  </p>  <p>  All submissions received by my Department will now be examined and the views therein considered carefully over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The charges are imposed to compensate the Exchequer for the late payment of funds and to ensure equity for the vast majority of taxpayers who pay on time.</p>  <p>  Revenue has also assured me that where possible, it always seeks to work with taxpayers that are experiencing temporary cash-flow difficulties in preference to deploying debt collection/ enforcement measures to secure outstanding taxes. However, such discussions require open and committed engagement to identify and agree mutually acceptable solutions.  Where there is no such engagement Revenue has no alternative but to use its debt collection/enforcement options.</p>  <p>  In regard to the specific case to which the Deputy refers, the person in question has already been facilitated with two separate phased payment arrangements to help him manage his tax liabilities. One of the arrangements included a full deferral of payment for a twelve month period, which is beyond the normal level of concession afforded by Revenue but was considered appropriate given the particular circumstances of the case.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately the person failed to adhere to the various payment arrangements provided to him and, as mentioned in his letter to the Deputy, also failed to keep Revenue informed of his situation. This lack of engagement left Revenue with no alternative but to refer the outstanding amount, including interest, to the Sheriff for collection. </p>  <p>  However, notwithstanding the previous failed arrangements Revenue is still willing to work with the person to agree a mutually satisfactory arrangement providing he makes every effort to adhere to the terms of any agreement and to keep the Collector-General informed of any subsequent difficulties that might arise.</p>  <p>  Revenue will now ask the Sheriff to put a hold on any further action for a brief period to allow discussions to take place and will also make direct contact with the person in the coming days in an attempt to agree a mutually acceptable solution.</p></reply>

It does not change the basic coverage level of &euro;100,000.</p>  <p>  The major changes that the Directive introduces are as follows:</p>  <p>  (i)  it introduces an added protection for what are known as temporary high balances for a period of between 3 and 12 months. These balances are   over and above the standard coverage level of &euro;100,000  and are designed to provide short-term protection, in circumstances  where a person deposits  money from for instance a real estate transaction.</p>  <p>  (ii) it will require that we change the nature of the  funding arrangements for the DGS. Currently, these are asset based in the form of ring-fenced deposits in the deposit protection account in the Central Bank which can be called upon to fund a compensation event for depositors. However, once the new arrangements are in place, banks and credit unions will have to pay contributions to the DGS which will be reflected as a cost  in their financial accounts.</p>  <p>  (iii)  it will not be possible to provide DGS coverage of up to &euro;100,000 for deposits held by credit unions with banks as is currently permitted.  The rationale for this is that credit unions are classified as credit institutions and Article 5(1) of the Directive excludes from any repayment by a DGS, deposits made by other credit institutions on their own behalf and for their own account.  </p>  <p>  (iv) a  reduction in the number of days that a DGS must pay out within, from 20 working days to 7 working days.  However, this is phased in over an 8 year period. </p>  <p>  In relation to the calculation of contributions  to the DGS (Article 13), the Directive provides that Member States may provide for lower contributions for low-risk sectors which are regulated under national law. As part of the transposition, I will give consideration as to whether credit unions can be so categorised. It should be noted that the Directive allows Member States up until 31 May 2016 to implement this Article and it is likely that we will avail of at least some of this extra time. </p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware  that I am giving consideration to legislating for maintaining the availability of the existing deposit protection account resources in the early years of the build-up of the new fund. The purpose of such an arrangement would be to  maintain the level of overall funds available for DGS purposes at an amount close to the existing arrangements. This matter is still the subject of legal advice and it is almost certain that if it is permissible, primary legislation will be required in order to achieve this objective.</p></reply>

The system is designed to operate on the basis that tenderers submit their most competitive bid in response to the specifications set out in an RFT.

This is the rationale that shapes the detailed rules (Directives) governing the regime.</p>  <p>  Public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts.  The criteria upon which contracting authorities may exclude applicants from the award procedure of public contracts are set out in Regulation 53 of SI 329 of 2006 European Communities (Award of Public Contracts) Regulations and Article 45 and Recitals (34) and (43) of 2004/18/EC, the EU Directive on the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts.  Before an applicant, in relation to certain breaches, is excluded the applicant may make a case and provide supporting evidence as to why it should not be excluded.  The contracting authority must consider this evidence before deciding whether to exclude or include an applicant.</p>  <p>  In qualifying for inclusion in tender competitions for public contracts, applicants must submit signed declarations stating that none of the circumstances outlined in Regulation 53 of SI 329 or Article 45 of 2004/18/EC apply.  </p>  <p>  Under the current regime and standard forms of contract, there are requirements in place for compliance with legal obligations.  For example Clause 2 of the standard form of the public works contracts requires the contractor, his personnel and sub-contractors to comply with all legal requirements.  </p>  <p>  There is a substantial body of legislation that directly or indirectly governs construction activities, however two key pieces of industry specific legislation; the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2013 and the Building Control Regulations 1997 2014 both place considerable responsibility, not only on contractors, but on all those involved in construction projects including designers, supervisors and individual workers. </p>  <p>  The ultimate sanction for serious breach of health and safety regulations is a criminal conviction and imprisonment.  Compliance with health and safety regulations is separately assessed in a pre-qualification of a works contractor with supporting evidence required to demonstrate the applicant possesses sufficient resources and is competent to carry out the proposed works.  The Works Requirements which are a key part of the contract documents also set out detailed specifications on how regulatory standards are to be met. </p>  <p>  Contractors are required to submit on-going certification under Clause 5.3 (Pay and Conditions of Employment) of the contract that they have complied in full with the requirements of that clause which covers aspects such as compliance with employment law, and deductions for social welfare.  Contractors are also required under this Clause to maintain records and timesheets in respect of all those engaged on the works.  </p>  <p>  The new EU rules comprise a suite of three Directives (Public Procurement, Utilities and Concessions) that repeal the existing rules governing the conduct of procurement across the EU but the basic architecture of EU procurement will remain intact.  The changes in the new regime were agreed principally to streamline the public procurement process and to put in place more simplified and flexible rules to reduce red tape and to make the procurement process more efficient. </p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is currently exploring policy choices as part of the transposition process.  One of the policy areas highlighted in the consultation document is adherence to "applicable obligations" in labour law. Each Member States has the choice on which appropriate measures to adopt to ensure compliance with this obligation as well as choices on the level of oversight down the subcontracting supply chain.  The OGP is currently exploring the appropriate measures to adopt and have sought views on this choice as part of the consultation process.  Clearly, a key objective in transposing these new provisions is to avoid imposing disproportionate administrative burden on contracting authorities and tenderers while at the same time adhering to applicable labour law obligations.  Getting the balance right will help to ensure value for money outcomes from procurement for the economy as a whole. </p></reply>

Any economic operator, defined as a person, or a group of persons, that carries out works, or supplies products or services, is entitled to tender for a public contract under EU Directive 2004/18/EC, transposed into Irish law by SI No 329 of 2006</p>  <p>  Economic operators applying for above EU threshold contracts are typically assessed against pre-qualification criteria to establish their ability to do the job by reference to their financial and economic standing, their technical and professional capacity, and their insurance levels.  Successful economic operators who progress to the award stage are assessed either in terms of the lowest price or the most economically advantageous tender (MEAT) to determine the best offer.  Establishing the levels of qualification criteria and award criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is a matter for the contracting authority concerned.  This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge what is appropriate relative to the needs of that specific contract.</p>  <p>  It is a basic principle of public procurement that a competitive process should be used unless there are justifiably exceptional circumstances and that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way.</p></reply>

Where this is not the case the following national procedures apply:</p>  <p> - supplies or services costing less than &euro;5,000 in value may be purchased on the basis of verbal quotes from one or more competing suppliers;</p>  <p> - contracts for supplies or services between &euro;5,000 and &euro;25,000 in value should be awarded on the basis of responses to specifications sent by fax or email to at least three suppliers or service providers.

I would point out however that under Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 10/14 buyers are requested to extend the use of the eTenders website to include tenders for low value purchases where possible.

The question of putting controls in place in these areas is a matter for the local management which in turn is subject to scrutiny by the internal and external audit functions of these bodies.</p></reply>

Public procurement in Ireland is complex, with different levels of procurement development, capabilities and systems across the public service.  To date, there have been no specific training requirements for those undertaking public tendering, although many staff have received training in procurement through various bodies such as IPA, IIPMM and DIT.  Many procurement staff also have academic qualifications in procurement or related fields such as engineering, law and  business.  As part of the procurement reform programme, the OGP is considering the nature of professional public procurement training and possible accreditation.  </p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement commenced sourcing operations in 2014 and, together with sector sourcing organisations, is taking responsibility for sourcing all goods and services on behalf of the public service.  In addition, the OGP has responsibility for procurement policy and procedures, sourcing systems and data analytics. </p>  <p>  Staff have been recruited into the OGP from across the Public Service, thereby concentrating and leveraging the public sector's procurement expertise.  In addition, the OGP is operating to common policies, processes and procedures.  This strengthening of procurement expertise will in turn provide Departments and Agencies with increased certainty and reduced risk by providing them with compliant sourcing solutions.  </p>  <p>  To ensure a consistent approach to operations and an over-arching cohesive culture in an organisation consisting of people from diverse entities and backgrounds, the OGP has developed a learning and development strategy based upon a set of technical and behavioural competencies as well as a matrix of appropriate training interventions to address any gaps in these competencies.  </p>  <p>  Initial training has commenced and is aimed at equipping staff with the necessary skills and knowledge to work to a common standard in the following three core areas:</p>  <p> - Core Procurement &amp;amp; Category Management Training;</p>  <p> - Public Sector Procurement;</p>  <p> - Customer Service. </p></reply>

Specifically they are not allowed to use their official positions to benefit themselves or others with whom they have personal, family, business or other ties or seek to influence decisions on matters pertaining to their official positions.  They are not permitted to negotiate or arbitrate in any matter affecting a Government contract or the purchase from or sale of goods to the State where, in their private capacities, they are interested either as principals or as shareholders in a company being one of the principals in the matter under consideration. </p>  <p>  I would also point out that the standard procurement template documents (RFTs and Contracts) on the Government's eTenders website require tenderers, individual employees, or agents or subcontractors of a tenderer to fully disclose any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest as soon as it becomes apparent.  Failure to do so may result in elimination from a competition or termination of a contract.</p>  <p>  In relation to a central register, under the Ethics in Public Office Acts 1995 and 2001 all persons who occupy or occupied a "designated position" of employment in a public body are required to furnish an annual statement of interests disclosing any interest held by the person and any interests held, to the person's actual knowledge, by his or her spouse or civil partner, a child of the person, or a child of a spouse, which could materially influence the person in or in relation to the performance of his or her official functions.  In the public service all positions at Principal Officer level are prescribed as designated positions of employment.  In the case of the Office of Government Procurement all posts are designated for the purposes of the Ethics Acts. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, it is very important that the public procurement function is discharged with probity, transparency and accountability and in a manner that secures best value for public money.  Procurement practices are subject to audit and scrutiny under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 and Accounting Officers are publicly accountable for expenditure incurred.  If the Deputy has any concerns or information regarding potential ethical breaches, I would encourage you to raise the matter with the relevant contracting authority or enforcement body.</p></reply>

This is the rationale that shapes the detailed rules (Directives) governing the regime. </p>  <p>  The enforcement of employment and health &amp;amp; safety legislation apply equally to public and private sector contracts.  Consequently, it is not for me as Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform to set out a separate policy for public sector contracts.  My colleague Mr Richard Bruton TD, Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has overall policy responsibility for employment rights and the area of health and safety in the workplace.  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) is responsible for enforcing minimum statutory employment rights and entitlements in the State and, in undertaking that role, carries out a range of functions including the provision of employment rights information and the inspection of employment related records.  NERA operates a system of risk based inspections in sectors where there are identifiable risks.  Inspections are also carried out in response to complaints received and routine inspections are undertaken as a control measure.  It is a condition of any contract entered into by a public authority with a private sector entity (other than for operations that may reasonably be considered as small scale) that the entity is required to provide access to certain information.  This information may assist the authority to assess compliance with employment legislation consistent with the requirements of EU and national law.  While the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) has overall responsibility for the administration and enforcement of health and safety at work in this jurisdiction.  The HSA monitors compliance with legislation at the workplace and can take enforcement action up to and including prosecutions.</p>  <p>  Public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts.  The criteria upon which contracting authorities may exclude applicants from the award procedure of public contracts are set out in Regulation 53 of SI 329 of 2006 European Communities (Award of Public Contracts) Regulations 2006 and Article 45 and Recitals (34) and (43) of 2004/18/EC, the EU Directive on the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts.  Before an applicant, in relation to certain breaches is excluded, the applicant may make a case and provide supporting evidence as to why it should not be excluded.  The contracting authority must consider this evidence before deciding whether to exclude or include an applicant.</p>  <p>  In qualifying for inclusion in tender competitions for public contracts, applicants must submit signed declarations stating that none of the circumstances outlined in Regulation 53 of SI 329 or Article 45 of 2004/18/EC apply.  The OGP has made provision within its standard template suite of tender and contract documentation to address situations where breach of employment or health and safety (or other relevant) legislation comes to its attention in the context of contract administration.  Discharge of fees is subject to compliance with terms and conditions of contract which includes legislative compliance.  Similarly material breach of such terms may trigger a right of termination.</p></reply>

The service is designed to give an informal outlet for potential suppliers to raise concerns in relation to a particular live tender process.  The pilot covers all procurement processes carried out by the OGP or other public sector contracting body (excluding the commercial semi-state bodies) and will be subject to review after the first twelve months. </p>  <p>  The objectives of the initiative are to improve communications with suppliers and increase professionalism and consistency in how procurement processes are carried out across the public service.  Engagement with the service in no way impedes the rights of individuals to pursue their rights formally under the Remedies legislation.</p>  <p>  Under EU and National rules, contracting authorities are responsible for their own decisions relating to the tendering process.  However, in the interests of best practice the contracting authority should comply with any suggestion made by this service. </p>  <p>  Parties who engage with TAS or undertake a judicial review against a contracting authority in respect of a particular tender competition should not be disadvantaged when competing in subsequent public procurement completions.  To do so would be in contravention of national and EU rules which seek to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime.  Contracting Authorities cannot favour or discriminate against particular candidates and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. Contracting authorities are responsible for establishing arrangements for ensuring the proper conduct of their affairs, including conformance to standards of good governance and accountability with regard to procurement.</p></reply>

I understand that officials in that Department have worked with a broad range of stakeholders to ensure the industry was aware of, and prepared for, the implementation of the Construction Products Regulation in Ireland.  I also understand that a significant number of steel fabricators operating in the State have already established the systems necessary to comply with their obligations under the Construction Products Regulation and, more specifically, the requirements of I.S. EN 1090-1.  D/ECLG remains committed to working with all stakeholders in order to continue to raise awareness and facilitate the implementation of the Construction Products Regulation in Ireland. </p><p>With regard to your specific question concerning the educational/training courses provided by SOLAS for steel fabricators to meet the requirements of I.S. EN 1090-1, the programmes provided by SOLAS and the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) are primarily targeted at unemployed people who are generally referred to programmes by the Department of Social Protection.  I understand that the ETBs in Cork, Dundalk, Galway, Shannon, Tralee and Waterford provide metal fabrication apprenticeship training, which incorporates elements of certification training. </p><p>Skillnets, on the other hand, is funded from the National Training Fund through the Department of Education and Skills and funds groups of companies in the same region/sector, and with similar training needs, through training networks that deliver subsidised training to Irish businesses.  It may therefore be beneficial for steel fabricator companies to explore what economies of scale might be achieved for companies seeking the same upskilling in the same area.  There are no subsidies or grants available or envisaged to meet the requirements of the CPR or I.S. EN 1090-1.</p><p>The role of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) is to provide information to small and micro firms and to signpost them to relevant agencies/bodies for training and certification.  The provision of the specialist technical training required to achieve certification to an International or European Standard, such as that required by steel fabricators in this instance, is outside of the remit of the LEO services.  However, to date, the LEOs - in conjunction with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) - have provided five general awareness/information seminars on the topic at various venues around the country. </p><p>In view of the NSAI&rsquo;s final certification role, and given the roles and responsibilities of other Departments and agencies, my Department has discussed the requirements of the CPR with the relevant Departments and agencies i.e. Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Department of Education and Skills, the LEOs and the NSAI.  Based on the information provided, my Department has devised a step-by-step guide on the current training provision in the public education sector.  The guide is available on my Department&rsquo;s website under &lsquo;Latest Publications/Notices&rsquo; and has been distributed to the LEO network and to the relevant Departments for uploading on their websites. </p><p>The guide is tailored for those steel fabricator firms affected by the two key areas requiring action i.e. Responsible Welding Coordinator (RWC) and Factory Production Control (FPC) under Execution Class 2 (commercial and residential buildings).  Further courses can be provided depending on the level of demand from firms.  In relation to FPC training, this is only available through consultants.  However, as part of their information provision and advisory role, the LEOs may be able to organise group training between firms and consultants.  Firms should enquire about this through their local LEO office. In addition, the newly-formed Irish Association of Steel Fabricators has a website with useful information in relation to the CPR requirements including weld testing to meet the I.S. EN 1090-1 requirements.</p><p>NSAI has undertaken the accreditation requirements to enable it to act as a notified body under the CPR.

The Action Plan for Jobs set a target to increase employment by 100,000 by 2016 and this target was achieved 21 months ahead of the target. Much work remains to be done however to replace all the jobs lost in the downturn, and we are determined as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs and the Spring Economic Statement to have 2.1 million at work by 2018 and to get the unemployment rate below 8 per cent.</p><p>Our focus will continue to be on ensuring that there are rewarding employment opportunities for all those who lost their jobs during the recession and for those new to the labour market in to the future. Each quarterly progress report published on my Department&rsquo;s website of the Action Plan for Jobs contains within its commentary section an update on employment data. This year we have also embedded a new assessment framework, which will improve monitoring associated with our employment policies. This is in response to a suggestion by the OECD that one area of improvement for APJ was to more clearly link actions to outcomes. </p><p>It is important to record that over 104,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>in 2012. In the case of Dublin, the unemployment rate has been brought down from 13.2% in the first Quarter of 2012 to 8.8% in the first Quarter of 2015 and there were 584,900 at work in the Dublin region, an increase of 43,400 since 2012. </p><p>My Department, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices work closely with the Department of Social Protection to provide opportunities for all those seeking employment in Dublin, including graduates. According to the HEA publication &ldquo;What do graduates do &ndash; the Class of 2013&rdquo; (published Dec 2014), Dublin is the Region with the most employment opportunities for graduates across all levels of qualifications with 34% Honours Bachelor Degree, 32% of Higher Diploma, 27% of Graduate Diploma, 43% of Taught masters, 37% Research Masters and 32% of Doctorates employed in the Region. One third of the population live in Dublin.</p><p>Overall the HEA data indicates that in 2013 the proportion of university graduates with an Honours Bachelor Degree seeking employment after nine months of graduation was 6%. Similarly, the proportion of graduates with a Higher &amp;amp; Postgraduate Diploma seeking employment after 9 months was 9%, while for Masters/Doctorates holders the proportion seeking employment 9 months after graduation was 11%. Our aim is to further increase job vacancies especially for new entrants to the labour market.</p></reply>

This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU.  A study commissioned by my Department estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole. It suggests growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1% and increase in real wages of 1.5%. It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs.</p><p>The last formal round of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations, which was the ninth since negotiations began in 2013, took place in New York during the week beginning 20 April, 2015.  The tenth formal round is scheduled to take place in Brussels during the week beginning 13 July, 2015. Work has advanced in all three pillars of the negotiations, namely, market access, regulatory cooperation and rules. </p><p>One of the general principles set out in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating mandate is the objective to take into account the particular challenges faced by small and medium-sized enterprises in contributing to the development of trade and investment.  TTIP will include a specific chapter on SMEs which is aimed at making the terms of TTIP more accessible by providing information which in turn will help to identify opportunities to trade and invest.  </p><p>Insofar as negotiations on investment is concerned, the stated aim of EU&rsquo;s negotiating mandate is to negotiate investment liberalisation and protection provisions on the basis of the highest levels of liberalisation and highest standards of protection that both sides have negotiated to date.  The mandate makes it clear that the ultimately, the decision to include investment protection and ISDS in TTIP will depend on EU interests being met and on the final balance of the Agreement.  Negotiations on investment protection including ISDS are on hold pending further work being undertaken by the EU Commission.</p><p>The EU&rsquo;s aim is to overhaul investment protection provisions and the ISDS in international agreements, learning from experience of others under existing agreements globally.  Significant progress in this regard has already been made under the EU-Canada (CETA) free trade and investment agreement.  The Commission&rsquo;s Concept Paper on reforming ISDS &ldquo;<i>Investment in TTIP and beyond &ndash; the path for reform</i>&rdquo;, builds on this progress and sets out ideas to further improve four key issues, namely, Governments&rsquo; right to regulate, establishment and functioning of tribunals, relationship between national judicial systems and an ISDS system, and an appellate mechanism.  </p><p>As regards accessibility of SMEs to arbitration, some of the improved provisions included in CETA were introduced with SMEs in mind and should provide the basis for similar provisions in TTIP.  These include specific provisions on mediation, to encourage an amicable solution between parties and avoid a longer and costlier formal arbitration process.  CETA also introduces the possibility of a sole arbitrator when both parties agree, which would reduce costs, and also introduces limits on the fees paid to arbitrators.  </p><p>I am open to considering proposals that can achieve a reasonable and workable arbitration system that is fair, transparent and efficient and addresses the shortcomings of historic models of investment arbitration which have given rise to concern.</p></reply>

These 100 jobs were created and are currently in situ. Any further announcement about its future is a matter for the company.</p>  <p>  So far this year IDA Ireland has announced four new projects for the Mid-West Region (Shannon and Limerick) with a job potential of over 600 people at full operation.  These companies are. Amax, Viagogo, Northern Trust and Dell.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query on new job announcements, 2014 was a record year for IDA Ireland with 197 investments being secured for Ireland and 15,012 gross new jobs being created in IDA Ireland client companies.  There was a notable rise in new name investments with 88 new name investments being secured in 2014.  For a variety of reasons many companies do not seek any publicity on proposed investments and many projects proceed without being publicly announced. During 2014, there were only 66 investment announcements, of which 38 were new projects with the balance being made up of expansion projects.</p>  <p>  In relation to expansion of the Irish &ndash;owned sector, it is noteworthy that client companies of Enterprise Ireland created 19,705 jobs in 2014, which represented a net increase of 8,476 people employed in EI supported companies, the highest net gain in the history of that Agency.</p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge the natural time lag between an announcement of an investment and the coming on stream of that project, which can be between 3 and 5 years in some cases.  That time is required for such activities as locating and acquiring a suitable site for the company&rsquo;s operations, constructing a facility, installing machinery, the recruitment and training of suitable staff and a natural developmental phase.</p>  <p>  Because of the time lag it is not possible to compare the numbers of jobs announced with the numbers of jobs created. In any given year the number of jobs created exceeds the number of jobs announced. Taking 2014 as an example, the IDA job announcements indicated a potential job creation figure in the region of 7,000 jobs whereas the actual number of new jobs created in IDA Ireland client companies in 2014 was in fact 15,012.</p>  <p>  The level of investments coming on stream is best measured by the number of new jobs created in any given year as recorded in the Annual Employment Survey carried out by my Department.</p></reply>

The Forum has met on 5 occasions, including in November last year when the stakeholders agreed to a broad range of outcomes which address issues of concern for the sector in areas such as weight and age specifications, the Quality Payment system, live exports and producer organisations.  The Forum allows stakeholders to engage in a positive way on strategic goals for the sector. As an example, the most recent meeting of the Forum held in February proposed the preparation of written guidelines for beef farmers which would act as a blueprint for those currently producing bull beef or those considering developing bull and other beef production systems, taking into account production efficiency and market dynamics. There was also general consensus at February&rsquo;s Forum meeting that good progress was being made in delivering on the outcomes agreed at the November meeting, accompanied by a commitment from all participants to continue this work.</p>  <p>  We have seen the benefits that the forum can bring with positive co-operation from all of the stakeholders. In order to build on the progress made, another meeting of the Beef Roundtable is scheduled and I expect to be able to confirm the date in the coming days. The meeting includes a discussion on Producer Organisations, and the current market situation, and I am finalising other elements of the agenda at present.</p></reply>

The animal was not presented for slaughter and did not enter the food or feed chain.  The case was identified through the ongoing surveillance system of my Department. This surveillance system is part of the overall control systems in place to protect the food and feed chain.  A series of confirmatory tests is now being undertaken and the final results will be available shortly. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s BSE surveillance and controls are effective and consistent with legal requirements and best international practice. These controls are applied at different stages along the feed and food supply chain, supplementing and reinforcing each other to ensure the safety of the food and feed chain. The effective and systematic application of these controls, in accordance with EU and OIE rules, means that beef and beef products may be safely traded internationally.</p><p>The OIE has this week stated that it very much respects the integrity and transparency demonstrated by Ireland in providing preliminary information on this suspect case. It further commends the commitment to the protection of animal and human health as demonstrated by the effectiveness of the ongoing BSE surveillance program and the controls in place that prevented any part of the animal from entering the human food or animal feed chain.</p><p>In accordance with normal procedure, cases of BSE are subject to a full epidemiological investigation. The investigation of this particular case is now underway and will be concluded as soon as possible. The birth cohorts - animals born and reared in the herd of birth, around the same time as the positive animal - and progeny of the infected animal have been traced and will be sent for destruction and tested as a precaution.</p><p>I am confident that the controls being applied by my Department are among the best in the world.<i>The record of Irish agriculture in producing beef and other products to such a high standard will continue to be important to us and the proven success of our control and monitoring regime will continue to enhance our reputation as one of the best food producers in the world.</i></p></reply>

However, I would urge anyone with any information, no matter how trivial it may seem, to pass this information on to the Garda&iacute; or to the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  I also understand that, last year, stakeholders had an opportunity to input their views on the operation of the section 40 of the Wildlife Acts as part of a consultation process initiated by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and that the formulation of future proposals is currently under consideration by a Working Group in the Minister's Department.</p></reply>

I believe that it would be in the best interests of all concerned that an independent element should now be brought into this part of the process.

That person will be able to independently vouch for the fact that the summaries of conclusions and the reasoning behind them are a fair reflection of the advice which has been made available to the Department.</p>  <p>  Retired High Court Judge Mr Justice Roderick Murphy has agreed to undertake this task. I believe that Mr Justice Murphy's involvement in the process will offer additional reassurance to those whose cases were considered by the Panel.

I am advised that Garda&iacute; make full use of the extensive range of legislation which is in place to address street crime and anti-social behaviour, including drug related crime.</p>  <p>  The Garda response to the particular issues raised forms part of the overall and ongoing implementation of the Dublin City Centre Policing Plan.  This involves a high-visibility uniformed presence on key thoroughfares, as well as the use of undercover Garda&iacute; as appropriate. A range of measures are in place to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour in the city centre.  These include Operation Spire, which provides for a high visibility policing presence specifically on O&rsquo;Connell Street at critical times to address anti-social behaviour, drug dealing and related crime.  The operation is designed as a preventative measure and the area is patrolled by uniform patrols supplemented as required by Crime Prevention Unit and Divisional Crime Task Force personnel.  Garda strategy is also supported by other operations including Operation Pier which focuses on the Pearse Street District, as well as Operation Viking and Operation Clean Streets which further target the sale and supply of illicit drugs in the city centre.</p>  <p>  I think it is generally accepted that the complex issues which contribute to drug addiction and related behaviours must be addressed in a coordinated and cross-cutting manner.  In response to the particular issues arising in Dublin City Centre a  multi-agency street outreach approach is being used to work with vulnerable and high-risk individuals and an offender management programme is being piloted to address repeat offending in the Dublin City area.  These measures, combined with the Government's initiatives to tackle homelessness, are helping to address the broader aspects of the problems referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware,  the Government's overall response to the problem of drug misuse generally, is set out in the National Drugs Strategy for the period 2009-2016. The Strategy provides a coordinated and comprehensive response founded on a partnership approach.</p>  <p>  The Strategy is being delivered under the stewardship of my colleague, Minister of State &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in at the Department of Health, in his capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy. The Strategy, the implementation of which is monitored by the Oversight Forum on Drugs Group chaired by Minister of State &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, adopts a pillar based approach to the problem involving the implementation of a wide range of measures across the five pillars of drug supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research. The Group includes representatives from the key Departments and agencies involved in the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy.</p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies continue to progress the actions assigned to the criminal justice sector under the National Strategy and to actively participate in all of the structures in place under the Strategy.</p></reply>

The objective was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation. The review concluded that a revised district and station network commensurate with the organisation resource base would best meet public demand.</p>  <p>  The Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme provides for effectiveness and efficiencies through a programme of restructuring and reconfiguration of the service delivery methods, concomitant with changes to work practices within the new rostering arrangements already introduced. In addition, I am advised by the Garda authorities that the closure of these Garda Stations has resulted in an additional 61,000 patrolling hours being made available to the communities right across the country.</p>  <p>  The deployment of resources is kept under review at all times by the Garda Commissioner to ensure that Garda resources continue to be used in the most efficient and appropriate way possible to target criminal activity at the local and national level.</p></reply>

Improvements were needed in the refinement and consistent application of some processes and definitions, particularly with respect to the appropriate diversion of cases to a local area pathway or for a case to be formally closed.</p>  <p>  Local area pathways involve working with parents to provide support focussed on protective factors for children, and family support to avail of universal services. I understand that the findings from the ongoing quality assurance work will be used to inform future business planning with my Department. In the Louth/Meath administrative area, Tusla has indicated that key aspects of the service were not at an acceptable standard. Currently, intervention measures, led by the Chief Operations Officer, are being taken to address this. This involves a comprehensive action plan and the reinforcing of the management structures in line with the service delivery model.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that an inspection by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) on services in the Louth/Meath administrative area has taken place.  I understand that publication of this report, in line with HIQA's procedures, is expected in the near future.  I will refrain from further comment until the report has been published, other than to say that I have been advised that the interventions needed to support and progress service improvements, referred to in the associated action plan, are well under way.</p></reply>

From the information provided it was estimated in 2012 that around 1,500 women had undergone a symphysiotomy in Ireland between 1944 and 1984, but of that number only 350 were still alive.  The Scheme commenced on 10 November, 2014 and 577 applications were made to the Assessor for the Scheme, former High Court Judge Maureen Harding Clark.</p>  <p>  The Terms of the Scheme included at Section 38 that "the right to seek payment under the terms of the Scheme is personal to the Applicant and is therefore contingent on the Applicant being alive to accept the offer of any award. If therefore, an Applicant dies at any time after application and before she has accepted an award, the claim shall lapse and the Applicant&rsquo;s estate and her spouse and/or members of her family shall not be entitled to any award or payment under this Scheme."</p>  <p>  Regrettably, as the woman concerned was deceased prior to the commencement of the Scheme in November, 2014, the Scheme is not applicable to her case.</p></reply>

This has been in operation since 2010. Its main objective is to provide the best value, safe care for all people with epilepsy in the right place, at the right time by sharing the best available information.</p>  <p>  Under the first recommendation of the resolution, the NCPE has a specific remit to describe models of care and formulate guidelines, where necessary, which aim to improve quality, access and value of clinical care. An advisory group of medical, nursing, technical and patient experts was convened with a remit to define a Model of Care for epilepsy. Consensus was rapidly agreed based on best international practice on the need to define centres of expertise nationally, to invest in nurse specialists and electronic communication, and to standardise procedures in epilepsy care. The NCPE has supported the implementation of this policy position with over 30 new Whole Time Equivalents (WTEs) in 6 defined national centres. The Model of Care has been signed off by the National Clinical Lead and Clinical Advisory Group and is being prepared for submission to the HSE Office of the National Director for Clinical Strategy and Programmes.</p>  <p>  The NCPE has also developed and supported the implementation of an Electronic Patient Record; this promotes patient safety by supporting the availability of current, accurate patient information to clinicians involved in patient care.  In addition, a suite of over 40 guidance documents (SOPs) have been developed by the NCPE. These look at the management of persons with Epilepsy across the care continuum from initial presentation, specialised treatment (including surgery) and to long-term management in primary care.</p>  <p>  A detailed SOP has also been developed for the management of women with epilepsy, which includes family planning, pregnancy, delivery right through to menopause. This was completed in conjunction with the National Clinical Programme for Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Three Primary Care SOPs have also been developed in conjunction with the National Clinical Programme for Primary Care to cover the critical areas of managing seizures in the community, the process of referral to specialised services and the intelligent support process for managing Epilepsy in primary care. The NCPE also contributes to the National Medicines Liaison Centre collaborative and GP bulletins with information relating to the management of Epilepsy in the Community.</p>  <p>  Under the second recommendation of the WHO resolution, the NCPE's Model of Care for Epilepsy advocates self management. Epilepsy specific self-management programmes, such as Epilepsy Ireland&rsquo;s STEPS programme (Support &amp;amp; Training in Epilepsy Self-management) and the &lsquo;Training for Success&rsquo; initiative run at the Sligo Institute of Technology, address more condition-specific issues such as living with Epilepsy; managing seizure triggers; lifestyle and safety; and understanding the impact of diet, exercise and sleep. The NCPE also supports the development of transitional programmes that support adolescents with epilepsy transition from paediatric services to adult services. Included in successful transition is the development of self-management and self-awareness skills to enable the young adult to take more responsibility for the management of their condition.</p>  <p>  For the third recommendation of the WHO resolution, the NCPE has a close working relationship with Epilepsy Ireland. The programme regularly contributes to the Epilepsy Ireland newsletter and various national and regional conferences with updated information on developments within the programme.</p>  <p>  Finally, on the question of research as per the fourth recommendation of the resolution, long-standing links with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland Genetics group has resulted in senior participation in the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) genetics consortium; this has been making important discoveries that will impact on diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy in the future.  In this regard, significant advances on epilepsy research capacity has been made in Ireland.  Furthermore, clinicians and researchers associated with the NCPE have been regular recipients of Health Research Board sponsored research grants. Other examples of research projects underway in Ireland include:</p>  <p>- Improving our understanding of the gene-based regulation of neuronal cell death and hippocampal remodelling in epilepsy</p>  <p>- European collaborative project called EpimiRNA which aims to understand molecular mechanisms, diagnostics and develop novel therapeutics for epilepsy</p>  <p>- Research group focused on identifying genetic predictors of the development and treatment of epilepsy</p>  <p>- A study on children with undiagnosed early onset epileptic encephalopathy.</p></reply>

The nursing home public and private sectors are collaborating with the Department of Health and the HSE in sourcing several solutions to meeting the issues arising in relation to nurse recruitment and retention.</p>  <p>  Currently, there are two areas under active review in relation to these recruitment and retention issues. Firstly, there is the issue of recruitment of nurses educated and trained in Ireland. The HSE Office of the Nursing and Midwifery Services Director has been supportive in allowing the nursing home sector meet with graduate students in the universities, to discuss employment opportunities. In addition, the Chief Nursing Office in the Department has been engaged with, the public and private nursing home sector in promoting nursing in the older adult as a career choice. The Office has facilitated ongoing discussions, spoken at conferences and engaged with 3rd level universities on seeking solutions to the recruitment and retention issue. These discussions have involved exploring and reviewing career pathways within older people services to encourage more staff into this area of nursing practice.</p>  <p>  The second area under review relates to the undertaking of initiatives for the recruitment of global nurses. The background to this issue is that nurses who trained in a country outside of Ireland and wish to work in Ireland are required to apply to register as a nurse with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland. The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, following assessment of qualifications by an applicant, may require an applicant to undertake a six to twelve week period of adaptation and assessment. A period of adaptation is designed to make up for differences in education and ensure competence for working in the Irish health service. If this adaptation is required it must be successfully completed as a pre-requisite to registration.</p>  <p>  A collaborative group including Department of Health, HSE and Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI) representatives continue to explore options to facilitate adaptation. In this regard some hospitals will respond to local need from local nursing homes, and this has been encouraged within the hospital group structures; some hospitals will continue to support placements pending funding from NHI though not at peak undergraduate student times; and, some are withdrawing from the provision of clinical placements to facilitate their own internal international recruitment initiatives.</p>  <p>  In addition, options are being explored with an Irish university to offer a one-day programme of assessment through an examination format. It is hoped that the pilot of this programme will be complete and results available in the last quarter of 2015.</p></reply>

In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE, through the National Contact Point (NCP) office, provides information for patients on the Cross-Border Directive on its website -  - and also by phone. The principal function of the NCP (which is the mechanism specified under the Directive for the dissemination of information on the Directive by Member States) is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements. The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the right to healthcare, if any, that they may have through the European legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (EU Regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them. The NCP is able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State.</p><p>The healthcare being sought under the CBD can only be healthcare that a person would be entitled to within the public health system in Ireland, which is not contrary to Irish legislation. Referral for care under the CBD can be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other HSE clinicians. It will be a matter for the patient and his/her referring doctor to identify the clinician abroad and satisfy him/herself in relation to the qualifications, quality and safety of the services being availed of in the other jurisdiction.</p><p>Prior authorisation may be required from the HSE for certain healthcare. This requires completion of an application process; consequently patients intending to access care under the CBD should check with the HSE in advance of travelling. The costs must be borne by the individual and he/she then will seek reimbursement for the cost of the healthcare upon return to Ireland. The HSE will reimburse the patient for care which meets the terms of the CBD in line with the Directive. Costs will only be reimbursed up to the level that would have been arisen if the healthcare had been provided in Ireland or the actual cost of the healthcare in the other member state, whichever is the lesser. All other costs associated with accessing care abroad under the CBD are a matter for the patient and will not be reimbursable by the HSE.</p></reply>

This is not surprising given the age and structure of many of our public nursing homes.   Compliance issues are in the main related to physical infrastructure and to issues such as personal space and privacy  and access to toilet facilities.  It is important to stress that the care provided to residents of these facilities is of a generally high standard. </p>  <p>  Discussions are ongoing between the Health Service Executive (HSE) and HIQA in this context.   Addressing these issues will require prioritisation across facilities within the overall resources that can be made available.</p></reply>

One aspect of that resolution was a request for an investigation by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights into alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka. A report of that investigation is due to be presented at the UN Human Rights Council in September 2015.</p>  <p>  There has been a change in Government in Sri Lanka following the presidential election in January 2015, and I welcome the stated commitments by the new President,  Maithripala, to re-establish democracy, freedom, good governance and respect for human rights.</p>  <p>  Our Ambassador to Sri Lanka (who is based in New Delhi) maintains regular contact with the Sri Lankan authorities and regularly visits Sri Lanka for discussions there. Our Embassy in New Delhi monitors developments in Sri Lanka on an ongoing basis. Through the Embassy, we are in regular contact with the EU Delegation in Colombo which reports that the new Government have already taken some positive steps to deal with resettlement issues, including returning some military land (used for commercial purposes), nomination of a civilian governor in the Northern Province, cancelling the foreign travel restrictions in the North and welcoming Tamil refugees from India.</p>  <p>  At the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union in Brussels on 9 February 2015, which I attended, the Council agreed a number of conclusions on EU priorities at UN Human Rights Fora in 2015. With regard to Sri Lanka, the Council welcomed the commitments by the new Sri Lankan Government on rule of law and reconciliation, while encouraging the new Government to work with the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights and the UN Human Rights Council to address ongoing human rights concerns and make credible domestic progress on reconciliation. </p>  <p>  A meeting of the EU-Sri Lanka Joint Commission took place in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 2 April 2015. The Joint Commission, which oversees the EU-Sri Lanka Cooperation Agreement on Partnership and Development (in place for 20 years) deals with a broad range of bilateral and multilateral issues of mutual interest. At this meeting, it was agreed in principle to establish a new Working Group on Governance, Rule of Law and Human Rights, to allow for a dialogue on these issues.</p></reply>

Since my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have strongly advocated for a stronger EU involvement in the Peace Process. I visited the region myself and urged HRVP Mogherini to do so upon her appointment.  She has visited the region on a number of occasions, most recently with the newly appointed EU Special Representative, Fernando Gentilini.</p>  <p>  There was some discussion of the Middle East Peace Process at the last Foreign Affairs Council and I expect HRVP Mogherini to brief Ministers on her recent visit with SR Gentilini at this month&rsquo;s FAC.</p>  <p>  I endeavour to use all appropriate opportunities in my international engagements as Minister to press for progress in restarting peace talks in the region.

This funding will be used to provide 1,700 additional teachers and SNAs for our schools, as well as to fund prioritised reforms, such as implementation of the literacy and numeracy strategy, reform of junior cycle, and the introduction of education focussed pre-school inspections.

In late 2010, my Department issued Circular 0063/2010 which updated and clarified the requirements for Garda vetting as part of recruitment procedures for all teaching and non-teaching positions. This circular also set out the vetting requirements of non-employees such as volunteers, sports coaches etc.  In relation to non-employees, the key criterion in determining whether a vetting requirement arises is whether the person will have or may have unsupervised access to children in the school. This would not normally be the case in the case of board of management members or persons employed by the bodies referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The existing Garda vetting arrangements for the recognised schools sector operate on a non-statutory basis.  However, the Deputy will be aware that the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, will, when commenced, put in place statutory requirements for vetting of persons involved in working with children and vulnerable adults, including those working in schools.</p></reply>

A number of measures have been implemented to assist genuine students affected by the closure.  The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of the Department of Justice and Equality acted swiftly to assure the immigration status of affected students.  All current immigration permissions are being fully honoured by the immigration service.  </p><p>  In addition, any student who arrives at a port of entry with a valid visa or letter of enrolment for MEC issued prior to 1st May 2015 is being permitted to land.  This is to allow students to pursue the college for any refund owing to them and to allow them to make alternative arrangements to continue their studies as soon as they can.  For students who have not yet registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau, INIS is allowing those students up to the end of June 2015 to make alternative arrangements for study.</p><p>  While I have every sympathy for the genuine affected students who have lost money when this college closed, the relationship between students and private colleges is based on a private contract between the student and the provider.  However, it should be noted that the Task Force which I established jointly with the Minister for Justice and Equality to assist affected students has worked closely with the representative bodies of the high-quality private sector providers to develop solutions that could provide alternative courses at a significantly discounted rate for students impacted by the private college closures, including MEC, who were not covered by learner protection arrangements.  Other individual colleges and representative groups, such as the recently-formed Private College Network, have also made offers to accommodate impacted students.</p><p>  The new package of reforms to the student immigration system for international education being introduced by my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality includes a number of specific measures to protect international students including compulsory learner protection arrangements and a separate account facility to safeguard student advance payments.</p></reply>

The State Claims Agency is engaging with plaintiffs' solicitors to clarify the position in cases and to make settlement offers where appropriate.  In pursuing settlements, the State Claims Agency will be considering cases of school child sexual abuse where there was a prior complaint about the relevant teacher's sexual abuse to school authorities. The rationale for this approach is that these were the circumstances on which the European Court of Human Rights judgment was based.</p><p>  The position in relation to those cases that were not progressed for a number of reasons, including those which might have been discontinued after receiving letters from the State Claims Agency is that I asked the Agency to undertake a review to clarify the exact position as to whether the cases had been formally discontinued or not. The Agency has completed its review and my Department sought some clarification from the Agency.  I expect to be in a position to report to Government on this matter shortly at which time the Government will consider whether any measures will be taken in relation to these cases. </p><p>  There are a significant number of additional cases in which the State has either been joined as a party or notified of the intention to seek to join the State.  The State Claims Agency will be engaging with the Plaintiffs' solicitors involved in each of these cases having regard to the facts in each individual case.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Government initiated a review of current and planned child protection mechanisms in the school system to assess the extent to which issues identified in the ECHR Judgment have been addressed in the period since 1973.

The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities.  The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment.  HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.   </p>  <p>  Further to the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 28 July 2014, the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot commenced with effect from 15 September 2014 in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council.  HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils from 1 October 2014.  Subsequently, on 18 December 2014, Dublin City Council became part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households.  Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities.  The second phase of the HAP pilot has commenced with the HAP scheme becoming operational in Donegal County Council since 25 May 2015 and in Offaly County Council since 15 June 2015.  HAP will become operational in Carlow, Clare and Tipperary County Councils and Cork City Council from 29 June 2015.</p>  <p>  There are now over 2,200 households in receipt of HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot scheme, with 293 of these households accommodated in the Waterford City and County area.</p>  <p>  Section 43(2)(a) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 provides for the making of Regulations to prescribe the maximum rent limits for different household classes that will apply in each local authority where HAP has been commenced.  In prescribing these limits, household size and prevailing rents in the relevant areas are taken into consideration.  These limits are currently based on the rent supplement limits as set out by the Department of Social Protection, in advance of the introduction of a national differential rents framework for local authorities, as provided for under section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. </p>  <p>  The operation of the Rent Supplement scheme is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.  The Department of Social Protection published a review of the maximum rent limits under the Rent Supplement scheme on 27 March 2015 and this review is available on that Department&rsquo;s website.  In the context of the implementation of HAP, my Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection, and closely monitors data gathered by HAP pilot authorities in relation to this issue.  This data is important in the context of the further roll out of HAP and the maximum rent limits that may apply in local authorities where HAP is operating will be kept under review in this context.</p></reply>

However, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is currently funding a PhD study on contrails and their potential effect on climate as part of its STRIVE research programme.  The study titled Cloud cover and radiation balance changes over Ireland due to aircraft induced contrails is due to be completed later this year.   </p>  <p>  My Department has previously been informed by Met &Eacute;ireann that vapour trails are formed through the emission of exhaust gases from jet engines of aircraft in the upper troposphere and that the main component of these gases is water vapour.  Ambient air temperature at jet cruising altitudes is often below -500C.  Under these conditions, water vapour cools and condenses and the particles act as ice nuclei, leading to the production of ice crystals; these ice crystals are what are visible from the ground as a linear cloud of condensation. </p>  <p>  Depending upon atmospheric conditions, these vapour trails can rapidly dissipate or remain for some time, gradually spreading horizontally into an extensive thin cirrus cloud layer.  Water in the atmosphere commonly evaporates to become water vapour.  As a general rule, the drier the air the more effective this evaporation process will be. Under more humid conditions, there will be less effective evaporation and so contrails will generally last longer in more humid air.  Contrail formation is also influenced by wind speeds, with higher winds disrupting and breaking up contrail formation.   </p>  <p>  Contrails do not adversely impact ambient air quality in Ireland.  Met &Eacute;ireann advises that there is some evidence that contrails can influence climatology but they have little impact on day-to-day weather.  The purported reason for the former is that the contrails (or consequent cirrus cloud) will trap outgoing long-wave radiation, thus leading to warming in the atmosphere, and that this effect is greater than the reflection of short-wave radiation from the sun.    </p></reply>

A clear governance structure has been put in place, which Minister of State Paudie Coffey and I personally oversee, to ensure delivery of all actions. Dedicated groups have been established in Dublin and Cork with a lead role in driving increased delivery of social housing in these important areas.</p><p>In the context of the delivery of new social housing units, ambitious targets have been set for local authorities for the period 2015 &ndash; 2017 with the announcement on 1 April 2015 of over &euro;1.5 billion to be invested in a combination of building, purchase and leasing schemes, to accommodate 25% of those currently on the social housing waiting lists. Full details of the targets and provisional allocations for each local authority are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i>.</i></p><p>On 5 May 2015, I announced funding of &euro;312 million for the first tranche of the local authority direct-build social housing programme under the Strategy. This announcement covers over 100 separate housing projects, providing 1,700 units across all 31 local authorities and details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>Further announcements of new unit delivery under the Capital Assistance Scheme and the broader social housing investment programmes will be made in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>The implementation of HAP has been progressing at increased pace. There are now over 2,200 households in receipt of HAP across the country and by the end of June HAP will be available in 13 local authority areas including South Dublin with HAP available in respect of homeless households in all Dublin local authorities.</p><p>The dedicated Finance Working Group, with appropriate membership from within my own Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Housing Finance Agency, has commenced Work on Public Private Partnership proposals. Engagement between the NDFA is on-going and a site selection process is at an advanced stage.</p><p>Proposed legislative changes to Part V provisions have been set out in the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill 2015 which was published on 5 June. In future, the focus of Part V will be on the delivery of completed social housing units, with a requirement for up to 10% social housing in developments of 10 or more units. The Bill also proposes a more concerted focus on the delivery of completed Part V units instead of, for example, the making of cash payments instead, being discontinued.</p><p>Research into off-balance sheet and more sustainable forms of funding, including the development of a new Strategic Housing Fund, are also currently being assessed. A protocol was put in place in March 2015 under the auspices of the Finance Work Stream to facilitate individuals and entities seeking to engage with the State to provide investment for the delivery of social housing. A single point of contact for submitting proposals has been established - the Social Housing Proposals Clearing House Group - which operates through my Department, under the oversight of the Finance Work Stream. Interested parties are invited to contact the Clearing House at <i>newfundingmodels@environ.ie.</i></p><p>As part of the process, I held a conference in March 2015 entitled &lsquo;<i>Financing and Delivering Ireland&rsquo;s Social Housing Strategy</i>&rsquo; in Dublin. The conference was attended by more than two hundred domestic and overseas financiers and investors as well as developers, voluntary housing associations, local authorities, Government departments and public bodies. </p><p>The powers of local authorities to deal with anti-social behaviour and the repossession of local authority dwellings were significantly enhanced with the commencement of Part 2 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 13 April 2015.</p><p>It is recognised that the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>sets out ambitious targets for the delivery and reform of social housing and I am determined to see all the targets and measures fulfilled and implemented. </p></reply>

It estimates that 47% of total supply over the period is required across the Dublin Region. The Agency notes that 57% of all households in the Dublin region over this period will be for one and two persons, while a further 18% will be for three person households.</p><p>Analysis by the ESRI has estimated that, in coming years, increases in population will result in the formation of at least 20,000 new households each year, each requiring a separate dwelling.  In addition, a number of existing dwellings will disappear through redevelopment or dilapidation. The results suggest an on-going need for at least 25,000 new dwellings a year over the coming fifteen years.</p><p>In response to this projected demand, the Government&rsquo;s published <i>Construction 2020</i>in May 2014.  This strategy is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors to ensure that any critical bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting the forecasted residential demand are addressed.</p><p>A key action under <i>Construction 2020</i>is a commitment to put in place a National Framework for Housing Supply, ensuring a balanced approach in which the supply of housing is matched with projected demand, and in which emerging imbalances can be identified and rectified at an early stage.</p><p>A core aspect of the National Housing Framework is the analysis of supply and projected demand data, broken down on a national and local basis, with information on housing types and sizes a key feature.  This action also includes a commitment to publish an annual <i>National Statement of Projected Housing Supply and Demand</i>.  The Housing Agency, in consultation with my Department , is leading on delivery of this action and I expect the first of these Statements to be finalised in the coming weeks. On receipt of the final Statement, I will consider its contents, in the context of future housing policy development.</p><p>In terms of social housing need, the latest summary of social housing assessments, which was carried out as of 7 May 2013, showed that there were 89,872 households on local authority waiting lists at that date . The full 2013 results are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:</p><p><i>. </i></p><p>In addition, the Housing Agency carried out an analysis of the results of the 2013 summary of social housing assessments and on the basis of certain assumptions, and taking account of housing support mechanisms, including the progressive roll-out of HAP over the years ahead, identified a need for an additional 35,000 properties for social housing.</p><p>In this regard, the Government&rsquo;s <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>, published in November 2014 , targets the provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme.  This will address the needs of the 90,000 on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.</p><p>Moreover, i n order to ensure that the most up to date and comprehensive data is available relating to the numbers applying for social housing support, the Strategy includes a commitment to increase the regularity of the summary of social housing assessments by undertaking it on annual basis from 2016 onwards.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level.  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities; accordingly my Department does not fund any homeless services directly but provides funding to housing authorities towards the operational costs of homeless accommodation and related services under Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.  Under Section 10 funding arrangements, housing authorities must provide at least 10% of the cost of such services from their own resources.

Such interventions require EU clearance to ensure that the State&rsquo;s investment does not adversely distort competition.</p>  <p>  Under the former National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which expired in August 2014, some 58,000 premises availed of a basic broadband service from 3 Ireland.  The minimum specifications of the NBS mobile wireless service improved over the duration on the contract and with effect from October 2012 offered minimum download and upload speeds of 2.3Mbps and 1.4Mbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 18:1.  The NBS satellite service, which was utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, offered minimum download and upload speeds of 3.6Mbps and 384 kbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 48:1.  The total payments to 3 Ireland under the National Broadband Scheme between 2011 and 2014 were &euro;9.65m. </p>  <p>  With the completion of the NBS, Ireland achieved the first of the milestones set down in the EU&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe i.e a basic broadband service to be available to all citizens by 2013.  The focus is now on fast tracking the roll out of high speed services through the National Broadband Plan (NBP).  The Government&rsquo;s NBP intervention will ensure the availability of quality future proofed broadband services to all other parts of the country.</p>  <p>  This Plan aims to ensure that high speed broadband will be available to all citizens and businesses.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-17a.685.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015061700083#WRY01900"><p>The Government recognises that access to high quality, high speed broadband is important for businesses and households throughout Ireland and is critically aware of the issues raised by IBEC in the Midwest and Kerry region and elsewhere in Ireland.  The National Broadband Plan aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service.  This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>The proposed State intervention under the National Broadband Plan (NBP) represents a potentially very significant capital investment project for the State and the Government is firmly committed to delivering this investment, as evidenced in the National Broadband Plan itself and in the Programme for Government, the Action Plan for Jobs and the Statement of Government Priorities.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at <i>.</i>The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016.  The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention.  All premises within the AMBER areas will be included in the State's intervention.  The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises/home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention.  It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.</p><p>Eircom recently announced an investment that may address a further 300,000 premises with fibre-to-the-premises technology.  My Department will be rigorously examining the assurances from Eircom in relation to these new plans, which is a requirement for all operators, and will review how this impacts the proposed intervention area.  More generally, I can confirm that next generation broadband services have been rolled out to 123,474 premises to date in the Mid West and Kerry region comprising Limerick, Clare, Tipperary and Kerry with a further 56,073 premises expected to be served over the next 18 months.  The remaining 160,850 premises in the Mid West and Kerry Region are the target for the proposed State intervention under the National Broadband Plan. </p><p>Intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy for the AMBER area.  Following a public consultation process on the draft Intervention Strategy this summer, I hope to move to formal procurement phase towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders.  I expect the physical build of the network to begin in late 2016, and it will take 3-5 years to fully complete &ndash; depending on the details of the bid or bids selected.  This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government.  It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland such as those identified by the IBEC Midwest and Kerry Regional Executive.</p></reply>

As part of this strategy, a National Policy Position was published in April 2014 and a Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill is currently progressing through the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The National Policy Position clarifies the level of GHG mitigation ambition envisaged for Ireland and the  legislation sets out proposed statutory obligations in relation to the development of a National Mitigation Plan.  The Plan will incorporate four key sectors - electricity generation, the built environment, transport and agriculture.  These sectors will contribute to the commitment in the National Policy Position to achieve an aggregate emissions reduction of 80%  by 2050.  Similarly, the anticipated Effort Sharing Decision in respect of 2030 will provide for an aggregate reduction across these sectors.  There will not be a specific target for each sector individually.</p>  <p>  In relation to meeting standards, I presume the Deputy is referring to EU legislation that sets mandatory emission reduction targets for new cars.  This law requires that new cars must not emit more than an average of 130 grams of CO2 per kilometre by 2015.  By 2021, phased in from 2020, the fleet average to be achieved by all new cars is 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre.  As standards are regulated at EU level and the compliance rests with manufacturers, there is no requirement to provide measures at a national level for meeting these standards.  However, the policy objective to reduce CO2  emissions is reflected in our charging system for private vehicle motor tax and VRT, which will continue to differentiate in favour of the most environmentally friendly vehicles.</p></reply>

However, large employers are encouraged to develop Work Place Travel Plans which would involve incentivising staff to cycle to and from work through engagement in the Cycle to Work Scheme and provision of on site bike parking and shower facilities.</p><p>All current funding available to my Department for the delivery of cycleways/greenways is fully committed up until 2016.  Details of all projects funded under the recent tranche of the National Cycle Network funding programme and the Government Stimulus package can be viewed on .  Given the success of the projects delivered to date, it is possible that funding may become available from other sources over the coming years, including the programmes mentioned above.  However, I am  currently not in a position to comment with any certainty on future funding.</p></reply>

With regard to the Osberstown interchange and the Sallins bypass the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.

Unfortunately, the current financial realities are such that the budgets proposed for my Department for 2016 and 2017 indicate that capital funding will continue to be very tight, and my ability to progress new projects  is limited.  I acknowledge it is important to restore over time capital funding for the transport sector to ensure that infrastructure is maintained but, as of now, I am not in a position to give a commitment in regard to funding of the projects in question, although I acknowledge their national and local importance.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-17a.719.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015061700085#WRAA00300"><p>With the development in recent years of the major interurban roads programme and improvements to the rail network providing domestic connectivity, regional airports are now being viewed as being important because of the level of international connectivity they bring to a region for the tourism and business sectors.  That connectivity, which is primarily European in nature, is seen as being a significant contributory factor underpinning Ireland's economic recovery and sustainable development into the future.  In relation to transatlantic routes, the two PSO air services from Donegal and Kerry Airports to Dublin Airport offer a possible link to transatlantic routes from that Airport and I am also aware that a transatlantic charter service will operate into Ireland West Airport Knock this August. Ireland&rsquo;s National Aviation Policy, which I expect to publish before the summer recess, confirms that the regional airports at Donegal, Knock, Kerry and Waterford are being given the opportunity to grow to a viable, self-sustaining position, particularly considering the contribution they make to their regional and local economy.  As a result, the Policy provides that Exchequer support (OPEX and CAPEX) for the regional airports will be continued, where appropriate. Such supports will be in accordance with the 2014 EU Guidelines on State aid to airports and airlines and Ireland's 2015 - 2019 Regional Airports Programme.  It is up to those airports being supported to exploit all opportunities to expand their level of connectivity to other regions.</p></reply>

This work is a vital aspect of ensuring value for money is achieved.   As an aid to developing capital investment plans, work on an evidence-based framework to guide key land transport investment decisions has been undertaken.  This work, which will be set out in a forthcoming report  "Investing in Our Transport Future" considered the issue of potential alternative sources of funding. </p>  <p>  The most important source of non-Exchequer transport funding to date has been through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Programmes and the Exchequer already has significant forward commitments relating to the road network in the form of availability payments to remunerate private investment in PPP projects that are not tolled.  Consideration of additional use of the PPP mechanism must be cognisant that any such further commitments will reduce the funding available in the future to meet basic infrastructure maintenance and upkeep requirements and will limit future potential for investment in necessary capacity development.</p>  <p>  Alternative funding sources will, of course, continue to be used as appropriate, such as in the case of European Investment Bank funding which is providing a loan to part-fund the current Luas Cross City Project, and every effort will be made to maximise draw-down from EU funding programmes and to access EIB loans although such alternative, additional sources of funding are likely to be limited in the short to medium term.  Furthermore, "Investing in Our Transport Future" emphasises that a major part of our funding challenge is with regard to maintenance requirements which are more challenging to fund through alternative mechanisms.</p></reply>

Figures for early part of 2015 show this strong performance continuing with good growth being recorded in visit numbers and revenue from all of our main overseas markets. In terms of employment, the most recent CSO Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) data shows that, in the final quarter of 2014, the seasonally adjusted number of persons employed in the accommodation and food services sector was 135,600. This represents 23,000 additional jobs compared with the same period in 2011, when this Government took office. This 20% increase in employment shows the success of the measures introduced by the Government to support the tourism sector, including the 9% VAT rate, the setting of the air travel tax to zero, initiatives like the Gathering, and major investments such as the Wild Atlantic Way.</p>  <p>  Of course, the overall level of employment in the tourism sector is wider than accommodation and food service, with employment in transport, visitor attractions, tour operators, and retail all benefitting from higher levels of overseas and domestic tourism.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimates that the total level of employment in the tourism sector is in the region of 200,000. </p>  <p>  The Government's Tourism Policy Statement "People, Place and Policy &ndash; Growing Tourism to 2025", as published earlier this year, contains three key goals to be achieved by 2025.  Specifically:</p>  <p>  - there will be 250,000 people employed in tourism;</p>  <p>  - Ireland will welcome ten million overseas visits compared with 7.6 million in 2014; and</p>  <p>  - overseas visitor revenue, net of any inflation effect, will be &euro;5 billion compared with &euro;3.5 billion in 2014.</p>  <p>  The Tourism Policy Statement set out a range of policy objectives to achieve these targets.  I will shortly announce the members of a Tourism Leadership Group who will oversee the preparation of a three-year Tourism Action Plan that will set out specific actions required in the period up to 2018 in order to achieve the policy objectives.</p></reply>

My Department has no function in relation to the administration or sale of these artworks.  </p>  <p>  However, I did meet last night with the Chair of the Alfred Beit Foundation and two other Trustees. I asked the Chair if it would be possible to delay the sale, or to consider withdrawing the paintings from auction, to provide some time to explore all other possible options that would involve my Department and the Office of Public Works. The Trustees declined to either delay or cancel the sale, citing the fact that they would incur a liability of &pound;1.4 million for breaking an agreement with the auction house handling the sale, with which they entered a contract several months ago. </p>  <p>  I was only informed last month of the decision in relation to the sale - several months after the Foundation had entered into an agreement with the auction house to have the paintings sold. The fact remains that my Department does not have the discretionary funds necessary - believed to be in the order of &euro;12 million - to buy the paintings. I will continue to see if any other possible options can be explored. This, however, will be very difficult given that the sale is to proceed next month.</p></reply>

Whilst it is recommended good practice to conduct studies of the type referred to before contemplating works to a site of this nature, I regret that all funding available to my Department for these purposes in 2015 is, in any event, already committed to other priority work. I am not, therefore, in a position at present to offer assistance to any other projects.</p></reply>
