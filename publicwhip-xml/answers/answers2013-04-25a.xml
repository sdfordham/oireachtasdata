The programme will be comprehensive, authentic and inclusive.  Against the background of the developing Home Rule crisis, activities in the current year relate to the Centenary of 'The Lockout' and the formation of the Irish Volunteers.  Largely organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, a very active programme of events will continue through the year relating to the living and working conditions in Dublin. The ICTU programme is supported and complemented by initiatives of the national cultural institutions and Dublin City Council, including particularly a major exhibition to open in the National Library this August and the current 'One City, One Book' programme promoting the reading of 'Strumpet City'.  </p><p>  The centenary of the founding of the Irish Volunteers will be marked by exhibitions, presentations, special commemorative issues and official ceremonies in November.  The particular arrangements are under development and will be announced shortly.</p><p>  The Easter Rising and the Proclamation of the Irish Republic will be at the centre of the commemorative programme and will be marked in 2016.  In keeping with the development of an authentic programme, all the principal sites relating to the Rising and subsequent events will feature in the commemorations.</p><p>  I am aware of the significance of Richmond Barracks, especially the former gymnasium used to accommodate prisoners after the Rising.  The special opportunity for renewal arising from the commemorations and the contribution it could make to an area regeneration project have been described in meetings with community groups. The possibilities are under consideration in consultation with Dublin City Council.</p><p>  I take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the support of the members of the Oireachtas Consultation Group on Commemorations and to invite any member of the House to contact me with suggestions or advice.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-25a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1000" speakername="Dinny McGinley" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042500046#WRB01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 39, 41 and 43 together. </p><p>  At the outset, I should remind the Deputies that my Department is charged with implementation of the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 in collaboration and partnership with relevant stakeholders, including agencies directly funded by my Department.  In that context, Foras na Gaeilge, an agency of the North/South Language Body, An Foras Teanga, has a key statutory role in provision of resources and supports for the Irish language on an all-island basis.</p><p>  In regard to the feasibility of introducing a voluntary code for bilingual labelling and packaging of goods, I am pleased to say that Foras na Gaeilge is currently compiling an e-book on best practice in bilingual packaging.  The recommendations in this e-book - <i>'Pac&aacute;ist&iacute;ocht Bia agus D&aacute;theangachas: Taighde ar Fh&eacute;idearachta&iacute;' - </i> are based on research commissioned by Foras na Gaeilge and carried out by the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The e-book is aimed primarily at private sector companies and will demonstrate how bilingual packaging can be used to a competitive advantage.  It is envisaged that the e-book will be available by the end of the year.</p><p>  In regard to initiatives to encourage young writers in Irish, Foras na Gaeilge funds a range of schemes and provides advice and assistance to young writers/script writers through the funding of workshops, the Irish Writers Centre, drama companies and arts centres. For example, the Blogging Scheme or <i>Sc&eacute;im Blag&aacute;la</i>, provides transition-year students with the opportunity to read an Irish language book and blog about it, giving rise to lively debates between young people in different geographical regions.  This scheme is organised in various Gaeltacht regions under the auspices of Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne.  Another example is the <i>Scr&iacute;obh Leabhar </i>  project, which provides an opportunity for children to write their own books through Irish and some of these have been published online.  This project is run in conjunction with the &Aacute;isaonad in Northern Ireland and with Education Centres in this jurisdiction.</p><p>  In regard to the provision of an Irish language venue, including a bookshop, I should point out that Conradh na Gaeilge, which is funded by Foras na Gaeilge, runs the 'Siopa Leabhar' on Harcourt Street.  The venue also provides Irish language resources for teachers, learners and the general public in the same building.</p><p>  In regard to the development of an online stock and order management system for Irish books and other media, 1980 Bord na Gaeilge established <i>An &Aacute;is&iacute;neacht D&aacute;ili&uacute;ch&aacute;n Leabhar</i>  , better known as &Aacute;IS, to distribute Irish-language books on a wholesale basis, both nationally and internationally.  Following completion of a recent review on the operations of &Aacute;IS, major initiatives are underway to improve the service. These include development of a new web-based information service, in conjunction with Cl&aacute;r na Leabhar Gaeilge, which will be available on the URL 'www.leabhar.ie'.  That service will include a trade-end online ordering facility and a facility for publishers to view sales figures. I understand that preparatory work began on this initiative in late 2012 and that the target date for project completion is October 2013.</p></reply>

The Deputy will understand, therefore, that it would not be appropriate for me to express any view in relation to this area of the Coimisin&eacute;ir's work.  However, I should point out that the <i>20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030</i>   recognises the need for the development and strengthening of language awareness and language training programmes so that a higher proportion of public service staff, including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, will have the ability to provide services in Irish to customers, including those located in Gaeltacht areas.  In this context, the Strategy proposes that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Appointments Service should devise appropriate arrangements over time to increase the cohort of public servants who are functional bilinguals, having regard to the present constraints on public sector recruitment.  </p><p>  The Strategy also provides for these arrangements to be supported by the development, within the existing overall national qualifications framework, of an independent, standards-based accreditation system for Irish language competency within the public service so as to support the delivery of quality services to the public in both Irish and English.</p><p>  Clearly, the implementation of initiatives such as these would significantly advance the objective of enhancing the delivery of public services in Irish in a satisfactory manner. My Department is in discussion with relevant stakeholders, including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with a view to progressing this objective, while taking account of the significant resource restraints at this time. As a first step, my Department  recently signed a Service Level Agreement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the provision of Irish language training and proficiency testing for the civil service and certain public service organisations.. The purpose of this agreement is to support staff in developing their proficiency in the Irish language and to enhance the capacity of the civil service and other bodies to provide services in Irish to the public.</p><p>  I should also point out that in the context of the overall implementation of the Strategy, officials of my Department have conducted bilateral meetings with their colleagues in relevant government departments, including the Department of Justice and Equality, in order to promote the language awareness agenda. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-25a.36.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042500046#WRB02700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 36, 44, 49, 132 and 138 together.</p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to "work with stakeholders in the Arts community to develop new proposals aimed at building private support of the Arts in Ireland exploring philanthropic, sponsorship or endowment fund opportunities".  To further this objective, in May 2012 I announced the introduction of a new philanthropic initiative on a pilot basis for arts and culture organisations.  The initiative - the Philanthropic Leverage Initiative - was designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment of the arts from private sources.  The initiative, established with funding of &euro;230,000 for 2012, has provided an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new funding relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts. The initiative was available across projects of varying scale, geography and art forms to not-for-profit organisations for arts programming projects.</p><p>  The organisations approved for funding under the initiative were required to procure matching philanthropic funds and complete their drawdown from my Department in 2012.  Matched funding could come from public funds or from any public sector organisation.  At the outset, it was anticipated that a multiple of 2.5 on the pilot initiative funds of &euro;230,000 would result in philanthropic funding of some &euro;800,000 being raised for the arts.  The scheme proved very successful with private sector philanthropic donations &euro;4.26 being leveraged for every &euro;1 of public funds.  I recently launched a similar initiative for 2013.  Full details including application forms are available on my Department's website.</p><p>  The Philanthropic Leverage Initiative was run in parallel with a second initiative - the Arts Council's RAISE: Building Fundraising Capacity pilot initiative.  That initiative will provide one-to-one professional support to eight selected organisations for two years through planning and implementing a tailored fundraising programme.  This will help those art organisations build and resource their capacity to attract philanthropic giving.  In developing this complementary programme, the Arts Council has identified that it is vital for art groups to develop, agree and implement an effective fundraising strategy and to properly resource that fundraising function.</p><p>  My Department has also provided support to the Business to Arts organisation for a number of years and, in each of the last three years, this has been allocated to delivery of the New Stream Programme, which builds fundraising skills in the cultural sector in Ireland.  The Bank of America Merrill Lynch investment in this project is &euro;400k over three years.  In 2010, my Department also awarded a &euro;20,000 grant to Business to Arts for &lsquo;Fund it&rsquo; in 2010 under the Cultural Technology Grants Scheme. Business to Arts initially matched this figure with private funding and since then has attracted additional foundation funds to this project.  </p><p>  There is not now nor has there been any intention that philanthropy could become the sole source of funding for the arts. The allocation to the National Gallery in 2013 is &euro;7.677m. The allocation by my Department to the other National Cultural Institutions is &euro;30.629m. </p><p>  The State appreciates and values the contribution the arts sector makes to the internationally renowned artistic reputation of this country.  As Minister with responsibility for the arts, I believe that, within the current economic constraints, investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity and potential of the sector.  The arts are a significant contributor and employer in their own right and they are also important building blocks for those economic policies the Government has identified as crucial for our economic recovery.</p><p>  Government policy on the arts is set out in the Programme for Government. As Minister responsible for the arts and culture sectors, I am committed to securing the best possible funding provision for them during my term in office.  Government policy is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts, to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life, and maximise the potential for cultural tourism. Primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council, which, under the Arts Acts, is independent in its funding decisions. In 2013, the Arts Council will receive an allocation of &euro;60.7 million in current, capital and EU Presidency funding. The allocation to the Irish Film Board is &euro;14.858m.</p><p>  The Government appreciates the importance of the arts, culture and the creative industries to both our society and our economy.  I am fully aware of the challenges for those involved in the arts and culture sectors and of the tremendous work they are doing I am committed to supporting the essential elements of the arts.  I will consider publication of the report of the Informal Working Group.</p></reply>

Value for money is determined according to a range of indicators. Some of these, such as audience numbers or the financial health of an organisation, lend themselves to relatively easy measurement. Others, such as quality of artistic direction or the significance of an organisation for provision in a particular art form, are no less important for being less amenable to measurement. In this way artists and arts organisations are profiled on an ongoing basis by the Arts Council.</font><font color="#2F2F2F">I have no plans at present to commission a longitudinal study as referred to.</font></p></reply>

Boat dwellers can be accommodated on the new moorings under an Extended Mooring Permit.</p><p>  Waterways Ireland has also endeavoured to regularise the ownership and lease arrangements at Lowtown Marina and it continues to work closely with the owners of the adjacent boat yard in that regard.

However, initial steps have been taken by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta with a view to commencing the language planning process with organisations and communities in the areas concerned.

It is also an important element of the country's cultural tourism product as a means of encouraging the Irish diaspora to visit the land of their ancestors.  The Government, at my instigation and cognisant of its commitments under the Programme for Government, recently agreed a national genealogy policy.  </p><p>  In Ireland, the situation regarding genealogical research is complicated for historical reasons. Few records have survived compared to other countries.  <font color="#212100">The fire in the Public Record Office complex in the Four Courts during the Irish Civil War (1922-1923) resulted in the severe damage and destruction of many records and impaired the range of records available for genealogical purposes.  It is very important that the genealogy records which exist are presented in a way that is easy to use and understand and readily accessible. </font>The national genealogy policy aims to bring some coherence to this area.  </p><p>  As part of the policy, I have recently launched the updated website  incorporating a web portal.  The new web portal will enable visitors to the site to search genealogy records from a number of online sources particularly in the State sector.  A link will then bring the user directly to the results of the search.  Now for the first time, one search on  will inform the user whether relevant records are available in a number of online sources such as the Church Records currently available on , Tithe Applotments, Griffiths Valuations and the 1901 and 1911 Census records.  The improved search capabilities of this website are part of my Department's contribution to the Government's Gathering Initiative.  It is hoped that this site will contribute to genealogical tourism by making easier for the Diaspora to connect with their heritage.  It is also hoped that the enhanced website will help to simplify the way that the State presents genealogy records.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, there are a wide variety of organisations that already provide valuable services to those seeking information on their ancestry.  My Department would be happy to discuss the provision of a searched link from the webportal on  to allow users to search the websites of those organisations.  I believe that this would benefit all users and bodies by simplifying the genealogy landscape.</p></reply>

As outlined previously, the Arts Council is playing an ongoing key role in funding and developing arts events around the country during 2013.  In terms of the Gaeltacht, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has a dedicated scheme to support traditional festivals in the Gaeltacht and this year placed particular emphasis on activities aimed at attracting visitors to Ireland as part of The Gathering.  Tourists arriving as part of The Gathering, particularly those from amongst the 70 million people abroad who claim Irish ancestry, will be particularly interested in heritage sites. </p><p>  Culture Ireland operates as part of my Department, promoting Irish arts worldwide.  For 2013 Culture Ireland has worked with Irish artists to promote The Gathering, while highlighting the excellence of Irish arts and creativity.  It was a condition of funding imposed by my Department's Culture Ireland Division that all artists travelling abroad this year encourage their audiences to embrace The Gathering initiative. </p><p>  I am committed to availing of every possible opportunity to project a positive global image for Ireland and am particularly conscious in the context of 2013 being the year of The Gathering initiative.  In summary, therefore, I consider that a substantial contribution to The Gathering is underway in both the cultural and heritage areas.</p></reply>

She welcomed the agreement reached between the two parties on a number of outstanding issues which &ndash; it is hoped &ndash; will facilitate the normalisation of relations between Belgrade and Pristina and which goes a long way towards fulfilling the conditions for progress on their respective European paths.  The High Representative also updated Ministers on the latest round of the E3+3 talks on Iran, held in Almaty on 5-6 April, and gave a brief overview of recent developments in DPRK.  In addition, she referred briefly to the situation in Mali, noting the progress made with regard to the EU training mission (EUTM Mali) which has been up and running since 2 April and in which eight members of the Defence Forces are participating.  The Council adopted comprehensive conclusions on Mali which, inter alia, welcomed the Malian Government&rsquo;s commitment to implementing the "roadmap" for the transition and organising free, credible and transparent elections in July. </p><p>  Under the Southern Neighbourhood heading, the Council had a comprehensive exchange of views on the situation in Syria.  I and other colleagues reiterated the urgent need to arrive at a political settlement to the two-year old crisis and expressed our full support for Special Envoy Brahimi in his efforts to promote this.  The Council agreed to ease certain EU sanctions against Syria including the oil embargo, with a view both to helping the civilian population and supporting the opposition.  Ministers also briefly discussed the difficulties faced by neighbouring countries such as Lebanon and Jordan in the context of the ongoing crisis in Syria and its humanitarian consequences.  In my own intervention I highlighted the predicament of the rapidly growing Syrian refugee population and mentioned in this regard my visit to a Syrian refugee camp during my recent visit to Turkey.  High Representative Ashton also gave a short debriefing on a visit she paid recently to Egypt, where growing political and social tensions are a source of serious concern.  </p><p>  Under the Eastern Partnership heading, the Council took stock of preparations for an Eastern Partnership Ministerial meeting which is scheduled for Brussels in July and which will prepare the ground for the Eastern Partnership Summit in November in Vilnius.  </p><p>  Finally, the Council discussed Myanmar/Burma.  Ministers welcomed the advances being made so far towards democracy and congratulated the Government on this progress.  In recognition of reforms already implemented, the Council agreed to lift all sanctions against Myanmar/Burma with the exception of the arms embargo, which has been extended for one year.  This decision is just one step in our developing relationship with Burma/Myanmar as it pursues democracy and reform.  We recognise the significant challenges that remain, not least with regard to political prisoners, inter-communal violence and humanitarian access.  Ireland and its EU partners stand ready to assist Myanmar/Burma as it continues with the efforts it is making towards political, economic and social transition. </p></reply>

The focus was on the rapidly deteriorating situation in the country and on what further steps the EU can take to support the ongoing efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution to the conflict and mitigate its impact on the civilian population.  These objectives remain central to the mission of the UN/Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi who made clear, when he briefed the UN Security Council on 19 April, that the choice faced by Syria is either a destructive fight to the finish or a negotiated political resolution.</p><p>  The Foreign Affairs Council on 22 April reiterated its full support for Mr. Brahimi's efforts as well as for the initiative taken by the former President of the National Syrian Coalition, Dr Al Khatib, to bring about political dialogue among all Syrians leading to a peaceful transition. </p><p>  EU sanctions are essential in maintaining strong pressure on the Syrian authorities so as to persuade them to stop their campaign of repression and brutality against the Syrian people.  Over recent weeks, including at the informal Ministerial meeting I co-hosted with High Representative Ashton in Dublin on 22/23 March, the Council has been discussing these sanctions in detail.  Consideration has also been given to other, non-military ways in which the secular and moderate opposition can be supported and much needed relief and basic services provided to the population.  In this regard, I welcome the decision by the Foreign Affairs Council on 22 April to ease a series of economic restrictive measures, notably in the oil sector, so as to allow for possible trade in this sector with areas now controlled by the Syrian National Coalition. </p><p>  The humanitarian situation in Syria is reaching catastrophic levels, with the United Nations now estimating that 6.8 million people within Syria are in urgent need of assistance, 4.25 million of whom are displaced inside the country.  The widespread and indiscriminate violence has also forced an additional 1.3 million people to seek refuge in neighbouring countries.  After over two years of conflict, the coping mechanisms of those affected by the crisis are severely depleted and the ability of neighbouring countries to absorb further refugees is close to breaking point.</p><p>  In this context, Ireland is making its voice heard.  Earlier this month, I saw first-hand the terrible suffering being endured by people who are forced to flee the violence when I visited Syrian refugee camps in Turkey.  My colleague, Minister of State Joe Costello, had previously visited refugee camps in Jordan last August.  I briefed my colleagues on the Council this week on my impressions and, in discussion around the table, we voiced shared concerns about the overall humanitarian situation, including the issue of humanitarian access.  I have insisted that aid organisations must be immediately granted safe and unimpeded access to those in need in all areas of Syria and that all parties to the conflict must also desist from attacking medical and educational facilities and personnel.</p><p>  In line with the UN Security Council's call on 19 April, Ireland is also urging member States to fulfill pledges made at the International Humanitarian Pledging Conference in Kuwait in January without delay, as the current shortfall in funding severely undermines the humanitarian response.  Ireland has already contributed some &euro;8.15 million in emergency assistance in response to the humanitarian crisis in Syria. </p><p>  The conflict in Syria will remain a major priority for us at all levels of our international engagement.  We will use the influence available to us in our current EU Presidency role to support European and UN efforts and initiatives towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict. </p></reply>

I will be raising this issue when I meet with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and members of the Northern Ireland Executive next Monday 29 April.  In addition, officials in my Department are in contact with the Northern Ireland Office regarding parades on an ongoing basis.  I think it is important to put right the view that there is a legislative vacuum around non-notified parades, as has been suggested in the context of the flags protest.  This is not the case, as is illustrated by the fact that over 200 people have been charged with a variety of offences since those protests began. </p><p>  There is however an ongoing debate regarding the extent, if any, to which existing legislation needs to be strengthened to enhance the remit of the Parades Commission in these matters.  There is no cross community consensus on this matter. Indeed, some unionist community representatives, far from wanting the Commission&rsquo;s role extended, want it abolished completely.  What is important at present is that where the Parades Commission has jurisdiction, all parties cooperate with it and respect its determinations.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I are fully in agreement on this issue.  Furthermore, we are agreed that the police should be fully supported in their attempts to maintain public order. </p></reply>

In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments are reckonable as income for tax purposes.  These include long-term payments such as Disablement Benefit, the State Pension, Widows, Invalidity and Blind Pensions, Carers Allowance and the One Parent Family Payment, as well as short term benefits such as Job Seekers Benefit.  Treating these payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  </p><p>  As a result of maternity benefit payments becoming liable to income tax for all claimants, from 1 July 2013, a number of possible tax outcomes could arise:</p><p>  1. An individual may pay no income tax on their maternity benefit payment as their tax credits will be sufficient to reduce their tax liability to zero.</p><p>  2. An individual may pay income tax on some or all of their maternity benefit payment solely at the standard rate.</p><p>  3. An individual may pay income tax at the standard rate on a portion of the maternity benefit and the higher rate on the balance of the maternity benefit payment.</p><p>  4. An individual may pay income tax on all of their maternity benefit payment at the higher rate.</p><p>  I am fully aware that some employers do not pay a top up payment to their employees whilst on maternity leave.  However, in such circumstances many mothers will not be subject to income tax on their maternity benefit payments as their personal credits will ensure that no tax arises on the social welfare income itself.  Of course, the extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends on the level of income that a recipient has in a tax year.  Accordingly, the tax liability on maternity benefit payments will ultimately depend on the total income of the individual or couple concerned in the tax year or years concerned.</p><p>  There are situations currently where an employee continues to be paid by her employer, while on maternity leave and, based on her PRSI contributions, is entitled to Maternity Benefit from the Department of Social Protection.  The non-taxation of such benefit currently results in an employee having a greater net take-home pay for the period of maternity benefit, than if she was at work. </p><p>  The rates of Maternity Benefit are earnings-related and are set to reflect post-tax income.  It was never intended that individuals would gain financially by being on maternity leave.  The introduction of the charge to income tax on maternity benefit payments will ensure that those with identical incomes will be treated the same for income tax purposes.    </p><p>  I would point out though, that maternity benefit payments will remain exempt from Universal Social Charge and PRSI. </p></reply>

An authorised Officer of the Revenue Commissioners questioned the driver who admitted having possession of the vehicle for one year and failing to register the vehicle in the State on payment of Vehicle Registration Tax.  The vehicle was subsequently seized under the provisions of Section 141 Finance Act, 2001.  It is an offence, under Section 139 of the Finance Act, 1992 to be in possession of an unregistered vehicle in the State unless the person found in possession of it is a person whose normal residence is outside the State or the vehicle is the subject of an exemption.  A person who is not an authorised person who brings a non-State registered vehicle into the State, which is not exempt, is required to complete the registration of the vehicle not later than 30 days following its arrival in the State.    </p><p>  The authority to levy penalties in relation to seized vehicles is provided for under the provisions of Section 144 of the Finance Act, 2001.  The penalty normally applied is 10% of the <i>open market selling price</i>  (OMSP) of the vehicle where the vehicle has remained in the State as unregistered for a period up to 6 months.  If the period is greater, then an additional penalty is applied i.e. 5% of the previous penalty for each month or part of a month that the vehicle has remained unregistered since registration was due.  In this case, the Revenue official confirmed that the OMSP of the vehicle was &euro; 15,166.  The Officer, using discretion, applied the 10 % compromise penalty only and called for &euro;1,500 to secure the release of the seized vehicle.  It was correctly seized and the compromise penalty paid was accepted in lieu of forfeiture of the vehicle and institution of legal proceedings.</p><p>  Due notice of seizure is not required and the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the seizure was correct.</p></reply>

The methodology for the assessment of dwellings to establish significant pyritic damage will be prescribed in regulations to be made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I understand that the regulations are currently being finalised and will be published shortly.</p><p>  I am advised by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government that homeowners will be required to demonstrate significant pyritic damage in accordance with the recently published standard by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, <i>IS 398 - Reactive Pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material - Part 1</i>.  This standard provides guidance on the building condition assessment, sampling and testing to be carried out to establish the presence of significant pyritic damage.  To be eligible for an exemption from the LPT, a homeowner must obtain a certificate, from a competent person, confirming the presence of significant pyritic damage on the basis of a building condition assessment and having regard to the outcome of the testing and classification of the sub-floor hardcore material carried out in accordance with I.S. 398.  Eligibility for an exemption will be determined by reference to the presence of significant pyritic damage in the relevant property concerned.  Conscious of the need to reduce costs to affected homeowners, I understand that provision will be made in the Regulations being made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for the use, where feasible, of test results from sampling and testing undertaken to classify the sub-floor hardcore material prior to the publication of I.S. 398.  Such testing results must be validated by a competent person as being in accordance with, or equivalent to, I.S. 398.  A building condition assessment will be required to be carried out by a competent person irrespective of when such testing is, or was, carried out.</p><p>  A homeowner cannot claim the exemption until the relevant certificate has been issued.  He or she should notify Revenue at that stage to claim the exemption. Special arrangements will apply in respect of 2013 and 2014 to facilitate homeowners in claiming an exemption.  While homeowners who do not have the relevant certificate on the first liability date of 1 May 2013 (liability date for 2013), or by 1 November 2013 (liability date for 2014), will be required to pay LPT for those periods, they will be able to reclaim the tax paid if they obtain the certificate by 31 December 2013 and notify the Revenue Commissioners in writing on or before 31 January 2014.  As an alternative to such retrospective treatment, they can opt to start the period of exemption from the liability date following the issue of the certificate.</p></reply>

This applies until 31 December 2017.</td></tr><tr><td>Partial <br />Deferral </td><td>3</td><td>Gross income for the year is unlikely to exceed &euro;25,000 (single or widow/er) and &euro;35,000 (couple).</td></tr><tr><td>Partial <br />Deferral </td><td>4</td><td>Gross income for the year is unlikely to exceed the adjusted income limit. This adjusted income limit is calculated by increasing the thresholds of &euro;25,000 (single or widow/er) and &euro;35,000 (couple) by 80% of the expected mortgage interest payments for the year 2013. This applies until 31 December 2017.</td></tr></table></p><p>To determine whether they qualify for deferral for 2013, liable persons are required to estimate on 1 May 2013 what their total gross income for 2013 is likely to be.  Gross income from all sources consists of the total income before any deductions, allowances or reliefs that may be taken into account for income tax purposes and includes income that is exempt from income tax and income received from the Department of Social Protection but excludes Child Benefit.  Where a deferral is being claimed on this basis, the LPT1 Return must be completed and the relevant deferral selected.</p><p>Interest will be charged on LPT amounts deferred at a rate of 4% per annum.  The deferred amount, including interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.  I am advised by the Commissioners that full details of all deferral options are outlined in the Guidelines on Deferral or Part Deferral of Local Property Tax, which are available on Revenue&rsquo;s website <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</p></reply>

Throughout the period of the discussions between the Irish Authorities and the ECB the confidentiality of matters discussed was emphasised between the parties. However, the ECB has not been approached in relation to documentation requested under specific FOI requests relating to the liquidation of IBRC nor has the ECB requested the Department not to release any such documentation. The ECB has informed my Department that they will not be releasing any information in relation to these discussions. </p><p>  In normal course my Department will examine all requests received for information under the FOI Acts and assess whether specific information can be released. While the overall aim is to release the information requested the FOI Acts do list specific provisions under which records can be deemed to be &ldquo;exempt records&rdquo; for the purposes of the Acts. The decisions of the Department/public body, in this regard, are subject to a right of appeal by the requester. One such exemption [section 24(2)(e) 1997 Act] refers specifically to information communicated in confidence from, to, or within an international organisation, including an organisation or an institution or body of the European Union. Other exemptions provided in the legislation include; meetings of Government; information received in confidence; commercially sensitive information; deliberations of  public bodies; functions and negotiations of public bodies; financial and economic interests of the State; etc. </p><p>  As part of this process My Department will communicate with third parties if consideration is being given to releasing information/documentation received from those parties. In the event that third parties object to information being released the Department will take a view on the nature of the information, the basis on which the information was received or acquired and the views of the third party etc.  The Department will then decide whether the information should be released under the FOI Acts having regard to particular circumstances and the requirements of the public interest. Any decision, therefore as to whether information is released or not by Irish authorities under Freedom of Information legislation enacted in this jurisdiction is a matter for the Irish authorities. While the ECB or other third parties may have a view on the release of particular information the ECB has not and would not seek to influence the proper operation of national legislation.  </p><p>  My Department is committed to the spirit and proper operation of the Freedom of Information Acts 1997-2003. </p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s staff are the official national representatives interfacing with the International Labour Office (ILO) and World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) as well as the WTO.</p><p>  In addition to WTO related duties, the Department&rsquo;s Geneva officials represent Ireland at the WIPO and ILO when officials from Dublin are unable to attend or where it would be more cost effective for Geneva based personnel to service meetings. In the case of ILO there are significant time commitments during meetings of the Governing Body (Spring and Autumn) and the International Labour Conference (three weeks each June).</p><p>  The staff complement servicing the national interest at these three organisations comprises 1 Principal Officer (PO), 1 Higher Executive Officer (HEO) and 1 Clerical Officer. Offices and other facilities are shared with the PMUN. During 2012 there was considerable work involved in preparing for the current Irish Presidency of the European Council. To assist with the additional obligations that Ireland is required to meet, in the latter half of 2012 two additional staff were seconded to Geneva until July 2013.</p><p>  In 2012 over 550 WTO related meetings were attended by the Department's officials. These included EU coordination and related meetings, as well as numerous WTO working sessions. These working sessions include key themes of trade liberalisation (Non Agricultural Market Access, Services and Agriculture) under the current Round of global trade talks known as the Doha Round and the broader WTO&rsquo;s work involving Trade Facilitation, Technical Barriers to Trade, Trade Policy Reviews, Disputes, and the international Technology Agreement as well as the start of talks on a new international agreement covering trade in international services. Furthermore this year also sees a significant increase in WTO activity as a range of items are advanced for consideration at the Ninth WTO Ministerial Conference in December.</p><p>  In total there are about 40 different working groups and specialist thematic sub groups that Ireland is required to service where possible. In addition, senior staff are required to participate in extensive networking and interaction outside the EU group in Geneva and to actively promote the Department's interests in both the ILO and WIPO.</p><p>  All EU Member States maintain Permanent Missions in Geneva with dedicated WTO teams and will continue to do so.</p><p>  On the matter of competence, the EU Commission does not have exclusive competence across the broad span of WTO trade activity/negotiations. In addition, like all other EU MS, Ireland is a WTO member in its own right, unlike the EU, which is not a WTO Member. Furthermore, the issue of competence is not clearcut in either the ILO or WIPO where a mixture of arrangements are in place. I believe therefore that it is vital that our presence is maintained in Geneva to ensure that Ireland's particular interests in the International Institutions that set global rules for trade, intellectual property and labour law are both promoted and protected; and that Ireland can play its part along with other Member States in forming EU Trade Policy.</p><p>  In 2012 Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the operating costs of the WTO is CHF 2,205,826 or approximately &euro;1,823,000, calculated by reference to the proportion of Irish trade to global trade.</p></reply>

It aims to help Irish business gain competitiveness and grow by having access to new markets and a wider customer base.  The objective is to target 2,000 small businesses with a view to them commencing trading online in 2013 and 2014.

The trial initiatives will be evaluated on an on-going basis with a view to any necessary adaptation for a significant scaling up of the programme in 2014.</p><p>  The vision is to develop, in collaboration with industry partners, a series of actions which will stimulate growth in Irish-based small businesses by supporting them to trade on-line, informed by past interventions and engagement with digital market participants.  The actions, as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, include the following:</p><p>- Consult with representatives of the digital industry in Ireland to establish the contribution which those companies can make to the design and implementation of the Trading On-Line initiative;</p><p>- Design the detailed operational arrangements for the Business On-Line voucher scheme to be applied to the pilot phase of the initiative;</p><p>- Agree an approach, including plans for a promotional campaign, for pilot projects that will maximise the outcomes and learnings from this initial trial phase. Identify suitable projects at regional and/or sectoral level with a target of engaging companies for inclusion in the trial phase of the initiative in 2013;</p><p>- Commence the first phase of the pilot(s) and monitor progress with a view to a significant scaling up of the initiative in 2014.</p><p>  This programme has the capacity to support and transform jobs in Irish-based companies, improve their competitiveness and open their access to a wider customer base, both domestically and internationally.  The programme will also support jobs indirectly in businesses supplying expertise, training, hosting and logistics services to companies that are adapting to trading on-line.</p></reply>

Peak employment at the factory was in the early 1980's when it employed 95 people. The business was acquired in 2008 by a California based manufacturer of metal fixings and hangers used in construction of wooden frame housing. Employment had gradually declined to approximately 30 by 2011. By this time, the plant was consistently loss making and on a 3 day week.  In former years, only about 20% of the company's output was sold on the Irish market but latterly this increased as total sales declined.</p><p>  In 2012, IDA Ireland was informed that the US based parent company had decided to exit this particular market in Europe and to consolidate their business units and concentrate on traditional products particularly for the timber frame sector. The decision was influenced by the construction downturn, both in the US and Europe.  The company was marketed as a going concern in mid-2012 without success. The Killorglin product line and rights to production for Europe was sold to a Finnish company in late 2012 and this company plan to manufacture the products in their own plant in Finland.</p><p>  The premises are still owned by the US parent company and this company, with the 7 remaining staff, are in the process of overseeing the sale and disposal of the remaining equipment. This work is likely to be concluded by May/June 2013, at which stage the plant will be finally closed. The factory and lands have now been offered for sale<i>.</i>  The IDA has worked with the company in a search for a new owner and Enterprise Ireland has also been made aware of its availability as a possible location for one of that Agency's client companies. </p><p>  Unfortunately, given the combination of various circumstances including the fact that the facility dates from the early 1970s, it has not proven possible to date to secure a new occupier. It is, of course, very disappointing that this factory, which provided employment for several decades in Killorglin, is now closing, due to external market factors and changes in the industry worldwide.  I have, however, asked the development agencies to continue to do all they can to find a replacement company for the Killorglin plant.</p></reply>

At this stage, it is the mandate to be given to the Commission that is under consideration at EU level, negotiations on a trade agreement have not commenced. Consequently it is not possible to quantify either the extent of any US requests for access to the EU market and the necessary trade off involved in respect of market access in the agriculture sector more broadly or the beef segment in particular.</p><p>  The High Level Working Group recommended the phasing out of substantially all tariffs for all but the most sensitive tariffs. I have supported my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is recognising the beef sector as a sensitive sector of importance for Ireland. As I have done previously in other trade negotiations, I will continue to look for the most advantageous outcome from this trade and investment agreement with the US that promotes our vital economic interests, and that includes the special interests of the beef sector.</p></reply>

The provisions for the registration of a death are set out in Part 5 of the Civil Registration Act 2004. Under these provisions, where a death occurs, a registered medical practitioner must provide a relative of the deceased with a Medical Certificate of Cause of Death; the relative then brings the certificate to a registrar, provides the registrar with any additional particulars required to register the death and then signs the entry in the register of deaths.  Where no Medical Certificate can be obtained, or where a death occurs in certain circumstances, the matter is referred to a Coroner, who will, following necessary enquiries, arrange for the registration of the death.</p><p>  The provisions for the registration of births and stillbirths are set out in Part 3 of the Act. The registration of stillbirths is a voluntary option for parents and the stillbirth may be registered provided that the child, at birth, weighed not less than 500 grammes or had a gestational age of not less than 24 weeks and showed no sign of life.  Qualifications such as weight and gestational age apply only in the case of stillbirths and do not apply in the registration of births or infant deaths.  The person (details supplied) should contact their local registrar (contact details available via ) who will be able to assist with information pertaining to the registration of births, deaths and stillbirths, as applicable in this particular case.</p></reply>

It is open to the Deputy at any stage to provide further more detailed information to enable my Department to examine more specifically the issues raised in order to determine what action, if any, is warranted in the particular circumstances.  It is important, in the interests of all concerned, that any alleged impropriety on the part of any staff member is brought to our attention with sufficient detail to enable the matter to be fully investigated.</p><p>  The Department provides both a dedicated phone number and a facility on the Department&rsquo;s website for this purpose. Persons are asked to provide as much detail as possible about the case they are reporting and they can do so anonymously. </p><p>  All anonymous or confidential reports are examined and, where relevant, are referred to the relevant sections for follow-up action. In relation to alleged fraudulent behaviour by a customer, while a payment is not suspended or stopped solely on the basis of an anonymous report, it may &ldquo;trigger&rdquo; the instigation of a review of a customer&rsquo;s entitlement.  A Social Welfare Inspector may then deem it appropriate to carry out a full review of the circumstances and means of the customer in order to determine on-going entitlement to the relevant payment. The Inspector will then submit their report to a Deciding Officer for decision regarding on-going entitlement to the social welfare payment.  The Deciding Officer&rsquo;s decision will be based on the full facts and circumstances of the case, including the report of the review by the Inspector. </p><p>  It is the view of my Department that this process provides a clear mechanism for investigating allegations of fraud without prejudice to the customer. In any case where the customer is not satisfied with the decision of a Deciding Officer, it is open to them to lodge an appeal with the Social Welfare Appeals Office within twenty one days.</p><p>  The Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour sets out a clear framework within which civil servants must work and outlines the principles which should govern the behaviour of civil servants and the values which the Civil Service espouses.

The individual&rsquo;s yearly average number of contributions determines the amount of pension paid.  This is generally calculated from the date on which paid employment commenced to pension age, therefore it is varies depending on each individual&rsquo;s working life.  Time taken out of the paid workforce may result in gaps in contribution records, which may result in a lower rate of pension being paid.  </p><p>  The average contributions test has been in existence since 1961 and was designed with a view to ensuring that people could move in and out of PRSI coverage.  A move away from the averaging system to a total contributions system is planned.  This will mean that the total number of years contributions paid will be considered when assessing entitlement to a pension.  The level of pension paid will then be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life. The proposed change is supported in the OECD Review of the Irish Pension System launched on the 22 April 2013.  </p><p>  The State pension is a very valuable asset and it is important, for sustainability reasons that those who receive it have made a significant contribution towards it during a working life. </p></reply>

It was for that reason that the Government last year adopted the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy with a view to giving greater public recognition to carers and their work.  Carers receive significant income supports from my Department so that people can continue living at home.  Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years.  In 2013 it is estimated to be &euro;776 million compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.  The expenditure on carers in 2012 included: &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance; &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit; &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and; &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance.  Carers also receive a free travel pass at an annual cost of &euro;6 million and carers who reside with the care recipient are eligible for the household benefits package at an annual cost of approximately &euro;30 million.  The revised rate of the respite care grant of &euro;1,375 will still be more than what it was in 2006 when the rate was &euro;1,200.</p><p>  The respite care grant is paid to more than 70,000 people each year, with some 5,000 people in receipt of more than one grant as they care for more than one person.  Almost 54,000 people are in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance and 27,000 in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  There are also 1,700 in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  Some 5,000 carers not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment also receive the grant.</p><p>  The supports to carers from my Department are among the highest rates of income support in Europe.  A person getting certain qualifying payments and also providing full-time care and attention to another person can keep their main social welfare payment and receive a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance as well.  The half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance was protected in Budget 2013.  The respite care grant is available to all full-time carers regardless of their means while the income disregard and means test for carers allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system.  A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance while a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.  Carers are entitled to an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person and a respite care grant for each care recipient.</p></reply>

At 18 April, 2013, 16,545 had commenced internships, 5,947 individuals were on internships and 2,452 internship opportunities were advertised.  The recent independent evaluation of the Scheme found that 61% of interns have progressed into employment on within five months of completing their internship.  This represents very significant progress in a short period of time and compares very favourably with outcomes of similar schemes across Europe. </p><p>  JobBridge is a short-term and targeted intervention.  It has been launched in a targeted way to allocate scarce exchequer resources to make maximum impact for long term unemployment while ensuring that it does not replace or displace the normal operation of the labour market, which is an essential element of Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  It is essential to strike a balance between our commitments to combat unemployment through the up-skilling opportunities provided by quality internship placements that offer real workplace experience, on the one hand, and the potential to destabilise the normal functioning of the labour market and a consequent reduction of opportunities for permanent employment, on the other.</p><p>  The Department of Social Protection does not allow for exceptions in the nine-month limit at present.  Currently, a jobseeker may partake in a maximum of two internships to a maximum cumulative time period of 9 months.  However, the independent evaluation of the Scheme is currently being finalised by Indecon International Economic Consultants.  Part of its remit includes recommendations on how the Scheme might be improved or expanded.  The final report will be published at the beginning of May.  At that stage, I will give further consideration to amending the terms and conditions of the Scheme. </p></reply>

In the event that funding was required from the Department of Social Protection, the implementation of the claim is not considered sustainable in light of the current and ongoing fiscal environment and the requirement to contain and reduce public expenditure.  The costs of the introduction of any scheme are likely to be of the order of &euro;3m per annum with retrospective costs of the order of at least &euro;30m.</p><p>  It should also note that the Department of Social Protection is not the employer of CE supervisors and such employees are not public servants.

The unique qualities of Ireland&rsquo;s national heritage play a significant role in enhancing and projecting Ireland&rsquo;s image abroad, and in supporting economic renewal through cultural and heritage tourism and in downstream opportunities, such as in the retail, catering and accommodation sectors.  For example, according to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, some 3.5 million overseas visitors engaged in cultural activities while in Ireland in 2011.  Over 2.5 million tourists visited historic houses or castles, while 2 million visited our archaeological monuments, with over 3.7 million visitors to heritage sites where the Office of Public Works provides a guide service.  My Department&rsquo;s network of National Parks and Reserves are also a major part of Ireland&rsquo;s tourism attractions.</p><p>  I am committed to availing of every possible opportunity to project a positive global image for Ireland and to this aim I recently met with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland to enhance co-operation between my Department and both Toursim bodies in promoting heritage and tourism.  I am particularly conscious in the context of 2013 being the year of The Gathering initiative.  My Department is actively engaged in a wide range of activities to this end, both in co-operation with bodies such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Office of Public Works, and in promoting its own initiatives such as our &lsquo;Places to See&rsquo; and &lsquo;Monuments to Visit&rsquo; websites, which provide directions to lesser known heritage sites and details of what the visitor can expect to find on arrival. In addition, my Department provides core funding for the Heritage Council, which supports a range of initiatives, including National Heritage Week.</p><p>  This year, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, my Department is also initiating a pilot programme, the Historic Towns Initiative, in Youghal, Westport and Listowel with the Heritage Council and the local authorities in each town.  This initiative is intended to promote heritage-led regeneration with the objective of harnessing cultural heritage to create desirable places to live, do business and visit.  The redevelopment of Killarney House in Killarney National Park will also be a major tourism asset in years to come.  These are but a sample of the overall range of initiatives and programmes my Department is helping to promote, support or guide as a means of preserving the quality and diversity of our heritage, which in turn, is basis for positively promoting that heritage abroad.</p><p>  On the broader issue of North/South cooperation, my Department&rsquo;s remit includes the Waterways Ireland and the Language Body (encompassing Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster Scots Agency) which have a key role in tourism and cultural development and my Department also works on a range of issues across the area of built heritage, arts and culture and the natural heritage with public agencies in Northern Ireland where opportunities for co-operation arise.</p></reply>

All known archaeological monuments, of which there are in excess of 130,000, are entitled to protection under the National Monuments Acts.  The National Monuments Acts 1930-2004 allow me to make a preservation order where I consider a national monument to be at risk.  Protection may be extended to previously unrecorded monuments by entering them in the Register of Historic Monuments or the Record of Monuments and Places.  Prosecutions in respect of damage to recorded monuments are initiated where warranted.</p><p>  Under section 53 of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2011, I may make recommendations to a planning authority concerning the inclusion in its record of protected structures any structures which I consider would merit such inclusion and the attendant planning restrictions which would apply to protect the structures&rsquo; special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest.  My Department has been and is currently involved in various actions which aim to address specific issues such as the endangerment of our national heritage.  These include the work of an expert advisory committee, set up in 2011 and representing key stakeholders, to review the operation of Part IV of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2011 in respect of protection and management of architectural heritage.</p><p>  Additionally I provide funding through a Structures at Risk Fund to assist with works to safeguard structures protected under Part IV and, in certain cases, works to safeguard structures within Architectural Conservation Areas, where an urgent need for works to such structures has arisen and has been demonstrated.  Comprehensive statistics are not available in respect of the numbers of reports of actual damage or threats of damage to protected structures and monuments.</p></reply>

The list of unfinished housing developments eligible for the exemption was compiled by local authorities utilising the categorisation employed for the purposes of the National Housing Survey 2012.  The Survey was carried out over the course of summer 2012 by my Department in conjunction with local authorities and the Housing Agency.  The categorisation methodology for the survey was different to that which was used in 2011 and which provided the basis for the waiver from the household charge. That earlier categorisation related largely to the level of on-site activity at the time the 2011 survey was carried out and had less to do with the physical character of a development. The 2012 survey was based purely and objectively on the actual state of completion of a development. Only developments that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included.  For purposes of preparing the final list of developments to which the exemption from the local property tax would apply local authorities were asked by my Department to confirm or update the then existing list as appropriate.</p><p>  The list of estates exempted from payment of the household charge, as well as the list of estates which are entitled to a waiver from the local property tax, are both available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.environ.ie.</p></reply>

Drafting of the Bill is being finalised with a view to meeting the commitment in the Government Legislation Programme which indicates that the Bill is expected to be published in the current session. The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a Bill that is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Work is being completed to properly align the provisions of the Bill with the principles contained in the UN Convention on supporting people with impaired capacity in making decisions and exercising their basic rights.  I envisage that the revised title of the Bill, The Assisted Decision - Making (Capacity) Bill, will reflect this approach.</p><p>  The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Convention chaired by my Department monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  The committee has identified as part of its work programme, issues to be considered by various Government Departments including my Department.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, is in the process of assisting it to assess the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed.</p><p>  It is the Government's intention to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are being met.  As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.</p></reply>

The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012. </p><p>  The current average processing time for applications is approximately 12 weeks from date of receipt.  However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process. </p><p>  Following discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, sanction was granted for an additional 25 staff to be re-deployed from the Department of Agriculture to the Garda Central Vetting Unit.

This atrocity which took the lives of 28 innocent men, women and children was carried out by terrorists opposed to peace on this island.  The purpose of the Act was to strengthen the powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling these criminal terrorists.</p><p>  Section 18 of the 1998 Act, as amended by section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, provides that certain sections of the 1998 Act must be reviewed annually and would cease to operate unless a resolution had been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas confirming the continuation of the sections.  I presume the rational behind the annual review mechanism is to ensure transparency in the application of the Act and to enable members of the Oireachtas to consider whether the security threat which gave rise to the powers in question remains.  With regard to the areas for which I have responsibility as Minister, a similar review mechanism is in place with regard to section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 which provides for the trial in the Special Criminal Court of certain organised crime offences.</p></reply>

The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.</p><p>  The current average processing time for applications is approximately 12 weeks from date of receipt.  However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.</p><p>  Following discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, sanction was granted for an additional 25 staff to be re-deployed from the Department of Agriculture to the Garda Central Vetting Unit.  I am pleased to announce that these personnel transferred to the GCVU on 22 April 2013.  When these staff have been fully trained on the vetting process I expect there will be a positive effect on vetting times.  Since I became Minister, it has been a priority for me that processing times should be kept to a minimum consistent with maintaining the overall integrity of the vetting system.

The provision of funding for compensation in the context of the compulsory phase of the BVD programme must be placed in the context of the economic benefits accruing to farmers arising from the eradication of this disease and, particularly, the short payback time involved for individual farmers as well as the scarce budgetary resources available to my Department.  It has been estimated that the overall benefit for the eradication of this disease is beneficial to farmers.  I should also emphasise that the strategy of my Department is to concentrate its scarce resources in continuing to support Animal Health Ireland in its ongoing work in establishing control.</p></reply>

It is now recognised that the first year of the new regime will be 2015.  Farmers will apply in that year for an allocation of new payment entitlements.  The Commission proposals have been the subject of negotiations at official and political level in the Council of Ministers over the past 18 months, culminating in an agreed Council position which was reached at the Council on 18 and 19 March.</p><p>  Under the proposals agreed by the Council of Ministers, the number of entitlements to be allocated in the first year of the new regime can either be based on the total number of eligible hectares declared in that year or, alternatively, a Member State may decide that the number of entitlements will be confined to the number of eligible hectares declared in either 2012 or 2013.  Member States are also allowed to confine the allocation of payment entitlements to those farmers who received a payment under the existing Single Payment Scheme in either 2010 or 2011.  Where a Member State exercises this option, the European Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to determine how entitlements are to be allocated to farmers who apply in the first year of the new regime but who did not receive payment in either 2010 or 2011.  Again, it is too early to say whether Ireland will exercise this particular option.  I should also point out that the next step in the negotiations involves reaching agreement between the three European Institutions - the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and the Commission.  Therefore, it is too early to speculate on how the final outcome will affect individual farmers.</p></reply>

The cold and wet weather in the early part of 2013 led to greatly reduced grass growth this Spring, culminating in an acute shortage of fodder currently.</p><p>  Once fodder shortage became a reality I took a number of steps to aid the farming sector on this issue and have now put a comprehensive package of measures in place to deal with the situation.  I met with the CEO&rsquo;s of the Dairy Co-ops, who have agreed with my request that they will substantially increase the volume of fodder being imported into the country over the short to medium term. In tandem with this, I have created a fund of &euro;1m to contribute to the transport costs of importing fodder, which will reduce the cost of purchasing fodder for farmers by approximately a third.  The Dairy Co Ops have also agreed to consider the introduction of interest free credit, within limits, to farmers for the purchase of fertiliser, during the month of May.</p><p>  Emergency assistance will also be available under the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council&rsquo;s early warning system.  Support is there for any farmer that is facing an emergency situation and I would urge farmers who need support to contact the Department for assistance immediately.  I have also met with senior bank representatives and have asked them for flexibility over the coming period for farmers that wish to access credit at this time.  In addition, outstanding scheme payments are being processed by my Department with urgency. </p><p>  While access to fodder is the immediate priority, grass growth will be a crucial factor in alleviating the current situation and in ensuring that there will be sufficient fodder conserved for next winter.  In that regard, I have asked the advisory services to prioritise advice to farmers in the period ahead and to focus on the optimum use of fertiliser in generating feed for the national herd.

Successive EU audits have made it absolutely clear that compliance with the Regulations must be strictly adhered to and that all administrative checks must be passed and eligibility conditions met before payment issues.  As a result, my Department is obliged to ensure that individual payments will not issue until all aspects of a farmer&rsquo;s application are in order, all outstanding documentation provided and all queries resolved.</p><p>  Outstanding payments under both AEOS I and AEOS II are largely due to unresolved queries associated with applications and in most instances officials in my Department will have contacted the applicants concerned with the intention of issuing payment as soon as possible.  There is a specific issue delaying payments under AEOS 2 related to non productive capital investments.  In order to facilitate the 2012 payment applicants must have submitted a valid claim form, if they have selected a non-productive capital investment action.  However a significant number of applicants have either not submitted a claim form or have outstanding queries associated with submitted forms.  Officials in my Department have been in contact with all these farmers and are dealing with the responses received with the intention of clearing any backlog as soon as possible.</p><p>  The information requested is not readily available but will be collated and forwarded directly to the Deputy.  I am also conscious that farmers are experiencing difficulties given the current fodder shortage.  Payments are being processed as promptly as possible.  &euro;2.5 million will be paid out in payments over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Details are given in the Annex.  However, as demonstrated below, no undue delay currently exists in processing cases and payments continue to issue twice weekly, as individual cases are confirmed eligible.</p><p>A major factor impacting on processing of 2012 Scheme applications arose from the changes made to better focus the Scheme in light of budgetary realities and, in particular, ensuring that affected applicants could have access to robust and fair derogation and appeal processes.  In this context, my Department wrote to in excess of 10,000 beneficiaries under the 2011 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme whose holdings had not achieved the minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare, as required under the Terms and Conditions of the 2012 Scheme.</p><p>In response, my Department received a total of 9,829 derogation applications of which 7,385 were successful.  Those, whose applications were unsuccessful, were informed of their right of appeal to the independently chaired DAS Appeals Committee, on foot of which 1,572 appeals were received.  On the basis of additional information which had not previously been submitted, my Department was in a position to overturn the original decision on 612 cases, without the need to refer the cases to the DAS Appeals Committee.</p><p>Of the appeals submitted to the Committee, decisions have been taken in respect of 844 cases, of which 302 were allowed, 458 disallowed and 84 requested to submit additional information. Processing of the outstanding appeals remains ongoing.</p><p>On a more general note, the overall position is that those who have not received payment under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme (i.e. 7,554 cases &ndash; see table) are not yet confirmed eligible for payment.  Of the 7,554 cases in question, 3,556 have not, as yet, shown that their holdings satisfied the Scheme minimum stocking density requirements.  The holdings of a further 2,822 did not achieve the minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units in 2011; 444 cases relate to applicants being deceased or change of ownership where my Department must await legal formalities to be completed.  A further 47 cases relate to cases where it has not been demonstrated that equines are eligible.  The remaining 685 cases in the main relate to outstanding area-related issues.</p><p><bu>2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme</bu></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Name</div></th><th><div>Applied</div></th><th><div>Paid</div></th><th><div>Gross Amount</div></th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>757</td><td>708</td><td>&euro;1,457,968.65</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>4,851</td><td>4,589</td><td>&euro;9,942,480.88</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>6,135</td><td>5,780</td><td>&euro;13,926,017.47</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>7,127</td><td>6,704</td><td>&euro;15,353,624.81</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>8,485</td><td>7,597</td><td>&euro;17,634,172.68</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>134</td><td>116</td><td>&euro;250,656.27</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>12,177</td><td>11,139</td><td>&euro;24,158,510.63</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>7,723</td><td>7,154</td><td>&euro;17,643,066.85</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>523</td><td>465</td><td>&euro;826,652.81</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>1,768</td><td>1,662</td><td>&euro;3,484,943.75</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>1,727</td><td>1,609</td><td>&euro;3,188,848.99</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>3,483</td><td>3,220</td><td>&euro;7,252,000.29</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>2,933</td><td>2,718</td><td>&euro;5,373,814.93</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>2,392</td><td>2,266</td><td>&euro;4,978,349.96</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>756</td><td>685</td><td>&euro;1,142,766.91</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>11,621</td><td>10,695</td><td>&euro;22,922,103.82</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>1,355</td><td>1,260</td><td>&euro;2,297,512.50</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>4,108</td><td>3,863</td><td>&euro;7,660,546.74</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>2,397</td><td>2,246</td><td>&euro;4,486,745.07</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>5,746</td><td>5,395</td><td>&euro;11,889,546.34</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>4,064</td><td>3,714</td><td>&euro;8,082,267.69</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>4,536</td><td>4,236</td><td>&euro;9,029,815.31</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>1,449</td><td>1,326</td><td>&euro;2,721,511.86</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>2,653</td><td>2,501</td><td>&euro;5,070,850.28</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>1,432</td><td>1,278</td><td>&euro;2,354,521.62</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>1,751</td><td>1,603</td><td>&euro;3,904,501.61</td></tr><tr><td>TOTALS </td><td>102,083</td><td>94,529</td><td>&euro;207,033,798.72</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Each child in foster care has a social worker who visits the child in the foster carers' home and maintains a link with the child&rsquo;s birth family.  90.8% of children in relative foster care have an allocated social worker while 92.2% in general foster care have an allocated social worker.</p><p>  Every foster carer also has a social worker, known as a link worker, to support and supervise them.  The link workers responsibilities include ensuring that foster carers receive all relevant information and advice about the children including background history, health and education.  The link worker organises training, provides regular supervision and support for foster carers and their children and ensures that foster carers are aware of and operate within relevant standards, policies and guidance of the HSE.  The link worker also provides foster carers with specific written information on and explanations of HSE procedures should a complaint or allegation be made against them and the supports available in such an event. </p><p>  Support is also available from Public Health Nurses, psychologists and child care workers as appropriate with other professionals being accessed if necessary, for example, speech therapists, counselling services etc.  Any concerns that a foster carer has about a child's welfare may be addressed to the appropriate person from the support network available to them.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in relation to the recruitment of social workers, the HSE has advised me that as of 15 April, there are currently 123 vacant posts being filled.</p></reply>

I understand that at the time of drafting of the legislation it was felt that this provided an adequate period following the initial assessment of applicants to complete an adoption.  Given the changing landscape of intercountry adoption, this may no longer be the case.  I am currently examining a number of proposals in relation to amendments to the Adoption Act, 2010.  I intend to bring forward any changes to the legislation in conjunction with the draft Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2013, which I propose to bring before the Oireachtas in the coming months.  However, any change to the length of validity of a declaration must be weighed up against the necessity to ensure that an applicant's current situation in relation to their suitability to adopt is taken in to account in the adoption process.</p></reply>

The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects. It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population. The effects of fluoridation on health and related matters are kept under constant review.  The material to which the Deputy refers is a generic letter, which has already been received and forwarded to the Expert Body for examination.

In the most recent World Health Statistics Annual Report (2012), Ireland had the 13th lowest rate of maternal mortality out of 178 countries reporting data.  It is generally recognised internationally that official vital statistics can result in an underestimate of maternal deaths.  In particular, indirect obstetric deaths resulting from previous existing disease or diseases which developed during the pregnancy may be missed in the official statistics. For this reason, Ireland established a Confidential Maternal Death Enquiry (MDE) system in 2009.  In doing so, it linked itself with the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Confidential MDE which has been acknowledged as a gold standard for maternal death enquiry in recent decades.  </p><p>  The MDE report shows that 75.4 per cent of maternities in Ireland in 2010 were women of Irish nationality and that 40% of all maternal deaths identified in the triennium 2009-2011 occurred in women who were not born in Ireland. There were 25 maternal deaths in the period, and 10 of these deaths were women not born in Ireland.  The report draws attention to how these women engage with Irish maternity services and the importance of the availability of interpretive services. A particular concern was the issue of engagement with the services by non-national patients in receipt of alternative medical advice from outside the country.</p><p>  In order to improve standardisation and to drive service quality, the HSE's National Clinical Programme in Obstetrics and Gynaecology has been working on the development of national clinical guidelines; to date, 20 guidelines have been developed, eight are under review and a further 20 have been commissioned. It is important to state that no matter what definitions are used or how case ascertainment is conducted, that Ireland continues to be a very safe country for a woman to give birth and our safety record compares favourably with other developed countries.</p></reply>

This will of course require detailed consideration and further consultation and I am developing proposals for Government on this matter.  In addition to consent systems, there is evidence from other countries that good co-ordination at hospital level and counselling arrangements for relatives are significant factors in achieving high organ donation rates.  In conjunction with the HSE's National Organ Donation and Transplantation Office I am also examining what practices and organisational  changes could further improve donation rates in this country. </p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that following discussions between my Department and the Road Safety Authority, the new Driving Licence Application Form contains a question asking applicants if they would like a code to be placed on their driving licence indicating their wish to become an organ donor.  Since the introduction of a new type of driving licence on 19 January, the code that will appear on new driving licences issued to people who indicate that they wish to become an organ donor, is 115.  My Department has written to the National Organ Donation and Transplantation Office and the Regional Directors of Operations in the HSE asking them to alert relevant hospital staff to this initiative and to the code which will appear on new driving licences of people who wish to donate.  My Department is also in discussion with the Department of Social Protection with a view to including a similar code on the Public Services Card.</p></reply>

Co-location, and ultimately tri-location with a maternity hospital, on the St James's campus will support the provision of excellence in clinical care that our children deserve. The new children&rsquo;s hospital is a key commitment in the Programme for Government and the largest project within the current Capital Plan.  </p><p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is the body charged with building the hospital. Following detailed consideration of the project management structures and governance arrangements required to enable delivery of the project as quickly as possible and to the highest quality, I intend to restructure the NPHDB to focus on the core function of planning, designing, building and equipping the new hospital.  The new Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group, which brings together the three existing paediatric hospitals, will now lead on functions relating to service transfer planning, human resource planning, philanthropy etc. which were previously within the remit of the NPHDB.</p><p>  In line with its core function of building the hospital, the membership of the restructured NPHDB must include the expertise to deal with this very large and complex capital project. The necessary appointments are under consideration and, in the interim, a transitional Board is in place comprising officials from my Department and the HSE, ensuring continued governance and decision-making for the project. </p><p>  The transitional Board is progressing a number of immediate issues. In this first phase of the project, the focus is on reconciling the brief with the new site, site and site preparation and new procurement processes. A joint group involving the HSE and St James's Hospital are meeting regularly to progress the enabling and decant work required. A shared services group has been established to focus on identifying the facilities which can be shared so as to optimise the build. While much of the work that has been done for the project in its previous location on the Mater site is transferable to the new site, a new design for the new site is required and in this regard a priority now for the NPHDB is the procurement of a new design team. A review of urgent care centre(s) configuration is underway and is expected to be complete within the coming weeks; this is key to finalising the scale of the facilities required on the St James&rsquo;s campus and informing the design. </p><p>  It is important to remember that, in addition to a new building, the new children's hospital entails the coming together of three existing paediatric hospitals (Temple Street, Crumlin and Tallaght).  I welcome the commitment expressed by the three existing hospitals to  becoming a single service well before the new hospital is built and the establishment of the new Children's Hospital Group, involving the three hospitals, is an important step in this regard. The  Group will have a non-statutory Board of Direction which will oversee the integration of services across the three hospitals, over time.  Dr Jim Browne has been appointed as its Chair, and will work closely with the Chairs of the three existing hospitals, who have welcomed his appointment.</p></reply>

I am advised that, in 2012, ninety cochlear implants were carried out with 42 children receiving implants and 48 adults.  In addition to providing the surgical services, the programme provides a comprehensive assessment service to potential candidates and a rehabilitative service to those actually implanted.</p><p>  In 2009 a National Review of Audiology Services was carried out by the HSE, to examine the services provided to children and adults nationwide, and to formulate a national plan for the services. The report of the National Audiology Review Group, published by the HSE in 2011, provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services, from new-born screening to assessment and management of adults and children with hearing problems, including cochlear implantation.   Two of the main recommendations in the report include the national roll-out of a universal new-born hearing screening programme and the establishment of a bone anchored hearing aid programme. The report also included a recommendation that continued ring-fenced financial support be provided for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children. </p><p>  The HSE is working closely with Beaumont Hospital to progress plans for both simultaneous and sequential bilateral implantation. The development of the service will require additional resources for Beaumont and these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 Estimates process.</p></reply>

In addition, the HSE is developing its Rehabilitation Medicine Programme within the Clinical Strategy and Programmes Directorate.  The Report is the overarching policy on neuro-rehabilitation services and includes proposals for a framework for the future of neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland, including key elements such as: guiding principles; implementation structure; methodology for implementation; and information and communication.</p><p>  The Report recognises that given the current economic climate, the focus in the short to medium term has to be on re-configuration of services, structures and resources and the enhancement of the skills and competencies required to meet the changing context.</p><p>   The key priority areas, as identified in the HSE's National Operational Plan for 2013 are to map and develop Integrated Service Area level rehabilitation networks; implement the model of care for rehabilitation services within the networks with a focus on community rehabilitation.</p><p>  An implementation plan beyond the overall operational plan commitments would not be beneficial, as the work involved to progress  networks and teams will require to be flexible and responsive to the areas identified and to their specific service profiles.</p><p>  The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has been working in collaboration with the National Disability Unit as part of an expert Working Group planning for the implementation of the Report.  The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has incorporated key elements of the Report into its own Model of Care and adopted the Strategy's recommendation of &quot;hub and spoke&quot; model for specialist rehabilitation services and is keen to progress with a comprehensive model for the continuation of such service into the community.  This co-operation will continue in 2013.</p></reply>

In 2012 the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) initiated a national project to compile, for the first time, an Outpatient Waiting List database based on patient-level information from individual hospitals. Now, for the first time, clear data on the OPD waiting list is being reported and is published on www.ntpf.ie.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals. In the first instance, this will allow resources to be targeted towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment. </p><p>  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. </p><p>  In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.</p></reply>

Discussions are ongoing within the HSE, and in consultation with the Department of Health to finalise the allocation of these resources and commence recruitment.  Business cases from each HSE Region are being finalised and examined, against each of the identified objectives, detailing how the funding is to be spent and the type and number of WTE to be recruited.  It is expected that this process will be concluded in the very near future with a view to recruitment of the additional staff proceeding as soon as possible.

However, the provision of modern, high quality, safe care requires increasing levels of cooperation and overarching systems of governance and communication. We know that the traditional practice of providing as many services as possible in every hospital is neither sustainable nor safe.  Experience in Ireland and abroad teaches us that a co-ordinated system of care is clearly better for patients than a sporadic approach from hospital to hospital.   The formation of Irish acute hospitals into a small number of groups, each with its own governance and management, will provide an optimum opportunity for hospital services to be configured to deliver high-quality, safe patient care in a cost-effective manner.  </p><p>  It was with this in mind that I appointed Professor John Higgins in June of last year to chair a Strategic Board on the establishment of Hospital Groups. I have received Professor Higgins&rsquo; report, which is based on a comprehensive consultation process and contains almost 60 recommendations on the formation, management and governance of hospital groups, all of which are strongly endorsed by the Strategic Board.  I will shortly submit this report to Government, to consider and decide on the final formation of each hospital group.  I appreciate that this report and the related  government decision are anxiously awaited: however, this is the most radical and most fundamental modernisation of our health system infrastructure since the State&rsquo;s foundation and I take very seriously my obligation to consider the report closely, to assure myself and my Cabinet colleagues that it provides a robust basis to enable timely access to a high quality and sustainable hospital service for those who need it. </p><p>  The Government will decide on the initial make up of hospital groups which will be established on an administrative basis pending the legislation required to set up hospital trusts by 2015. Before those trusts are established the composition and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed. </p></reply>

Noting this I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply in relation to the funding of the installation of wi-fi on buses and trains in the GDA.</p><p>  Outside of the GDA, my Department provides funding directly to Irish Rail for the implementation and development of public transport infrastructure projects, such as the installation of wi-fi on services operated by Irish Rail. Therefore, I have also referred the Deputy's question to Irish Rail for direct reply to provide the costs regarding the installation of wi-fi on trains outside of the GDA.
