The Labour Court has also been expanded and serves as a separate appeals body.</p><p>The putting in place of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 is the most far-reaching legislative reform in the area of employment and industrial relations in almost 70 years and replaces the previously existing five workplace relations bodies.  The result is a more straightforward and user friendly system allowing both expert and non-expert users navigate their way around the employment and industrial relations machinery.</p><p>As a result of this fundamental reform programme, the Employment Appeals Tribunal is being wound down.  No new claims or appeals have been received by the Tribunal since 30 September 2015.  All cases have been offered a first hearing which means the Employment Appeal Tribunal has no backlog. </p><p>There are approximately 700 cases remaining to be heard by the Tribunal before it can be formally dissolved. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-08a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1247" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120800047#WRA01000"><p>The revised Book of Quantum was published on the 5th of October 2016.  The Book was compiled by independent consultants and commissioned by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB).</p>  <p>  The revised Book of Quantum provides the most comprehensive research available on levels of personal injuries awards prevailing in Ireland.  It is based on a detailed analysis of 51,000 closed personal injury claims from 2013 and 2014 and includes compensation awards from Court cases, insurance company settlements, State Claims Agency cases and data relating to awards of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  It also contains more granular detail on injuries and new injury types and more narrowly defined compensation bands. </p>  <p>  The Book of Quantum sets out the amounts that may be awarded or assessed in personal injury claims for workplace, public liability and road accidents.  It does not set personal injury award levels.  It reflects settlements arrived at by insurance companies, PIAB, the State Claims Agency and the Courts so that all stakeholders involved in settling personal injury claims have an independent reference guide when assessing claims. </p>  <p>  In order for the economy to grow, and maintain competitiveness, it is vital to address insurance costs.  The Book of Quantum should allow for earlier settlement of claims and have a stabilising effect on compensation awards. </p>  <p>  I note in recent judgments of the High Court, the revised Book of Quantum has been referenced in the written judgments.  Universal application of the revised Book by all stakeholders will bring consistency in settlements.  This should reduce the volume of litigation and help reduce the cost of insurance.  This measure supports the work of Minister of State Murphy on the Cost of Insurance Working Group, aimed at tackling increasing insurance costs. </p>  <p>  I understand from PIAB that they propose to revise the Book of Quantum every three years.</p></reply>

Collaboration between the private and the public sector has been a core element in each plan&rsquo;s development, and will be central to each plan&rsquo;s delivery.  The first progress reports on these Plans have been finalised and will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  A key objective of the plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the aim of having the unemployment rate of each region within one per cent of the national average.</p>  <p>  The success of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs is crucial to the Government in meeting the ambition to create an additional 200,000 jobs, 135,000 of which are outside the Dublin region, by 2020. </p>  <p>  Employment has been growing continuously for the past 16 quarters and over the past year employment has grown in all regions.</p>  <p>  The most recent figures from the CSO also show that 72% of all jobs created in the past year were created outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  Continuing to work towards the ambitious targets at regional level requires a renewed focus on building on regional strengths, assets and areas of competitive advantage to develop the attractive and competitive environments for business to start, grow and succeed on international markets and to attract inward investment.</p></reply>

The case was heard on 24 October 2014 and the determination issued to the parties on 20 November 2014.  The details of the determination are available on the Workplace Relations Website <i>www.workplacerelations.ie.</i></p><p>In summary, the Tribunal were satisfied that a dismissal had occurred in this case and upheld the claimant's application under the Unfair Dismissals Acts.  The Tribunal found that the appropriate remedy was reinstatement and an award for losses suffered.</p><p>Once the determination of the Employment Appeals Tribunal has issued, the Tribunal has no further function in the matter it is <i>functus officio.</i></p><p>Determinations of the Employment Appeals Tribunal can be appealed by either party and the appeals procedures are set out in the relevant legislation under which each determination is made.  The mechanism for enforcing determinations of the Employment Appeals Tribunal is also prescribed in the relevant legislation and generally, this involves an application to the Circuit Court for an order directing compliance, or instituting proceedings in the District Court. </p><p>The collection of any money outstanding in respect of a Circuit Court order is the responsibility of the relevant County Sheriff. </p><p>Where the person's former employer goes into liquidation or receivership the insolvency payments scheme may apply.  The purpose of the insolvency payments scheme, which operates under the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act, 1984, is to protect certain outstanding pay-related entitlements due to employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.  These entitlements include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice &amp;amp; Terms of Employment Acts, 1973-2001, and certain pension contributions.  Various other statutory awards made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, Rights Commissioners, etc., are also covered by the scheme. </p><p>My colleague the Minister for Social Protection, has responsibility for the administration of payments from the insolvency payments scheme.</p></reply>

Strong leadership together with a skilled workforce that is committed to high performance is key to achieving this ambition.  SMEs in Ireland compete not only internationally to attract skills, but also nationally given the presence of large scale foreign owned enterprises here.</p><p>Employee participation in their company&rsquo;s ownership increases competitiveness and supports employment.</p><p>To progress the commitment set out in the Programme for Government, the Department of Finance carried out a consultation and review of share-based remuneration earlier this year. </p><p>The current share based incentives do not take account of the specific circumstances of SMEs, and are not an attractive proposition.  My Department, working together with the enterprise development agencies, submitted to the consultation process. </p><p>The Tax Strategy Group papers that are available online provide an outline of the current mechanisms, international comparisons and alternatives for change. </p><p>I am delighted that the Minister for Finance announced his intention to develop a new SME-focused share-based scheme to be introduced in Budget 2018.  This will require engagement by his Department with the European Commission to ensure that it will comply with State Aid rules.</p><p>I and my officials will continue to engage with the Department of Finance as the scheme design is progressed over the coming months.</p></reply>

Increasing and sustaining foreign direct investment (FDI) outside of Ireland&rsquo;s main urban areas forms a vital part of this.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2015-2019 includes a commitment to increase FDI in every region outside of Dublin by 30-40%.  Site visit statistics indicate that progress is being made towards that goal.  In 2015, 57% of site visits took place outside of Dublin, up from 43% in 2014.  The latest available figures for 2016 show this trend is continuing, with 58% of visits this year outside of the capital.</p>  <p>  To attract more FDI to the regions, the IDA must maintain an adequate supply of marketable serviced land and buildings that can be offered to potential investors.  There are currently 21 vacant IDA Ireland-owned properties which are available for investment.  If IDA did not have such properties available it would severely diminish Ireland&rsquo;s ability to compete for mobile FDI, particularly in regional Ireland.</p>  <p>  The IDA actively encourages clients to locate in regional locations.  I also encourage companies to do likewise.  The final decision, however, always lies with the investor itself.  It must also be borne in mind that the number of site visits to a county does not necessarily reflect FDI activity there, especially as 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA clients.</p></reply>

A new single body of first instance called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) was created from 1<sup>st</sup>October 2015 and a separate appeals body, which is effectively an expanded Labour Court.</p><p>The WRC incorporates the functions of the Labour Relations Commission (including the Rights Commissioner Service), the Equality Tribunal, the Employment Appeals Tribunal (first instance jurisdiction only), and the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA). </p><p>Since its establishment the WRC has published its Annual Report for 2015 and two six monthly Progress Reports and Commentaries.  These Progress Reports include activity reports and data on the work of the Information and Customer Services and Inspection and Enforcement Divisions of the Commission.  Both the Information and Customer Services and Inspection and Enforcement Divisions of the WRC carry out the functions of the former National Employment Rights Authority (NERA). </p><p>The Progress Reports set out the work undertaken by the WRC in its first year of operation and also identify trends emerging in dispute resolution, adjudication, labour inspection, and enforcement. </p><p>The Progress Reports and Commentaries are published on the Workplace Relations Website and can be accessed at <i>ie</i>. </p></reply>

Companies that Enterprise Ireland works with, including the agri<b>-</b>food <font color="#4F4F4F">s</font>ector, are a vital source of employment in every county in Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland is also responsible for attracting overseas Food &amp;amp; Beverage companies into Ireland and for developing new Food &amp;amp; Beverage start-ups.</p><p>The Food sector is one of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s key exporting sectors and employs in excess of 48,000 people throughout the country.  In line with Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s development plan for the food industry, and the Foodwise 2025 Strategy led by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Enterprise Ireland is committed to working with Food and Beverage companies to help them to scale, be competitive and innovative, and to create sustainable jobs across every region in Ireland.  </p><p>In 2015, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s portfolio included five food ingredient companies, employing approximately 1200 people.  Some of these companies carry out a diverse range of manufacturing, services and R&amp;amp;D activities serving global markets.  </p><p>There are undoubtedly challenges globally, including Brexit, to the development of the Food Industry in Ireland.  I am confident however, that the Agencies under my remit will continue to work closely with the sector, and that they will have a range of supports to offer, to ensure the industry remains competitive in export markets.</p></reply>

The usual way of gauging business sentiment at a point in time is by way of survey.  The reliability of survey results depends on many variables such as sample size, timing of the survey and questionnaire design.</p>  <p>  The Dublin Quarterly Business Trends Survey referred to involved surveying 222 businesses in August 2016.  Given the timing of the survey, just post Brexit, it is likely that the UK&rsquo;s vote to leave the EU was a contributing factor in the results of that survey, particularly as there were a number of questions specifically on Brexit. </p>  <p>  More recently a survey released on 23 November, at the Enterprise Ireland/Deloitte CEO Forum, found that 96% of Irish CEOs are planning to expand over the next 12 months, while 86% are confident of revenue growth in their companies in 2017.  It also found 73% of CEOs citing Brexit as an opportunity for more Irish companies to export to Europe.  </p>  <p>  My own view is that, on balance business confidence is broadly stable at the moment.  We will continue to work across sectors and regions to drive opportunity, exports and jobs growth.</p>  <p>  While IDA and Enterprise Ireland do not publish regional targets, the Dublin Regional APJ aims to increase employment in the Dublin region by 10-15% over the period to 2020, delivering 66,000 additional jobs.</p></reply>

CETA is a comprehensive and progressive trade agreement between the EU and Canada.  It removes over 99% of tariffs that currently hinder trade between the EU and Canada.  It is expected to increase bilateral trade by &euro;12 billion per year, and to generate growth and new jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.  </p><p>Given the position taken by Ireland and other Member States, the Commission submitted CETA to the Council for decision as a mixed Agreement.  That is one requiring both EU and individual Member States ratification.  As this process may take a number of years to complete the Agreement provides for provisional application.  Provisional application allows businesses and consumers to enjoy the benefits and new opportunities of the agreement as soon as possible in respect of good and services. </p><p>The European Parliament vote on the provisional application of the Agreement is scheduled to take place in February 2017.  Should the Parliament give its consent, the agreement will be provisionally applied.  The process of ratification of the Agreement can then commence in Member States according to their constitutional requirements.  The provisions regarding investment protection will only apply after the agreement has been ratified by all Member States. </p></reply>

My priority is to deliver on the Government&rsquo;s goal to help create 200,000 additional jobs by 2020, including 135,000 jobs outside Dublin.  The success of the Regional Plans plans will be crucial to the Government in meeting this ambitious target.</p>  <p>  I am currently working with Ministerial colleagues to develop the 2017 Action Plan for Jobs.  My priority is to ensure that the 2017 Plan is ambitious and impactful and keeps us on track to deliver on our 2020 jobs targets through the delivery of a business environment which enhances our competitiveness and supports sustainable enterprise and employment growth in all regions.</p></reply>

It should be remembered that this will continue to give Ireland access to a market of 450 million people, even after the UK&rsquo;s departure.</p>  <p>  While Government is working to ensure a close future relationship between the UK and the EU, our position is that access to the Single Market must be on the basis of acceptance of all four freedoms &ndash; free movement of goods, services, capital and people.  It is clear that everyone should play by the same rules.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently advocated greater progress being made in further strengthening the Single Market. Indeed, as recently as the week before last, I led an initiative where my Ministerial counterparts from nine other Member States and I signed a joint letter to President Juncker calling on the European Commission to be ambitious in advancing the Single Market for services.  This demonstrates the positive influence that Ireland can bring to shaping the future success of the Single Market, through building alliances with a wide range of Member States across the Union, and which can ultimately enhance the benefits accruing to Irish businesses and consumers.  Deepening the Single Market and negotiating improved access to third country markets under EU FTA's are key elements in offsetting the adverse impacts of Brexit.</p></reply>

The key action in relation to this is a proposal for legislation that will ensure that all public bodies provide ISL users with free ISL interpretation when availing of their statutory services.  In order to respond effectively to the needs of ISL users, a pragmatic and feasible approach is required, and I am certain that this action - and another action in the Strategy which relates to expanded translation services - will be an effective way forward once implemented.</p>  <p>  A draft of the Disability Strategy will be prepared with the assistance of the National Disability Strategy Steering Group for consideration by Government in early January, and I intend that the Strategy will be in place shortly afterwards.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the European Parliament motion referred to.

Such international liaison has led to many parallel investigations with international law enforcement agencies. </p>  <p>  The State is committed to providing two members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to Europol.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in August 2016, one of the two members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na based at Europol Headquarters in the Hague was successful in an internal Garda competition and was assigned to a position in Dublin.  I am further informed that arrangements are in-hand for a competition to be held to fill the vacancy arising on a permanent basis.  In the interim,  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is represented by the full-time Garda Liaison Officer and an additional member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned on temporary secondment to work at Europol.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p>  <p>  Blanchardstown Garda District forms part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West Division.  I am further informed that the Garda strength of the Blanchardstown Garda District, on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 312 of which 28 are Community Garda&iacute;.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organise Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  The Commissioner has advised that it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide including 62 to the DMR West Division.</p></reply>

This request also sought for the listing to be suspended to allow technical discussions to take place between officials.  This request remained under consideration by the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service until we received a response on 17 November.  </p>  <p>  While the request was still under consideration, the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service made some changes to the operation of the listing.  These changes were designed to remove the aviation sector from the scope of taxes imposed as a result of the listing.  This change means that withholding taxes are not included on the payment of aircraft lease rentals from Brazilian airlines to Irish aircraft leasing companies. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the reply from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service on 17 November rejected our request for the listing to be suspended.   Following further follow up discussions, the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service have agreed to meet a technical delegation from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to discuss this issue.  Our Ambassador in Brazil is now working on scheduling this meeting as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  The response received from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service makes clear that Ireland has been included on the list because our statutory rate of corporation tax is below 17% which is the benchmark set under Brazilian law.  In our formal submission to Brazil we highlighted that Ireland also has a 25% corporation tax rate on passive income and a 33% rate on chargeable gains.  We also stressed that the 12.5% rate has been settled policy in Ireland since 2003.  Ireland's corporation tax take has also typically been very close to the EU and OECD averages both in terms of corporate tax as a percentage of GDP and in terms corporate tax as a percentage of total tax revenue.  We believe it is inappropriate to include Ireland on a black list simply because we apply a low tax rate to a wide tax base which is fully in line with recommended OECD best practice.  We remain hopeful that discussions between Brazilian Federal Revenue Service and Irish officials will enable us to fully explain our corporate tax system and hopefully see Ireland removed from the Brazilian list. </p>  <p>  I should also add that the response received from Brazil on 17 November makes clear that Brazil does not consider Ireland to be a tax haven.  I strongly reject any allegations that we are a tax haven.  Ireland does not meet any of the international standards for being considered a tax haven.  Ireland is fully compliant with all international best practices in the areas of tax transparency and exchange of information.  Ireland's corporate tax policies are designed to attract real and substantive operations to Ireland.  Ireland has not been and will never will be a brass-plate location.  We only have and want real substantive FDI, the kind that brings real jobs and investment into Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is an active participant in global work to reform the international corporate tax system.  We have implemented Country by Country Reporting, agreed the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and are working towards the implementation of the remaining OECD BEPS recommendations both domestically and internationally.  On Budget Day, I published an Update on Ireland's International Tax Strategy which highlights our continuing efforts in this regard. </p></reply>

Guidelines relating to requests for opinions submitted for non-LCD cases through the Revenue Technical Service (RTS) are available on under &quot;Guidelines on Revenue's Service to Practitioners and Business Taxpayers&quot;.  The guidelines set out the procedures to be followed in relation to seeking an opinion from Revenue on a tax matter and also provide details of the areas within Revenue with responsibility for issuing opinions.  While it is open to any taxpayer to seek an opinion from Revenue on the tax treatment of a particular transaction or activity, the circumstances in which a taxpayer should require an opinion from Revenue are relatively limited.  This is because Revenue already publishes extensive detailed information, on the application of tax legislation, in various tax briefings and guidelines which are available on the Revenue website. </p><p>An opinion will be provided by Revenue where the issues are complex, information is not readily available or there is genuine uncertainty in relation to the application of the tax rules as set down in the legislation.  An opinion will provide Revenue's view of the correct application of tax law to a particular transaction or situation and will assist the taxpayer in filing a correct tax return as required under the legislation.  Accordingly, the issue of an opinion by Revenue in respect of a complex tax matter is not about forgoing any tax.</p><p>On 7 September 2016 I confirmed in the D&aacute;il that Revenue would be amending its guidance and instructions to provide that tax opinions will not remain valid beyond five years without a full review.  </p><p>I am informed by Revenue that it has updated its guidance to confirm that opinions issued to taxpayers, whether multinational companies or other taxpayers, will remain valid for a maximum period of five years.  Previously the maximum period was seven years.  However, depending on the particular circumstances, a shorter period than five years may be specified.  After the maximum validity period, whether five years or less, an application for a renewal or extension must be made if the taxpayer wishes for the opinion to continue.  An opinion will only remain valid for so long as the facts and circumstances on which it is based continue to exist and the relevant legislation and practice remains in place.</p><p>Revenue has also confirmed that it has begun reviewing a number of opinions that were provided more than five years ago.</p><p>While statistics have not been compiled on the number of tax opinions issued by Revenue each year, in responding to the European Commission enquiries in relation to tax ruling practice in the various Member States, Revenue identified that in the period 2010-2012 the total number of advance opinions issued to companies on various matters relating to corporation tax was as follows: <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>128</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>108</td></tr></table></p><p>To facilitate accountability Revenue has committed to publishing in its future Annual Reports the number of opinions it issues each year.  </p><p>In the context of its State Aid enquiries into ruling practices in different Member States, the European Commission requested that Ireland provide it with certain information in respect of Revenue's administrative practice in relation to advance opinions.  The information provided to the Commission included an overview of Revenue's administrative practice with regard to the provision of advance opinions, the type of issues on which opinions are provided, and details of opinions provided to over 300 companies, including all opinions issued in the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 on a range of issues.</p></reply>

This independence is seen as critical to maintaining the integrity of the taxation system and forms a key pillar of Revenue's Governance framework.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that their current compliance intervention activity is focused on patronage shares received by suppliers of milk as a consequence of and in proportion to the quantity of milk supplied and the extent to which those share allocations are at values other than market value.  Where a cooperative does not receive the market price for the shares issued, then the profit accruing i.e. the difference between the market value of the shares issued and the price paid for these shares, forms part of the value received from the sale of milk and is accordingly assessable to income tax. </p>  <p>  This programme of compliance activity by Revenue is in its initial phase and accordingly I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to say at this stage the numbers of farmers that might be encompassed by this compliance programme or the additional tax yield that might arise.  I am informed by Revenue that the initial phase involves a letter of enquiry to certain farmers as to whether the value of the shares received was included in the accounts for the years in question.  Farmers who disclosed the share value received should not have any additional income tax liability in relation to the specific matter raised in these enquiries.  Where the share value received was not included in the accounts for the years in question, then the matter of an additional tax liability may arise.</p>  <p>  I am assured by Revenue that there has been no change in policy in relation to this issue.  It is well established, under general taxation principles that a person is taxable by reference to the value received for services rendered or product sold.  Predominantly this value is generally received in the form of cash payments.  However, where value is provided in the form of non-monetary benefits, such as shares, the same principle applies. Revenue has issued guidance very recently reiterating its view on this matter.  In the context of the engagement between Revenue and individual taxpayers or their agents, Revenue will be happy to provide any further clarification of its position in this matter that may be necessary or helpful.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-08a.184.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120800049#WRC02500"><p>The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980).  This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage.  The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.  </p>  <p>  Where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of income tax as a separate and unconnected individual.  Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, tax credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.</p>  <p>  From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners.  Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting and it would be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  Furthermore, while there may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the partial transferability of the standard rate band and tax credits, their legal status as spouses/civil partners has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.  To counter tax avoidance, numerous restrictive provisions regarding transactions between "connected persons" are contained in the various Tax Acts and the definition of "connected persons" extends to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners.  Such provisions could be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. </p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage.  Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.</p>  <p>  The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Mr. Leo Varadkar TD.  However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples.  This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</p></reply>

These lenders are seen as an important alternative source of credit to Irish businesses which is why I provided that they would not be impacted by the introduction of the new subsection (5A) to section 110 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which is currently being inserted by Finance Bill 2016.  </p>  <p>  However it is also possible for an Irish resident company carrying on a loan origination business to achieve near tax neutrality under the normal corporation tax rules.  Equally, if the investment bank that was based in a country with which we have a double tax agreement (and which taxes interest received from non-residents), lent directly to its Irish customers, then no Irish tax would arise on those profits.  For a non-resident lender to achieve Irish tax neutrality there is an administration burden placed on the Irish borrowers.</p>  <p>  The main benefits of using a section 110 company are therefore the certainty which the lenders have in relation to the tax treatment available; in addition Irish borrowers would experience an increased administrative burden if a non-resident lender is used rather than a section 110 company. </p>  <p>  There is no loss to the Exchequer from allowing section 110 companies carry out loan originations in a tax neutral manner.</p></reply>

An individual may claim tax relief on qualifying fees paid in respect of any person as long as he or she has paid the fees.  Qualifying fees means tuition fees, but not examination fees, registration fees or administration fees.  In addition, relief is not available in respect of any part of the fees that are met by way of a grant or scholarship.  The maximum limit on such qualifying fees at present is &euro;7,000 per annum, per individual, per course.  Moreover, for the purposes of the relief, the first &euro;3,000 of qualifying fees in respect of a full-time course, and the first &euro;1,500 of qualifying fees in respect of a part-time course, is disregarded.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that in the case of the person concerned, his income and tax credits for 2015 were such that no income tax was payable by him.  In October of this year, the person concerned made a claim for tax relief in respect of tuition fees paid in 2015 in respect of the 2015/2016 academic year.  In the circumstances there was no income tax liability against which to offset the tuition fees paid.</p>  <p>  Tax reliefs, in general, are only available to those who are liable to taxation.  Consequently relief in respect of tuition fees for third-level courses is contingent on a claimant having an income tax liability for the tax year in respect of which the claim is made.  I have no plans to change this basic principle.  As the person concerned did not pay any income tax for the tax year 2015, he is not entitled to any refund of tax as a result of having paid fees in respect of a third-level course in that year.</p></reply>

Choice-based letting is a method that can be used for allocating social housing in a manner that offers more choice and involvement for applicant households and thereby reduces the likelihood of a refusal.  In the context of progressing the introduction of Choice&ndash;Based Lettings (CBL) as an allocation system for local authorities, in line with commitments in the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>and the Government's <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness,</i>my Department sought feedback from local authorities on two occasions in recent years on the level of refusals of offers of social housing across the local authority system. </p><p>The data received as part of this process only covered limited time-periods.  In addition, it was incomplete and was not directly comparable across local authorities.  Nevertheless, it did give a general indication of the level of refusals around the country and assisted my Department in the deliberative process.  For example, it clearly showed that those local authorities that had introduced CBL had seen a significant reduction in their refusal rates. </p></reply>

This is scheduled for delivery in Q1 2017 with all key stakeholders highly engaged and will underpin many of the ongoing and future actions taken to address vacant homes across the country.</p><p>My Department supports a number of schemes that help to address the issues of vacant and derelict housing while also provide new social housing for those on waiting lists around the country.  Earlier this year I introduced a programme to provide additional support to local authorities in remediating more seriously derelict social houses which require a greater level of remediation than is possible either through the current programme for the return of vacant social houses, or through the normal pre-letting works carried out by the local authorities.  I expect this programme to deliver around 280 remediated social houses in 2016 and further work will continue into 2017.</p><p>In October this year, I announced two specific new schemes - the Repair and Leasing Scheme and the Buy and Repair Scheme - which are intended to assist private property owners, local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to harness the accommodation potential that exists in certain vacant properties across Ireland.</p><p>The Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) is currently being piloted in Waterford and Carlow, and it is my intention that the scheme will be rolled out nationally in Q2 2017.</p><p>The basic principle behind the scheme is to assist a property owner to bring a suitable vacant property in need of repairs up to the standard required for social housing leasing by providing a mechanism of upfront funding for the repairs in exchange in return for the property being made available for social housing through a lease for a period of at least 10 years.  The cost of the repairs will be offset against the rental income over the duration of the lease.  Given the complexity of operating a new scheme such as this, it was agreed that a pilot phase would be appropriate to work through processes at an operational level before expanding nationally.  Over the period 2016 to 2021, it is anticipated that up to 3,500 units will be secured for social housing under this scheme and I will be making up to &euro;140m available. </p><p>In parallel to the Repair and Leasing Scheme I also announced a new &lsquo;Buy and Renew&rsquo; funding scheme to support local authorities and AHBs to purchase and renew housing units in need of remediation, and make them available for social housing use.  This scheme will commence in 2017 when I will be making &euro;25 million available and I am proposing to increase this to as much as &euro;50 million in 2018, which should result in at least 400 - 500 renewed houses &ndash; or a greater number if costs per unit prove reasonable. </p></reply>

The matter raised in the Question is an operational issue in the day-to-day delivery of services and is a matter for Kildare County Council in the first instance.   </p>  <p>  Homeless services are administered at the regional level and in each region a Joint Homelessness Consultative Forum exists which includes representation from the relevant State and non-governmental organisations involved in the delivery of homeless services in a particular region.

The independent Pyrite Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated.  Dwellings which have no significant damage but have reactive pyrite in the hardcore should be monitored and only remediated if they display significant damage due to pyritic heave.  This remains the position with regard to dwellings which do not display significant pyritic damage.</p><p>The relevant provisions of <i>Pyrite Resolution Act 2013</i>and the eligibility criteria of the pyrite remediation scheme are broadly reflective of the conclusions and recommendations of Panel&rsquo;s report.  The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with <i>I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol</i>.  It is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2. I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion.</p><p>There is no sunset provision in the Act. Where a dwelling, which has a Damage Condition Rating of 1 and is currently not eligible under the scheme, progresses to a Damage Condition Rating of 2, an application can be made at that point in time for inclusion in the pyrite remediation scheme.</p></reply>

However, customers who were already in receipt of Pre-Retirement Allowance on that date continue to receive payment as long as they satisfied the conditions for payment.  </p>  <p>  The overall concern in recent years has been to protect the value of weekly social welfare rates.  Expenditure on pensions, at approximately &euro;7 billion, is the largest block of expenditure in my Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approximately 35% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p>  <p>  Each year more people are reaching pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision, which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided for the necessary amendments to increase the State pension age in line with the National Pensions Framework as set out in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.  State pension age is being increased in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66 by the abolition of the State pension (transition).  The pension age will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  It is anticipated that this rate of increase in pension age will be no faster than the rate of increased longevity.  It is also anticipated that the duration of a typical State pension may continue to increase, albeit at a slower pace than if these increases in pension age were not provided for.</p>  <p>  Where individuals are out of employment prior to pension age they often seek the support of either the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes.  Legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions is not entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment. </p>  <p>  People in receipt of a jobseeker's payment must engage with the Department's activation measures and can face sanctions if they fail to do so.  However, since January 2014, these criteria have been eased for people aged 62 and over.  They are able to avail voluntarily of an array of supports from the Department if they wish to return to work, training or education but sanctions are not applied to this cohort, should they decide they do not wish to engage with the activation process.</p>  <p>  Currently individuals who claim jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in their 65th year continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  While this is currently up to their 66th birthday, this approach will continue to extend their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment continuing for another year when the pension age rises to 67, and indeed a further year when it rises to 68 in 2028.  This eligibility is of course still subject to satisfying conditions such as the &lsquo;genuinely seeking work&rsquo; condition. </p>  <p>  Special arrangements have also been made so that this cohort of jobseekers register with their local office once a year and their payments can be paid directly into their bank accounts. </p>  <p>  In light of these existing provisions there are no plans to reintroduce the Pre-Retirement Allowance scheme for new entrants. </p></reply>

However, even with these staff, additional capacity was still required to meaningfully engage with unemployed jobseekers and in particular with the long-term unemployed who require a significantly higher level of support.  </p>  <p>  The allocation of additional resources to the activation of long term unemployed jobseekers was the focus of an updated &ldquo;Pathways to Work&rdquo; policy statement published in July 2013.  Having examined various resourcing and contracting options, and taking note of recommendations by the OECD among others, it was decided to procure additional capacity from providers with expertise and experience in the provision of employment supports or related services. </p>  <p>  Two companies, Seetec and Turas Nua, have been contracted to deliver the service.  These companies have established over 80 service locations around the country and employ nearly 600 staff.  This additional capacity has increased my Department&rsquo;s ability to provide supports to Jobseekers by augmenting and complementing the department&rsquo;s own activation capacity as well as the capacity already provided by the Local Employment Service (LES) and Job Clubs. </p>  <p>  The roll-out of JobPath commenced on a &ldquo;soft-launch&rdquo; basis in July 2015.  To date, the additional JobPath capacity has enabled my Department to provide an intensive one-to-one employment support and advisory service to over 60,000 long-term unemployed jobseekers who would otherwise not have received such a service. </p>  <p>  JobPath is a payment by results model and all initial costs are borne by the companies.  The companies are paid registration fees and job sustainment fees.  A registration fee may be claimed only when a jobseeker has developed a personal progression plan. Job sustainment fees are payable for each 13 week period of sustained employment, up to a maximum of 52 weeks (i.e. 4 payments).  Payments to the JobPath companies amounted to &euro;1.2m in 2015.  It is estimated that payments will amount to c. &euro;25m in 2016 and to &euro;65m in 2017.  The overall cost will be determined by the number of people who engage with the service and the number of jobseekers who successfully obtain and sustain employment. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The new service has been available since 28th July 2016, replacing an older site that enabled jobseekers to search for job opportunities based on job type and location, but did not facilitate employers to search for suitable jobseekers on the site &ndash; they had to rely on candidates finding and applying for a job from among the many thousands hosted on the system. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Department commissioned the development and implementation of a new service that would enable both employers and jobseekers to search for each other using competencies and skillsets as well as the traditional job-type classifications.  As part of the new service, candidate profiles will be automatically matched to job specifications posted by employers with both candidate and the employer notified when a suitable match is found.  Candidates can also use the site to apply for the jobs advertised.  The system will also integrate with the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Intreo service and will include other new features such as allowing jobseekers to post CVs and video profiles if they wish.</p>  <p>  To facilitate the transition to the new service it was necessary to take the service offline for a few days.  The service is being implemented on phased basis which means, unfortunately, that there is some service disruption while work is ongoing.  There have also been some teething problems with the first phase implementation, but the Department is working with the supplier to resolve these.  A significant upgrade was implemented in November 2016.  This has resolved many of the teething issues and there has been a noticeable improvement in performance.  Further improvements and new functionality will be added over the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  Video guides are available on the site to assist employers through the various stages of the vacancy creation and advertisement process, including one specifically directed at Community Employment sponsors.  To date over 5000 Community Employment vacancies have been advertised on the new site.</p>  <p>  Employers or any person experiencing difficulties with the website can contact the Department&rsquo;s National Contact Centre on 1890 800 024 for assistance.  Additional resources have been assigned to expedite queries.</p></reply>

It has experienced decades of violence since gaining independence in 1962.  Violence in 2012 plunged the country into further instability and widespread conflict, and a major humanitarian crisis.  The humanitarian situation across the country remains extremely serious.  2.3 million people, out of a population of 4.6 million, are in need of humanitarian assistance, 1.1 million of them children.  Life expectancy in CAR is now just 50 years.</p>  <p>  Over 380,000 people are internally displaced, with a further 450,000 having fled to neighbouring countries.  Those displaced within CAR are in need of protection and access to basic services, with approximately 40% in temporary camps.  Over 2 million people are facing an emergency food security situation.  In rural areas, only 34% of the population has access to protected water points, while in urban areas only 22% of the population has access to a safe water supply network.  </p>  <p>  In response to these urgent humanitarian needs, Ireland has contributed over &euro;19 million in humanitarian assistance since 2013 to ensure access to food, health, shelter, and water and sanitation services for those most affected.  Assistance is channeled through Ireland&rsquo;s UN and NGO partners who have a presence on the ground and capacity for responding to complex crises.  In 2016 alone, Ireland has provided just over &euro;6 million to the crisis in CAR.  This includes support to NGO partners Concern, Oxfam Ireland, and Plan International Ireland which are providing education, livelihoods, water and sanitation, and protection programmes for displaced and host communities.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has also contributed to the work of UN agencies and in particular the Common Humanitarian Fund for CAR. Ireland is a strong supporter of such Country-Based Pooled Funds which allow for decisions to be made locally on the allocation of resources to respond most effectively to urgent needs.  Ireland provides &euro;3 annually to the Fund which supports sectors such as food security, protection, education and shelter for communities affected by the crisis.</p>  <p>  Ireland also provided &euro;2 million to the UNHCR in 2016 for its Regional Response Appeal for CAR which directs humanitarian support to refugees from CAR currently seeking refuge in neighbouring countries.</p>  <p>  In addition, we work closely with our EU partners on the humanitarian situation.  In additional to individual member State contributions, EU funding for the Central African Republic has amounted to &euro;21 million so far this year. </p></reply>

I discussed the political and humanitarian situation in Somalia during my visit to Kenya last week.  Five million people are now food insecure throughout the country, with over a million facing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity.  This is a 20% increase since early 2016. Food prices are rising, and poor rainfall in southern and central Somalia has led to a dramatic reduction in cereal production.  The severe food and nutrition situation particularly affects the estimated 1.1 million internally displaced persons, who are highly vulnerable to disease outbreaks and exploitation.</p>  <p>  The EU is responding to the crisis through a range of measures.  In December 2015, &euro;17.5 million was allocated to Somalia through an EU package to respond to the effects of El Ni&ntilde;o in the Greater Horn of Africa.  This contribution was directed to addressing the effects of drought, primarily in Puntland and Somaliland.  In October 2016, the European Trust Fund for Africa allocated a further &euro;8 million to Somalia to respond to the effects of El Ni&ntilde;o, including drought. </p>  <p>  The European Commission has provided &euro;29 million in humanitarian assistance to Somalia under the EU&rsquo;s 2016 Horn of Africa Humanitarian Implementation Plan.  This also supports communities coping with the effects of drought, including by providing livelihood and food assistance, and access to safe water.  Somalia also benefits from longer-term development funding from the European Development Fund, with a focus on building resilience and long-term food security. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also responding directly.  We have provided &euro;5.93 million in humanitarian assistance through UN agencies and NGOs in Somalia so far in 2016.

In 2014, a comprehensive review by the OECD Development Assistance Committee of Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation noted that Ireland had &ldquo;consistently played an important agenda-setting role on gender equality and women's empowerment&rdquo;.</p><p><i>Ireland played </i>a leadership role in the process of agreeing the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, adopted at the UN <i>in September 2015, </i>ensuring that specific targets on gender equality, including violence against women and girls, were included both under a standalone goal, and mainstreamed across the framework.</p><p>Irish Aid&rsquo;s work on gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment focuses on the provision of direct funding to gender equality programmes as well as ensuring the systematic integration of the needs and interests of women and girls into all aspects of the aid programme.  It is estimated that 46% of Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral ODA has gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment as a key objective, significantly higher than the OECD average. </p><p>Funding in our key partner countries supports specific projects focused on addressing gender based violence, improving women&rsquo;s political participation, increasing access to quality education and health care, and providing greater economic opportunities for women and girls.  The importance of high quality secondary education for girls was impressed on me by the girls themselves when I visited secondary schools receiving Irish Aid funding in Moroto in Karamoja, during my visit to Uganda in July, and in Tuum in Samburu County in Kenya during my visit last week.</p><p>In addition, Ireland prioritises the strengthening of the capacity of the multi-lateral system to promote gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment.  Irish Aid provides core funding to UN Women, UNICEF and UNFPA, as well as direct support to a range of multilateral initiatives such the UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women and the UN Programme on Gender Statistics. </p><p><i>The Government considers gender-based violence to be a fundamental abuse of human rights and a priority for the aid programme.  We have prioritised policy development, funding and research to address the issue.  The OECD concluded that Ireland has been a &lsquo;powerful force behind the stronger donor focus on tackling violence against women&rsquo;.</i></p><p>Most recently Ireland argued strongly for a clearer focus on gender and on gender based violence in humanitarian programming at the World Humanitarian Summit which I attended in Istanbul in May.  </p></reply>

Compensation of employees  consists of wages and salaries, and of employers' social contributions.  This is, therefore, a gross pay measure but in ESA 2010 terms this relates to the whole of the General Government sector rather than the Exchequer pay bill as set out in the Expenditure Report. </p></reply>

These licences contain 26 conditions which have been refined over the years, the majority of which are central to hare welfare. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department understands that the Irish Coursing Club has extensive systems and practices in place to underpin the welfare of hares and greyhounds involved in coursing.   </p>  <p>  A Monitoring Committee on Coursing is in place, comprised of officials from my Department, the ICC and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to monitor developments in coursing, and in that regard, the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well-controlled and responsible manner in the interests of both hares and greyhounds.   </p></reply>

In addition, one of the means to help improve health outcomes in this area is through the expansion of the National First Response Network.  Community first responder groups comprise this national network.  These are people from local communities who are trained in basic life support and the use of defibrillators that attend a potentially life threatening emergency in their area.  They are then able to provide an early intervention in situations such as heart attack or cardiac arrest by providing, among other things, resuscitation and defibrillation.</p>  <p>  Cardiac First Responders (CFR) Ireland, launched in 2015, is the national umbrella organisation for Community First Responders Groups.  CFR Ireland works with the National Ambulance Service, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council and the Centre for Emergency Medical Science UCD.  There are currently 141 Community First Responder groups tasked by the National Ambulance Service.  If an emergency 999/112 call for cardiac arrest, choking, chest pain or breathing difficulties is made to the National Ambulance Service in an area where a CFR group is established, the on-duty CFR member gets a text from the National Ambulance Service at the same time that an ambulance is despatched with location and call details.  The First Responder then goes straight to the scene and administers initial care (defibrillation if required) until the National Ambulance Service Emergency resources arrive.</p></reply>

The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is currently evaluating the tenders, received at the end of October, for the main and specialist contractors for the new children&rsquo;s hospital and for the two satellite centres.  It is expected that the contracts for the satellite centres at Tallaght and Connolly Hospital will be awarded in Q1 2017 and that the centres can open in 2018, significantly enhancing access to urgent care and outpatient services for children from the Greater Dublin Area.  Building work on the main site is expected to be  completed by 2020.</p>  <p>  The satellite centres will be an integral part of, and come under the governance of, the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  This will include staffing, quality assurance, education and training, and branding.  In addition, staff of the main hospital will rotate through the centres.</p>  <p>  Each centre will provide urgent care as well as secondary outpatient services including rapid access general paediatric clinics.  The aim is to improve geographic access to urgent care for children in the Greater Dublin Area and support primary and community care paediatrics, as well as reducing Emergency Department and outpatient attendance at the main site. </p>  <p>  Each centre will provide consultant-led urgent care from staff of the new children&rsquo;s hospital with observation beds (4-6 hour) and appropriate diagnostics.  Each centre is projected to deal with 25,000 urgent care attendances per annum.</p>  <p>  The satellite centres will also provide general community and paediatric clinics including developmental paediatrics, multidisciplinary care for children with chronic stable conditions and other outpatient services.  Each centre is expected to cater for a minimum of 15,000 outpatient attendances per annum.</p>  <p>  Child sexual abuse unit examination, observation and therapy rooms will be provided in the satellite centres.  The satellite centre at Blanchardstown will also include two HSE paediatric care primary care dental services operating theatres. </p></reply>

These fish have an approximate point of landing value of &euro;1.26 billion.  Ireland&rsquo;s total share of the TAC&rsquo;s in 2016 amounted to 216,261 tonnes with a value of approximately &euro;201million. This represents 20% by tonnage and 16% by value.  These figures fluctuate depending on the state of the stocks and the markets from year to year.  Also, they do not include valuable inshore fisheries e.g. crab, lobster, whelk which are not managed under the TAC system. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s share of a particular TAC varies depending on the stock. For example, we have 86% of the Celtic Sea Herring stock and 15% of the Celtic Sea Cod stock.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that Ireland&rsquo;s landings have substantially increased (from 85,700 tonnes in 1973 to 201,000 in 2016) since Ireland joined the EU in 1973.</p>  <p>  The share out of stocks between Member States was established as a principle of the first CFP in 1983 and was based on the average catch of each Member State over a period of reference years.  The reference period used to determine the allocation percentages (keys) for many of the traditional fish stocks around the coast runs from 1973 &ndash; 1978.  This means that each Member State's share of each Community quota should remain constant over time.  </p>  <p>  Ireland successfully argued that recognition had to be given to the &ldquo;special needs of regions where the local population is particularly dependent upon fishing and the industries allied to&rdquo;.  This gave rise to the Hague Preferences which can double Irelands fishing opportunities for certain stocks dependant on overall TAC level.</p>  <p>  At the end of each year at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, Ministers set the total allowable catches (TACs) for a number of stocks important to Community fleets.  Each TAC is then divided up among Member States in the form of quotas on the basis of &ldquo;relative stability&rdquo; after which Member States are free to manage their quotas at national level as they see fit.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's point concerning "foreign supertankers", all foreign fishing vessels, on the north-west coast, are precluded from Ireland&rsquo;s 12 mile fishing zone, other than for transit purposes and all foreign pelagic fishing vessels, including pelagic factory vessels,  are also precluded from Ireland&rsquo;s 12 mile fishing zone on  the west coast.  In addition,  Irish fishing  vessels equal to or greater than 36.58 m (120 ft)  in length,  are precluded from Ireland&rsquo;s 12 mile zone.  Under the Voisinage arrangement Northern Ireland vessels were given access in respect of the 6 mile fishing zone.  However, in light of the recent Supreme Court judgement on this matter, access for Northern Ireland vessels is not currently provided for in domestic law.   </p>  <p>  The SFPA and the Naval Service through the Fisheries Monitoring Centre monitor the movements of foreign and Irish vessels within our Exclusive Fisheries Zone, using the Vessel Monitoring System Automatic Identification System and declared catches through Electronic Reporting System.  The SFPA is reliant on the seagoing fishery patrol activity of the Naval Service to verify compliance of vessels not landing into Ireland. </p>  <p>  The monitoring and control of fishing vessels within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone are matters for the Irish control authorities.  Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature concerning sea fisheries control are, as a matter of law, exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Naval Service.  As Minister I am precluded from getting involved in operational matters including in relation to law enforcement. </p></reply>

Encouraging people to divert waste from landfill is important as we have had two landfill capacity emergencies this year.</p>  <p>  In this regard, I also wish to provide more flexibility to the industry so that they will be in a better position to provide householders with options on managing their waste costs under an incentivised charging scheme.  Given that we are reviewing more than just the introduction of a &lsquo;per kilogramme pay by weight&rsquo; system, there is no necessity for companies to now provide for &lsquo;dual billing&rsquo; and &lsquo;opt in/ opt out&rsquo; arrangements for kilogramme prices from January 2017.  </p></reply>

Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested c. &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of telecoms services.</p><p>It is estimated that up to 70% or c.1.6 m premises in Ireland will have access to  commercial high speed broadband services provided by telecommunications operators, while the remaining 30% consisting of just over 750,000 premises will fall within the proposed State led intervention under the National Broadband Plan.  Currently approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can now get high speed broadband from commercial service providers.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at shows the extent of the State Intervention area:  </p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services. </p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.</p><p>My Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area comprising over 750,000 premises, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. </p><p>Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids.

This responsibility extends to the provision of suitable first- aid facilities dependent on the number of employees.  The statutory requirements regarding the provision of first aid are set down in Chapter 2 of Part 7 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 to 2016.  This legislation requires employers to have a sufficient number of trained occupational first aiders and first aid equipment in the workplace, based on a risk assessment.  These provisions apply to all places of work and all employers, including employment in gyms, the responsibilities imposed by the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and its related Regulations do not extend beyond the provision of first aid facilities to employees.  While the issue of wider public safety is not within the remit of my Department, some work places can include areas accessible to the public areas, such as gyms, and in these cases it is the responsibility of the management to ensure there is a trained first aider and first aid equipment available.  The Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s <i>Guidelines on First Aid at Places of Work,</i>published in 2008, provide a practical guide to employers including help in determining the number of trained occupational first aiders required having regard to the number of employees and the type of industry involved. </p><p>It is the responsibility of the employer to ensure that adequate first aid training is provided to an employee who is designated to be occupational first aider.  The employer is required to make the appropriate arrangements for first-aid training.  Under the terms of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, any employees attending such training shall not be at any loss for their participation in such training.  The employer is also responsible for ensuring that designated employees are afforded the opportunity to refresh their first-aid training at regular intervals and at a minimum of every two years.</p><p>The comprehensive guidance and information in the HSA <i>Guidelines on First Aid at Places of Work</i>includes information on occupational first aid training standards and certification, and the requirements for Occupational First Aid training providers. </p><p>There is no legislative requirement on an employer to have an automatic external defibrillator (AED) in the workplace.  However, it is good practice, in line with the advice for employers in the HSA <i>Guidelines on First Aid at Places of Work,</i>for employers to consider the provision of an AED in the workplace.  This may not, of course, prove to be feasible for some small businesses in view of the potentially high initial costs and the need to ensure ongoing maintenance.  There are, however, good examples of a number of small businesses combining in a shared arrangement, notably in work locations such as shopping centres, gyms and small business enterprise centres.  The operation of defibrillators (AEDs) is part of the initial and refresher training provided for occupational first aiders. </p><p>The provision of first aid arrangements and the supply of defibrillators in facilities intended for recreational use does not come under the remit of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</p></reply>

Based on the latest CSO data released earlier this week, 189,500 additional people are at work since the start of the Action Plan for Jobs Process in 2012. Over the last twelve months, an additional 56,500 are at work.  The unemployment rate is now down to 7.9%, from over 15.1% in 2012.  Over 72% of the additional jobs created were outside Dublin.  The Department does not advertise its annual Action Plan for Jobs, the first one of which was launched in February 2012, and each year since.</p>  <p>  A key thrust of the approach to supporting job creation has been to develop a concerted effort to raise awareness of the supports available to firms through a one-stop website. In response to a well-recognised demand for more information on Government supports for SMEs, the Department decided to run an awareness campaign to address this deficit.  Following a tender process in the Official Journal of the European Union, a successful tender was identified.  This awareness campaign uses the web address of the Action Plan for Jobs as a landing page for those interested in using the Government's online SME tool which helps explain what supports one might qualify for.  The campaign used business representative groups like SFA, ISME and Chambers Ireland, as well as experienced and young entrepreneurs in the advertising to raise awareness of the supports available. In 2016, there were payments totalling &euro;13,779.83 in relation to this campaign, which was a carryover from 2015. There was no additional expenditure in 2016.  </p></reply>

The employment permits system is intended to offer an interim solution where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA; it offers a conduit into the Irish labour market for non-EEA nationals with in-demand skills and is operated as a vacancy-led system.</p><p>The Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List (HSEOL) and the Ineligible Categories of Employment List (ICEL) which are used to manage the employment permits system, are reviewed twice a year in order to ensure their ongoing relevance.  Changes to access to the Irish labour market for specific occupations via the employment permits system are made on the basis of research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) in tandem with a consultation process, as part of a package of measures to meet those skills needs.  Any changes to the lists are made with due regard not only to their potential impacts on the resident labour market but also to upskilling and training that is in place.  These bi-annual reviews ensure that the employment permit system is responsive to the skills needs of enterprise in Ireland while ensuring that priority access to available employment is given to the resident Irish and EEA workforce.  </p><p>The globalised nature of 21st century enterprise means that the flow of personnel and expertise between states and facilities is a core element of business practice, and the regulatory systems of the State must balance the interests of the labour force and economic development in this context.</p><p>The inflow of foreign expertise brings a range of positives to the State. Much of the expansion, for example, of the multi-national business sector over the past decade has been predicated on the access of the companies in question to skill sets which have not always been available in the resident labour market at the level or scale that has been required. The State&rsquo;s economic migration policy has sought to ensure that the skills needs of enterprise are met while safeguarding, the resident labour market. The State deploys a number of safeguards across employment permits and employment rights legislation to protect the labour market from distortion.</p><p>The Employment Permits Acts provisions that to protect the resident labour force include a requirement that, for eligible occupations that are not included on the HSEOL, a Labour Market Needs Test must be undertaken, thereby ensuring that the position has been offered to Irish and EEA nationals prior to its offer to a non-EEA national.  The employment permits system in Ireland, in addition, features a requirement that companies seeking employment permits for prospective employees should maintain a balance of at least 50:50 EEA employees to non-EEA employees.  With limited exceptions, such as a start-up situation, an employment permit will not be granted where more than 50% of the company&rsquo;s staff are non-EEA nationals.  The 50:50 rule helps to prevent large scale outsourcing of employment in Ireland to non-EEA nationals. </p><p>8798 employment permits have issued in the year to the end of November.  Details of employment permits issued by company is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: <i>.</i></p></reply>

However, I understand the matter relates to an industrial relations dispute.  The case was referred to the Labour Court under Section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1969 and was heard by the Court on 16th June 2016.  The Court&rsquo;s recommendation dated 20 June 2016 recommended that in addition to the statutory redundancy payment already paid, the Company should pay the employees  an ex-gratia redundancy payment of 1.5 weeks&rsquo; pay per year of service, subject to a &lsquo;cap&rsquo; of &euro;72,000 on the total amount.  I understand that the employees concerned are seeking the additional 1.5 weeks ex-gratia payment recommended by the Labour Court.  </p>  <p>  The position is that in industrial relations matters under Ireland's voluntary system of industrial relations the Labour Court operates as an industrial relations tribunal and is not a court of law.  It hears both sides in a case and then issues a recommendation setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms under which it should be settled.  Recommendations made by the Court concerning the investigation of disputes under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946-2015 are not binding on the parties concerned; however, the parties are expected to give serious consideration to the Court's recommendation. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, under the Industrial Relations Acts, responsibility for the settlement of a dispute rests with the parties.</p></reply>

The role it plays in sustaining employment in Ireland is well-documented: approximately one out of every five private sector jobs here directly or indirectly results from FDI.  Multinational companies also, of course, contribute to our economy in other ways, whether through the taxation generated for Government revenue or their support for research and innovation.  </p>  <p>  There is no denying that the global FDI market is increasingly competitive and that Ireland must fight hard to win each and every new investment.  I am confident, however, that our offering to prospective investors remains attractive.  Our selling points include our pro-enterprise business environment, competitive economy, first-class workforce and proven track record as a home to global businesses.  Our continued membership of the Eurozone and European Union is also a significant positive, particularly in light of Brexit.  The Government will continue to work hard to reinforce these strengths while also taking steps to address any areas where we need to improve. </p></reply>

The Action Plan for Jobs is working.  Almost 190,000 more people are at work today than in 2012 when the first Plan was launched.  The original target was to add an extra 100,000 jobs by the end of 2016. In the first nine months of 2016, 48,500 new jobs were created.</p><p>The unemployment rate was 7.3% in November 2016, down from 15.1% when the first Action Plan was launched in Q1 2012. </p><p>Employment has been growing continuously for 16 quarters and over the past year employment has grown in all regions.  72% of all jobs created in the past year were created outside Dublin.</p><p>I am currently working with ministerial colleagues to develop the 2017 Action Plan for Jobs.  My priority is to ensure that the Plan is ambitious and impactful and keeps us on track to deliver on this Government&rsquo;s goal to help create 200,000 additional jobs by 2020, including 135,000 outside Dublin.  The success of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs is crucial to the Government in meeting this objective. </p><p>The Regional Action Plan initiative is working to address regional and rural job creation by bringing different stakeholders in each of the 8 regions together to identify innovative and practical actions, to be taken across a range of Departments and agencies, with clear timelines for delivery over the period 2015 &ndash; 2017. </p><p>Collaboration between the private and the public sector has been a core element in each plan&rsquo;s development, and will be central to each plan&rsquo;s delivery. </p><p>The first Progress Reports prepared by the 8 Regional Action Plan Implementation Committees have now been completed.

The overarching ambition is to reach 2.18 people in employment by 2020, with growth delivered throughout the country.  We aim to achieve and retain a top three competitiveness ranking.</p><p>We aim to generate growth that is sustainable, that is driven by exports, and underpinned by innovation and competitiveness. </p><p>We aim to realise a step change in the performance of our enterprises by 2020 to deliver, for example:</p><p>-a 60 percent increase in Enterprise Ireland supported enterprises spending more than &euro;1 million on R&amp;amp;D;</p><p>-a 50 percent increase in exports in Irish companies &ndash; and increased market diversification to non-UK markets;</p><p>-an additional 1,080 inward investment projects and &euro;3.6 billion in R&amp;amp;D related FDI; and</p><p>-a 25 percent per annum increase in start-ups and start-ups with better survival rates.</p><p>We are not blind to the possible implications of Brexit. I have secured additional resources so that we can redouble our efforts.  The enterprise development agencies are actively engaged in supporting enterprises as they navigate through these challenging times, and to identify potential FDI opportunities.</p><p>Enterprise 2025 is a comprehensive strategy. It sets out actions that include a focus on building competitive advantage, on ensuring a supportive business environment, and on realising a significant uplift in the performance of enterprises based here in terms of innovation, export potential and productivity, and in attracting further investment. </p><p>We will continue to focus on taking action in the right areas to support enterprise as set out in Enterprise 2025.  This focus does not change because of Brexit. </p><p>Just as the whole of Government responded to the severe unemployment challenge we faced post the global economic downturn, I am confident that we are responding and will continue to respond to the challenges and opportunities that Brexit presents.  </p></reply>

Ensuring Ireland is a competitive location internationally to establish and run a business is essential for job creation.  In July of this year, the National Competitiveness Council published its annual Competitiveness Scorecard benchmarking report which provides an in-depth assessment of all aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness performance.  The Council found that while Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved in recent years, and has been central to recent strong economic growth, a number of threats persist, not least of which is Brexit.  The analysis contained in the Council&rsquo;s Competiveness Scorecard report is informing the development of the Council&rsquo;s annual policy report Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge 2016, which I will shortly be bringing to Government for consideration and which will contain a range of actions to enhance competitiveness.</p>  <p>  Brexit means we must do more across a wide range of policy areas to enhance our attractiveness as a location to start and locate a business relative to the UK.  The most recent data from the World Bank&rsquo;s Ease of Doing Business shows that Ireland is ahead of the UK in terms of ease of starting a business and paying tax but is behind the UK in the overall rankings.</p>  <p>  To improve business competiveness we must consolidate Ireland&rsquo;s traditional strengths and address those areas where we lag other countries.  We are stepping up investment in infrastructure and SMEs access to finance is improving.  We are reforming our tax system to encourage enterprise growth. We are driving the implementation of our research strategy Innovation 2020.  As part of Budget 2017 my Department secured additional resources for our enterprise agencies to put more people on the ground in foreign markets to attract investment and to help Irish business who export to the UK and helping others diversify into new markets.  I have asked that Enterprise Ireland intensify its work with clients exporting to the UK by providing support to improve their competitiveness in the market through its management capability and development programmes such as LEAN.</p>  <p>  My officials will continue to monitor Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness publications such as the IMD, the World Bank Doing Business report.  Further actions and reforms - driven by the 2017 Action Plan for Jobs which is currently being prepared - will enable us to further narrow the gap with the world&rsquo;s most competitive countries and improve the ease of doing business, ultimately helping us to achieve our objective of sustainable full employment.</p></reply>
