    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-13a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013031300064#WRA00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 26 together. </p><p>  I recently announced a new Philanthropy Initiative for 2013.  This initiative is designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment funding of the arts from private sources and to maximise investment in the arts by unlocking many multiples of the funding put up by the taxpayer.  It also provides an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new and multi-annual relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts.</p><p>  This year, &#8364;210,000 will be available to arts organisations under the scheme.  The terms of the scheme allow arts and culture organisations to apply to the Philanthropy Initiative for funding if they can generate funding from the private sector by philanthropy or fundraising in the following ratios:</p><p>- Up to &#8364;5,000 of funds can be accessed through the scheme if the organisation can match each &#8364;1 from the taxpayer with &#8364;2 from private sector funding;  </p><p>- Up to &#8364;10,000 can be accessed if each &#8364;1 from the taxpayer can be matched by &#8364;3 from private sector funding; </p><p>- Up to &#8364;15,000 can be accessed if each &#8364;1 from the taxpayer can be matched by &#8364;4 from private sector funding.</p><p>  The application form is available on my Department's website and applications are dealt with on a first-come-first-served basis. The application form includes a provision that in the event of multiple applications competing for limited grant allocation, priority will be given to Arts in Education projects aimed at disadvantaged (DEIS) schools.</p><p>  This year, the majority of the Philanthropy Initiative funding will be directed towards arts and culture organisations seeking support for projects that include an education component.  This is designed to support another of my policy initiatives - the Arts in Education Charter, launched recently by myself and my colleague, Minister Ruairi Quinn TD, Minister for Education and Skills.  The Charter sets out a range of actions to be undertaken by our two Departments, the cultural institutions, the Arts Council and arts organisations.  In 2013, I hope that the Philanthropy Initiative, while continuing to provide an incentive to arts organisations to engage in fundraising, will also encourage arts and culture organisations to engage creatively with children and young people and add to their education.  In doing so, they will be helping to foster the artists and the audiences of the future.</p><p>  The 2012 Philanthropy initiative exceeded all expectations and gives an example of how the careful targeting of taxpayer funding can produce very good value for money.  It was anticipated that for every &#8364;1 of public money invested, private sector funds of &#8364;2.50 could be generated.  At the end of 2012, the scheme was reviewed and the results indicated that it had exceeded all expectations by unlocking 70% more private sector funding than had been anticipated.  The arts got a boost of over &#8364;1 million last year, of which less than one-fifth came from the public purse. A full list of awards under this scheme can be viewed on my Department's website at </p></reply>

I understand that the Ulster-Scots Agency has recently been in touch with Scottish MPs at Westminster with some very encouraging feedback and the Agency is now working to develop a framework for east-west activities. In addition, the Ulster-Scots Agency already undertakes some activities in regard to promotion of Ulster-Scots in North America, including attendance at large-scale events like the Stone Mountain Highland Games in Atlanta, Georgia.   </p><p>  I should also refer the Deputy to the work of Colmcille, a partnership programme between Foras na Gaeilge and B&oacute;rd na G&aacute;idhlig to promote the use of Irish and Scottish Gaelic within Ireland and Scotland and also between the two countries.  Through its work programme, Colmcille seeks to foster understanding of the diverse culture of the Irish and Scottish Gaelic communities and to encourage debate on common concerns with regard to social, cultural and economic issues with a view to building self-confidence within the respective language communities. In 2011, Colmcille launched Sl&iacute; Cholmcille, a major heritage and cultural tourism trail linking sites in Ireland and Scotland. </p><p>  Further information is available on the agencies' websites at <font color="#2F2F2F"> </font>and<font color="#2F2F2F"> </font><font color="#2F2F2F">. </font></p></reply>

While my Department has the overarching responsibility for the Strategy, it is working in co-operation with other key stakeholders, including the Department of Education and Skills, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge, to implement the Strategy on an incremental basis, within available resources.</p><p>  Priority was given during 2011 to implementing the Strategy&#8217;s establishment phase.  This involved providing information about the Strategy and establishing the organisational and operational structures required for its implementation. Priority was given during 2012 to legislative matters. The enactment of the Gaeltacht Act 2012 was a significant achievement as it provides for a statutory language planning process, both within and outside the existing Gaeltacht, and for a statutory role in this regard for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge, as appropriate. </p><p>  My Department is actively engaging with a wide range of key stakeholders under the auspices of an Inter-Departmental Group, which I chair, and other high-level working groups regarding the implementation of those aspects of the Strategy that are relevant to their areas of responsibility. As a result, it is envisaged that the various key stakeholders will be in a position to publish their implementation plans for the Strategy later this year. It is also envisaged that a report on the overall progress made in implementing the Strategy to date will be published later this year.</p></reply>

The principal components of the Plan include the essential refurbishment of the historic buildings at Merrion Square and the provision of additional space, including, in time, a new wing for exhibitions, education and the library.</p><p>  The first phase of the project (Phase 1) relates to the renovation of the historic wings (the Dargan and Milltown Wings). The Dargan Wing was opened in 1854 and the Milltown Wing was opened in 1903. Since then there has been no fundamental upgrade to the fabric of these buildings and they are no longer considered fit for purpose for modern exhibition requirements.  Under this project, the roofs of both wings will be brought up to standard, as will the internal fabric. This will ensure that the National Collection can be shown and protected in an appropriate forum.  It will also enable the Gallery to host international exhibitions and, in the longer term, to increase its contribution towards the country&rsquo;s cultural tourism offering.</p><p>  There are a number of aspects to the first phase:</p><p>- Refurbishment of the roof of the Dargan Wing;</p><p>- Refurbishment of the roof of the Milltown Wing and renovation works to both wings to return them to their original architectural forms;</p><p>- The installation of an energy centre and the modernisation of the heating, ventilation and environmental controls; and</p><p>- The integration of external spaces into the Gallery proper, as exhibition facilities and orientation galleries. </p><p>  Both the Dargan and Milltown Wings were closed to the public in February 2011. Work on the refurbishment of the roof of the Dargan Wing commenced in March 2011 and was completed in May 2012. Work on the refurbishment of the roof of the Milltown Wing and the renovation of both wings remains to be completed.  The Office of Public Works is about to go to tender in relation to this project and it is expected that work will commence towards the end of this year and be completed by 2016.  Befitting its status as a national cultural institution and one of the leading galleries of its kind in the world, the National Gallery will play a full role in the centenary celebrations. I understand that the Director is advancing his plans in that regard.</p></reply>

The NSMC comprises Ministers of the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government, working together to take forward co-operation between both parts of the island to mutual benefit.</p><p>  Six North-South Implementation Bodies have been established. They operate under the overall policy direction of the NSMC, with clear accountability lines back to the Council and to the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly. In that regard, my own Department and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland together have a specific role in relation to two of these Implementation Bodies: Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga, which comprises two agencies - Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency/Tha Boord o Ulst&eacute;r-Scotch.</p><p>  My Department is committed to supporting North/South co-operation, particularly in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement.  I, along with the Minister of State at my Department, Mr. Dinny McGinley, T.D., participate regularly in meetings of the NSMC, in both the Waterways and Language sectoral formats. There were six such meetings in 2012 &#8211; three in each sectoral format. Topics addressed at those meetings included the management and development of the waterways network; the development of education packs for schools in relation to waterways; the negative effects of invasive species on the waterways; the publication of a major new English/Irish dictionary; projects to build links between communities in Ireland and Scotland; the development of the Hairtlan project, which aims to preserve, protect and present Ulster-Scots heritage; and governance and financial management arrangements. </p><p>  The most recent formal engagement was at the NSMC meeting in Language sectoral format on 6 March last in Armagh. As is customary, the Council issued a Joint Communiqu&eacute; following this meeting, which is available on   .  I am advised that the next NSMC meeting in sectoral format for both Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga is planned for June 2013.</p></reply>

This was in keeping with the recommendations of Justice Quirke following his report on the Peatlands Forum. It was also in line with the motion agreed unanimously by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 7<sup>th</sup> of March, 2012 which called on the Government to &#8220;<i>engage actively with the European Commission to seek a resolution within the terms of the Habitats Directive, and to prepare and submit a National Raised Bog Restoration Plan to the Commission as a matter of urgency</i>  &quot;.</p><p>  My Department has prepared a document detailing the proposed approach to the development of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan. The document is available on my Department&#8217;s website at   . The Plan will provide for the long-term protection of Ireland&#8217;s raised bog SACs, will address the needs of turf-cutters and can unlock the flexibility available for dealing with the most difficult of bogs, within the terms of the Habitats Directive.   My Department has sought and received tenders for carrying out the necessary scientific work which is required to underpin the long term conservation and restoration of these SACs and for completion of the National Plan.  I expect to be in a position to announce the outcome of this tendering process shortly.</p><p>  As part of the Plan, arrangements are now being made for the relocation of turf cutters to alternative bogs and these have already been finalised or are close to finalisation for a number of sites. Potential relocation sites have been identified for almost all of the remaining SACs where relocation of turf-cutters will be required. Monetary compensation or the delivery of turf is available to qualifying applicants as an interim measure, while the development of relocation sites and the completion of the national plan are awaited. To-date in the region of &#8364;3.4 million has been paid in compensation, by way of annuity payments and deliveries of cut turf to applicants under the cessation of turf cutting scheme, which was established to compensate those impacted by the need to cease cutting turf on these sites.</p><p>  I am determined that, in collaboration with the Peatlands Council and local turf-cutting communities, substantial progress will be made on the Plan over the coming months. My Department has stepped up contact with turf-cutting groups to seek long-term resolutions to the issues for their particular bogs, in compliance with EU and national law. I hope that the National Plan can be completed by November, in time to submit an application to the European Commission under Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, if required, prior to the 2014 cutting season.  However, the engagement and agreement of turf-cutting communities to its proposed approaches will be essential to meeting this timeline and to unlocking the potential flexibility it offers.</p></reply>

Government policy is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts, to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life, and to maximise the potential for cultural tourism.  Primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council, which, under the Arts Acts, is independent in its funding decisions.  In 2013, the Arts Council will receive an allocation from my Department of some &#8364;60.7 million in current, capital and EU Presidency funding.</p><p>  One key vehicle for delivering arts funding to the local authorities is the 28-year partnership the Arts Council has had with local authorities through annual direct funding of the national infrastructure of local arts services.  Much of the work of local arts services offers people in remote and rural communities the opportunity to engage in the arts, both as audience members and as active participants in making and presenting work.  The assortment of programmes offered by the Council nationwide reaches a particularly broad range of publics and communities.  Another important and particularly relevant partnership, in this context, is the Arts Council's 14-year partnership with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, through the mechanism of Eala&iacute;on na Gaeltachta, which has focused on developing the arts in the Gaeltacht.</p><p>  With regard to funding from the EU Culture Programme, the position is that neither Ireland, nor indeed my Department, receives an allocation from the EU Culture Programme but projects must apply directly to Brussels for this funding.  There is a Cultural Contact Point in Ireland, funded by the EU Culture Programme, which assists arts and culture organisations wishing to apply for funding.  Information in this regard is available at its website at   A specific strand of this programme, entitled <i>&quot;Local Arts Europe&quot;,</i> features 23 projects across many areas of arts practice, each of which is led by a Local Authority Arts office, or by Eala&iacute;on na Gaeltachta, working in cooperation with artists, art organisations and community partners in their localities, as well as artistic partners based elsewhere in Europe.</p><p>  I might refer the Deputy to the proceedings of the Joint Committee on Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht on 24 April 2012, where discussion took place on the topic of <i>&#8216;Utilising the Arts to combat disadvantage among the young, the old and the socially disadvantaged and to encourage their greater integration and social inclusion within local communities&#8217;</i>.

A total of 2,161 payments and 195 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of the applications received.</p><p>  Arrangements for the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs have been made as regards a group from Clara Bog special area of conservation in County Offaly and a group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog special areas of conservation in County Galway.  These arrangements involve the groups moving to nearby bogs, with the group from Clara Bog having commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June last, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have now been accommodated.  Agreement has been reached between my Department and the group of turf cutters from Carrownagappul and Curraghlehanagh Bogs that necessary infrastructure development works will be carried out this year in the relocation site in preparation for turf cutting.  The commencement of cutting depends on the ground settling following these works and I understand that cutting will commence here in 2014.</p><p>  Progress has also been made with a view to the relocation in a similar manner of qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation in County Kildare.  My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence turf cutting in a relocation site during the forthcoming turf cutting season.</p><p>  In total, 70 applicants from Carrownagappul Bog, 19 applicants from Curraghlehanagh Bog and 28 applicants from Ballynafagh Bog have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.</p><p>  I am advised that of the remaining 49 raised bog special areas of conservation, potential relocation sites had been identified for a further 31 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites.  Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation due, for example, to the small number of turf cutters that have been active on these sites.</p><p>  In addition, my Department had recently written to applicants from Ballynamona Bog and Corkip Lough special area of conservation in County Roscommon, who had expressed an interest in relocation, in order to ascertain interest in relocation to a particular site from the 2013 turf cutting season.  I understand that this site would not suit the majority of those who wish to relocate from Ballynamona Bog and Corkip Lough due to the distance of the potential relocation site from their homes.  However, a small number of applicants have indicated to my Department an interest in relocation to this site.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that relocation is a very complex process, in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, the infrastructure/drainage works required, establishing the number who can be accommodated on the site, the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements.  Accordingly, it will only be possible to bring this process to a conclusion over time in respect of all the relocation sites. It is not possible to indicate, therefore, when exactly additional turf cutters can be accommodated at any of these sites over and above the specific cases already mentioned.</p><p>  A payment of &euro;1,500 or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum is available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to applicants while awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs.  An additional once-off payment of &euro;500 will be provided where legal agreements are signed with me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p></reply>

The Report was published in July 2011 and an implementation committee to pursue the execution of its recommendations has been established.  One of the main recommendations in the Report is the extension of the Section 481 Scheme until the end of 2020; it was previously approved until the end of 2015.</p><p>  In his budget speech last December, the Minister for Finance, Mr Michael Noonan, T.D., announced that the Section 481 Scheme will be extended to 2020.  An important and significant change will mean that the scheme will operate as a tax credit model from 2016.  This will allow an extended lead-in period to enable the sector to adapt to the change to a tax credit model.</p><p>  This very good news has been welcomed by the sector.  The extension of this scheme gives a great deal of certainty to the Irish audiovisual sector to the end of this decade.

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.   I should point out that the Health Levy was introduced in the Health Contributions Act, 1979 and was payable on all reckonable income and subject to certain exemptions.  The Health Levy was collected along with PRSI contributions by the Revenue Commissioners.  Under the legislation, it was paid into the Social Insurance Fund and transferred from there to the Minister for Health, where it was appropriated to the Health Vote as an appropriation-in-aid.   </p><p>  The Income Levy was introduced along with a suite of revenue raising measures in Budget 2009 in response to the economic downturn in order to assist in stabilising the country finances.  </p><p>  Payment of the Health Levy and the Income levy did not confer any entitlement or specific benefits to an individual.

For the purposes of LPT, property values for properties under &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands, with a range of &euro;50,000 in each band.  As property owners will not be required to provide a precise value for their property, it is unlikely that any owner would find themselves in the position where they overpay their LPT.  The initial valuation of a property on 1 May 2013, assuming it is made in good faith, will be valid up to and including 2016 and will not be affected by any increase or decrease in property prices or other changes, during this period.   Notwithstanding this, I am advised by the Commissioners that section 26 of the 2012 Act provides for a refund to issue where it transpires that there has been an overpayment of LPT either directly or by deduction at source, or where, the overpayment was due to an error or mistake on a return or a statement made by the liable person, subject to certain conditions being satisfied.  Where a true and complete return has been prepared and delivered to the Revenue Commissioners and all the information required by the Commissioners to make a determination on the case has been provided, a refund may issue where a claim for repayment is submitted to Revenue within four years after the end of the year in which the liability date in respect of the payment was made falls.  For example, if a liable person elects on the LPT Return to pay the 2013 LPT liability by deduction at source from his or her salary, but their spouse subsequently pays part of the liability by cash, this would result in an overpayment of LPT for 2013.   In order to receive a refund, the liable person must submit a claim for repayment of the LPT to Revenue by the end of 2017 and provide the necessary information to support the claim.  It should be noted that a refund of tax will only be made where the taxpayer has no other outstanding tax liabilities.  </p><p>  I am further advised by Revenue that the legislation also allows a liable person to appeal against a decision of the Revenue Commissioners not to allow a repayment.</p></reply>

However, the Group recognised the considerable pressures on the public finances and the need to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue. For this reason, the Group suggested that consideration be given to phasing in deductibility over a period of years.  The Group also considered that it is for Government, having regard to the prevailing budgetary situation, to decide on the time span for phasing-in deductibility and on what percentage of LPT to allow as a deduction from gross rents for tax purposes.   There is no provision in the current legislation for such deductions.  While it is the intention of the Government to introduce such a provision on a phased basis, neither the manner in which this will happen or the timing have yet been decided.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-13a.171.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013031300070#WRG01600"><p>In structuring the local property tax (LPT) consideration was given to household incomes, as I will outline in my reply.  At present I am not considering other ways of taking into account household income when calculating an individual&rsquo;s liability to LPT.   The Inter-departmental group, chaired by Dr Don Thornhill to consider the design of a property tax (the &ldquo;Thornhill Group&rdquo;), had due regard to issues such as ability to pay and considered the provision of waivers or deferrals for households unable to pay the tax or where a payment requirement would cause hardship.  The Thornhill Group commissioned the ESRI to assist in this regard and the ESRI was charged with analysing a residential property tax which would yield specified annual revenue yields.</p><p>  When considering reliefs, the Thornhill Group had regard to the following issues: </p><p>  - The arrangements for payment of tax due arising from the ownership of properties should have regard to the ability of the owners to pay. </p><p>  - Reliefs create costs which have to be paid for &ndash; either by taxpayers not benefiting from them, or by reductions in public expenditure.</p><p>  - Reliefs should be designed to address clear economic and social policy needs. </p><p>  - Considerable care would need to be taken in designing reliefs to ensure that the gains from the reliefs are targeted based on need and that there are not unintended and inequitably distributed gains. </p><p>  - The LPT will not be assessed on incomes.</p><p>  The Thornhill Group favoured allowing voluntary deferrals rather than waivers. Deferrals focused on particular categories of householders can address cases where there is an inability to pay the LPT.  The Government agreed with this recommendation of the Thornhill Group. </p><p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT for individuals on low incomes in certain cases.  To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence.  The gross income thresholds for a full deferral will be &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or cohabitants.  A person may claim a deferral if their gross income will not &ldquo;as can reasonably be foreseen at the liability date&rdquo; exceed these thresholds in that year.</p><p>  An increased gross income threshold applies in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  A deferral option in qualifying cases in this regard will apply until the end of 2017 and will assist individuals currently in mortgage distress.</p><p>  A deferral of up to 50% of the LPT liability will be possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for married persons/civil partners/cohabitants.</p><p>  A deferral of 50% of the LPT will also be available where gross income does not exceed the above thresholds (&euro;25,000 single, &euro;35,000 couple) as increased by 80% of the gross mortgage interest payments that a liable person expects to make by the end of the year for which the gross income is being estimated. This type of deferral will also be available until 31 December 2017.</p><p>  Where a liable person no longer satisfies the necessary conditions, amounts deferred prior to the date on which eligibility ceased may continue to be deferred.  Interest of c. 4% per annum will apply to any amounts deferred. The deferred amount, including interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.</p><p>  The deferral thresholds were based on the recommendations of the Thornhill Group.  In recommending the thresholds the Group had regard to the analysis it commissioned from the ESRI.  An income level of &euro;25,000 for joint and co-owners/spouses/civil partners/cohabitees was recommended in order to enable most households in the lowest 40% of income levels to have the option of deferral.  This is considered appropriate, having regard to the findings in the ESRI study regarding potential impacts on households and having regard to the need for balance and equity in terms of the burden thereby imposed on those with higher (but still average or below average) incomes.  The ESRI report notes that increasing the income thresholds will have an impact on the rate of property tax that will be applied.  As the income threshold increases the rate will also be required to increase to achieve the same revenue yields.</p><p>  The Government accepted the gross income thresholds recommended for a full deferral and adapted the recommended gross income thresholds for a partial deferral so that they are &euro;10,000 rather than &euro;5,000 above the thresholds for a full deferral.</p><p>  Gross income from all sources consists of total income before any deductions, allowances or reliefs that may be taken off for income tax purposes and includes income that is exempt from income tax and income from the Department of Social Protection but excludes Child Benefit.</p><p>  I appreciate that some property owners may find themselves unable to pay Local Property Tax but do not qualify for a deferral under the existing legislation.  For this reason, the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013, as passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, provides that a person who has entered into an insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may apply for deferral of the LPT that is due during the period for which the insolvency arrangement is in effect.</p><p>  The 2013 Bill also provides that a person who suffers both an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense, as a result of which he or she is unable to pay their LPT without causing financial hardship, may apply for full or partial deferral.  Claims for this type of deferral will require full disclosure of the person&rsquo;s financial circumstances, supporting documentation and any other information required by Revenue and following an examination of the information provided, Revenue will determine whether deferral should be granted.  The detail of how this type of deferral will operate and the criteria that will be used to determine eligibility will be set out in guidelines due to be published by the Revenue Commissioners shortly.</p></reply>

The Local Property Tax rate of 0.18% (for houses up to &euro;1m in value) is less than half the rate used in the ESRI analysis, and, as such, the impact on housing demand is likely to be minimal.  In addition, the property rental market is a competitive market, with many suppliers and renters.  Upstream costs such as the Local Property Tax are likely to be passed through in the rental market and as such will not create a disincentive to purchase houses relative to renting.</p></reply>

This is borne out by the fact that in 2012, 85% of the capital expenditure in the school sector was in respect of large scale projects, additional accommodation and prefab replacement. The balance was expended on site acquisition, emergency works, furniture and equipment provision and commitments arising from earlier years.</p><p>  The capital allocation that is available for the school sector in 2013 will likewise be expended primarily on the provision of additional permanent school places by means of large scale projects, the additional accommodation scheme and prefab replacement.

In this context, I am fully aware of developments in the digital textbook publishing industry and I believe that the digital format has the potential to add significant value to teaching and learning for the future.   I believe it is important for schools, in conjunction with parents, to retain local autonomy in deciding whether to recommend their pupils purchase e-books and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice over the medium and long terms.  In making this decision each school should consider all the available information and in this regard the Professional Development Service for Teachers &ndash; which now incorporates the ICT in Schools function is available to advise schools.</p><p>  Work has commenced on the development of a new ICT Strategy for schools. The first step in this process is the completion of an ICT Infrastructure census in schools.  The census questionnaire will be disseminated to post primary schools next week and to primary schools in the coming weeks. The new ICT Strategy will address the new policy challenges and opportunities arising from major developments in curricular reform, digital publishing, digital content dissemination tools generally, cloud services, portable computing and student devices and the deployment of high speed broadband at post-primary level.</p></reply>

The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget. The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department's website. The staffing arrangements for the 2013/14 school year (Circular 0013/2013) have recently been published. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.</p><p>  The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0007/2012.  The allocation process at individual school level is currently underway.  The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p></reply>

These are managed and maintained by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and include both sites which are in full State ownership and others which are privately-owned but where Guardianship arrangements exist and where the OPW provides maintenance services. A small number of sites included in the list have National Monuments which are State owned and others which are privately held at the same location.   A full list of the National Monuments in State care has been sent to the Deputy under separate cover.</p><p>  As a general policy, OPW facilitates visitor access to as many National Monument sites as possible.   However, access is not always feasible because of a range of issues including physical location, risks associated with dangerous structures and restrictions imposed in some cases by landowners who may wish to limit access, either temporarily or more longer term, by reason of accident risk, livestock etc.  OPW would estimate that approximately 10% of the National Monument sites in its care are not accessible at any given time.</p><p>  As part of its remit, the OPW also provides enhanced visitor access, together with Guide facilities in some cases, at 70 of the more prominent visitor locations nationally.   These include many of the most iconic heritage sites in the country such as Kilmainham Gaol, the Rock of Cashel, Newgrange etc as well as a number of smaller, less well known properties.  Year-round access with full Guide services is provided at 24 of these locations and a further 7 are accessible unguided.  The remainder are open with Guide services on a seasonal basis on varying dates and for different lengths of seasons generally between March and October.  Details of these sites and their opening arrangements are available on </p><p>  There are no plans at present to extend the number of sites presented with a full or partial OPW Guide service.  However, commencing in 2012, the OPW engaged with local communities in many parts of the country and sought proposals from a number of local Groups interested in facilitating public access at a number of heritage locations and times not currently provided for.   This scheme will be repeated in 2013.</p></reply>

There is no provision for lease breaks on the property and the rent is due for review every seven years.  The Industrial Development Authority acquired the lease from AnCo on 20th October 1976.  On 1st January 1994, the leasehold interest transferred to Forf&aacute;s.  The Industrial Development Authority occupied Carrisbrook House from 1976 until 1985, when the agency relocated to Wilton Park House.  I understand that the Youth Employment Agency occupied three floors of Carrisbrook House between 1986 and 1989.</p><p>  Since 1985, the available offices were sub-let to a number of tenants outside the public sector on a continuous basis until early 2008 when a major tenant exercised its break clause in its sublease and vacated the building.  The Israeli Embassy is currently the only occupant of the premises, on a sub-lease which expires in 2025.  The total rent per annum paid by Forfas in respect of the vacant space in Carrisbrook House since 2008 has been as follows: 2008, &euro;0.743m; 2009, &euro;0.990m: 2010, &euro;0.990m; 2011, 0.990m; 2012, &euro;0.990m.</p><p>  In addition, annual rates and service charges are applicable on the building.  Forf&aacute;s has been actively seeking to market the vacant space in Carrisbrook House since 2008.  The Office of Public Works and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have also been advised, through my Department and Forf&aacute;s, of the availability of vacant space in the building.  The IDA has also been asked to bring the availability of the accommodation to the attention of prospective clients.  In current market conditions, and despite a number of engagements with potential tenants by Forfas, a letting has not been secured.</p></reply>

The CEBs support the indigenous micro-enterprise sector in the start-up and expansion phases and stimulate enterprise potential at local level.  The CEBs are the first port of call in terms of advice, direction, training and grant support for anyone who wishes to start a business.  The CEBs will deal with queries from all potential clients (including those who have taken redundancy, whether in the public sector or not). Contact details for the CEBs are available on .  They offer a range supports including both financial assistance and non-financial assistance.  The forms of financial assistance, which are available subject to certain criteria and conditions, are Priming Grants, Business Expansion Grants and Feasibility/Innovation Grants.  The provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives etc.  Training courses include such topics as start-your-own-business, taxation for beginners, internet marketing, idea&#8217;s generation and negotiation skills.</p><p>  As part of the overall Government approach to unemployment, the Department of Social Protection (DSP)<b></b>operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments by taking up self-employment opportunities.  These include the back to work enterprise allowance scheme (BTWEA), short term enterprise allowance scheme (STEA), employer job (PRSI) incentive scheme and JobBridge - the national internship scheme.  The STEA is payable to a person who qualifies for jobseekers&#8217; benefit and who wishes to commence in self-employment.  Further information on specific entitlements can be obtained by contacting your local Social Protection Office.</p><p>  In addition, Microfinance Ireland is providing support in the form of loans of up to &#8364;25,000 available to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks.  The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal.  Applications for the new Microfinance Fund should be channelled through the local CEB.  Contact details for the CEBs are available on .</p><p>  A guide entitled &#8220;Financial Support for Irish Business&#8221; has been published on my Department&#8217;s website at www.djei.ie under &#8220;latest publications&#8221; and includes information on supports, other than those available from the Enterprise Development Agencies, such as &#8220;Revenue Job Assist&#8221; and &#8220;Back to Work Enterprise Allowance&#8221;.  A particularly important action in this year's Action Plan for Jobs 2013 is the launch of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) which will see the merger of the CEBs with the Business Support and Enterprise Development functions of the Local Authorities.  The APJ recognises that the indigenous micro-enterprise and small business sector is central to economic recovery, job creation and the future prosperity of the Irish economy.  This merger will ensure that the national enterprise support model for these sectors is a premium model delivering high quality.</p></reply>

I have been informed by IDA that in 2008 the Agency acquired in the region of 11 hectares (28 acres) of industrial zoned land on the Sligo Road, Ballina, Co. Mayo for the development of a Business and Technology Park.  Full planning permission has been obtained for this land.</p><p>  In 2010 the Agency carried out limited site treatment works at the IDA Park in Ballina.  These works involved some limited boundary fencing, cultivation, planting and general low level landscaping focusing on the site boundaries.  The works also included the demolition and environmental disposal of materials relating to a former derelict house on the subject lands. The total expenditure associated with same was approximately &euro;60,000 excluding VAT.  Capital works for a new park entrance, access roads and associated services were also planned but due to budgetary constraints these works have not yet taken place.</p><p>  The Agency has assured me that it continually promotes and markets the Park in Ballina to overseas clients wishing to invest in Co.

This is borne out by the fact that in 2012, 85% of the capital expenditure in the school sector was in respect of large scale projects, additional accommodation and prefab replacement. The balance was expended on site acquisition, emergency works, furniture and equipment provision and commitments arising from earlier years.</p><p>  The capital allocation that is available for the school sector in 2013 will likewise be expended primarily on the provision of additional permanent school places by means of large scale projects, the additional accommodation scheme and prefab replacement.

In this context, I am fully aware of developments in the digital textbook publishing industry and I believe that the digital format has the potential to add significant value to teaching and learning for the future.   I believe it is important for schools, in conjunction with parents, to retain local autonomy in deciding whether to recommend their pupils purchase e-books and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice over the medium and long terms.  In making this decision each school should consider all the available information and in this regard the Professional Development Service for Teachers &ndash; which now incorporates the ICT in Schools function is available to advise schools.</p><p>  Work has commenced on the development of a new ICT Strategy for schools. The first step in this process is the completion of an ICT Infrastructure census in schools.  The census questionnaire will be disseminated to post primary schools next week and to primary schools in the coming weeks. The new ICT Strategy will address the new policy challenges and opportunities arising from major developments in curricular reform, digital publishing, digital content dissemination tools generally, cloud services, portable computing and student devices and the deployment of high speed broadband at post-primary level.</p></reply>

The staffing arrangements for the 2013/14 school year (Circular 0013/2013) have recently been published.

Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0007/2012.  The allocation process at individual school level is currently underway.  The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn.

These are managed and maintained by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and include both sites which are in full State ownership and others which are privately-owned but where Guardianship arrangements exist and where the OPW provides maintenance services. A small number of sites included in the list have National Monuments which are State owned and others which are privately held at the same location.   A full list of the National Monuments in State care has been sent to the Deputy under separate cover.</p><p>  As a general policy, OPW facilitates visitor access to as many National Monument sites as possible.   However, access is not always feasible because of a range of issues including physical location, risks associated with dangerous structures and restrictions imposed in some cases by landowners who may wish to limit access, either temporarily or more longer term, by reason of accident risk, livestock etc.  OPW would estimate that approximately 10% of the National Monument sites in its care are not accessible at any given time.</p><p>  As part of its remit, the OPW also provides enhanced visitor access, together with Guide facilities in some cases, at 70 of the more prominent visitor locations nationally.   These include many of the most iconic heritage sites in the country such as Kilmainham Gaol, the Rock of Cashel, Newgrange etc as well as a number of smaller, less well known properties.  Year-round access with full Guide services is provided at 24 of these locations and a further 7 are accessible unguided.  The remainder are open with Guide services on a seasonal basis on varying dates and for different lengths of seasons generally between March and October.  Details of these sites and their opening arrangements are available on </p><p>  There are no plans at present to extend the number of sites presented with a full or partial OPW Guide service.  However, commencing in 2012, the OPW engaged with local communities in many parts of the country and sought proposals from a number of local Groups interested in facilitating public access at a number of heritage locations and times not currently provided for.   This scheme will be repeated in 2013.</p></reply>

There is no provision for lease breaks on the property and the rent is due for review every seven years.  The Industrial Development Authority acquired the lease from AnCo on 20th October 1976.  On 1st January 1994, the leasehold interest transferred to Forf&aacute;s.  The Industrial Development Authority occupied Carrisbrook House from 1976 until 1985, when the agency relocated to Wilton Park House.  I understand that the Youth Employment Agency occupied three floors of Carrisbrook House between 1986 and 1989.</p><p>  Since 1985, the available offices were sub-let to a number of tenants outside the public sector on a continuous basis until early 2008 when a major tenant exercised its break clause in its sublease and vacated the building.  The Israeli Embassy is currently the only occupant of the premises, on a sub-lease which expires in 2025.  The total rent per annum paid by Forfas in respect of the vacant space in Carrisbrook House since 2008 has been as follows: 2008, &euro;0.743m; 2009, &euro;0.990m: 2010, &euro;0.990m; 2011, 0.990m; 2012, &euro;0.990m.</p><p>  In addition, annual rates and service charges are applicable on the building.  Forf&aacute;s has been actively seeking to market the vacant space in Carrisbrook House since 2008.  The Office of Public Works and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have also been advised, through my Department and Forf&aacute;s, of the availability of vacant space in the building.  The IDA has also been asked to bring the availability of the accommodation to the attention of prospective clients.  In current market conditions, and despite a number of engagements with potential tenants by Forfas, a letting has not been secured.</p></reply>

The CEBs support the indigenous micro-enterprise sector in the start-up and expansion phases and stimulate enterprise potential at local level.  The CEBs are the first port of call in terms of advice, direction, training and grant support for anyone who wishes to start a business.  The CEBs will deal with queries from all potential clients (including those who have taken redundancy, whether in the public sector or not). Contact details for the CEBs are available on .  They offer a range supports including both financial assistance and non-financial assistance.  The forms of financial assistance, which are available subject to certain criteria and conditions, are Priming Grants, Business Expansion Grants and Feasibility/Innovation Grants.  The provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives etc.  Training courses include such topics as start-your-own-business, taxation for beginners, internet marketing, idea&#8217;s generation and negotiation skills.</p><p>  As part of the overall Government approach to unemployment, the Department of Social Protection (DSP)<b></b>operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments by taking up self-employment opportunities.  These include the back to work enterprise allowance scheme (BTWEA), short term enterprise allowance scheme (STEA), employer job (PRSI) incentive scheme and JobBridge - the national internship scheme.  The STEA is payable to a person who qualifies for jobseekers&#8217; benefit and who wishes to commence in self-employment.  Further information on specific entitlements can be obtained by contacting your local Social Protection Office.</p><p>  In addition, Microfinance Ireland is providing support in the form of loans of up to &#8364;25,000 available to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks.  The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal.  Applications for the new Microfinance Fund should be channelled through the local CEB.  Contact details for the CEBs are available on .</p><p>  A guide entitled &#8220;Financial Support for Irish Business&#8221; has been published on my Department&#8217;s website at www.djei.ie under &#8220;latest publications&#8221; and includes information on supports, other than those available from the Enterprise Development Agencies, such as &#8220;Revenue Job Assist&#8221; and &#8220;Back to Work Enterprise Allowance&#8221;.  A particularly important action in this year's Action Plan for Jobs 2013 is the launch of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) which will see the merger of the CEBs with the Business Support and Enterprise Development functions of the Local Authorities.  The APJ recognises that the indigenous micro-enterprise and small business sector is central to economic recovery, job creation and the future prosperity of the Irish economy.  This merger will ensure that the national enterprise support model for these sectors is a premium model delivering high quality.</p></reply>

I have been informed by IDA that in 2008 the Agency acquired in the region of 11 hectares (28 acres) of industrial zoned land on the Sligo Road, Ballina, Co. Mayo for the development of a Business and Technology Park.  Full planning permission has been obtained for this land.</p><p>  In 2010 the Agency carried out limited site treatment works at the IDA Park in Ballina.  These works involved some limited boundary fencing, cultivation, planting and general low level landscaping focusing on the site boundaries.  The works also included the demolition and environmental disposal of materials relating to a former derelict house on the subject lands. The total expenditure associated with same was approximately &euro;60,000 excluding VAT.  Capital works for a new park entrance, access roads and associated services were also planned but due to budgetary constraints these works have not yet taken place.</p><p>  The Agency has assured me that it continually promotes and markets the Park in Ballina to overseas clients wishing to invest in Co. Mayo and would consider reviewing its capital budget expenditure programme for this land if a suitable client expressed interest in investing in the area.</p></reply>

This qualifying condition is applied to all applicants, regardless of their nationality.  The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere would not normally be entitled to social welfare assistance or child benefit payments on arrival in Ireland.  The habitual residence condition (HRC), as provided for in section 246 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005 (as amended), applies to claims for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, non-contributory State pension, blind pension, non-contributory widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s pensions and guardian&rsquo;s payment, one-parent family payment, carer&rsquo;s allowance, disability allowance, supplementary welfare allowance including rent supplement, and child benefit.    A person who does not have a right to reside in the State shall not be regarded as being habitually resident in the State.  HRC does not apply to exceptional needs or urgent needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  </p><p>  Under Social Welfare legislation, decisions in relation to all aspects of claims are made by statutorily appointed Deciding Officers.  Each case received for a determination on HRC is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the legislation and guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case.</p><p>  The determination of a person&rsquo;s habitual residence is made in accordance with five factors which are set out in legislation, as follows: </p><p>(a) the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;</p><p>(b) the length and purpose of any absence from the State;</p><p>(c) the nature and pattern of the person&rsquo;s employment;</p><p>(d) the person&rsquo;s main centre of interest, and</p><p>(e) the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.</p><p>  These five factors have been derived from European Court of Justice case law, and are generally sufficient to enable the deciding officer to determine whether a person&rsquo;s present circumstances in Ireland indicate a temporary visit or habitual residence.   Any applicant who disagrees with the decision on a case has the right to request a review of that decision and/or appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. </p></reply>

This report was commissioned from the Economic &amp; Social Research Institute by my Department as part of the Social Inclusion Research Report series. It details the social and living conditions of people with disabilities and is intended to assist policy makers and service deliverers to meet the national poverty and high level social inclusion goals set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007&ndash;2016.  While it provides a valuable detailed social portrait of people with disabilities in the State, it does not make specific recommendations for implementation.</p><p>  However, I should point out that the policy of the Department is to support and facilitate people with disabilities who wish to engage in the labour force and there are a range of measures in place in this area. These include:</p><p>- Partial capacity benefit, introduced in 2012, which enables people in receipt of invalidity pension and illness benefit to take up work while continuing to receive income support. </p><p>- The earnings disregard under the disability allowance scheme which is designed to facilitate claimants of that payment to avail of employment opportunities.  </p><p>- The National Internship Programme (Job Bridge) which is open to people in receipt of a disability related payment. </p><p>- The EmployAbility service which provides a dedicated job-coaching service for people with disabilities as well as providing a range of supports to employers who employ people with disabilities. </p></reply>

For the first six months of 2013, to mark Ireland&#8217;s Presidency of the Council of the EU, my Department has put in place an extensive programme &#8211; <i>Culture Connects</i> - embracing all Member States and some significant third countries.  This programme, which has had a very successful two months to date, will include over 400 events taking place across all Member States of the European Union. </p><p>  The high profile events which have been launched include:</p><p>- 'Changing States' in Brussels, an exhibition of twenty of Ireland's strongest emerging visual artists and Francis Bacon in the high profile Beaux Arts Gallery.</p><p>- An exhibition of the work of Eileen Gray in Centre Pompidou, which is expected to be seen by around 500,000 visitors and to help cross-promote contemporary Irish design.</p><p>- Extensive theatre tours to sell-out houses are ongoing, including 'WATT' at the Barbican in London and Brokentalkers 'Blue Boy' at various cities across Europe. </p><p>- For the duration of Ireland's Presidency, an exhibition of Irish craft and artwork involving cutting-edge technology is being presented in the Council Headquarters in Brussels.</p><p>  In January of this year, my Department supported a delegation of key theatre, dance and music practitioners to attend the Association of Performing Arts Presenters Conference (APAP) 2013, as part of an Irish Government trade and promotional mission for the performing arts.  This is a key target market for Irish artists and is of strategic importance in the development of US Irish cultural relations. Reports to date are very positive for future tour bookings for 2013/2014 for the Irish artists and delegates who were part of the delegation. </p><p>My Department, through the Culture Ireland programme, continues to support Irish artists in presenting work at strategic international festivals, venues and showcases, building touring networks and contacts, including with overseas emigrant or representative groups, where appropriate  . It also continues to work on a cross-agency basis on key initiatives of joint interest and, over the St Patrick&#8217;s Day period, for example, is supporting more than 60 events across Europe, the US, China, Russia and Australia.</p><p>  Other activities to be supported this year through the Culture Ireland Programme include:</p><p>- WOMEX, the World Music Expo, in Cardiff in October in a partnership sharing showcasing and networking opportunities for Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland;</p><p>- a showcase at the Edinburgh Festivals in August, which will offer audiences and promoters a snapshot of the diverse and exciting new theatre work being created in Ireland; and </p><p>- support, in partnership with the Arts Council, for Ireland's participation in the 55<sup>th</sup> International Venice Art Biennale 2013.</p><p>  I am satisfied that my Department's international promotion of Irish arts has created significant goodwill and influence for Ireland and has helped to contribute to the strength of Ireland's reputation for creative excellence.</p></reply>

The national cultural institutions under the auspices of my Department have prepared a comprehensive response to The Gathering.  As outlined previously, the Arts Council is playing an ongoing key role in funding and developing arts events around the county during 2013.  In terms of the Gaeltacht, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has a dedicated scheme to support traditional festivals in the Gaeltacht intends, when assessing applications for such festivals in 2013, to place particular emphasis on activities aimed at attracting visitors to Ireland as part of The Gathering.</p><p>  Tourists arriving as part of The Gathering, particularly those from amongst the 70 million people abroad who claim Irish ancestry, will be particularly interested in heritage sites.  Last September, I launched two new websites which aim to highlight some of our lesser-known sites &#8211; national monuments and heritage buildings that are open to the public but which tend to be only visited by those very familiar with the particular area in which they are situated.  It is hoped that these new <i>&quot;Places to See&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;Monuments to Visit&quot;</i> websites will assist in encouraging tourists to visit locations that might not otherwise be on their itineraries and also assist people welcoming relatives and friends from abroad as part of The Gathering to be able to identify locations nearby that will interest visitors. My Department will also continue to cooperate closely with the Office of Public Works to further enhance the tourism value of our built heritage.</p><p>  I am informed that the Heritage Council has made a submission to F&aacute;ilte Ireland regarding the international marketing of Heritage Week 2013 to link in with &#8216;The Gathering&#8217;.  In addition, in 2013 the Heritage Council is grant-aiding a genealogist post in the organisation <i>Ireland Reaching Out, </i>a Diaspora focused organization that is contracted to support The Gathering. I also understand that Local Authority Heritage Officers, whose employment is financially supported by the Heritage Council, sit on County Committees for The Gathering 2013 around the country.</p><p>  In summary, therefore, I consider that a substantial contribution to The Gathering initiative is underway in both the cultural and heritage areas.</p></reply>

As Minister responsible for the arts and culture sectors, I am committed to securing the best possible funding provision for them during my term of office.</p><p>  Government policy is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts, to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life, and maximise the potential for cultural tourism. Primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council, which, under the Arts Acts, is independent in its funding decisions.  In 2013, the Arts Council will receive an allocation from my Department of some &#8364;60.7 million in current, capital and EU Presidency funding.</p><p>  The Government appreciates the importance of the arts, culture and the creative industries to both our society and to our economy. I am fully aware of the challenges for those involved in the arts and culture sectors and of the tremendous work they are doing.  I am committed to supporting the essential elements of the arts and culture sectors, within the available financial resources and in the light of the evolving budgetary and Estimates processes. </p><p>  The <i>Programme for Government</i> includes a commitment to <i>&quot;work with stakeholders in the Arts community to develop new proposals aimed at building private support of the Arts in Ireland exploring philanthropic, sponsorship or endowment fund opportunities&quot;.</i> To further this objective, in May 2012 I announced the introduction of a new philanthropic initiative on a pilot basis for arts and culture organisations. The initiative - the <i>Philanthropic Leverage Initiative </i>  - was designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment of the arts from private sources. The initiative, established with funding of &#8364;230,000 for 2012, has provided an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new funding relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts. The initiative was available across projects of varying scale, geography and art forms to not-for-profit organisations for arts programming projects. The organisations approved for funding under the initiative were required to procure matching philanthropic funds and complete their drawdown from my Department in 2012. Matched funding could come from public funds or from any public sector organisation. At the outset, it was anticipated that a multiple of 3.5 on the pilot initiative funds of &#8364;230,000 would result in philanthropic funding of some &#8364;800,000 being raised for the arts. The scheme proved very successful with a multiplier of 4.26 eventually being leveraged in philanthropic donations.  I recently launched a similar initiative for 2013 and full details are available on my Department's website. </p><p>  The <i>Philanthropic Leverage Initiative </i>was run in parallel with a second initiative - the Arts Council's <i>RAISE: Building Fundraising Capacity</i>   pilot initiative. That initiative will provide one-to-one professional support to eight selected organisations for two years through planning and implementing a tailored fundraising programme. This will help those art organisations build and resource their capacity to attract philanthropic giving. In developing this complementary programme, the Arts Council has identified that it is vital for art groups to develop, agree and implement an effective fundraising strategy and to properly resource that fundraising function. </p><p>  My Department has also provided support to the <i>Business to Arts</i> organisation for a number of years and, in each of the last three years, this has been allocated to delivery of the <i>New Stream Programme, </i>which builds fundraising skills in the cultural sector in Ireland. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch investment in this project is &#8364;400k over three years. In 2010, my Department also awarded a &#8364;20,000 grant to <i>Business to Arts</i> for &#8216;<i>Fund it</i>  &#8217; in 2010 under the Cultural Technology Grants Scheme. Business to Arts initially matched this figure with private funding and since then has attracted additional foundation funds to this project.</p><p>  The State appreciates and values the contribution the arts sector makes to the internationally renowned artistic reputation of this country.  As Minister with responsibility for the arts, I believe that, within the current economic constraints, investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity and potential of the sector.  The arts are a significant contributor and employer in their own right and they are also important building blocks for those economic policies the Government has identified as crucial for our economic recovery.</p></reply>

Ireland is now therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband in Ireland which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country. </p><p>  Specifically, the Plan commits to 70Mbps to 100Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; at least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population, and a minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.</p><p>  The Plan anticipates minimum target upload speeds of 25% to 30% of the headline download speeds.</p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  </p><p>  The Government is committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention.  </p><p>  In an important milestone towards delivery of the commitments in the Plan, the Government recently launched a tender for experts to assist in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be on-going throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including rural areas and towns with populations of less than 1500 people, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-13a.414.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013031300079#WRP01400"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Social Media have not to date been subject to a formal regulatory regime akin to that used to &lsquo;regulate&rsquo; traditional radio and television broadcast media, either in Ireland or in other jurisdictions.  There are a range of reasons for this, not least the rapidly evolving nature of the technologies involved, the sensitivities around regulating media and the multi-jurisdictional nature of the Internet.</p><p>  There has been a very considerable amount of discussion on these matters in the recent past at EU and Council of Europe level, in which my Department has been involved.  Indeed this matter is also the subject of a fundamental debate at EU and national level at present, a fact reflected by the recent decision of the Joint Oireachtas Committee to examine the issue.  Ireland is committed through the Internet Governance Principles contained in the Declaration of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers to the principle of &ldquo;Multi-stakeholder governance&rdquo;.  In this regard, the development of international Internet related public policies and Internet governance arrangements must allow for full and equal participation of all stakeholders from all countries.  My officials have been and will continue to be engaged in the discussions on these issues.</p><p>  As Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I have policy responsibility for providing a supportive legislative and regulatory environment to facilitate the development of high quality communications infrastructure and services.  However, I should highlight that I do not have sole responsibility for addressing as to how that infrastructure is used.  Responsibility, in the context of abuse over the Internet in particular, also sits with the Minister for Justice and Equality, and the executive agency of his Department, the Office for Internet Safety.</p><p>  It is clear that there are no simple answers to the challenges posed by the development and abuse of social media, not least because of the international basis of the services and because any possible policy responses fall across a range of Government Departments.  In recognition of this complexity my Department maintains open and regular contact with all Departments and State Agencies with responsibilities in this area.</p><p>  I am convinced that it is possible to ensure that people can gain the full benefit offered by social media, in their public and private lives, while being protected against harassment or bullying of any kind, if we remain open to appropriate and sensitive intervention.  Any such intervention must tread a very fine line between the protection of individuals and ensuring that free speech, and free and open debate, are preserved. This is difficult balance to strike, but we must continue to amend our regulatory regime in light of new technologies. My Department is presently evaluating how one such amendment might be introduced, to deal with a gap in telecommunications legislation. </p><p>  Experience in other jurisdictions has been that this balance is not easy to strike, and I fully intend to give any measures my full consideration before implementing them.</p></reply>

The Government however recognises the need to ensure that high speed broadband is available in all parts of Ireland, including towns such as Boyle, to underpin economic growth, enable eCommerce and greater connectivity for citizens generally.  To this end The National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to ensure that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses.</p><p>  The plan commits to 70Mbps to 100Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; at least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population, and a minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.</p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  </p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention. </p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.  </p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including Boyle and other rural areas in County Roscommon, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

Under Section 12 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977, where it appears to a local authority that it is necessary to do so in order to prevent or control pollution of waters, the local authority may serve a notice in writing on any person having control of any polluting matter on premises in its functional area.

Similarly, and as with all local charges, the invoicing and collection of any outstanding development contributions is a matter for the local authority concerned to manage in the light of prevailing local circumstances and in accordance with normal financial procedures.

In the Planning and Development Act 2000 increased rights were given to third parties in that planning authorities are statutorily obliged to acknowledge submissions on planning applications and to consider those submissions before making decisions on the applications. Persons who make submissions are also entitled to be notified of any new information provided, and to be notified of the decision of the planning authority.  These increased rights were introduced in tandem with the &euro;20 fee for making a submission or observation, the aim of which was to contribute to the increasing costs for planning authorities in administering the development consent system, while not discouraging public participation in the process.</p><p>  In relation to planning appeals, the position is that any person who made a submission on the planning application may appeal the decision of a planning authority on the application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the independent statutory appeals board. There is, however, also a fee for making an appeal - currently &euro;220. When an appeal is made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la any person may make a submission on it for a fee of &euro;50.</p><p>  It should also be noted that the Board has discretion to dismiss an appeal where it is satisfied the appeal is vexatious, frivolous or without substance or foundation or where the appeal is made with the sole intention of delaying development or of securing the payment of money, gifts, considerations or other inducement by any persons. </p><p>  The views of third parties are part of the planning process and, in any case, are only one of the matters considered by a planning authority when considering the planning application. In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities, and An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal, must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to a number of matters including the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by my Department.</p><p>  In relation to retention permission, under the Planning Acts all development, unless specifically exempted under the Acts or associated Regulations, requires planning permission. Any development that is carried out without planning permission, or that does not comply with the terms of a planning permission, is unauthorised development, and may be subject to enforcement action by a planning authority.  </p><p>  Planning authorities have substantial enforcement powers and duties under the Planning Acts. A planning authority must issue a warning letter in relation to written complaints regarding unauthorised development, or other unauthorised development it becomes aware of (except in the case of trivial or minor development). There is also a statutory obligation to carry out an investigation and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued or a court order should be sought, under section 160 of the 2000 Act. Where a planning authority establishes, following an investigation, that unauthorised development (other than development that is of a trivial or minor nature) has been or is being carried out, and the person who has carried out the development has not proceeded to remedy the position, then the planning authority must issue an enforcement notice or seek a court order, unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so.  </p><p>  An application for retention permission is required to be assessed by a planning authority in the same way as any other application, that is the planning authority is required to consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by my Department.</p></reply>

These powers include the power to refuse to allocate, or to refuse to sell, a dwelling to a person engaged in anti-social behaviour and the power to seek a court order excluding a person engaged in anti-social behaviour from entering a local authority dwelling or estate for a period of up to 3 years.  Each housing authority also has a statutory duty to adopt and review an anti-social behaviour strategy for the prevention and reduction of anti-social behaviour in its housing stock, which must provide for co-operation with other relevant bodies, notably the Garda&iacute;, who have a range of measures in place to deal with allegations of such behaviour generally.   </p><p>I intend to commence section 29 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 this year and to make the necessary regulations to give effect to the <i>Programme for Government</i> commitment to introduce probationary tenancies for all new social housing tenants, which will include provision for termination in the event of anti-social behaviour. </p><p>Proposals for new housing legislation currently being developed in my Department will include a revised procedure to replace section 62 of the Housing Act, 1966, which will be designed to enable housing authorities to recover possession of their dwellings from households engaged in anti-social behaviour.  I am also   examining the scope for making the excluding order powers of housing authorities more effective in tackling anti-social behaviour without having to evict entire families from their homes.  In the context of the new legislation, I am giving particular consideration to the issue of anti-social behaviour in the arrangements to be made for transferring responsibility for rent supplement households with an established long-term housing need from the Department of Social Protection to housing authorities.   </p><p>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the tenant-landlord relationship in the private rented residential sector.  The Act sets out the obligations of tenants and landlords in the sector and the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) is the independent statutory body charged with the administration of the Act and the enforcement of those obligations, as necessary.   </p><p>While action to deal with anti-social behaviour is primarily a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of private residential estates and complexes, under section 15 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 a landlord of a dwelling owes a duty to enforce the obligations of the tenant to each person who could be potentially affected by the breach of those obligations.   </p><p>  The Act specifically prohibits a tenant in a private residential tenancy from engaging in anti-social behaviour in, or in the vicinity of, a dwelling to which the Act applies and allows a landlord to terminate any tenancy where the tenant is engaging in or allowing others to engage in such behaviour.  This termination is subject to a notice period of only 7 days in the case of serious anti-social behaviour or 28 days in the case of less serious but persistent behaviour. </p><p>Section 77 of the Residential Tenancies Act provides that a third party who is directly and adversely affected by anti-social behaviour may refer a complaint to the PRTB against a landlord who has failed to enforce tenant obligations.  It also allows the PRTB to furnish the name and address of the landlord concerned to a person who proposes to make such a complaint.  However, the third party complainant must have taken reasonable steps to resolve the matter by communicating or attempting to communicate with the parties to the tenancy concerned before referring the complaint to the PRTB.   </p><p>The effectiveness of these provisions was clearly demonstrated in a recent case taken in Cork against the landlord of two properties, the tenants of which were found to be engaging in anti-social behaviour.  A group of 13 residents took a case to the PRTB and were awarded combined damages of just under &#8364;30,000 against the landlord for his failure to address the behaviour of his tenants.   </p><p>The above provisions are being kept under review in the context of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012, which will provide for amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004; the Bill has recently completed second stage in the D&aacute;il.   </p></reply>

I have no plans to amend the legislation in that regard. </p><p>Section 15 of the Residential Tenancies Act provides that a landlord of a dwelling owes a duty to third parties to enforce the obligations of a tenant under a tenancy.

It is a key tool of Government in providing supports for the 'harder to reach' in the most disadvantaged areas in society.  The Programme is managed by Pobal on behalf of my Department and delivered at a local level by the nationwide network of Local Development Companies and a small number of alternative delivery structures. </p><p>  To date, indicative allocations for the year and all first stage payments for 2013 have issued to all Local Development Companies contracted to deliver the Programme. </p><p>  In late 2011 the European Commission approved a change in the maximum co-funding rate from 55% to 85% for the Axes 3 and 4 elements (LEADER) of Ireland's Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013, thereby reducing the national exchequer input to 15% on a net basis for 2012 and 2013 without a concomitant increase in the amount of funding to be provided by the EU.  This resulted in a reduction in the overall Programme complement from &euro;427m to approximately &euro;314m on the basis of the Programme achieving full spend by the end of 2013. </p><p>In this context the original project allocations given to each Local Development Company (LDC) contracted to deliver the LEADER elements of the RDP required readjustment.  My Department is carrying out an exercise to determine the level of project commitments across all LDCs and all RDP measures in order to complete the rebalancing of the programme in as equitable a way as possible.  In addition, given the levels of spending by the LDCs from 2009 to date it is very unlikely that full spend will be achieved by the end of 2013.  The co-funding rate will revert to 55% for all expenditure beyond the end of 2013 and as a consequence of this the overall Programme requirement will also change.  Until such time as the rebalancing exercise, as outlined, has been satisfactorily completed, it is not possible to be definitive regarding the remaining funding available for project commitments under Axis 3&amp;4 of the RDP.  I expect this exercise to be completed shortly.   </p></reply>

I am satisfied that the reforms proposed including the lodgement of drawings, inspection by registered professionals and statutory certification will result in the necessary improvement in the quality of buildings and ensure that homeowners in particular are delivered the quality homes they expect and deserve.  The new regulations also place an increased emphasis on reliance on competent persons &ndash; the design must be certified by a registered professional, while the building owner is required to assign a competent builder to build and certify the works and, also, to assign a registered professional to draw up and execute an appropriate inspection plan for the building concerned and to certify compliance on completion.  It is not intended to constrain the capacity of all-in service delivery models that currently exist in key sectors of the industry.

My Department is the responsible Department for the delivery of the Axes 3 and 4 elements (LEADER) and , in line with the &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; approach to rural development, there are 35 Local Action Groups (LAGs) contracted by my Department to deliver the LEADER elements throughout the eligible rural areas of the country.</p><p>The 35 LAGs are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding and such decisions are made in the context of the local development strategy of the individual groups in line with Departmental operating rules and EU regulations. There is a total fund of &euro;314m available for allocation to qualifying projects up to the end of 2013.</p><p>Under the regulatory framework of the RDP a maximum of 20% of the fund can be spent to support the administration and running costs of the LAGs in implementing the RDP measures over the life of the programme. In addition funding is also available to the LAGs to carry out animation activities which can also involve the payment of staff salaries and other ancillary costs.</p><p>The nature of the RDP requires more intensive expenditure in the early part of the programming period on the running cost and animation elements of the programme. This is primarily due to the intensive efforts that are required by LAGs in order to support the capacity building and development of communities to avail of project funding. This type of support tends to decrease significantly as the programme matures.</p><p>Again in line with the &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; approach my Department has no remit in relation to LAG staff salaries or numbers.

However as an EU citizen they retain the right to move freely and reside within another EU member state for that period.  For the sake of completeness I should also add that in late 2012 one person from the Czech Republic who was serving a custodial sentence and who was transferred to the Czech Republic under the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act was also subject to an Exclusion Order.

There are fourteen Prison siting Committees in existence - one for each institution.  Each siting Committee comprises no more than six members, and only suitable people with appropriate qualifications and a genuine interest in prison issues are appointed.   There are currently 18 vacancies which I am in the process of filling.  Details on membership for each Committee are set out in the following tables.</p><p>The Government has approved the drafting of a General Scheme of an Inspection of Places of Detention Bill, which will include provisions to make siting Committees more effective, while they continue their role of visiting prisons, meeting with prisoners, and liaising on their behalf with prison authorities.  A link will be established between the siting Committees and the Inspector of Prisons. As part of these plans, it is intended to expand the role of the Inspector of Prisons.  I believe this will greatly enhance the Inspector's independent oversight of the prison system.  Subject to competing legislative priorities, it is expected that the General Scheme will be published early this year.  When work on preparation of the General Scheme has been completed, I will be seeking Government approval for its publication to facilitate a consultation process in advance of drafting and publication of the Bill.  <b>  </b></p><p>  <b>LIST OF CURRENT PRISON VISITING COMMITTEE VACANCIES</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Prison / Place of Detention</th><th>Current membership</th><th>No. of appointments required for figure of six on each committee (Vacancies)</th></tr><tr><td>Arbour Hill</td><td>  5</td><td>  1</td></tr><tr><td>Castlerea</td><td>  3   </td><td>  3</td></tr><tr><td>Cloverhill</td><td> 2</td><td>  4</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>  4</td><td>  2</td></tr><tr><td>D&oacute;chas</td><td>  5</td><td>  1</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>  6       </td><td>  0</td></tr><tr><td>Loughan House</td><td>  6      </td><td>  0</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands </td><td>  6        </td><td>  0</td></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy</td><td>  4        </td><td>  2</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td>  4         </td><td>  2</td></tr><tr><td>Shelton Abbey</td><td>  4</td><td>  2</td></tr><tr><td>St. Patrick's </td><td>  5         </td><td>  1</td></tr><tr><td>Training Unit</td><td>  6         </td><td>  0 </td></tr><tr><td>Wheatfield</td><td>  6         </td><td>  0</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td> 66</td><td>18</td></tr></table></p><p><b>LIST OF VISITING COMMITTEE MEMBERS  ( 12 March, 2013 )</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Prison</th><th>Member</th><th>Appointment date</th><th>Expiry date</th></tr><tr><td>Arbour Hill Prison</td><td>Rita Hayes <br />Abdullah Bulbulia <br />Wilhelmina Daly <br />Paddy Murray <br />Angela O'Connor</td><td>23.01.12<br />23.01.12<br />23.01.12<br />28.03.12<br />26.10.12</td><td>22.01.15<br />22.01.15<br />22.01.15<br />27.03.15<br />25.10.15</td></tr><tr><td>Castlerea Prison </td><td>Michael Nevin<br />Eddie Brady<br />Martin Daly</td><td>28.03.12<br />22.10.12<br />22.10.12</td><td>27.03.15<br />21.10.15<br />21.10.15</td></tr><tr><td>Cloverhill Prison</td><td>Margaret Downey<br />Fintan Hudson</td><td>12.03.13<br />12.03.13</td><td>11.03.16<br />11.03.16</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Prison</td><td>Donie O'Keeffe<br />Dermot O'Connell<br />Mary Loughnane<br />Tomas Ryan</td><td>08.07.10<br />23.01.12<br />23.01.12<br />22.10.12</td><td>07.07.13<br />22.01.15<br />22.01.15<br />21.10.15</td></tr><tr><td>D&oacute;chas Centre</td><td>Noel Cloak  <br />Bernie Donnelly<br />Mary Elliott<br />Ruth Gallagher<br />Anne Delaney</td><td>23.01.12<br />23.01.12<br />23.01.12<br />22.10.12<br />26.10.12</td><td>22.01.15<br />22.01.15<br />22.01.15<br />21.10.15<br />25.10.15</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick Prison</td><td>Maria Gorman<br />Val Rooney   <br />Mary Prendergast  <br />John Higgins <br />Patricia McCarthy<br />James Houlihan</td><td>21.04.10<br />23.01.12<br />15.02.12<br />20.02.12<br />28.03.12<br />26.10.12</td><td>20.04.13<br />22.01.15<br />14.02.15<br />19.02.15<br />27.03.15<br />25.10.15</td></tr><tr><td>Loughan House Place of Detention</td><td>Francis McDermott<br />Gerry O'Connor<br />Kathleen Richey<br />Andrew Cullen<br />Patrick Boyle<br />Peter Cutliffe</td><td>08.06.10<br />24.06.10<br />23.01.12<br />23.01.12<br />23.01.12<br />03.12.12</td><td>07.06.13<br />23.06.13<br />22.01.15<br />22.01.15<br />22.01.15<br />02.12.15</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands Prison</td><td>John Cronin<br />Brigid Teefy<br />Colm Wiley<br />Paddy Boland<br />Nuala Halpin<br />Colette Fennelly</td><td>01.05.10<br />01.05.10<br />01.05.10<br />15.05.10<br />08.11.10<br />08.10.12</td><td>30.04.13<br />30.04.13<br />30.04.13<br />14.05.13<br />07.11.13<br />07.10.15</td></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy Prison</td><td>Liam Hogan<br />Stephen Langton<br />Joe Aherne<br />Tom Crean</td><td>09.01.11<br />10.01.11<br />23.01.12<br />03.12.12</td><td>08.01.14<br />09.01.14<br />22.01.15<br />02.12.15</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise Prison</td><td>Anne Turley<br />Eilis Croke<br />Brian O'Neil<br />Margaret Guijt-Lawlor</td><td>11.04.10<br />08.07.10<br />26.10.12<br />03.12.12</td><td>10.04.13<br />07.07.13<br />25.10.15<br />02.12.15</td></tr><tr><td>Shelton Abbey Place of Detention</td><td>Gerry Delaney<br />Thomas Gregan <br />Margaret Short  <br />Richard Codd </td><td>23.01.02<br />15.02.12<br />15.02.12<br />21.02.12</td><td>22.01.15<br />14.02.15<br />14.02.15<br />20.02.15</td></tr><tr><td>St. Patrick's Institution</td><td>Yvonne N&iacute;

The European Court of Justice declared in case C418/04 that, by failing to take all the measures necessary to comply with Article 6(3) of Directive 92/43 (Habitats Directive) in respect of authorisation of aquaculture programmes, Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under that Directive.  In the negotiations to address the judgment a process was agreed with the European Commission which would lead to full compliance by Ireland with the relevant EU Directives.  This process includes the following steps:	a detailed data collection in 91 Bays/Estuaries; detailed analysis of raw data collected; setting of Conservation Objectives by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in respect of each site; carrying out Appropriate Assessments of each licence application/fishery plan against the detailed Conservation Objectives set, and determination of Licences/Fisheries on the basis of the Appropriate Assessment and other relevant factors.</p><p>  My Department has been working closely with the Marine Institute, BIM, and NPWS to achieve full compliance through a multi-annual work programme.  A key factor of this Work Programme is the identification of prioritised bays based on the number of aquaculture sites, the ready availability of scientific data and other factors.  Conservation Objectives have been set for Galway Bay complex SAC and Inner Galway Bay SPA.  The next step in the process is the carrying out of an Appropriate Assessment by the Marine Institute.  This is being progressed taking account of the need to facilitate the use of scientific and other resources on a flexible basis across the full range of bays.</p></reply>

REPS 4 is a measure under the current 2007-13 Rural Development Programme and is subject to EU Regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications to be completed before any payments can issue.  Following the administrative check an area discrepancy was discovered between the Single Farm Payment Scheme application for 2012 and the REPS Agri-Environmental Plan which has resulted in the need for further clarification.  This issue is currently being investigated with the intention of an early resolution and payment in respect of 2012.</p></reply>

I have on many previous occasions referred to my commitment to ensure that the maximum number of jobs are created and maintained in the seafood industry.  Both Food Harvest 2020 and Action Plan for Jobs 2012 recognise that most of the potential for increased employment in the seafood industry is in the areas of processing and aquaculture.  Food Harvest 2020 aims to increase employment in the seafood sector as a whole, from the present approximately 11,000 to 14,000 by 2020 and to increase turnover from &euro;700 million to &euro;1 billion.  The two targets are part of the same ambition to grow the seafood industry and its contribution to our economy.  The EU co-funded Seafood Development Programme 2007-2013 provides a wide range of supports for the development of the seafood industry.  These measures are intended to assist the industry in achieving the potential identified in Food Harvest 2020.</p><p>  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will shortly be advertising a call for applications under the Commercial Aquaculture Development Scheme and the Seafood Processing Business Investment Scheme.  Grants of up to 40% will be available in 2013 under the aquaculture scheme to operators in either the shellfish or whitefish sectors of the aquaculture industry to develop and sustainably grow their operations.  The scheme is subject to certain restrictions on operators located in Natura 2000 protected sites and operators in the salmon farming sector.  I have made available some &euro;2.5 million for this scheme in 2013.  The processing sector has been recognised as a high growth area of the seafood industry.  CSO figures show that seafood exports were valued at &euro;495 million in 2012, an increase of 18% over 2011.  Grants of up to 30% will be available in 2013 under the processing scheme to seafood processing companies seeking to modernise and grow their businesses through investments in value added production.  This is a premium of 10% over that available under the scheme to primary processors and will target funds at those firms maximising the value of raw material, including wild and farmed shellfish.  I have made available some &euro;2.5 million for this scheme in 2013.</p></reply>

Further, for best practice, operators should also stand back from tank while the tank is being agitated as toxic gasses will be released during the agitation of any slurry.</p></reply>

These include national studies in 1984, 1990, 2001 and 2002, regional studies between 1990 and 1999 and a cross border study in 2006.  All of these studies showed a substantial benefit of fluoridation in terms of a reduction in tooth decay.  The Health Research Board has recently approved funding for a study to be led by the Oral Health Services Research Centre of University College Cork.  The Department of Health is a collaborator in the study.  The study will consider the impact of changes on the oral health of children, following policy decisions relating to fluoride toothpaste use for infants and young children in 2002 and the reduced level of fluoridation in drinking water since 2007. </p><p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, which was established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters.  The Expert Body provides advice and information on all aspects of water fluoridation.  In evaluating ongoing research, the Expert Body accepts the fundamental scientific tenet that any single piece of scientific evidence by itself remains hypothetical unless it can be repeated or confirmed by other scientists.  Therefore, it considers scientific evidence that has been submitted to examination by other scientists, usually by publication in recognised peer reviewed scientific journals, after such publication has been approved by independent referees.  This ensures that the advice provided by the Expert Body is impartial and evidence-based.  The Expert Body is satisfied that water fluoridation, at its optimal level, causes no ill effects to the health of adults or children.

The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultation.</p><p>  The Government's Programme for Government committed it to major reforms of the manner in which health services are delivered. As part of the reform programme, Universal Primary Care is to be introduced on a phased basis during its term of office. Primary legislation is being prepared to give effect to this commitment.  The wording of this legislation, which will allow the Minister for Health to make regulations to extend access to GP services without fees to persons with prescribed illnesses, is currently being drafted by the Office of the Attorney General and the Department. As the legislation is still being drafted, I am not in a position to give a definite date for its publication. Details of an implementation timeframe, illnesses to be covered  etc.  and application details will be announced in due course. </p></reply>

Developments so far under the Programme include the opening of Rapid Access Clinics at four of these centres, including Beaumont, St James&rsquo;s, Galway and Limerick. The Rapid Access clinics are led by Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANPs). Under the Programme, 10.5 (WTE) Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANPs) have been recruited to lead these clinics so that a total of 12 ANPs are now in place across the four centres, delivering services on site and on an outreach basis.</p><p>  The two Epilepsy Monitoring Units (EMUs) planned for Cork and Beaumont under the Programme will increase pre-surgical evaluation capacity. Monitoring is required for those patients with the worst effects of epilepsy, and patients at these units will require 24-7 care. </p><p>  The staffing requirements to enable the units to be safely opened have been identified. I am advised that the staffing required for the unit at Beaumont includes five staff nurses, one consultant neurophysiologist and three technicians. I am advised by the HSE that, having secured recruitment approval from the National Control Group, Beaumont is progressing the recruitment  of  the posts necessary to support the service development. </p><p>  With regard to Cork, the HSE has advised that it is the intention of the Cork University Hospital management to open the EMU in Quarter 3 of this year and this will be included in the HSE South&rsquo;s 2013 Regional Service Plan.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-13a.637.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013031300083#WRZ00600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 to 206, inclusive, together.</p><p>The Government is committed to a single-tier health service, supported by universal health insurance, which provides equal access based on need, not ability to pay, and which delivers the best health outcomes for Irish citizens. </p><p>  Universal health insurance (UHI) will replace the current inequitable and inefficient two-tier health system.  Under UHI, everyone will be insured for a standard package of curative services comprising primary and hospital care services, including mental health services.  Health insurance will be mandatory, with a system of financial support ensuring affordability by paying or subsidising the cost of insurance premiums for all those who qualify.  Insurance will be provided under a multi-payer insurer model with no distinction between &#8220;public&#8221; and &#8220;private&#8221; patients.  The system will be founded on principles of social solidarity, including  financial protection, open enrolment, lifetime cover and community rating. </p><p>  The introduction of UHI will see the purchasing of primary and hospital care largely devolved to insurers.  Health insurers will commission care for their members from primary care providers, independent not-for-profit Hospital Trusts and private hospitals.  In doing this, they will have a duty to use their purchasing role to ensure that quality, continuous care is provided at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as close to a person's home as possible.  Furthermore, in line with the fundamental principle of social solidarity, neither insurers nor providers operating within the UHI system will be allowed to sell faster access to services covered by the UHI standard package of care.  While it is envisaged that supplementary insurance may be purchased for items not covered by the standard package, this may not interfere with the fundamental overriding principle of access to care being based on need. </p><p>The Department is currently undertaking detailed work in relation to the preparation of a <i>White Paper on Universal Health Insurance.</i>   This White Paper will provide further detail on the UHI model for Ireland in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with its introduction.   The work involved is both complex and technical and  demands a wide-range of specialised legal and financial expertise.  My Department has recently engaged specialised legal expertise to support work in relation to the design of the UHI model and work in this area is underway. </p><p>The reform programme is a major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing over a number of years and full implementation of UHI will take some time to achieve. I anticipate that by 2016 the necessary groundwork will be in place to enable us to phase in  implementation of UHI, as promised in the Programme for Government. I should add that it is my intention to consult widely as part of the reform implementation process.    </p></reply>

Depending on the level of complexity of the individual case, processing of the application may take longer.  For example, in cases where ancillary State support is sought, additional factors may impact on the timeframe, e.g. the HSE must establish title of property before a decision cane be made and establishing title can be a lengthy process in some cases.

There is a provision for discretion to grant a card in cases of "undue hardship" where the income guidelines are exceeded.</p><p>  The Government's Programme for Government committed it to major reforms of the manner in which health services are delivered. As part of the reform programme, Universal Primary Care is to be introduced on a phased basis during its term of office. Primary legislation is being prepared to give effect to this commitment.The wording of this legislation, which will allow the Minister for Health to make regulations to extend access to GP services without fees to persons with prescribed illnesses, is currently being drafted by the Office of the Attorney General and the Department. As the legislation is still being drafted, I am not in a position to give a definite date for its publication.

I established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which is working to unblock access to acute services by improving patient flow through the system, including Beaumont hospital. An intensive work programme is underway between the SDU's liaison officers, the Clinical Programmes and Beaumont hospital teams. The SDU is satisfied that there is increased engagement at all levels in the hospital ensuring that emergency patients are seen in a timely manner, focussing on working to achieve the national targets for unscheduled care. There has been some improvement in treatment times for patients at Beaumont Emergency Department (ED) - 59% of new ED patients were admitted to a ward or discharged in less than six hours from their arrival time at Beaumont in January 2013 compared to 50% in May 2012.</p><p>  I relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy in relation to additional immediate steps being taken to reduce waiting times at the hospital, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.</p></reply>

Arrangements are in place in each of the seven hospital hepatology units to ensure that all patients in urgent need of treatment are prioritised during this transition phase.  All parties, including hospital pharmacists, have been actively planning for the changes to ensure that these services are delivered effectively and safely to patients.</p><p>  The HSE Service Plan 2013 provides funding for the continued rollout of this service.   The HSE has made arrangements to ensure that the appropriate pharmacy capacity and resources are available in each of the 7 hospitals to provide the anti-viral treatment as soon as possible to patients who have been assessed as suitable to receive it.  This includes the recruitment of additional hospital based pharmacists to ensure that treatment is available to all patients in a timely manner.  The pharmacists representative body has written to the HSE confirming it agrees with this arrangement.   In this context, the HSE does not envisage any further delays.</p></reply>

Additionally, &euro;17,348.50 of Free Travel Pass funding has been allocated to Longford Rural Transport Programme from January to June, 2013, with a further proposed, allocation of &euro;17,348.00 from July to December. This represents a total 2013 allocation of &euro;187,542.50, of combined RTP and FTP funding for the provision of the RTP service in Longford.</p><p>  My aim is to strengthen the RTP by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure by maximising integration with other state transport services and by making  the programme a sustainable part of the public transport system. This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.  Since becoming Minister for Public and Commuter Transport the developments I have initiated have been aimed at ensuring that into the future there is a more complete and cost effective transport service offering in rural areas that better meets the transport needs of all users. To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA) with effect from 1 April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.  I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport.  I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community.  However, given  resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised. To not do this would mean that vital services would be threatened.  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved. If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Coordination Units be established.  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector.  Rural Transport by its nature is community based and this will remain under any new structure.  While I can understand and fully appreciate that this restructuring creates a level of uncertainty for RTP groups, I am hopeful that the outcome will be a better service delivered more efficiently. I will work with all involved over the coming months to make any transition as smooth as possible.</p></reply>

Additionally, &euro;88,726.50 of Free Travel Pass funding has been allocated to Kerry Community Transport Limited from January to June, 2013, with a further proposed, allocation of &euro;88,726.00 from July to December. This represents a total 2013 allocation of &euro;752,311.00, of combined RTP and FTP funding for the provision of the RTP service in Kerry.</p><p>  My aim is to strengthen the RTP by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure by maximising integration with other state transport services and by making  the programme a sustainable part of the public transport system. This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.  Since becoming Minister for Public and Commuter Transport the developments I have initiated have been aimed at ensuring that into the future there is a more complete and cost effective transport service offering in rural areas that better meets the transport needs of all users. To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA) with effect from 1 April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.  I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport.</p><p>  I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community.  However, given resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised. To not do this would mean that vital services would be threatened.  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved. If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.</p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Coordination Units be established.  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken regarding Kerry or any other part of the country, but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector.  Rural Transport by its nature is community based and this will remain under any new structure.  While I can understand and fully appreciate that this restructuring creates a level of uncertainty for RTP groups, I am hopeful that the outcome will be a better service delivered more efficiently. I will work with all involved over the coming months to make any transition as smooth as possible.</p></reply>
