Eighty five percent (85%) of employment in Ethiopia is currently provided by agriculture, therefore it is clear that the continued development of sustainable agriculture production systems and the development of a vibrant agri-food industry in Ethiopia represent huge opportunities to provide food and livelihood security for many millions of Ethiopians.</p><p>  In this regard I believe that Ireland&rsquo;s agri-food sector has a role to play in assisting Ethiopia reach its full potential.  During the 3<sup>rd</sup>  Africa Ireland Economic Forum, held in Dublin in October this year, I met my counterpart from Ethiopia, Mr Tefera Derbew, to discuss current developments in the agri-food sectors in Ireland and Ethiopia.  At this meeting we signed a joint Statement of Intent which encourages enhanced cooperation between Ireland and Ethiopia in the areas of agriculture, in particular continued cooperation in the areas of Agricultural Research and Training.</p><p>  In follow up to this at the end of October 2013 Teagasc signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research which provides for further close collaboration between the two bodies.</p><p>  Ethiopia is one of nine Key Partner Countries for Ireland&rsquo;s overseas aid programme administered by Irish Aid. In 2012, Irish Aid&rsquo;s bilateral programme spending in Ethiopia was <b>&euro;26 million</b>.  Irish Aid also provided funding to agencies including Concern, Goal, Self Help Africa, Tr&oacute;caire and UN organisations in Ethiopia, bringing our total funding for Ethiopia to over <b>&euro;32 million</b>. </p><p>  In addition as the Deputy may be aware in 2012 the Tanaiste and I launched the Africa Agri-food Development Fund (AADF). The Fund aims to develop partnerships between the Irish Agri-Food Sector and African countries to support sustainable growth of the local food industry, build markets for local produce and support mutual trade between Ireland and Africa. </p><p>  One project which has received funding from the Fund is MaGrow, a technology which uses magnetic inserts to improve spraying/irrigation equipment used for crop spraying. The project aims to develop a manufacturing facilities and jobs in both Ireland and Ethiopia. To date AADF funding has been approved for the start-up phase of the project which includes a comprehensive business plan and production of prototype to be followed by field trials in Ethiopia. AADF funding will also be considered the further stages of the project.</p><p>  I will continue to encourage Irish private sector agri-food enterprises to look at the potential of Africa in the coming years to develop cooperation and trade.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-12a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121200045#WRA00900"><p>I am confident that the industry developed targets set out in Food Harvest 2020 are achievable and can be met.  The main targets in the Food Harvest report are by 2020 to increase the value of:</p><p>- Primary output in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sector by 33%;</p><p>- Value added production by 40%;</p><p>- Agriculture, food (including seafood) and drink exports by 42%;</p><p>In addition, a 50% increase in milk production and a 78% increase in the volume of aquaculture production is envisaged.</p><p>  Progress on these targets and the 215 recommendations in the Food Harvest report are monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Food Harvest High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC). The HLIC, which I chair, consists of the senior officials of all state agencies involved in the agriculture, food and fisheries sector.  Their third report &ldquo;<i>Milestones for Success 2013</i>  &rdquo;, published in September, showed that the sector had achieved growth in excess of 25% (primary production), 20% (value-added) and 13% (exports) by the end of 2012, compared to the baseline period.</p><p>  The CAP and CFP reforms, concluded during the Irish EU Presidency, provide a sound policy framework for the sustainable development of the agri-food and fisheries sector to 2020 and beyond. A range of State-led measures targeted at improving competitiveness and sustainability have been implemented, for example Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s <i>Lean Business</i> offer, the Teagasc/Farmer&rsquo;s Journal <i>BETTER Beef Farms</i>; and Bord Bia&rsquo;s <i>Origin Green</i> and <i>Food Works</i>   initiatives.</p><p>  Strong industry support and buy-in for the Food Harvest targets and vision is critical to success.  Industry investment in processing, innovation and developing new markets proves the confidence, drive and ambition of Irish food companies.  At primary level, farmers have shown an increased focus on efficiency and sustainability.</p><p>  Opportunities exist to increase our exports to countries such as China, Russia, Africa, South East Asia and the Middle East, as demonstrated during my recent trade mission to the Gulf States. In addition, there will be opportunities arising for increased market access from the negotiation of Free Trade Agreements with Canada, USA, India, Japan, Thailand and Vietnam.  I therefore believe that the agri-food and fisheries sector is well placed to meet the Food Harvest targets, and to make a substantial contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s export-led economic recovery.</p></reply>

This process includes the following steps:</p><p>- a detailed data collection in 91 Bays/Estuaries;</p><p>- detailed analysis of raw data collected;</p><p>- setting of Conservation Objectives by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in respect of each site;</p><p>- carrying out Appropriate Assessments of each licence application/fishery plan against the detailed Conservation Objectives set; and</p><p>- determination of Licences/Fisheries on the basis of the Appropriate Assessment and other relevant factors.</p><p>  The data collection programme is substantially complete.  Analysis of the data, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.  </p><p>  Conservation objectives had been set in relation to a significant number of bays and Appropriate Assessments have been carried in five bays (Castlemaine, Dundalk, Lough Swilly, Donegal Bay and Roaringwater).  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that as a result of the above process I have made aquaculture licence Determinations in respect of applications in Castlemaine. A number of licensing determinations in respect of Roaringwater Bay have been made and others are imminent at this time.</p><p>  My Department continues to make every effort to expedite the determination of aquaculture licence applications having regard to the need to comply with all relevant national and EU legislation.</p></reply>

These rigorous procedures, together with on-farm inspections, apply to a number of scheme payments including the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and the Agri-environment Options Scheme (AEOS), and are necessary to ensure that applications meet the scheme conditions and cross-compliance requirements. </p><p>  All of the 29,253 REPS 4 and the 13,746 AEOS 1 and 2 applicants who are eligible to receive a payment in 2013 have to be subjected to a full administrative check before the first phase of payment (75%) can be released. All of these administrative checks have been completed and payments commenced in November and will issue on a continuous basis until all payments are complete.  In a certain number of cases the administrative checks raised issues and queries which require detailed examination. Department staff are working to resolve these as quickly as possible. Many of these cases, will, however, require the applicants&rsquo; to supply further information such as soil tests before payment can issue. </p><p>  The LPIS Review exercise which will be completed shortly, resulted in area changes for some applicants, but has not held up the 75% payment in respect of either the REPS or the AEOS schemes and any impacts are being taken into account at either the 75% or 25% payment stage. The balancing payment of 25% is issued when all of the required control inspections are completed which is again laid out in the EU governing regulations. It is anticipated that these balancing payments will commence in mid December for all of those applicants whose files are in order. A total of &euro;148 m will be spent on REPS and &euro;51m on AEOS by the end of the year, in accordance with the budget allocation for these schemes.</p></reply>

Operational  matters are the responsibility of its board and CEO.</p><p>  The Board is also responsible for ensuring that the organisation has systems and procedures in place to ensure adherence to best practice in regard to corporate governance. Bord na gCon is required to act in accordance with its statutory obligations, the <i>&ldquo;Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies&rdquo;</i> and with Government policy.</p><p>  As Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine I am responsible for appointing the Chairman of Board na gCon.  The position of Chairman of Board na gCon was vacated on 16<sup>th</sup> February 2011 following the retirement of the then Chairman. Recognising the importance of the role of Chairman, one of my earliest decisions, taken shortly after my appointment as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine was, on 12th April 2011, to appoint the current Chairman.</p><p>  In terms of oversight, my Department monitors the compliance of Bord na gCon with its responsibilities in a number of ways, including  by  meeting with Bord na gCon at least bi-annually  to discuss matters of mutual interest, and obtain assurance in relation to compliance with  corporate governance standards. Issues arising from this forum are dealt with as required.</p><p>  In addition, the Chairman of Bord na gCon, in accordance with the paragraph 13.1 of the <i>&ldquo;Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies&rdquo;</i>  is required to submit  a comprehensive report covering a wide range of governance issues and confirms the Group&rsquo;s compliance with the Code. Any non-compliances must be  explained,  if they arise,  and the appropriate corrective actions outlined.</p><p>  In relation to governance, Bord na gCon is required to have an Internal Auditor and an Internal Audit Committee and fulfils this requirement.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Annual Report and Accounts of Bord na gCon are independently audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Comptroller and Auditor General reports by exception if the statement of internal financial control does not reflect Bord na gCon&rsquo;s compliance with the <i>&ldquo;Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies&rdquo;.</i>  Officials from my Department examine the Annual Reports, the C&amp;amp;AGs report, the Chairman&rsquo;s Report to the Minister (referred to above) and instigate follow-up action as appropriate.</p><p>  On the basis of a model adopted with a number of agencies under the aegis of my Department, including Coillte, BIM and HRI, I recently announced my intention to commission a review of Bord Na gCon.</p><p>  This review is being undertaken to ensure that the governance and administrative structures supporting the industry remain appropriate and fully effective in the modern operating environment. It will assess the current legislative framework, governance structures, the structure and size of the board, and a number of other matters.</p><p>  Tenders for the review were sought through a public procurement process, a preferred bidder has been identified and I am happy to report that it is expected that the contract will be signed shortly.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-12a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121200045#WRA01700"><p>The annual fishing opportunities for the Community&rsquo;s fishing fleets are traditionally agreed at the December Fisheries Council. This year, the arrangements for 2014 are due to be negotiated at the Council scheduled for 16<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th </sup>and 18<sup>th</sup>   of December.  The levels of Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and the quotas for Ireland will again be determined at that meeting following negotiations with Member States and the EU Commission.</p><p>  The process of preparing for the Council has been under way since the publication of detailed proposals for TACs and quotas of key stocks of interest to Ireland on the 30<sup>th</sup> of October. The Commissions&rsquo; proposal for Nephrops in the Irish Sea was, however, only received on the 22<sup>nd</sup>  of November. In preparing for the Council I have engaged in consultations, with the assistance of the Marine Institute and BIM, with the industry and other stakeholders here in Ireland as well as with other Member States in regard to stocks of common interest. I have also had direct engagement with the authorities in the UK, which involves Northern Ireland. The latter are particularly important when it comes to nephrops. There have also been protracted discussions in Brussels and these have continued this week in preparation for Council next week.</p><p>  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals are based on formal advice received from ICES, the independent international body with responsibility for advising on the state of fish stocks. It also takes account of the views of the (STECF) Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, which gives the Commission its views on the economic, technical and social impacts of the scientific advice. </p><p>  Specifically with regard to nephrops, Ireland has stocks in both Area VI and Area VII.  The latter is of vital importance to the Irish fishing industry and Commission proposal on the table is for a cut of 24% on the 2013 quota. In financial terms this would cost the Irish fleet over &euro;10 million. The proposal appears to be based on a  narrow interpretation of the ICES advice and does not take into consideration the fact that traditionally landings are significantly below the TAC. This is the second most important fishery to Ireland after mackerel, and I am not accepting such a drastic and unwarranted cut.</p><p>  Under utilisation of quotas by some Member States is a fact, the effect of which is that actual landings have been at or below the scientific advice for a number of years.  Given this, and allied with the over restrictive interpretation of the advice, reducing the TAC as proposed by the Commission is, in my view, unnecessary and overly precautionary.  I will work closely with my UK colleagues to make the strongest possible case in order that the proposed level of reduction is not implemented.</p></reply>

When the process on the new agreement  began and the Commission was seeking a mandate, Ireland sought that any agreement  should be more transparent and should include clearer geographic reporting on the benefits of the Agreement in the Western Sahara.</p><p>  Ireland considers that the new agreement addresses concerns raised.  We welcome the introduction of provisions to the Protocol on the planning and reporting duties of Morocco in respect of the regional distribution of funds, especially with regard to the expected economic and social benefits and the geographical distribution of these benefits.</p><p>  Ireland has joined with like minded Member States, and has asked the Commission to inform the Council comprehensively and regularly on the returns received by the West Saharan population as a result of the agreement. It must be ensured that the West Saharan Sahrawi population is also given an appropriate stake, and a stake that is in line with their interests, in the financial resources ensuing from the agreement. The EU Commission has also  advised that it considered that the agreements is consistent with the reform of the external dimension of the EU Common Fisheries Policy in that it places strong emphasis on scientific advice, economic profitability, good governance and respect of international law. EU Fishing activity is restricted to the surplus resources in all fisheries thus ensuring sustainability of the fish stocks.</p><p>  Ireland  joined with Germany and Austria in a Statement emphasising the importance of having regard to human rights &amp;amp; self determination in terms of the implementation of the agreement.

My Department&rsquo;s industry derived strategic research agenda called &lsquo;<b><i>Stimulating Sustainable Agricultural Production through Research and Innovation&rsquo; </i></b> contains a dedicated chapter on Crops (tillage) and a section on grassland management and breeding and, almost exclusively, this agenda informed the content of the Department&rsquo;s last two research calls.  Furthermore, a strategic research agenda on Forestry research is nearing completion which will focus on all aspects of forestry research including tree breeding. </p><p><b>Cereals</b></p><p>  The Irish tillage sector has benefitted significantly from developments in plant science in recent years.  Over the last thirty years or so the average commercial gains in the yield of cereals on Irish farms has been between 1% and 2% annually.  Half of this gain has been due to the selection of superior varieties for Irish conditions through intensive testing in my Department&rsquo;s Crop Evaluation Programme.  Cereal yields here are now among the best in the world. </p><p>  The same intensity of progress in the sphere of plant science has taken place in Irish grassland production.  Some of the most successful grasses used in our high performing pastures have been bred by Teagasc and there are further improved varieties, uniquely suited to our conditions, in the pipeline.  </p><p><b>Potatoes</b></p><p>  Ireland has enjoyed much success both here and abroad in producing new improved potato varieties.  Teagasc is the main potato breeder in Ireland and its breeding programme has been particularly successful.  In its partnership with Irish Potato Marketing, 39 varieties have been released and at least 25 of these are still being marketed commercially in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.  The variety Rooster, released in 1990 and probably the best-known of the Teagasc-bred varieties, now accounts for 56% of the total potato area grown in Ireland</p><p><b>Horticulture</b></p><p>  In the horticultural area, the bulk of work in the development of plant science occurs in either Teagasc or the various Universities. The Teagasc research programme in this area is mainly concentrated on the management, screening and evaluation of a range of ornamental species for suitability as cut foliage.</p><p><b>Forestry</b></p><p>  In partnership with a number of other organisations, my Department also supports the forest genetic resources aspects of plant science through grant aid funding for the work of Teagasc on the improvement of alder and birch, the work of the <i>Future Trees Trust</i>  on the improvement of ash, birch, oak, Spanish chestnut and sycamore and the involvement in the work of the European Network on Forest Genetic Resources.  </p><p><b>Teagasc</b></p><p>  Teagasc have a group of plant scientists and biotechnologists based at Oak Park in Carlow, employing the latest plant science technologies for the improvement of crops for Irish agriculture, with the work targeted at those likely to have the biggest impact on the agricultural sector with a view to supporting the objectives of Food Harvest 2020.  Currently the work is focussed on; the development of genomic selection in Perennial Ryegrass, improving disease resistance in cereals, accelerating the rate of genetic improvement in potatoes through the development of marker assisted selection and the production of biomass from marginal lands.</p></reply>

I and my officials are currently giving careful consideration to all of the responses.  I hope to be in a position to make decisions across the range of alternatives by the end of 2013. In general, Member States are required to notify Commission about decisions by 31 August 2014.</p><p>  As regards Pillar 2, work on the development of the next rural development programme is already well under way. An initial consultation process was launched in 2012, and written submissions were received from over 80 stakeholders. These submissions have been analysed by the Department and have fed into the development of SWOT and needs analyses. A second consultation was held in July 2013, where stakeholders attended a full day workshop. Based on the outcome of these processes, the drafting of a new programme is being advanced by the Department, and it is intended that further stakeholder consultation will form part of this. </p><p>  A general co-financing rate of 53% is set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation but this rate may rise to a maximum of 80% for measures such as farm and business development, co-operation activities, and LEADER projects.

The total Exchequer funding that will be required to draw down the available EAFRD funding will depend on the types of measures to be included in the new Rural Development Programme and on the co-financing rates specific to these measures.</p><p>  While final decisions in relation to what measures are to be included in the new RDP have not yet been made, my Department is in ongoing contact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the overall financing that will be required and also with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in relation to the level of EAFRD funding to be reserved for LEADER under the new RDP.

This year, the arrangements for 2013 are due to be negotiated at the Council scheduled for 16th and 17th of December.  The levels of Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and the quotas for Ireland will again be determined at that meeting following negotiations with Member States and the EU Commission.  The Fisheries Council will also decide on the fishing effort, which determines days spent at sea, available for the Irish fleet in the Irish Sea and off the north-west coast for 2014.</p><p>  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals are based on formal advice received from ICES, the independent international body with responsibility for advising on the state of fish stocks. It also takes account of the views of the (STECF) Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, which gives the Commission its views on the economic, technical and social impacts of the scientific advice. .  </p><p>  As a general principal, Ireland is committed to having Total Allowable Catches set at levels that can produce Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) by 2015, where possible and by 2020 at the latest.  This is consistent with the newly reformed Common Fisheries Policy.  A core objective of the Common Fisheries Policy is to  ensure exploitation of  living aquatic resources that provides sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions&quot;.  Under the ongoing reform of the CFP, the goal of attaining fishing mortality rates that are consistent with delivering maximum sustainable yield by 2015 has been set.  While achieving this through the regulation of catches (TACs) may be relatively straight-forward in the context of a single species fishery; in multi-gear, multi-species and multi-fleet fisheries using single species, TAC constraints are complex and challenging.</p><p>  The basis for Ireland&rsquo;s assessment of the biological impacts of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for fixing 2014 fishing opportunities is the Stock Book. The Stock Book is produced annually by the Marine Institute and provides up to date scientific information, including ICES advice, on the state of the fisheries resources exploited by the Irish fleet.  The Stock Book has been published by the Marine Institute since 1993 and has evolved considerably in that time period.  It continues to evolve in a changing fisheries advisory environment.   </p><p>  Data collection and evaluation to support the advice provides is collected by Ireland and other Member States involved in a fishery.   I consider that the EU should support increased funding for data collection and I am strongly pursuing  increased EU funding for this area under the new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund currently under negotiation at EU level.</p></reply>

Approximately 130,000 farmers benefit from these schemes and these supports will continue under the next CAP, recently agreed by the Irish Presidency. Financial controls are operated by the EU Commission on the management of EU funded schemes paid out by Member States as part of the Clearance of Accounts process.  If the Commission believes the scheme does not fully adhere to EU regulations, a financial correction can be imposed. The EU Commission has been auditing schemes in operation in Ireland over a five year period and has concluded that some farmers have declared land eligible and sought payment on land that contains ineligible features such as houses, farmyards, roads, rivers, scrub etc. This has occurred under all land based schemes including REPS. Cognisance is, however, taken where lower stocking rates apply under certain agri-environmental schemes.</p><p>  At a meeting between the Department of Agriculture and the EU Commission in July 2013, the Commission indicated that this practice of claiming on ineligible features has to be regularised, to avoid Ireland being significantly penalised  by the Commission.  In order to avoid a significant financial correction, which would see the overall Single Farm Payment Scheme reduced for all farmers, including those fully compliant with the scheme, a review of land eligibility has been undertaken by my Department, this review will be completed within the next few weeks. </p><p>  As part of that review, 950,000 eligible land parcels (belonging to approximately 130,000 farmers) are being examined; ineligible features have been identified in some cases (a minority) in the context of the 2013 payment scheme. In the vast majority of cases, it does not appear that farmers have over-claimed and most farmers have applied the rules correctly. While it is not possible until the review is complete to provide final figures on over-claims by farmers, it is clear that over 90% of the farmers reviewed to date have either no reduction or a very minimal reduction. </p><p>  As the review progresses, letters are issuing to farmers indicating that there is a discrepancy with regard to their eligible land declared and the farmers in question are being offered a desk review (within the Department) of the decision in the first instance and an independent review if they are not satisfied with that outcome. An independent review panel is being chaired by Padraig Gibbons and will deal with appeals in an efficient and timely manner to avoid any undue delay to the processing of payments. </p><p>  It is important to note that while this review is underway, payments to farmers under the Single Farm Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme are on track and on a par with 2012. A 50% advance payment issued under the Single Farm Payment scheme to farmers in October and 120,000 farmers were paid their SPS balancing payment this week amounting to &euro;560m. To date, almost &euro;1.4 billion has been paid to farmers under the two schemes.</p></reply>

This strategic approach has resulted in the following specific new market openings in 2013:</p><p>  - UAE opened for sheep-meat;</p><p>  - Libya opened for livestock;</p><p>  - Australia opened for pigmeat;</p><p>  - Iran opened for beef;</p><p>  - GCC lifted the ban on imports of  beef and sheep-meat;</p><p>  - Canada opened for Sheepmeat;</p><p>  - China opened for Salmon;</p><p>  - Japan opened for beef.</p><p>  The most recent announcement of the opening of the Japanese market to Irish beef is very significant not only in terms of the potential of up to &euro;15million in exports, but also from a reputational point of view, particularly in the Asian region. </p><p>  My recent trade mission to the Gulf States of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates also yielded productive outcomes particularly for dairy products, food ingredients, agri-services and the equine sector. </p><p>  I also led trade missions to US in 2013, where exports of agri-food to the US have increased from &euro;406million in 2010 to &euro;518million in 2012 and to Switzerland where exports have increased from &euro;29million to &euro;38million in this period.  Following intensive lobbying, the US published its BSE rule which is a first step in moving to opening the US market to exports of Irish beef.  This is now being followed up at official level to ensure that Irish beef can be exported as soon as the market reopens in 2014.</p><p>  All of these efforts should of course be viewed in the context of the continued growth in the performance of our actual exports. Exports of food and drinks rose by 2% in 2012 to over &euro;9 billion.  They are showing a further 6.5% increase in the first nine months of 2013.  Asian markets accounted for over 5% of exports in 2012.  In China alone, we have seen our exports increase from &euro;167 million in 2010 to &euro;323million in 2012, an increase of 93%.  And these increases are continuing into 2013. </p><p>  Russia is also showing dramatic growth as a market as is the continent of Africa where there is strong potential for increased exports.  We now export over &euro;500 million in agri-food to Africa.  Nigeria, South Africa, Senegal, Algeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are our key markets.</p></reply>

These inspections are a necessary requirement to drawn down approximately &euro;1.7 billion of EU funds annually and to avoid EU disallowances, My Department must therefore ensure that these inspections are conducted in full accordance with the legislative provisions. </p><p>  Land eligibility checks must be carried out on at least 5% of applicants. These checks are carried out to verify that the actual area claimed in the application form corresponds to the area farmed by the farmer and to ensure that any ineligible land or features are not included for aid purposes.  My Department has made every effort to respond to concerns about the impact of on-the-ground inspections on farmers and arising from this around 75% of these inspections are initially carried out without the need for a farm visit, as the information needed is acquired using the technique of remote sensing via satellite.  </p><p>  The rate of inspections for cross-compliance is 1% of applicants to whom the Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) and Good Agricultural Condition (GAEC) apply. However, 3% of farmers must be inspected under the bovine identification and registration requirements, while 3% of sheep/goat farmers must be inspected covering 5% of the flock.  In addition, since 2010, my Department undertakes Nitrates inspections under the Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) regulations on behalf of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, on an inter-agency basis. </p><p>  The governing EU regulations require that the selection of cases for inspection is undertaken by means of a risk analysis process.

This Scheme was aimed at making a basic broadband service available to un-served premises in rural areas, not already covered by the National Broadband Scheme. An amount of &euro;13,413,000 of funding from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Devleopment (EAFRD) was allocated to the scheme which came within the remit of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. </p><p>  During the scheme development process existing commercial internet service providers indicated their ability to provide a broadband service to almost all of the qualifying applicants under the scheme. Consequently there has been no need for any disbursement of public money and no related draw-down of EU funding was necessary. The EAFRD funding originally made available for this scheme has since been re-allocated to other qualifying measures under the RDP. </p><p>  In relation to the new RDP for the period 2014-2020, work is currently ongoing in my Department to design the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) for the period from 2014 &ndash; 2020. In designing the new RDP, my Department must take account of the range of requirements set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation and the need to support key policy aims for the agri-food sector in the light of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. In undertaking this work, a number of ex-ante analyses are being undertaken and a public consultation process has also taken place. </p><p>  I expect to make decisions in relation to the measures to be supported under the new RDP by the end of this year, and to submit a draft programme to the Commission in early 2014.</p></reply>

This is incorporated in two elements of the new Direct Payment Regulation, namely the &lsquo;Young Farmers Scheme&rsquo; and the &lsquo;National Reserve&rsquo;.  The essential purpose of the Young Farmers Scheme and the National Reserve is to assist young farmers in the initial stages of establishing a farming enterprise in their own name and to encourage generational renewal.  I expect to make decision on the implementation of Pillar 1 reforms by the end of this year.</p><p>  On the taxation side, I have had on-going contact with the Minister for Finance in order to make progressive amendments to support young farmers and to facilitate land mobility. This is reflected in a number of measures introduced and maintained over the course of recent Budgets, including:</p><p>- Retirement relief on Capital Gains Tax where an individual over 55 years   disposes of some or all of his land once certain criteria are met. A number of changes have been made to this relief in recent budgets;</p><p>- Reductions in stamp duty rates for land transfers in recent budgets;</p><p>- 100% stock relief on income tax for young trained farmers.</p><p>  Finally, the development of a new Rural Development Plan (RDP) for the period 2014-2020 represents an opportunity to further develop a comprehensive set of measures that will seek to address the issues outlined by the Deputy.  Work on the design of the next RDP is well underway. In designing the new RDP, my Department must take account of the range of requirements set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation and the need to support key policy aim for the agri food sector in light of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.

This has required the putting in place of a significant work programme which has considerable time and resource implications. An additional factor is that all aquaculture applications now undergo Environmental Impact pre-screening assessment which requires significant input from my Department&rsquo;s scientific and technical advisors. My Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, is engaged in a comprehensive programme to gather the necessary baseline data appropriate to the conservation objectives of &lsquo;Natura 2000&rsquo; areas.  This data collection programme is substantially complete.  Analysis of the data, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives. </p><p>  It is expected that successful completion of the Appropriate Assessment process will facilitate a significant increase in the number of licence determinations.  In the region of 45 aquaculture licences have issued this year in respect of Castlemaine.  A number of licensing determinations in respect of Roaringwater Bay have been made and others are imminent at this time.</p><p>  The Appropriate Assessment process represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.  My Department continues to make every effort to expedite the determination of all aquaculture applications having regard to the complexities of each case and the need to comply fully with all national and EU legislation. I am also satisfied that the resources available to my Department are sufficient to achieve this outcome.</p></reply>

The review of Coillte, to which the Deputy refers, is one which was undertaken on foot of a commitment in the previous Government&rsquo;s Renewed Programme for Government.  It is not my intention to publish the outcome of that review, as that particular review exercise was superseded by the analysis undertaken on foot of the Government Decisions in 2012 in relation to the sale of state assets which encompassed Coillte.</p><p>  This analysis, undertaken by NewERA, Coillte, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department, in relation to a proposed sale of Coillte harvesting rights was quite extensive and formed the basis for the Government&rsquo;s Decision in June of this year that it was not the appropriate time to proceed with the sale of harvesting rights and that the current focus must be on the restructuring of Coillte, overseen by NewERA and the relevant stakeholder Departments. I would like to stress that this particular analysis not only involved financial calculations associated with the sale process but also the possible impact on the timber industry, public access to recreational land, environmental and social impacts and consequential implications for the company.</p><p>  My plans for the future of Coillte will be informed by the progress on the restructuring of the company.  As I mentioned, a restructuring of Coillte is currently being undertaken on foot of the Government Decision in June and the Government will consider all the options to maximise value from Coillte when the restructuring is complete at the end of next year.   Another factor to inform my plans for the company will be the outcome of the current analysis evaluating how to give effect to a beneficial merger of Coillte with Bord na M&oacute;na to create a streamlined and refocused commercial state company operating in the bio-energy and forestry sectors, as committed to in the Programme for Government.</p><p>  As part of that exercise, NewERA is currently undertaking a financial evaluation on behalf of the relevant Government Departments, namely my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  This financial evaluation is being finalised after which the Departments will consider its findings.  It is intended that a recommendation will be brought to Government on the matter shortly thereafter.</p><p>  I am cognisant of the important role Coillte plays within the forestry sector.  Coillte, as the State forestry company, manages an estate of over 440,000 hectares, the bulk of which is under forestry.  It is currently the main supplier of sawlog to the timber processing sector.  Coillte Management, at its recent meeting with the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, gave a comprehensive overview of its activities, its performance in 2012 and its outlook for this year.</p></reply>

However, there is no evidence of a major welfare problem in the horse sector at present due to the relatively high level of horse slaughterings this year and the very good weather well into the Autumn, which has created a very favourable fodder situation. </p><p>  My Department, in conjunction with the local authorities and the Gardai are adopting a pro-active approach in relation to welfare issues in the horse sector and this has reduced the numbers of abandoned horses throughout the country particularly in urban areas.  The Deputy may be aware that, in recent weeks, 82 horses were seized in the Cork city area.  While a small number of horses had to be euthanized on welfare grounds, the majority that were seized are being re-homed with the assistance of welfare groups and or are being moved to registered equine premises and have received passports and microchips in accordance with regulations.  Furthermore, last week, my Department engaged with the local authority and An Garda Siochana in a similar proactive manner in County Wicklow.</p><p>  My Department devotes considerable resources to issues relating to the welfare of animals including horses.  To date this year, my Department has paid some &euro;2.5m to the Local Authorities under the Control of Horses Act to enable them to deal with stray and unwanted horses.  My Department also provides considerable financial support to animal welfare organisations to assist them in the delivery of animal care and welfare services.  In 2012, this funding came to a total of &euro;1,365,000 to some 140 organisations.  I plan to make an allocation in respect of 2014 shortly.</p><p>  In conclusion, I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to work with local authorities and Gardai in other areas if similar cases occur and intervention is required.

Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, operational issues concerning sea fisheries control are a matter for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service. The prosecution of fisheries infringements are carried out on behalf of the State by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p><p>  In October 2009, the EU adopted a new regulation dealing with fisheries controls in the EU.  Council  Regulation 1224/2009 establishes a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy.  Control and inspection is now focused where it is most effective through an approach based on systematic risk analysis. Inspection procedures are standardised and harmonised for all stages in the market chain, including transport and marketing.    This new control regulation complements the IUU fishing regulation Council Regulation 1005/2008 which establishes a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.  These regulations were introduced so that there is a common EU level playing field and to provide for effective range of controls across EU waters.   It applies to fishing activities in Community waters as well those carried out by Community fishing in the maritime waters under the jurisdiction or sovereignty of third countries and of the high seas. The focus of the control regulation is to create a level playing field which is necessary to give confidence to the industry so that they understand that all community vessels and third country vessels operating in EU waters  are subject to the same level of control, and that there is equality of treatment for all vessels no matter where they operate.   </p><p>  As part of this common approach provided for in the Control regulation,  I will shortly introduce a statutory instrument to provide for a points system which will apply to license holders of fishing vessels when a serious infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy is detected within the Exclusive Fishery Limits of the State.</p><p>  The accumulation of points for persistent serious infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy  will lead to the suspension of a sea fishing boat license for a period from 2 months to one year. In extreme cases persistent serious fisheries infringements could lead to a permanent withdrawal of a license.</p><p>  I am confident that this measure which is confined to serious infringement  combined with the deterrent level of sanctions for such serious offences will help address persistent overfishing by all vessels operating in rich fishing grounds around Ireland.   </p><p>  Finally, as I advised the Seanad recently, I intend to introduce a fixed penalty notice system, modelled on the points system for traffic offences, for minor fishery offences in the near future.</p></reply>

While suckler cow numbers have remained relatively stable since payments were decoupled from production in January 2005, my Department monitors the composition and strength of the national herd on an ongoing basis.  Calf registrations are subject to cyclical fluctuations as a contracting suckler herd causes an upturn in confidence, carcass values and margins encouraging renewed investment and restocking by producers.</p><p>  Challenging production conditions over the last two years undoubtedly impacted on the size of the beef cow herd and this may result in a diminution in overall suckler cow numbers. The data referred to by the Deputy covers the first 9 months of the year but it will not be possible to quantify the full extent of any reduction until the publication of data on the final outturn for the year. The annual replacement rate depends on the number of heifers calving each year and this data too, along with underlying trends, will be considered by my Department after full year data becomes available. </p><p>  As evidence of my commitment to the future of beef production, I can point to a number of targeted structural supports that I have put in place to enable the industry to meet future market requirements and the targets set out in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. In particular, the Beef Genomics Scheme (BGS), which is specifically aimed at suckler farmers, will initiate the process of building a genetic database for the beef sector that will position Ireland as a global leader in beef genetics and ultimately lead to a more efficient and profitable farm sector. </p><p>  With a total fund of &euro;23 million, the BGS will provide participants with a payment of &euro;40 per calf subject to an overall scheme limit. I have already indicated that in order to be eligible for entry into the BGS, a farmer must also join the Beef Data Programme (BDP) and I expect to announce full operational details of the new scheme early in 2014.</p><p>  In addition to the BGS, a further &euro;10 million in funding will be disbursed under the Beef Data Programme (BDP) in 2014. The objectives of the BDP are to improve the genetic quality of the national suckler herd through the collection of essential breeding and production information and to stimulate improvements in the competitiveness and output quality of the Irish beef industry. The Programme, which attracted some 34,000 application in 2013, assists farmers to improve the quality of their livestock by maintaining crucial data flows to ICBF that in turn will generate further advances in cattle breeding at a national level. Farmers in the BDP will qualify for a further &euro;20 per calf up to a maximum of 20 calves. Taken in conjunction with the BGS, suckler farmers will receive a payment of up to &euro;60 per calf in 2014. A payment model based on calves rather than cows sends a strong signal to the sector that supports are aimed at rewarding farmer efficiency and improved technical performance.</p><p>  In addition to the BGS and the BDP, a further allocation of &euro;5 million has been earmarked for the continuation of the Beef Technology Adoption Programme (BTAP) in 2014. Last year, some 5,500 farmers each received an annual payment of &euro;925 in relation to their participation in the first year of the BTAP. In total, these measures, added to residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme, amount to an investment of &euro;40m in this strategically important sector in 2014.</p></reply>

These resulted in the following developments in access to these markets.  Japan announced the opening of its market to Irish beef.  This is a very prestigious market worth some &euro;12 to &euro;15 million annually.  In regard to the United States, my trade visit was focused on Foreign Direct Investment and I had a number of meeting with key companies in this regard.  Following intensive lobbying, the US published its BSE rule which is a first step in moving to opening the US market to exports of Irish beef.  This is now being followed up at official level to ensure that Irish beef can be exported as soon as the market reopens in 2014.</p><p>  My visit to the Gulf States of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates was also very productive with the following specific outcomes:</p><p>- The Irish Dairy Board announcement of a &euro;20m investment in a Saudi Dairy company AL Wazeen which will result in the importation of significant volumes of Irish milk powders to Saudi and the production of approximately 20,000 t of a &lsquo;white cheese&rsquo; specific to the region, using new technology developed by Teagasc;</p><p>- The opening of the Kerry Food and Ingredients development centre in UAE which will cater for the specific consumer demands and tastes in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkish markets;</p><p>- A &euro;5m contract signed by Biotecter for water analysis equipment;</p><p>- A total of &euro;2.3 million was spent in the recent Goffs&rsquo; sales following my trade mission which related to Qatari and UAE purchases of thoroughbred horses;</p><p>- Announcement of a joint race with the Jabel Ali Race course;</p><p>  In addition, during the trade mission, a number of Irish suppliers obtained product listings in an additional leading retailer in UAE and Bord Bia announced the opening of new offices in Dubai to support Irish food companies exporting to the UAE.  I also hosted a week-long incoming visit from the Vietnamese Minister for Agriculture during which we agreed to develop a Memorandum on cooperation that I hope will be signed in the near future and earlier this month the first meeting of the working group on beef market access with China took place in Beijing.</p><p>  Of course my promotion of Irish agri-food exports did not just start in 2013.  Arising from ongoing efforts, the opening of the following markets was secured in 2013:</p><p>- UAE opened for sheep-meat;</p><p>- Libya opened for livestock;</p><p>- Australia opened for pigmeat;</p><p>- Iran opened for beef;</p><p>- GCC ban lifted  for beef and sheep-meat;</p><p>- Canada market opened for Sheep-meat;</p><p>- Japan opened for beef;</p><p>- China opened for Salmon.</p></reply>

For the first time in the Common Agricultural Policy there are provisions set out under Article 30 of the current draft Rural Development Regulation to support the conversion to or the maintenance of Organic Farming practices and methods. The greening provisions of the Direct Payments Regulation also recognise the important contribution made by organic farming.</p><p>  Preparatory work for the next Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014 &ndash; 2020 is well underway and the question of a new organic scheme is being considered in that context. Under the draft Rural Development Regulation, my Department must undertake an ex ante evaluation, a public consultation, a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) a needs assessment, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and an appropriate assessment (AA) in developing our Rural Development Programme. An independent evaluator has been contracted to prepare the ex-ante evaluation report, SEA and AA and to advise on the SWOT analysis. </p><p>  An initial consultation process was launched in 2012, and written submissions were received from over 80 stakeholders.  These submissions have been analysed by my Department and have fed into the development of the SWOT and needs analyses.  A second consultation was held in July, where stakeholders attended a full day workshop on the draft SWOT and needs analyses. Based on the outcome of these processes, the drafting of a new programme is being advanced in my Department, and it is intended that further stakeholder consultation will form part of this.</p></reply>

It was organised by Enterprise Ireland and led by my colleague Minister of State for Trade and Development, Joe Costello.  The visit was part of a wider programme that also encompassed South Africa.  The overall aim of the visit was to develop trade in this important emerging market in Africa.  Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with over 160 million people, approximately half the population of the United States and has a GDP rate of increase of 7% per annum.</p><p>  Irish food and drink exports to Africa were &euro;526 million for 2012, representing an increase of 7.3% on the 2011 figure of &euro;490million.  The main components of the trade are Dairy Ingredients (Skimmed Milk Powder and Whole Milk Powder), Pelagic fish and Beverages. Nigeria is by far the largest market accounting for &euro;170million: dairy exports reached &euro;100million and seafood &euro;68 million and it is becoming a hub for Irish companies wanting to expand their exports into the ECOWAS economic bloc.  Bord Bia participated in the trade visit with a view to supporting Irish companies already present in this market, identifying new business opportunities, assisting Irish industry regarding certain export constraints and endorsing the Kerry Group during their official opening of a new office in Lagos.</p></reply>

A full spend against Vote 27 is anticipated for 2013.  Ireland&rsquo;s ODA programme, which is known as Irish Aid, is primarily delivered, at the local level, in the form of grants to and through a number of trusted partners.  These include UN, EU and other multilateral and international organisations, governments in developing countries, Irish and international non-governmental organisations, public sector bodies and missionaries.  The aid programme is not delivered through any private sector companies based in eland.  Some specialised technical expertise or similar capacities, not available within my Department, are purchased in eland and in Partner Countries from individual experts or experts working as part of private sector companies.  This includes consultancy services such as independent audit, evaluation and project management.  It is anticipated that expenditure on the latter will amount to about &euro;365,000 in 2013.  Following an open and competitive tendering process, the Irish Embassy in Kampala recently directly engaged the services of a project management company to oversee all aspects of the construction of a number of schools in the remote Karamoja region of Uganda.  This project, which has just commenced, will run until 2016 and has a total budget of &euro;11.4 million.</p><p>  All funding managed by Irish Aid is fully untied, meaning that it is given without any stipulation that goods or services must be purchased by the recipient country or organisation from eland or from a limited selection of sources.  As would be expected, the Department&rsquo;s Development Cooperation Division and the Missions in our Partner Countries make a large number of payments annually in connection with the rental and maintenance of premises and the purchase of goods and services.  It would be inordinately time-consuming to compile information on the number of private sector companies that received payments from Vote 27 in 2013.  A detailed statistical analysis of programme expenditure each year is contained in annual reports published on the Irish Aid website: <i>www.irishaid.ie.</i></p></reply>

The Commissioners have confirmed that in the majority of cases deductions from Department of Social Protection payments have already commenced and over &euro;1.2m has been collected by Revenue to date.  I am also advised that in approximately 1,400 cases the instruction to deduct at source from Department of Social Protection payments, which is an automated process, was not successful for a variety of reasons, including because the wrong scheme was selected by the property owner.</p><p>  It is estimated that a small subset of these cases would be where the deduction of LPT from the relevant payment could not be finalised as it would have reduced the property owner&rsquo;s personal rate payment to below &euro;186 per week.  This amount is equivalent to the weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance and section 92 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) precludes the Department of Social Protection from reducing a property owner&rsquo;s personal rate payment to below this amount.  I am further advised that, where this has arisen, Revenue has already been in contact with a number of these individuals to agree alternative payment arrangements and is in the process of contacting the remainder.</p><p>  As to whether property owners were advised about the possible impact of the &euro;186 threshold on their LPT deductions, I am advised that the LPT information guide, which was sent to all property owners in March/April 2013, outlined the various payment options available and specifically advised property owners that deduction of LPT from their Department of Social Protection payment cannot reduce their personal rate payment to less than &euro;186 per week.  Furthermore, the Frequently Asked Questions section on the Revenue website outlined the possible implications of choosing this payment option and advised owners that they should satisfy themselves that the weekly deductions of LPT from their Department of Social Protection payment would meet their 2013 LPT liability by the end of 2013.  Where the scheme chosen would not allow the LPT to be paid in full by the end of the year, owners were advised to choose a different payment method, or alternatively, to consider deferring the charge, where they established that they met the qualifying conditions for deferral.  I understand that this issue was also dealt with by Revenue spokespeople who took part in a large number of national and local radio interviews between March and May this year.</p><p>  I am advised by the Commissioners that where a property owner discovers that deduction of LPT from their Department of Social Protection scheme is not possible on account of the &euro;186 threshold, they should contact the LPT Branch helpline on 1890 200 255 to make alternative arrangements for paying the 2013 tax, or to confirm if they are eligible to defer the charge.  In this respect, the Commissioners advise that where an owner-occupier&rsquo;s only source of income is their Department of Social Protection payment, they would be eligible to defer payment of the tax.  Full details on deferring payment of LPT are available on the Revenue website.</p></reply>

The penalty in the case of a summary conviction for the smuggling or illegal sale of unstamped tobacco products is now a fine of &euro;5,000, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both a fine and a term of imprisonment.  In the case of a conviction on indictment, the fine was increased ten-fold in 2010 and the Court may now impose a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970, or a term of imprisonment of up to five years, or both a fine and imprisonment.  Where the value of the excisable goods concerned in an indictable smuggling offence exceed &euro;250,000, including the tax payable, the Court may impose a fine three times the value of the goods. In the case of a conviction on indictment for an offence concerning a container load of cigarettes, the Courts would therefore have the option of imposing a fine up to three times the tax paid value of the cigarettes.  The current penalties for excise offences are very significant, but I will continue to keep them under review.</p></reply>

During the building of the Property Register some matching difficulties were encountered when consolidating the various Government and non-Government data sources used, and in a small number of cases the linkage of properties to their relevant owners was not correct.</p><p>  As part of its comprehensive LPT communications strategy, Revenue clearly stated that errors in the compilation of the Property Register were inevitable given the scale of the task and requested that anybody who received incorrect information in regard to their properties make contact via the LPT Helpline as soon as possible.

The BRRD proposal provides a common framework of rules and powers to help EU countries manage arrangements to deal with failing banks at national level as well as cross-border banks, whilst preserving essential bank operations and minimising taxpayers' exposure to losses. </p><p>  There are three pillars to the BRRD framework to facilitate a range of appropriate actions by authorities:</p><p><b><i>-</i></b> Preparatory and preventative measures including reinforced supervision and robust recovery and resolution planning for major institutions;</p><p>- Early intervention which would include supervisory powers, implementing recovery plans and appointing a special manager; and</p><p>- Resolution tools including sale of business, bridge bank and asset separation tools and also the use of bail-in mechanisms.</p><p>  The BRRD will apply to all 28 Member States and will ensure that losses incurred by a credit institution are allocated to its shareholders and creditors in accordance with a pre-defined hierarchy of claims. This is an important means of ensuring that a bank&rsquo;s losses are absorbed by those who fund its activities and not taxpayers. </p><p>  The proposed directive also includes a proposal for a resolution fund. This fund can be used for operational purposes, such as the provision of capital to a bridge bank and in some cases it can be used to provide solvency support to an institution in resolution. The resolution fund would be funded by the wider banking industry and in a banking union context this will be set up at a European level, thereby increasing the amount of funding available.</p><p>  In relation to the events in Cyprus earlier this year, I have said before that it was an exceptional case which took place in the absence of a clearly defined resolution regime. The BRRD now addresses this and provides for a common framework for resolution for all EU Member States. This therefore should reduce ad-hoc solutions to bank crises going forward.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-12a.114.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121200048#WRD01100"><p>The position is as I stated in my Budget day speech, that from 16 October 2013, tax relief for medical insurance premiums has been restricted to the first &euro;1,000 per adult and the first &euro;500 per child insured.  Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings will no longer qualify for tax relief.  The current system of income tax relief for medical insurance premiums is provided at source at the standard rate of income tax. Therefore, the State was paying 20% of the cost of all medical insurance premiums.  </p><p>  The cost of Income Tax relief in respect of medical insurance has increased significantly in recent years, estimated at &euro;404 million in 2011, &euro;448 million in 2012 and &euro;500 million in 2013. Despite the increasing cost of the relief, the numbers insured are estimated to have reduced by approximately 170,000 over the same period, while at the same time the level of medical cover has decreased on some policies. Against this background the increase in costs is unsustainable. If the relief were to remain unchanged and the trend was to continue, the cost would increase to approximately &euro;1 billion by 2020.</p><p>  Currently, the tax system is supporting those who can afford private medical insurance to the level of half a billion euros per annum. Effectively that means that those taxpayers who could never afford private health insurance, or who have had to give up their policies due to personal circumstances, are providing financial support via the tax system to those individuals who can afford such insurance. </p><p>  It should be noted that the Commission on Taxation in its 2009 report recommended the retention of medical insurance relief but that it should be limited. The introduction of an upper ceiling on the amount of medical insurance premiums that will qualify for tax relief achieves this recommendation.  </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that based on 2012 data, the most up to date data available, it is estimated that up to 577,000 policy holders, which provide cover for 1.1 million individuals, may be affected by this measure.  The Revenue estimate is based on an analysis carried out on the annual returns and the gross premium prices (i.e. before tax relief at source is applied) submitted by the Health Insurers in respect of the 2012 tax year. However, it should be noted that many will only be affected marginally, depending on the cost of the policies that individuals purchase.</p><p>  The new ceilings will ensure continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase medical insurance policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.  In addition, individuals can of course opt for less expensive policies and therefore avoid the impact of this measure entirely. </p><p>  I have no plans to reverse my decision to restrict tax relief in respect of medical insurance premiums. </p></reply>

The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  The CCMA sets out the framework that lenders must use when dealing with borrowers in mortgage arrears or in pre-arrears.  This framework is known as the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) which sets out the steps which lenders must follow:</p><p>Step 1: Communicate with borrower;</p><p>Step 2: Gather financial information;</p><p>Step 3: Assess the borrowers circumstances; and </p><p>Step 4: Propose a resolution. </p><p>  In order to determine which options for alternative repayment arrangements are viable for each particular case, a lender must explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements offered by that lender having assessed the borrower&rsquo;s financial circumstances (through a Standard Financial Statement).  Such alternative repayment arrangements may include:</p><p>- an interest-only arrangement for a period of time</p><p>- extending the term of the mortgage</p><p>- adding the arrears and interest to the mortgage, so that they are collected over the remaining term</p><p>- splitting the mortgage into an affordable loan and a remaining balance which is set aside to a later date </p><p>  While lenders must consider such arrangements, they are not obliged to offer such an arrangement.  If a borrower is offered an alternative repayment arrangement, the lender must give the borrower a clear explanation of the proposed arrangement and how it works, including the reason why the lender considers it to be appropriate for the borrower.  The lender must also provide the borrower with the advantages of the offer and explain any disadvantages. </p><p>  If the lender is not offering the borrower any alternative repayment arrangement, they must give the reasons why in writing.  The lender must also inform the borrower that a copy of the most recent Standard Financial Statement (SFS) is available on request, and provide the borrower with details, in writing of:</p><p>- other options available</p><p>- borrowers right to make an appeal to the lender's internal Appeals Board</p><p>- the website of the Insolvency Service of Ireland </p><p>  The same information must be given to the borrower if he/she does not accept the alternative repayment arrangement offered to by the lender.</p><p>  If a borrower is not happy with the way that their lender is dealing with them or if they think they are not complying with the CCMA, the borrower can make a complaint to their lender. </p><p>  Borrowers can also make an appeal to the lender&rsquo;s Appeals Board if they are not happy with the alternative repayment arrangement offered or if they believe they have been wrongly classified as not co-operating. </p><p>  Ultimately, if the borrower is not satisfied with the outcome of the appeal/complaint made to the lender they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO).  Further information on how to make a complaint to the FSO is available at <i><font color="#0000FF">www.financialombudsman.ie</font></i>.</p><p>  In addition, the Government has also provided an enhanced range of information and guidance services for mortgage holders including a dedicated information website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.keepingyourhome.ie</font></i>, a mortgage arrears information and advice helpline (phone number: 0761 07 4050), and a dedicated &quot;one to one&quot; independent financial advice service from accountants for a borrower who has been provided a long term mortgage restructure offer by their lender.</p></reply>

However, as Minister for Finance, I do not set commercial policy for individual banks, nor does the Central Bank.  In a supervisory capacity, the Central Bank oversees and reviews bank practices and regulatory adherence. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that this Government has undertaken a number of significant reforms in order to strengthen the regulatory framework for the financial services sector and to respond to shortcomings identified during the financial crisis.</p><p>  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 was passed this year which enhances the Central Bank&rsquo;s regulatory powers, drawing on the lessons of the recent past.  It strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.  The Act also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and underpins the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice.  </p><p>  This Government has also implemented a series of measures which reflect the important role that the banking sector has to play in supplying credit and in doing so to support economic growth in the economy.  As shareholders in the main banks, the Government's objective is to ensure that they are managed commercially so as to create and protect value for the taxpayer but also to ensure that they supply the credit lines necessary to sustain and grow the economy.  </p><p>  I am satisfied that the Central Bank is monitoring lending decisions of the banks.  Among the applicants for mortgage credit, I understand that investors, who are already active and welcome in the market, do not necessarily compete for the same property types as borrowers of residential mortgages.  As I have said recently, in the context of rising rents particularly in urban areas, new mortgage products targeted at the buy to let sector may assist in stabilising the situation and alleviating problems in the rental market.  Many of the generous tax incentives that promoted activity in this area contributing to the previous difficulties are no longer available.  It should also be noted that some of the investors are coming to the market as cash buyers and credit from the financial institutions is not an issue for these parties.</p><p>  The Deputy can be assured that this is an area which the Department and the Central Bank will continue to monitor closely.</p></reply>

In February 2013 the arrangements that replaced the promissory note resulted in significant benefits to the State including spreading the cost of the Promissory Notes from a weighted average life of c.7-8 years to c.34-35 years at a lower funding cost for the State, resulting in significant annual interest savings.   </p><p>  The State has now recouped a net positive cash return of circa &euro;1.1 billion from its overall investment and support to Bank of Ireland.  Therefore there is no question of the State seeking to recoup the monies invested in that institution via retrospective recapitalisation or other means.</p><p>  AIB is forecasting that it will deliver a profit in 2014 which would likely increase investor interest in the bank.  </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, on the 20th June 2013 the Eurogroup of Euro-area Finance Ministers agreed to consider retrospective recapitalisation of banks on a case-by-case basis once the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) direct recapitalisation instrument enters into force.  This also provides a potential mechanism for Ireland to recoup some of the funds it placed in the banks following the onset of the banking crisis.  I do not want to tie the future of the banks or the banking system solely to the ESM as the outcome in relation to Bank of Ireland has demonstrated that further more attractive options may become available to the State.  However, it is important that the option of access to the ESM is in place.</p></reply>

This is not the case.    </p><p>  As indicated in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 37 of 4 December 2013, it had come to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners that pension advisors and administrators had been interpreting the current SFT provisions in a manner that allowed the capital value of defined benefit pension arrangements with discretionary lump sum commutation rights to be calculated incorrectly at the point of retirement and not in accordance with the intention of the legislation. In light of that, one of the amendments to the SFT regime made in the Finance Bill is solely for the purposes of putting beyond doubt how the capital value of pension rights under such arrangements is to be determined. </p><p>  This issue has to be looked at within the broad framework of the SFT regime as a whole. In that regard, the approach to calculating the capital value of defined benefit pension rights is best understood in the context of the Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) concept. The PFT concept allows individuals with pension rights valued in excess of the new lower SFT limit of &euro;2m on 1 January 2014 to protect or &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; those rights against any risk of chargeable excess tax when the pension is eventually drawn down. </p><p>  The method of calculation of the PFT requires the capital value of defined benefit pension rights, where there is a discretionary lump sum commutation option (as in most private sector schemes), to be based on the annual amount of pension which the scheme would pay on 1 January 2014 (calculated in accordance with the requirements of the legislation) and before any commutation. This works to the advantage of the individual concerned as it maximises the amount of pension rights that are protected. </p><p>  This is best illustrated by way of a simple example. Say on 1 January 2014 a private sector defined benefit scheme, with optional commutation rights, would pay a gross pension before commutation of &euro;110,000 per annum. The capital value of those pension rights for PFT purposes is then &euro;2.2m (i.e. &euro;110k x 20).  However, if the capital value of the rights were required to be calculated on the assumption that, on 1 January 2014, the individual fully exercised his rights to commute the pension up to the maximum allowable lump sum (using the same commutation factor of 9:1 as used in the example in the details supplied) the capital value for PFT purposes would then be &euro;1.898m (i.e. a pension of &euro;82,500 x 20 + a lump sum of &euro;248,000). So the individual would not qualify for a PFT in the first place and the capital value limit of his or her pension rights at the point of retirement would then be the SFT limit of &euro;2m. </p><p>  Having calculated the PFT on the basis of the gross annual pension payable, it would be inconsistent, and would undermine the whole purpose of the SFT regime, to then afford the same individual the capacity to minimise the capital value of those rights at the point of retirement by permitting the calculation to be based on the capital value of the post-commutation pension added to the cash value of the lump sum. This inconsistency, if left unaddressed, would become even more pronounced now that the SFT regime is moving from a fixed conversion factor of 20:1 to a range of age&ndash;related factors which range as high as 37:1 where retirement takes place at age 50. Conceivably, &euro;1 of pension accrued before 1 January 2014 which should have a capital value of &euro;20 for chargeable excess purposes would be valued at just &euro;9, based on a 9:1 conversion factor, and equally &euro;1 of pension accrued after 1 January 2014 which should have a capital value of &euro;37 for chargeable excess purposes, would also be valued at just &euro;9 based on the same conversion factor. </p><p>  The fact is that the SFT regime includes different methods of calculating both a PFT and the corresponding capital value of pension rights at the point of retirement for different types of pension arrangements and different types of pension benefits. But it equally seeks to ensure that it compares like with like and that similar pension arrangements with similar pension benefits are valued in a consistent manner. To repeat what I stated in my answer to the earlier Parliamentary Question, the same approach to the calculation of the capital value of defined benefit pension entitlements with optional commutation rights at the point of retirement applies whether or not an individual has a PFT, as it would be incongruous and indeed would give rise to more concrete claims of discrimination and special treatment, if the method of calculation for schemes of a similar kind was to vary depending on whether an individual had a PFT or not.</p><p>  As regards, the particular hypothetical example which the Deputy included in the details supplied with Parliamentary Question No. 58, I would make the following observations. Firstly, the question itself implies that the scenario outlined in the example will arise as soon as the revised SFT regime comes into play from 1 January, but it is clear from the example that this cannot be the situation. The example is predicated on an age&ndash;related factor of 30 (applicable at age 60) applying to the whole of the annual pension benefits accrued at the point of retirement. By implication, this means that the individuals concerned would commence accruing benefits under their respective public and private sector schemes after 1 January 2014, as any rights accrued up to that date are automatically &ldquo;grandfathered&rdquo; using a factor of 20. </p><p>  The example implies that a highly paid individual in the private sector who is a member of a defined benefit pension arrangement with optional lump sum commutation rights and, presumably, with knowledge of the SFT regime and how it could affect him or her would, nonetheless, continue to accrue pension benefits over their career in the fashion implied, regardless, and take no remedial action. Clearly this would not happen. Any individual in this situation would act rationally and stop accruing pension benefits and negotiate alternative immediate taxable compensation with their employer instead.</p><p>  All the indications are that the pension funds of highly paid private sector individuals are being actively managed in this way with a view to avoiding a chargeable excess and the penal tax charges that go with it. This, of course, is how the SFT regime is intended to operate so as to restrict the capacity of higher earners to fund or accrue large pensions through tax-subsidised sources. By imposing penal tax charges on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down, it discourages the building up of large pension funds in the first place. Unlike highly paid private sector individuals who have the capacity to act to manage their pension funds with a view to avoiding a chargeable excess, the position for equivalent highly paid public servants is that the penal tax charge cannot be prevented as they have no means of ceasing to accrue benefits under their schemes in order to prevent a breach of the SFT or PFT, as appropriate.</p></reply>

This agenda includes the establishment of a national support service for the early years sector.  At the moment, the supports in place for the early years sector include D/CYA funded organisations (whether wholly or partly) such as the Voluntary Childcare Organisations and the City and County Childcare Committee structures.  My Department has had the experience of working across multiple organisations (funded through the D/CYA) to implement a quality improvement programme in early years service.  We will be publishing the final report on this before the end of the year.  The report will identify the issues that need to be addressed if a national support service is to be successful.</p><p>  Through the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, my Department will also start the process of developing a practice guide which will distil the core elements of S&iacute;olta and Aistear for use, not just by early years practitioners but also, by tutors delivering further/higher education programmes.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  </p><p>  The staffing arrangements for the 2013/14 school year (Circular 0013/2013) were published in February.  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. It currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools.</p><p>  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, there is a phased increase in the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools with four teachers or less. The first phase of the budget measure took effect from September 2012. The final phase of the budget measure takes effect from September 2014.</p><p>  An appeals process is available to small schools which have had their staff number reduced as a result of the budget measure.  A school with four classroom teachers or less which is losing a teacher or failed to gain an additional teacher as a result of the Budget 2012 measure can submit an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.</p><p>  The school referred to by the Deputy submitted an appeal under the Small Schools criteria to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board which was considered at the March meeting of the Appeals Board.  The appeal was refused as it did not meet the criteria set out in the staffing schedule.  The Primary Staffing Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p><p>  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities. They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape. In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.</p></reply>

The application was approved and Cork County Council subsequently availed of funding in the amount of &euro;32,871. The implementation of these works is a matter for Cork County Council, but it is the understanding of the OPW that the works have been completed.</p><p>  The OPW and Cork County Council also agreed in 2012 that a detailed study should be undertaken with the aim of devising a comprehensive solution to the flooding problem in Glanmire. It was decided that the Council would take the lead in commissioning this study, with funding being provided by the OPW. The Council has now appointed consultants to undertake the study and to develop outline flood mitigation proposals, with a view to bringing forward a viable scheme, if such emerges, through planning, detailed design and construction.</p><p>  It is expected that the study will be completed about mid-2014 which would allow a preferred scheme, subject to one emerging, to be brought forward for public consultation in late 2014. If any emerging preferred scheme is well received at public consultation stage then the detailed design could commence in the first half of 2015, with construction commencing before the end of that year, subject to the continued availability of the necessary funding. It is not possible to give a more definitive timescale at this point.</p></reply>

In 2013, there were 2 IDA Ireland sponsored site visits by potential investors to the park.</p><p>  The Agency has assured me that it will continue to promote and market the Park in Naas to overseas clients wishing to invest in Co. Kildare.  </p><p>  As Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services. In order to achieve economic regional development, IDA prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass (i.e. sufficient scale of population, skills, infrastructure, companies, business services etc.) and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  With improvements in infrastructure and investment in one town in a region it has a positive effect on other towns in the region.</p><p>  The East Region, which includes Kildare, has been particularly successful in recent years in terms of attracting inward investment from FDI companies and employing 67,860 people.  At present, there are 26 IDA supported companies in Co. Kildare employing 10,167 people.  IDA Ireland has strong relationships with these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites. </p><p>  We must also remember that it is the investor in all cases who decides where to invest and an investment win for Ireland regardless of the location has to be seen as a plus for the country as a whole.</p></reply>

There has never been a statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to contribute to their pension scheme (although schemes rules can place some level of obligation).</p><p>  Most defined benefit pension schemes in Ireland were established under a trust deed.  As part of the process of establishing each occupational pension scheme, an employer undertakes to be bound by the rules of the scheme and to undertake certain liabilities and duties defined therein.  The position around the employers and employees contribution obligation in a trust deed varies from deed to deed.</p><p>  Employers have, by and large, made great efforts to support and deliver on the promise made to scheme members.  This process is generally managed through dialogue between trustees, employers and members, where efforts are made to reach agreement regarding the steps that must be taken to secure scheme viability which may include a mix of measures such as increased employer/member contributions, longer working and amended benefits.</p><p>  In developing the measures contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill (No.2) 2013, significant consideration was given to imposing a statutory obligation on employers to secure a minimum level of funding before a scheme could be wound up.  The advantage of placing a minimum obligation on the employer would be to reduce further the possible risk to the State and to protect the benefits of current and former schemes members.  It may also prevent employers from &ldquo;walking away&rdquo; from defined benefit schemes and would encourage employers to ensure that the scheme is well funded and managed.</p><p>  However, there are strong arguments against the introduction of an employer obligation given the uncertainties as to the overall impact and potential for unintended consequences.  The introduction of employer guarantee is not a simple matter and may result increasing State involvement in sponsoring employers&rsquo; business decisions.  Whilst it may improve the security of scheme members in certain circumstances, in other situations it may not.  For example, in certain cases of liquidation, there may be few or no assets available once the claims of preferred and secured creditors have been met.</p><p>  Imposing an obligation on an employer may be seen as unfair on employers who have voluntarily set up DB pension schemes.  The previously voluntary commitments under these schemes would be made mandatory whereas there would be no corresponding obligation on employers who had set up DC schemes or had not set up any pension scheme.</p><p>  To avoid debt, there is a danger that some employers with underfunded schemes may wind up the scheme in advance of completion of legislative process which, by its nature, would be complex and take some time to put in place.  Experience in other countries has shown that complex &lsquo;anti avoidance&rsquo; structures, with the requisite resources and expertise, were required to prevent employers restructuring to avoid their obligations.</p><p>  Given the current economic circumstances, the imposition of significant additional costs on employers may have a counter-productive impact regarding the very viability of the business and jobs of those employed given many employers lack of capacity to absorb this extra cost.  As such an obligation on an employer may threaten the companies financial stability and in some circumstances render employers insolvent.  This may then impact on the companies creditors.</p><p>  Internationally, &ldquo;debt on employer&rdquo; structures are seen as a complex measure to provide for and administer.  Given the very small proportion of DB schemes here linked to employers who have a credit rating, or another reliably accurate and consistent measure of solvency, it is not the case that a workable framework to selectively apply an obligation on the employer is easily achievable.  Rather, than placing an obligation on the employer to protect member benefits, the approach in the Bill is to support schemes to gradually move to more appropriate funding levels through the short, to medium to longer term using regulation and the benefits of a strengthening economy.  This involves the Funding Standard and improved regulation with provisions such as restructuring of scheme benefits, the introduction of a risk reserve and  the availability of sovereign annuities.  The overriding priority in this area is to ensure that pensioners and members of pension schemes are protected and the future viability and sustainability of their schemes is ensured and made safer.</p></reply>

The trustees of such pension schemes have a fiduciary duty under trust law and the Pensions Act to act in the best interest of all scheme members.  In addition, the Pensions Act provides for further safeguards to protect the interest of pensioners.  In the event of the wind up of a pension scheme the provision in the Pensions Act gives priority to the benefits of pensioners before any assets of the scheme are distributed to meet the liabilities of other scheme members.</p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill is amending this provision to provide for a more equitable distribution of scheme funds in the event of the wind up of a scheme.  This change will only impact where the scheme is underfunded.  However, pensions up to &euro;12,000 per annum will continue to retain the same level of protection as heretofore.  For higher pensions, 90% of the annual amount between &euro;12,000 and &euro;60,000, and 80% of the annual amount over &euro;60,000, will also have priority over the distribution of assets to other scheme beneficiaries.</p><p>  The Bill also amends the Pensions Act to extend the options available to trustees of a scheme by providing for reductions of a portion of the benefits payable to pensioners.  The restructure of scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act is not an arbitrary matter and must comply with the requirements of the Pensions Act and the criteria set out in statutory guidance.</p><p>  Before the trustees make an application to the Board, they must consult with the employer, the scheme member, with pensioners and with the authorised trade union representing members.  Trustees must undertake a comprehensive review of the scheme with a view to the long term stability and sustainability of the scheme.</p><p>  In advance of any application to the Pensions Board to restructure scheme benefits, the trustees must notify, in writing, all members of the scheme including pensioners of; The circumstances giving rise to the proposed application and the reasons why the trustees believe an application is in compliance with their fiduciary duties; the proposed benefit reductions which are to apply to each category of member or other person and the reasons for treating one or more categories of member or other person differently to others; that the trustees have requested additional contributions from the employers to avoid the necessity for a reduction in benefits and the response of the employers; provide general examples of the projected impact of the reduction(s) on members using such assumptions as the actuary deems appropriate.</p><p>  Members have 30 days to respond to the notification and their interests will be considered.  In the context of the current Bill, stakeholder groups including pensioner representatives were consulted last year and asked to make submission in relation to the proposed changes to the Pensions Act.  The input from the stakeholders was taken into account in developing the proposals in the Bill.  It would be my intention that this practice of consultation with pensioner representatives and indeed with all stakeholder representatives would continue in relation to any further consideration of changes to the Pension Act.  As I said at the outset, the trustees of a defined benefit pension scheme are required under trust law to act in the best interest of all scheme members.  The changes I am proposing in this Bill will enhance the ability of the trustees to protect the overall best interest of all scheme members.</p></reply>

A key priority is to ensure that social welfare payments are paid to those who are entitled to them and that fraudulent activity is vigorously prevented and combatted.</p><p>  Over the past number of years, fraud detection and control systems have been refined and enhanced and are subject to on-going review.  A range of measures are employed by the Department to ensure that social welfare fraud and abuse is minimised and that its control activity is appropriately focused.  The approach taken by the Department to combat fraud is frequently reviewed and is regularly adjusted to ensure it is proportionate and is targeted on the areas of greatest risk.  Actual money recovered arises where the Department raises overpayments in individual cases.  Overpayments raised by the Department are categorised as &lsquo;fraud&rsquo;, &lsquo;non-fraud&rsquo; or &lsquo;estate&rsquo; cases.  Fraud cases arise mainly on foot of false declarations by customers concerning their employment, income and family status.  Non-fraud cases are primarily due to customer or third party error, with some due to Departmental error.  Estate cases arise where undisclosed means by customers come to light after their deaths.</p><p>  In 2012, a total of &euro;97m was raised in overpayments and of this amount, &euro;40.9m was recorded as attributable to fraud or suspected fraud.  In 2012, a total of &euro;53.3m was recovered.  In addition, the Department&rsquo;s control work is measured in terms of control savings which are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities.  Without this control work, social welfare expenditure would over time increase by this amount.  Control savings do not include any cases of departmental or clerical error or any cases where the customer voluntarily told the Department of their altered means or circumstances, which resulted in a change to their rate of payment.  My Department recorded control savings of &euro;669m in 2012.  In excess of &euro;525m was recorded in respect of control savings from January to end of October 2013.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 80,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013. </p><p>  Revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme came into effect from Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014.  The new rent limits have been determined following an extensive review of the private rental market.  The rent limits review was completed during the second quarter of this year and used a number of data sources, including that of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) which contained details of actual registered rental tenancies.  As outlined by the Deputy, the Daft.ie Q3 2013 rental report records a year on year increase of 4.4% in rents in County Wicklow.  There is no detailed breakdown of this figure by area within the county or by property type. </p><p>  There have been increases in the maximum rent limits in some areas including Bray, Delgany and Greystones while there have been some reductions across a number of counties, including parts of County Wicklow, reflecting the conditions in the rental markets in those areas. </p><p>  There are currently over 2,400 rent supplement recipients in County Wicklow.  Latest figures show that there are over 580 rent supplement recipients in the Arklow area, indicating that it is possible to secure accommodation in this location within the rent limits.  A search conducted on a leading property website shows that there are properties available for rent in the Arklow area within the maximum rent limits.  Officials in the Department continue to examine the impact of the rent limits on those who claim rent supplement.  </p><p>  Department officials operating the rent supplement scheme have discretionary powers to award a supplement at a higher level in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant.  Each case is examined individually and is decided on the basis of the situation presented.  In relation to the case referred to by the Deputy, the officer administering the rent supplement claim has advised that the person concerned has been requested to provide documentation in support of the request for a rent supplement above the relevant rent limit. The claim will be reviewed by the Department on receipt of this documentation. </p></reply>

The then Government agreed to cover the full capital costs of the project, which were estimated at that time to be of the order of &euro;35m.  It was always the intention that the Ulster Canal project would be funded from the Waterways Ireland annual allocations, as agreed through the annual estimates processes in this jurisdiction, as well as the deliberations of NSMC in relation to annual budgets.  It was a key consideration throughout the process that the Ulster Canal project would be supported by a significant level of projected income from the commercialisation of certain Waterways Ireland assets.  However, the economic downturn has had a negative impact on those plans.</p><p>  I am continuing to explore all possible options to advance this project within the current fiscal constraints.  In this regard, I established an Inter-Agency Group on the Ulster Canal to explore ways to advance the project and to examine possible funding options for it, including existing funding streams and the leveraging of funding from other sources.  This includes the exploration of any EU funding which may be potentially available.  The Ulster Canal project is progressing on an incremental basis.  Planning approvals have now been received for the project in both jurisdictions. Work on land maps is continuing, as is consideration of construction and other technical aspects of the project.  I welcome these developments, which, I am sure the Deputy will agree, are a significant milestone for the project.</p></reply>

My Department has contracted a raptor specialist to undertake site and wider countryside risk assessments, informed by the identification of the current pressures and threats operating on the hen harrier population in Ireland.  The specialist will also compile and analyse hen harrier related population and habitat data to help assist in our understanding of the ecological processes relating to the hen harrier.  This work has been under way since the summer of this year.  As the Deputy will appreciate, this kind of scientific analysis will take some time before it produces enough meaningful data for use to assist in the advancement of the process, such as allowing for the development of appropriate objectives for the Threat Response Plan.</p><p>  Officials from my Department have already met with officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to discuss the process.  The next step will be to formally establish an Inter-Departmental Working Group.  My officials will be in communication with other appropriate Departments to this end shortly.  Initially, the Working Group will comprise officials from those Departments, but it may be extended to include other relevant public bodies.</p><p>  According to the National Hen Harrier Survey carried out during 2010 and published in 2012, hen harrier numbers in the Stack&rsquo;s to Mullaghareirk SPA have declined by more than 35% since the last national survey in 2005.  This is contrary to the reported situation with the national population, where the total number of breeding birds recorded was broadly stable since the last national survey.  However, it should be noted that the accuracy of these reported estimates of change are somewhat complicated due to increased survey effort during 2010 compared to the 2005 survey.  The causes of the severe regional declines remain largely unknown, but potentially contributing factors are outlined in the survey report, including a deterioration of habitat availability and quality.</p><p>  A research project concerning hen harrier in its upland breeding areas, known as PLANFORBIO, was completed in 2012.  The full details of the findings of both studies can be accessed through the following links:</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Kildare, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at . The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS). Broadband services under the NBS are available since October 2010 from the NBS service provider, &ldquo;3&rdquo;, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in the designated NBS Electoral Divisions. NBS services are available within 11 of the 90 Electoral Divisions in County Kildare.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in County Kildare. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

The Act provided real security of tenure for tenants in the private rented sector for the first time and, <i>inter alia</i>, provided access for both tenants and landlords to an inexpensive, informal and independent dispute resolution process operated by the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).</p><p>  Nine years on from the passing of the Act, however, it is clear that there are aspects of the legislation that require amendment in order to improve the functioning of the rental sector. The Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012 was published on 19 July 2012. The Bill builds on what has already been achieved by the 2004 Act, and by the PRTB, and is a key element in the delivery of the Government&rsquo;s housing policy.</p><p>  Among the main issues addressed by the amending legislation are the extension of the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act to Approved Housing Body tenancies; the Board of the PRTB to be reduced from 15 to 12 members; the separation of the governance and quasi-judicial functions of the Board; the merger of the PRTB and the Rent Tribunal; the simplification and streamlining of the mediation process and the introduction of a new procedure to enable the PRTB to deal effectively with tenants who do not pay rent during the dispute process.</p><p>  While the Bill addresses a wide range of issues, there are some other aspects still under development which I hope to bring forward for consideration during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the Seanad. In particular, I am keen to progress the commitment in the <i>Programme for Government</i> to introduce a tenancy deposit protection scheme and I intend to provide for the establishment of such a scheme at Committee Stage of the Bill in the Seanad. The Bill is currently before the Seanad.</p></reply>

The most recent data available, from the 2011 Census, indicate that 728 properties described as bedsits were rented from a local authority representing 0.6% of the total number of local authority rented units then recorded.</p><p>  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Responsibility for enforcement of the regulations, including the inspection arrangements, rests with the relevant local authority supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).

I believe that the parties identified in the report of the independent Pyrite Panel as having a direct or indirect responsibility for the pyrite problem should contribute to the resolution of the problem. It was against this background that I engaged in protracted discussions with the key stakeholders to try and put in place a framework within which those parties could bring about a resolution of the problem through an industry-led response which would include appropriate funding arrangements; regrettably, this did not prove possible. In the absence of such agreement the Government approved, in April 2013, the funding of a pyrite remediation scheme through the imposition of mandatory levies on the construction and insurance sectors . Unfortunately, due to legal difficulties it was not possible to proceed on the basis of those proposals   and the Government has recently approved Exchequer funding for the scheme. The Bill to provide for the establishment of the Pyrite Resolution Board on a statutory basis and for the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme will be published in the next few days and I intend to bring it to the Oireachtas next week. </p><p>  The auditing of the Building Condition Assessment process is an operational matter and as such it is a matter for the Pyrite Resolution Board to determine the appropriate process that should be put in place for this purpose. </p></reply>

There is limited potential to abstract additional water from existing sources in the region and it is necessary to consider new options for potential long-term sources   to service growth in demand in the Greater Dublin Area. Studies conducted on behalf of Dublin City Council concluded that there were two feasible options to meet the future demand requirements of the region &ndash; abstraction from the Shannon or desalination.</p><p>  Further work by consultants working on behalf of the City Council, and a Strategic Environmental Assessment of the proposal, have identified a preferred option which involves abstraction of raw water from the River Shannon at Lough Derg and pumping the abstracted water through a new pipeline to a proposed storage reservoir in County Offaly. This plan was adopted by the City Council and during 2012 was put on display for public information in a number of local authority locations, together with a Strategic Environmental Assessment.   </p><p>  Since then Dublin City Council has held a competition to procure Consultants to advance the project through the planning process. Following the conclusion of a tender process Consultants were awarded the contract in September 2013. The Consultants will prepare an Environmental Impact Assessment, and deal with other statutory procedures, prior to submission of these to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for determination in due course. As with all of these statutory procedures, public consultation will be an integral part of the process. All interested parties can fully participate in that public consultation process and can raise relevant issues or concerns, on which An Bord Plean&aacute;la will adjudicate. </p></reply>

Insofar as the rental accommodation scheme (RAS) and the proposed scheme of housing assistance payments (HAP) are concerned, responsibility for estate management in relation to private rented accommodation, including RAS and HAP dwellings , rests with the landlord concerned, who has power under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to terminate a tenancy where the tenant is engaging in, or allowing others to engage in, anti-social behaviour. Nonetheless, housing authorities have certain powers set out below to address anti-social behaviour in RAS accommodation provided under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and it is intended that forthcoming legislation will include powers for housing authorities to address anti-social behaviour in HAP accommodation.</p><p>  Under section 14 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997, housing authorities will have power to refuse to allocate, or to defer the allocation of, dwellings the subject of rental accommodation availability agreements under Chapter 4 of Part 2 of the 2009 Act to persons engaged in anti-social behaviour or in the interest of good estate management. Under that Chapter, a housing authority may also notify the landlord of a dwelling the subject of a rental accommodation availability agreement that the tenant is or was engaged in anti-social behaviour, in which case the landlord is obliged to terminate the tenancy in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  Commencement of Chapter 4 of the 2009 Act is dependent on commencement of section 31 of the 2009 Act relating to local authority rent schemes, a process which, following the enactment of the Housing (Amendment Act ) 2013, I will put in train shortly.</p></reply>

In July 2013 <i>Building for the Future</i>, a voluntary regulation code, was published as an important step towards a statutory regulatory framework. My Department, together with the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency and the Housing Finance Agency, is now working with the sector to develop a set of financial criteria to further enhance its capacity to contribute to housing provision. </p><p>  Development of the code was marked by close engagement with representatives of the sector. To date, a total of 76 organisations have signed up to the code, including 5 of the larger housing bodies. The voluntary regulation code is available on my Department&rsquo;s website  .</p><p>  Details on the content of the proposed statutory regulation are not, at this stage, developed. However, the implementation of the voluntary regulatory code in the coming months will be a valuable source of information as to the scope and final content of the proposed statutory regulation to be developed by 2016. In addition, there will be widespread consultation, in the normal way, during the development of the new legal framework.</p></reply>

However, applications for restricted firearm certificates are made to Chief Superintendents, thus highlighting the gravity with which the Commissioner regards such firearms.  </p><p>  Section 4 of the Firearms Act 1925, as amended, provides for the conditions subject to which all firearm certificates may be granted.  A certificate for a restricted firearm  has additional requirements which are that the applicant has a good and sufficient reason for requiring the firearm and he/she has demonstrated that the firearm is the only weapon that is appropriate for the purpose for which it is required.</p><p>  The Commissioner&rsquo;s Guidelines on firearms licensing were published on 4 September 2009 to coincide with the commencement of the new provisions governing firearms licensing legislation. The Guidelines are for the benefit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the shooting public alike, and the document includes guidance on the licensing of restricted firearms. Individuals seeking to licence any rifle or pistol for target shooting must be a member of an authorised rifle or pistol club. </p><p>  Section 33 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for the authorisation of shooting ranges by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na holding the rank of<i></i>  Superintendent. Applications for authorisations under this Section are made by the owner/operator of the shooting range having first obtained a firearms range certificate which is issued by my Department's Firearms Range Inspector.  </p><p>  Strict conditions apply to individuals seeking to licence restricted firearms and where these firearms may be used.</p></reply>

This message was issued by the Garda Press Office to raise the awareness of the public to mobile phone theft and provide information on steps to secure mobile phones and smart phones particularly in the run up to Christmas. </p><p>  Crime prevention advice on mobile phone security was also provided on the Crimecall programme and on the Garda website   .  This advice includes information on ways in which people can safeguard their phones, including obtaining their IMEI numbers to ensure that if their phone is stolen the service provider can immediately block the phone, rendering it immediately inoperative.  Mobile Phone Security was included as a priority in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Supporting Safer Communities week in September and will also be featured in the campaign for 2014.</p><p>  Local Garda management in the Dublin Metropolitan Region continue to address the ongoing challenges associated with theft and sale of mobile phones, in particular in the City Centre.  In this regard Operation Aughrim was introduced in June 2012, in the Dublin Metropolitan Region, with particular emphasis being placed in the Pearse Street and Store Street Districts. This operation is intelligence led with uniformed Garda&iacute; engaged in a high visibility patrols as well as plain clothes members conducting surveillance in identified hotspots.  Contact with mobile phone shops which specialise in the sale, supply and repair of second hand smart phones also forms part of this operation.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p></reply>

Various co-financing rates have applied at different times and to different measures over the course of the RDP.  However, up to late November 2013 there had been total expenditure of &euro;4.03 billion, of which &euro;2.27 billion was EU funding.</p><p>  In relation to the new RDP, 2014-2020, the European Council agreement on the Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) provides some &euro;313m per year, or a total of &euro;2.19bn, for Ireland under Pillar 2 of the CAP for the period 2014 &ndash; 2020.</p><p>  A general EU co-financing rate of 53% is set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation but this rate may rise to a maximum of 80% for measures such as farm and business development, co-operation activities, and LEADER projects. Environmental type measures may be co-funded up to 75%. The total Exchequer funding that will be required to draw down the available European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) funding will depend on the types of measures included in the new Rural Development Programme and on the co-financing rates applied to these measures.</p><p>  There are a number of conditions attached to Ireland&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;313 million per annum.  The draft Regulation provides that at least 5% of EAFRD funding must be reserved for LEADER while the draft Common Provisions Regulation provides that 6% of EAFRD funding must be set aside to a national performance reserve. The funding set aside to the performance reserve will be allocated to each Member State following a performance review in 2019. Finally, the draft Rural Development Regulation sets out that 30% of the total EAFRD amount must be reserved for environmental operations and climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.</p><p>  Work is currently ongoing in my Department to design the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) for the period from 2014 &ndash; 2020.  In designing the new RDP, my Department must take account of the range of requirements set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation and the need to support key policy aims for the agri-food sector in the light of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. In undertaking this work, a number of ex-ante analyses are being undertaken and a public consultation process has also taken place. </p><p>  While final decisions in relation to what measures are to be included in the new RDP have not yet been made, my Department is in ongoing contact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the overall financing that will be required.  </p></reply>

As I have indicated previously, while it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend in the near future to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed.  My firm intention is that the process will be fully inclusive and that all stakeholders, particularly farmers and their representatives will be central to the process.  It is only by adopting this approach that the desired result can be achieved.</p><p>  With regard to the specific recommendations of the Committee contained in their Report, I can confirm that these will be included among the range of issues to be addressed in the process that will shortly be commenced by my Department - it very clear that matters to be resolved are very wide ranging and complex; it is self-evident that the process required to adequately address these must be fully inclusive and focused.  To this end, I am determined, as indicated, to convene a broad group of all relevant stakeholders, charged with comprehensively addressing the range of issues.</p><p>  Commonage lands form an important part of the farming enterprises of many farmers, particularly along the West Coast.  They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism.  However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. </p><p>  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission.  It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC.  It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.  This matter will be further progressed when the Direct Payments Delegated Acts are adopted by the European Commission.</p></reply>

The development of a new Rural Development Programme (RDP) under Pillar 2 will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas.</p><p>  A general EU co-financing rate of 53% is set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation but this rate may rise to a maximum of 80% for measures such as farm and business development, co-operation activities, and LEADER projects. Environmental type measures may be co-funded up to 75%.  The total Exchequer funding that will be required to draw down the available European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) funding will depend on the types of measures included in the new Rural Development Programme and on the co-financing rates applied to these measures.</p><p>  There are a number of conditions attached to Ireland&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;313 million per annum.  The draft Regulation provides that at least 5% of EAFRD funding must be reserved for LEADER while the draft Common Provisions Regulation provides that 6% of EAFRD funding must be set aside to a national performance reserve.  The funding set aside to the performance reserve will be allocated to each Member State following a performance review in 2019.  The draft Rural Development Regulation also sets out that 30% of the total EAFRD amount must be reserved for environmental operations and climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. </p><p>  Work is currently ongoing in my Department to design the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) for the period from 2014 &ndash; 2020. In designing the new RDP, my Department must take account of the range of requirements set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation and the need to support key policy aims for the agri-food sector in the light of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  In undertaking this work, a number of ex-ante analyses are being undertaken and a public consultation process has also taken place.</p><p>  While final decisions in relation to what measures are to be included in the new RDP have not yet been made, my Department is in ongoing contact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the overall financing that will be required.  I expect to make decisions in relation to the measures to be supported under the new RDP by the end of this year, and to submit a draft programme to the Commission in early 2014.</p></reply>

I recently accompanied the Taoiseach on a trade mission to Japan, one of the highlights of which was the agreement to open the market there to Irish beef.  In November the US lifted its ban on the importation of beef from the European Union.  This was one of my priorities last year when I visited the US, where I pushed the matter strongly with the US Department of Agriculture Secretary of State, Tom Vilsackand in meetings with Senators.  My Department is now advancing the various technical requirements to ensure commencement of the trade at the earliest possible date.</p><p>  My Department engages on a daily basis with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassies&rsquo; personnel on market access issues. </p><p>  These initiatives have led to a number of notable successes in securing agreement to import from authorities in Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran which allow the import of Irish beef; with Singapore, South Africa, UAE, Canada and the Russian Federation-Customs Union for the import of Irish sheep meat and with Australia and Serbia for the import of Irish pork.</p><p>  Whilst the UK, as the largest single destination, and Continental Europe together account for the majority of pig meat exports, there has been a continued shift in recent years towards Third Country markets for pig meat. This differs from developments in other meats, particularly beef.  Approximately one-third of Irish pig meat export volumes are destined for international markets, with China, the USA and Russia accounting for the majority of this trade.  </p><p>  Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across EU markets.  This wide portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years and reflects the success of Bord Bia&rsquo;s differentiation and premiumisation strategy which focuses on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmentally sustainable, grass-based production systems, full traceability, quality assurance at all stages and superior eating quality.  Among Bord Bia&rsquo;s key initiatives this year is the continued development, global promotion and marketing of its Origin Green initiative, designed to establish Ireland as a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink.  Over 200 companies are currently working with Bord Bia to develop, and commit to, sustainability plans setting out clear targets in emissions, energy, waste, water, biodiversity and corporate social responsibility activities.</p><p>  Last week a delegation from my Department visited China for discussions with authorities there on the lifting of the beef BSE ban which prohibits imports from any EU country. While there are a number of stages to go before Ireland secures access for beef to China, I am hopeful that these can be progressed in 2014.</p><p>  There is a strong demand for meat globally and my focus is to enable Irish exporters to take advantage of the opportunities that arise.  </p></reply>

The aid substantially covered the cost of transport into the country, thus reducing the cost to farmers of a bale of hay by approximately one third. </p><p>  While the scheme operated through the co-operatives, marts and other approved agencies, the actual beneficiaries are the individual farmers and primary producers who needed urgent supplies of feed. Operating the scheme in this manner was the quickest and most effective way of getting the fodder to those who needed it. </p><p>  The Minister for Transport, who is responsible for road traffic law, introduced Statutory Instrument 366 of 2008 - Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 2008 which sets the maximum height limit of vehicles in this country at 4.65 metres.  </p><p>  Following public consultation undertaken by the Department of Transport, prior to the completion of the relevant Regulations in 2008, the intention to introduce a 4.65m limit was announced in January 2007. In response to representations from the haulage industry, it was agreed that a five year derogation from that limit would apply to vehicles registered, licensed or in use prior to 1st November 2008. The derogation was introduced to allow a five-year period within which vehicles operating at heights in excess of the new limits could be withdrawn from use in Ireland in an orderly and planned manner, or to allow for the necessary height reductions by operators and would minimise the economic costs of the change. This derogation expired on 31st October 2013.</p><p>  Given the lead-in time that this height limit has had, extending the derogation would have the effect of penalising those operators who have adjusted their fleet to ensure compliance with this well flagged law, while rewarding those that did not. </p></reply>

These import requirements are generic and applicable for all countries authorised to export to the EU. The legislation imposes a series of health and supervisory requirements, designed to ensure that imported products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between Member States. Products must have originated in an area where there are no restrictions imposed under EU Safeguard measures and come from establishments which are under the supervision and control of the competent authorities. The products must be free from residues and contaminants, correctly labelled and travel with the specific health certificates or other documents conforming to the models laid down in EU legislation drawn up in conformity with the relevant model for the product, completed and signed on behalf of the competent authorities of the country of export. The EU's Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) carries out assessments of third countries wishing to export these products to the EU and submits for Commission approval those where the responsible authorities can provide appropriate guarantees as regards compliance or equivalence with Community feed and food law and animal health rules. Third countries and their establishments that are approved to export are audited and inspected by the FVO with regard to these guarantees and reports of the findings of inspections are published on its website.</p><p>  Import controls on products of animal origin arriving from third countries must be performed at an EU Border Inspection Post approved for that category of product being presented. Consignments for import requiring veterinary checks must be notified in advance to the Border Inspection Post of import and presented on arrival for checks with all the appropriate documentation. Border Inspection Posts in Ireland are operated by my Department. The import controls procedures on products of animal origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the FVO to ensure compliance. Again, reports of the findings of inspections are published on the FVO&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  In summary, the import of all products including poultry<font color="#004080"> </font>  from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by EU Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office, to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards. Finally, consumers wishing to purchase high quality Irish poultry products should look for the Bord Bia Quality Assurance mark.</p></reply>

While there has been some improvement in the status of some fish stocks, others remain a concern</p><p>  The newly reformed Common Fisheries Policy prioritises conservation measures and environmental issues and implements the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management to ensure the negative impacts of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem are minimised, it also endeavours to ensure that aquaculture and fisheries activities avoid the degradation of the marine environment.</p><p>  The SIA also notes that the activities of the fleet have other impacts on the wider marine ecosystem. Greater efforts are necessary to achieve a more harmonious and eco-friendly interaction with the broader environment and to support compliance with European Environmental Directives</p><p>  As a general principal Ireland is committed to having Total Allowable Catches set at levels that can produce Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) by 2015, where possible and by 2020 at the latest, this is consistent with the newly reformed Common Fisheries Policy reform.  A core objective of the Common  Fisheries  Policy is  to  "ensure exploitation  of  living  aquatic  resources  that  provides  sustainable  economic,  environmental and  social  conditions".  Under the ongoing reform of the CFP, the goal of attaining fishing mortality rates that are consistent with delivering maximum sustainable yield by 2015 has been set.  While achieving this through the regulation of catches (TACs) may be relatively straight-forward in the context of a single species fishery; in multi-gear, multi-species and multi-fleet fisheries using single species, TAC constraints are complex and challenging.</p><p>  A practical and phased  discards policy is now being introduced where in the early years of implementation, TACs and quotas will be set to take account of current levels of discards, which should see quotas increase over time. </p><p>  I am fully supportive of implementing appropriate measures to achieve the objectives set out in the CFP reform. The new Common Fisheries Policy reform agreement will bring real and meaningful reform to how EU waters are fished in the future. The agreement is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters.</p></reply>

However, there is no evidence of a major welfare problem in the horse sector at present due to the relatively high level of horse slaughterings this year and the very good weather well into the Autumn, which has created a very favourable fodder situation. </p><p>  My Department, in conjunction with the local authorities and the garda&iacute; are adopting a pro-active approach in relation to welfare issues in the horse sector and this has reduced the numbers of abandoned horses throughout the country particularly in urban areas.  The Deputy may be aware that, in recent weeks, 82 horses were seized in the Cork city area.  While a small number of horses had to be euthanized on welfare grounds, the majority that were seized are being re-homed with the assistance of welfare groups and the remainder were required to be correctly identified in accordance with EU legislation prior to being returned to their owners.  Furthermore, last week, my Department engaged with the local authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a similar proactive manner in County Wicklow.</p><p>  My Department devotes considerable resources to issues relating to the welfare of animals including horses.  To date this year, my Department has paid some &euro;2.5m to the Local Authorities under the Control of Horses Act to enable them to deal with stray and unwanted horses.  My Department also provides considerable financial support to animal welfare organisations to assist them in the delivery of animal care and welfare services.  In 2012, this funding came to a total of &euro;1,365,000 to some 140 organisations.  I plan to make an allocation in respect of 2014 shortly.</p><p>  In conclusion, I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to work with local authorities and garda&iacute; in other areas if similar cases occur and intervention is required.  I urge the public to continue to avail of the Animal Welfare Helpline in operation by my Department, to report instances where animal welfare may be compromised on 1850 211 990.</p></reply>

The ABC programme is co-funded by The Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation over 2013-2016 of &euro;29.7m.</p><p>  In March of this year, applications were invited from area-based not-for-profit organisations, which were either part of a pre-existing consortium or were prepared to form one for the purpose of the new programme.  In each case, the consortium had to be led by an organisation with a proven track record of working with statutory and non-statutory service providers and local community groups.  The scoring criteria identified in the application process were evidence of need; quality of the proposal; additionality and sustainability; and understanding and capturing outcomes.  The closing date for receipt of applications was 31st May 2013.     </p><p>  Fifty applications to participate in the new programme were received and evaluated against the programme criteria.  The evaluation process was undertaken by a Working Group of the Inter-departmental Project Team which was set up in February of this year to oversee the implementation of the programme.  The Project Team is chaired by my Department and includes representatives from seven other Departments, our co-funders The Atlantic Philanthropies and two organisations, Pobal and the Centre for Effective Services, which have been designated to manage the programme on behalf of my Department.  </p><p>  Based on the evaluation process, in addition to the three projects which participated in the previous Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) implemented by my Department in partnership with The Atlantic Philanthropies, the Project Team recommended nine of the fifty applicants for entry into the next, design stage of the programme.  A further application was recommended for entry to the design stage of the programme, on the basis that it will form part of one of the three projects which were previously in the PEIP.  The recommendations of the Project Team were noted by Government on 25th November 2013.</p><p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that an application was received from Galway Early Education, under the lead organisation Galway City Partnership, but that this application is not included in the areas which have been invited to proceed to the next stage.  My Department is currently engaged in supporting successful applicants through the design stage of the programme and there are no plans at present to invite new applications.  My Department will, however, be developing a mentoring programme in 2014 in the implementation of evidence-based programmes to improve outcomes for children and young people, for applicants which did not score sufficiently highly to enter the programme at this stage but showed future potential against the criteria set for the programme.  I understand that Galway Early Education was included in this group and has been invited to participate in the mentoring programme when it is established.</p></reply>

I have requested urgent action to ensure that every agency is fully compliant with Government pay policy.  The HSE has a team of senior managers following up with individual agencies and the Director General of the HSE is meeting the Chairpersons and the CEOs of all the Section 38 organisations today.  The HSE will take whatever actions are necessary to deliver full compliance  and ensure that any governance deficits identified are comprehensively rectified immediately.  The question of recoupment will be dealt with on a case by case basis.  As indicated above the HSE is urgently meeting individual agencies and it is important that due process is followed.</p></reply>

This process has the potential to produce significant savings in drug expenditure while at the same time enhancing patient safety.</p><p>  The MMP has also introduced the preferred drugs initiative which facilitates more cost-effective prescribing particularly in relation to high-cost medicines and it has commenced a series of educational meetings with general practitioners to reinforce the message around safe, effective and cost-effective prescribing as well as generic prescribing.</p><p>  Compliance with medication is a matter for the patient in conjunction with their medical practitioner. Pharmacists also have a vital role to play in relation to the management of individual patients and/or medicines.</p></reply>

The Special Action Group on Obesity comprises representatives from the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, the Health Service Executive, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, <i>Safe</i>food and other key stakeholders, to examine and progress a number of issues to address the problem of obesity.  The range of measures being implemented by my Department seeks to promote a healthy lifestyle, to encourage people to make healthier food choices, to become more active and take the first steps towards reducing obesity.</p><p>  The Special Action Group on Obesity is concentrating on a range of measures including actions such as: calorie on menus in restaurants, how best to support healthy eating choices, the supply of healthy food products in vending machines in schools, the detection and treatment of obesity, healthy eating guidelines and the promotion of physical activity.  As one of the measures specifically designed to combat Childhood Obesity, on Monday 21<sup>st</sup> October, I launched the <i>Safe</i>food / Healthy Ireland / HSE three year Childhood Obesity Campaign &ndash; <i>Childhood Obesity: Let&rsquo;s take it on &ndash;  one small step at a time </i>which is designed to create greater awareness among parent&rsquo;s about the threat of childhood overweight and obesity and provide practical tips to help address the problem with the ultimate aim and effecting behaviour change.</p><p>  I have also tasked SAGO with establishing a sub-committee to investigate and develop a range of options around pricing and other mechanisms in order to reduce consumption of foods and drinks from the top-shelf of the Food Pyramid (as per the Department of Health's Healthy Eating Guidelines) as these foods and drinks are not necessary for health.  The sub-committee&rsquo;s report and recommendations were presented to me on Wednesday, 23<sup>rd</sup> October when I attended a meeting of SAGO and an action plan is now being developed around these recommendations.</p><p>  Because the issue of Childhood Obesity is of such serious concern for me I placed it centre stage of the Irish Presidency of the EU and was successful in having the EU mandated to draw up an EU Action Plan to tackle Childhood Obesity. This Plan has been drafted and will be finalised before the end of the year.  SAGO will continue to liaise with other Departments and organisations in a cross-sectoral approach to further progress initiatives to help halt the rise in overweight and obesity.</p><p>  As childhood is a critical period for developing obesity as well as an opportune time to prevent or intervene on it, as eating and physical activity patterns are developed and established during this period, the majority share of HSE Obesity funding is channelled towards childhood obesity prevention programmes, run by the HSE and increasingly with partners both in public and voluntary organisations, who are best placed in the community to provide effective initiatives.</p></reply>

This has been combined with a firm focus on improving public service efficiency and effectiveness.  The Haddington Road Agreement provides for some five million additional working hours annually.  These measures will enable the health service to continue to reduce overall numbers, while maintaining services and service levels to the greatest possible extent.</p><p>  The HSE provides orthodontic treatment to those who have been assessed and referred for treatment before their 16th birthday. Orthodontic referrals are generally received via the Public Dental Service school screening programme. An individual's access to orthodontic treatment is determined in accordance with the Modified Index of Treatment Need. The dental health component has five categories ranging from 1 (no need for treatment) to 5 (great need). Further sub-divisions of these categories are substantially based in accordance with the causes of malocclusion, e.g. misalignment of teeth. Patients with the greatest level of need are provided with treatment and those with urgent clinical need are prioritised. The HSE has commissioned an independent review of orthodontic services. The outcome of this review, which is near completion, will give guidance as to what changes will be desirable to provide the best possible model of care delivery, given the current resources available and future demand for services.</p></reply>

More recently, (12th June) I announced an additional &euro;50 million to County and City Councils for regional and local roads bringing the overall amount available in 2013 to approximately &euro;400 million. </p><p>  The main two road grants are the Restoration Improvement and the Restoration Maintenance grants. Both of these grants are allocated based on the length of mileage of regional and local roads within the county. In the case of counties that experience higher road traffic than the norm, a loading is applied to the mileage within the county. In the case of Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council a factor of 2 is applied, one of 1.5 is applied for Fingal and South Dublin County Councils while a factor of 1.2 is used for Kildare, Louth and Meath County Council.</p><p>  Details of the regional and local road grant payments to local authorities are outlined in the regional and local road grant payment booklets which are available in the D&aacute;il Library.  Details of the 2013 regional and local road grant allocations to each local authority are also available in the D&aacute;il library. The 2014 grant allocations will be announced early in the New Year.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, all of the PSO services provided by Dublin Bus are loss making requiring subvention. If they were not loss making, they would not be eligible for subvention. While the vast majority of the services operated by Dublin Bus are PSO services, it also has some limited purely commercial services such as Airlink and Dublin Bus Tours which operate without subvention. Without the level of PSO subvention, in addition to free travel payments and capital funding, the company and the PSO services it provides would incur unsustainable losses.</p><p>  In relation to providing further information on the performance of Dublin Bus's PSO network, I have referred the question to the NTA for further response. If the Deputy does not receive a response within ten working days, please contact my private office.</p></reply>
