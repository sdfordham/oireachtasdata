    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-19a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014021900068#WRA00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 30 and 41 together. </p><p>  This is an issue to which I accord very high priority. I am conscious of the difficulties experienced by Irish citizens who are undocumented in the United States, and I have met and spoken with many of them on my working visits there, and also with the various groups who lobby on their behalf.</p><p>  I have maintained contact, both directly and through our Embassy in Washington, with many key players in Congress who are influential in steering the process of US immigration reform.  Over the last five months, both the Embassy and I have had direct contact with some 70 Members of the House of Representatives and their staff.   These have included Republican Congressman Paul Ryan, Chair of the House Budgetary Committee and former Vice-Presidential nominee; Republican Congressman Bob Goodlatte, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee and several other leading Republican members of that Committee, including Immigration Sub-Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy; Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi;  Chair of the Congressional Friends of Ireland, Pete King; with House Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and their staffs.   I have also maintained contact with key figures in the US Administration and with Irish-American community representatives. </p><p>  I have reiterated throughout all these contacts the Government&rsquo;s interest in all aspects of immigration reform and in particular our interest in seeing an overall agreement reached which provides relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and a facility for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US.  </p><p>  In this context, we very much welcomed the US Senate&rsquo;s approval of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill by a 68-32 margin on 27 June last year.    </p><p>  Following passage of that Bill, the issue has been under consideration in the Republican controlled House of Representatives.   Public comments and private conversations which I, the Taoiseach and our Embassy in Washington DC had with leaders of the House Republican caucus,  had given rise to expectations that the House would take up consideration of a series of immigration reform bills last autumn.  Unfortunately that did not come to pass.  </p><p>  Early last month, further public comments from Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Chief Whip Kevin McCarthy again raised hopes that the Republican leadership in the House saw the need to proceed with immigration reform.  To that end, the leadership prepared a set of draft principles that would guide their action on immigration in the House and presented them to the members of their caucus for consideration at a meeting on 30 January 2014.</p><p>  Informed by that discussion, Speaker Boehner gave a press conference on 6 February in which he expressed doubts that the House would pass immigration reform legislation this year.  He did reassert that immigration reform is something that needs to get done and that he would continue to consult his members.</p><p>  Given that expectations had again been raised, these and other comments are disappointing.  However, it is important that we keep our focus on the endgame.  The Government through our Ambassador in Washington DC and her team are continuing an extensive outreach and engagement with members of Congress and with the Irish groups and organisations who are lobbying for immigration reform.  We are monitoring the ongoing discussions within the Republican Party and continuing to press the case for addressing the concerns of our undocumented and to provide for a future legal flow for Irish immigrants to the United States.  The forthcoming St Patrick&rsquo;s Day visits to the United States will provide a further important opportunity to engage with US leaders in support of our immigration objectives and to assess the prospects for the weeks and months ahead.  We remain fully committed to the effort to achieve an outcome that addresses the needs of our undocumented and creates a legal path for the future.</p></reply>

I welcome the stated determination of both sides to conduct the negotiations in a results-oriented manner. </p><p>  I fully support their aim to find a solution that provides for a comprehensive settlement based on a bicommuncal, bizonal federation with political equality, as set out in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. </p><p>  Ireland remains fully supportive of the efforts underway to resolve this long-standing problem.  As the leaders themselves acknowledge, a successful resolution of the Cyprus question would have a positive impact on the whole region. Most significantly, however, it would benefit both Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots.</p></reply>

The second round of peace talks focused on resolving political differences between the parties in the country opened last week in Addis Ababa. The EU, through its Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, is closely monitoring the peace efforts and strongly supports the role being played by the East African regional grouping, IGAD, in mediating the ceasefire and peace talks.  </p><p>  The situation in South Sudan was discussed by EU Foreign Ministers most recently at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on 20 January.  There was very strong concern at the reports of widespread human rights violations and abuses, including ethnic targeting.  The Council welcomed the African Union&rsquo;s decision to establish a Commission to investigate the human rights violations and abuses. </p><p>  The African Union Commissioner for Peace and Security briefed EU Ambassadors in Addis Ababa on 7 February on the situation in South Sudan and progress on the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry into human rights abuses.</p><p>  Ireland strongly shares the concerns about the violence in South Sudan and the devastating impact on the civilian population.  According to current estimates, there are more than 700,000 people displaced inside South Sudan with a further 145,000 displaced in neighbouring countries.  This is close to 10% of the population.  The scale of the humanitarian needs is placing an enormous burden on humanitarian agencies to respond to the crisis.  Some aid agencies estimate that by June 2014 more than 3 million people could be at risk of food insecurity. </p><p>  In the last two years, Ireland has provided &euro;5 million in funding to the UN-managed Common Humanitarian Fund for South Sudan to help UN agencies target the most critical humanitarian needs. In addition, Ireland provided over &euro;3 million to NGOs operating in South Sudan to improve food security across the country. In addition, in response to the recent violence, two airlifts with 45 tonnes of emergency supplies, valued at &euro;400,000, were dispatched to South Sudan from Irish Aid pre-positioned stocks in Ghana.  A further airlift will be dispatched to Uganda in the coming days to assist South Sudanese refugees displaced inside Uganda.  I am currently considering how Ireland can best respond to the crisis this year though our ongoing support for the UN-managed Common Humanitarian Fund. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-19a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014021900068#WRA01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 35 together.</p><p>  I continue to avail of all opportunities for discussions with members of the Northern Ireland Executive to advocate for expanded cross-border trade and all-island economic co-operation.  These have included my recent meetings in Dublin and Belfast with the First Minister and deputy First Minister, one of which was the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) Institutional meeting on 10 January, 2014, and with other members of the Northern Ireland Executive at the most recent NSMC Plenary meeting on 8 November 2013.  The Narrow Water Bridge project was among the issues discussed during those meetings.</p><p>I believe that there is scope for increasing the levels of intra-island trade and economic activity including in border areas.  This in turn can safeguard jobs, and encourage cross-border investments. My colleague Minister Richard Bruton has responsibility for the NSMC Trade and Business Sector and meets regularly with Minister Arlene Foster to oversee the work of InterTrade Ireland, the North South Implementation Body which promotes trade and business development on the island. InterTrade Ireland has <i>a range </i>  of programmes designed to encourage trade and business growth across the island and to create an environment where it is easier to do cross-border business, and it is doing excellent work in this area. </p><p>  In addition, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation co-funds a total of 28 projects under the Enterprise Development theme of the Interreg IVA Programme (2009-2015), together with both the administration in Northern Ireland and the EU.  These include projects addressing barriers to trade faced by micro-enterprises in border counties, assisting with market entry support, developing cross border linkages, business support mentoring, capacity building for SMEs, schemes for assisting specific enterprise sectors, the provision of two Enterprise Centres and the provision of a major Science Park. </p><p>  There is also close engagement and cooperation between the relevant Enterprise Development bodies, Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards, with their counterparts in Northern Ireland on a range of mutually beneficial issues. </p><p>  At the NSMC Plenary meeting last November it was agreed that Ministers from both administrations would consider their priorities for further North/South co-operation in their respective areas with the focus of these discussions on where they could lead to economic recovery, job creation, the best use of public funds and the most effective delivery of services.  </p><p>  The shortfall in the funding for the Narrow Water Bridge project arose when construction tender prices came in at nearly double the estimated cost. </p><p>  As the additional funding required to deliver the project had not been secured, on 15 November 2013 the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) withdrew the letter of offer of &euro;17.4 million in INTERREG IVA funding.  The SEUPB has since been exploring options for the reallocation of the funding which had been earmarked for Narrow Water to other eligible projects capable of being delivered by December 2015 to ensure that the drawdown of funds from the European Commission is maximised and that no money is lost.  </p><p>  The priority for both Administrations, North and South, is to ensure that the significant amount of EU funding which has been withdrawn from the Narrow Water Bridge is secured for the benefit of the economies of the island.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to work together with colleagues in the Executive to that end and I confirmed this at my meeting with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister on 10 January 2014.  I appreciate that there is disappointment in the Louth/Down border area but I assure you that my colleagues in Government and I remain conscious of the potential benefits of the Narrow Water Bridge project.</p><p>  While the priority was not to lose the EU funding involved, I want to stress that at the Plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council Ministers remained supportive of the concept of the Narrow Water Bridge. </p></reply>

The Israeli Government, and Israeli public opinion, are in no doubt whatever about our views on this issue.  I strongly condemn the recent announcement by Israel of building permits for 558 new units in East Jerusalem, and I urge the Israeli authorities to reconsider this decision.  </p><p>  On 5 February, High Representative Ashton released a statement on behalf of the European Union expressing deep concern at the announcement and stating that these plans could put at risk the prospects of Jerusalem becoming the capital of two states and, in particular, the territorial contiguity between East Jerusalem and the southern West Bank.  In December 2013, the EU Foreign Affairs Council adopted Conclusions which strongly warned against actions that undermine the current negotiations and, in that regard, deplored Israel&rsquo;s continuous expansion of settlements.</p><p>  Settlement announcements such as these during the current peace talks have clearly been damaging to confidence in the process.   Israel has announced some 5,500 new settlement units since the talks began, a higher rate than before the talks.  Although actual construction does not seem to be moving any quicker, demolitions, land seizures and evictions are still continuing.   </p><p>  I made clear my concerns in a statement I issued on 1 November 2013 relating to plans for a further 1,500 settlement units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.   Ireland also provides funding to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs which challenge the legality of settlement construction activities through the courts.</p><p>  I believe however that the international community should be more forceful in its response to continued settlement expansion.</p></reply>

The referendum text did not specify what levels the quotas on migrants should be set at. These details will be set down in draft legislation which the Swiss Federal Council (Government) is required to bring forward to give effect to the new constitutional provisions on immigration.  The Federal Council has said that it intends to present a draft law to the Swiss Parliament by the end of this year.</p><p>The referendum outcome is a worrying development, with far reaching implications for EU- Switzerland relations, not least because any new Swiss legislation introducing quotas on immigration by EU citizens would be incompatible with the existing EU-Switzerland Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons which has been in place since 2002.  The free movement of people is a cornerstone of the construction of the European Union. It is integral to many of the 100 plus bilateral agreements between the EU and Switzerland and is a key basis on which Switzerland is able to access the EU single market.    </p><p>  At a meeting of the General Affairs Council in Brussels last week, Ireland echoed the views of many Member States who underlined the centrality of the free movement of persons to the operation of the EU single market. Ministers also made it clear that the onus was firmly on Switzerland to explain how it proposes to address the serious situation that has now arisen. </p><p>  The Federal Council has acknowledged that it has a responsibility to clarify its intentions regarding Switzerland&rsquo;s existing agreements with the EU and to keep the EU fully informed of its future plans. To this end, a meeting has been arranged with senior EU officials in Brussels later this month to begin exploratory talks on the way forward.   </p></reply>

The Council called on all actors to refrain from violence and dissociate themselves from radical actions. We recalled that demonstrations should be pursued by peaceful means. </p><p>  The Council made clear that the authorities should take all necessary measures to respect and protect the fundamental rights of Ukrainian  citizens and that the  continuous targeting of organisers and participants of peaceful protesters as well as of journalists must be stopped immediately. We have urged the authorities to investigate all acts of violence in a transparent and impartial manner and bring the perpetrators to justice. The current atmosphere of impunity which allows for such acts to take place must be addressed.</p><p>  While the Council welcomed recent steps, in particular the decision on 28 January by the Ukrainian Parliament to revoke the laws which unduly restricted the exercise of fundamental freedoms, we also indicated that further efforts are necessary to find a durable solution to the current political crisis. We have urged all sides to seek, though an inclusive dialogue, a democratic solution that would meet the aspirations of the Ukrainian people.</p><p>As the Conclusions state, the Union remains committed to supporting Ukraine&rsquo;s reform course.  While the details have yet to be worked out and agreed,   the EU is ready to further pursue its efforts with the international community and international financial institutions to assist Ukraine, in line with well-established conditions, to find a sustainable way out of its difficult economic situation. </p><p>  More generally, the EU has an important role to play in encouraging all sides to end the violence, engage in serious and inclusive dialogue and show willingness to compromise. As High Representative Ashton has already stressed, the EU will act as facilitator and not as a mediator.  I want to take this opportunity to commend the High Representative for her tireless efforts on behalf of the EU and indeed the Ukrainian people. </p><p>  I believe that the OSCE and Council of Europe also have potentially important roles to play in facilitating a negotiated way out of the crisis.  Following his visit to Kiev, the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Commissioner for Human Rights has found that excessive force was used against protesters by law enforcement officers and others working with them in recent months.  I have put on record my own shock at the loss of life in Ukraine and that I have been appalled at reports of torture and other severe human rights abuses perpetrated by the security services. I strongly agree with the Commissioner that it is important to prevent any further violence and to ensure accountability for the serious human rights violations which have already occurred.  The Foreign Affairs Council encouraged the Government of Ukraine to appoint without delay its member to the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Advisory Panel which will investigate   the violent incidents during the protests and which could be an effective mechanism in helping to defuse tensions.</p><p>  In relation to the particular point raised by the Deputy regarding the Eastern Partnership, I would recall that its purpose is to support reforms in the countries of the EU&rsquo;s Eastern neighbourhood and promote closer political association and economic integration with the EU. This is a long term project and in spite of many challenges, it is important to acknowledge the progress that has already been made in developing the Eastern Partnership. Both Georgia and Moldova will sign Association agreements with the EU later this year. The benefits of the Eastern Partnership are for all the countries of the Eastern Neighbourhood, however, including those which have not chosen, or do not fulfil the conditions, to conclude Association Agreements. The EU will be considering over the next few months how some of the benefits of the Eastern Partnership can be extended to these countries.</p></reply>

Regrettably, there has been little progress to date though both sides have stated their willingness to discuss the original terms of the Geneva communiqu&eacute; and see how it may begin to be implemented. To this end, the Syrian opposition led by the Syrian National Coalition have circulated a set of principles for a political settlement but the Syrian regime has to date been unwilling to engage on this or any discussion of a transitional authority as provided for in the Geneva communiqu&eacute;.   </p><p>  Joint Special Representative Brahimi  made a statement to the press last weekend indicating that progress remains blocked as the Assad regime is refusing to negotiate on a key principle of the Geneva communiqu&eacute;, the formation of a transitional governing body with full executive powers. He will make a full report to the Security Council this week.  I have repeatedly stated that I see no prospect for any military solution to this conflict and that the Geneva principles remain the best basis for a negotiated end to this conflict. If the present opportunity is missed, the future viability of the Syrian state may be at risk.</p><p>  The ongoing crisis in Syria and the Geneva II negotiations were discussed at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council which I attended on 10 February. Issues raised included the humanitarian crisis in Syria and across the region and the prospects for a humanitarian resolution at the UN Security Council which I have consistently called for and which now has full EU support; the regional impact of the Syrian conflict; the renewal of the Geneva II negotiations and the chemical weapons destruction programme.  All Member States expressed concerns about the appalling impact of this crisis and a shared determination to support the Geneva II process and Joint Special Representative Brahimi in his efforts.</p><p>At the 15 January Syria donor conference in Kuwait, Minister of State Costello met with UN , Valarie Amos, to discuss impediments to the humanitarian efforts on the ground in Syria.  The conflict is Syria is intensifying, with the latest reports indicating a total death toll estimated at 136,000 and over 9.3 million in need of humanitarian assistance.   They agreed that, while reaching populations under siege is an urgent priority, the fact remains that humanitarian access across Syria is exceptionally difficult as a result of increasing disregard by armed groups on both sides of the conflict of their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. </p><p>Minister of State Costello pledged a further &euro;12 million in Kuwait.   This additional pledge brings Ireland&rsquo;s overall commitment over the period 2011 to 2014 to &euro;26.011 million. International donors pledged US$2.3 billion of the US$6.5 billion UN Agencies are appealing for to cover life saving humanitarian needs of 9.3 million people in Syria and neighbouring countries. I welcome the recent announcement that &euro;5.3 million of the &euro;12 million pledged in Kuwait is now being disbursed by Irish Aid to provide emergency food, water, health and protection to victims of the conflict.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-19a.46.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014021900068#WRA03500"><p>The discovery of substantial new natural resources in Africa in recent years, especially oil and gas, brings both opportunities and risks.  These resources, if used well, can help to reduce poverty significantly on the continent.  Because of the development challenges many of the resource-rich African countries still face, it is vital to ensure that these non-renewable resources are extracted in a way that protects the environment and that revenues generated from them are used to improve the lives of the poor, with full transparency. </p><p>  We know that the so-called &lsquo;natural resource curse&rsquo; can be avoided when the right institutions and policies, that support transparency and accountability at national and international level, are in place. </p><p>  The Government strongly supports the efforts being made to improve transparency among EU multinational companies involved in extractive and logging industries in developing countries.  During Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency last year, revisions to the EU Transparency and Accounting Directives were approved by the European Parliament.  Ireland played a central role in the final negotiations of these Directives.  </p><p>  Under this new legislation, multinational companies based in the EU are now required to disclose full details of their payments to developing country Governments for every project that they operate in the oil, gas, mineral and logging sectors. These revised Directives complement the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) initiative, which has been developed under the EU-Africa Governance Partnership.</p><p>  Capital flight remains a major obstacle to developing countries&rsquo; efforts to raise more of their own revenue.  Ireland&rsquo;s new policy for international development &lsquo;One World One Future&rsquo; commits us to working at global level to combat illicit financial flows and capital flight and to helping developing countries raise their own domestic revenue in ways that better promote good governance and equitable and inclusive development.  It also commits to strengthening our procedures to help developing countries recover the proceeds of corruption and to combat bribery in line with our obligations under international agreements.  </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s International Tax Strategy which was launched in October 2013 also includes commitments to counter aggressive tax planning through our work with the OECD, the EU, through domestic legislation and through our engagement with developing countries.</p><p>  We continue to support efforts at the country level through the strong partnerships we have built with Governments, civil society and the private sector in Africa. In this way we are promoting improvements in governance and accountability, the protection and promotion of human rights, and the efficient and effective use of domestic revenues derived from natural resources.</p></reply>

While this stance has been legally challenged, the New York Supreme Court has ruled that the organisers are permitted to do so as the Parade is a private one.</p><p>  Since 2000, a second large parade has taken place in Queens, New York, called that St. Pat&rsquo;s For All Parade.  This inclusive event was set up as a response to the exclusion of LGBT groups from the Fifth Avenue Parade and takes place on the first Sunday in March.   The event is attended by most political and civil leaders in New York City.    The Irish Government has been represented at this event in previous years and that will remain the case this year.</p><p>  When I became T&aacute;naiste in 2011, I represented the Government in New York at all the events associated with St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, including the Fifth Avenue parade.    As the St. Pat&rsquo;s For All Event had already taken place at that point, I instead held a meeting with representatives of the Irish LGBT community.    I discussed, at length, the Government&rsquo;s commitment to LGBT rights and my own commitment to see reform in this area.   Ireland works to consistently support the promotion and protection of the human rights of all persons, irrespective of their sexual orientation or gender identity and is strongly committed to combatting all human rights violations committed against individuals on such a basis.  </p><p>  The St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day Parade on Fifth Avenue is a major event in the Irish American calendar and is a high point of a whole series of events which take place in New York marking the extraordinary depth of the relationship between the Irish and American peoples.   It is estimated that the parade has over 180,000 participants and between two and three million spectators.     Millions more watch the comprehensive coverage on American television.      In this context, and given the importance of the event for our two nations, the Taoiseach, as last year, will participate in this year&rsquo;s parade.   In keeping with our policy of inclusiveness, the Government will also be represented at the St. Pat&rsquo;s For All Event on 2 March. </p></reply>

The EU has set out what is required in order for the country to take the next steps to advance on its path towards EU membership. </p><p>  The Minister for European Affairs, Pascal Donohoe, visited Bosnia and Herzegovina at the end of January to express Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for the country and for its efforts to become a member of the Union. During his visit, the Minister encouraged the leaders there to work together to reach agreement on key issues in the interests of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. </p><p>  The Minister made clear that the solutions to these issues must come from within Bosnia and Herzegovina itself. The EU cannot impose remedies from outside. This is a position that the Minister found to be well understood by his interlocutors in Sarajevo. They look, however, to the EU and international community for support. The Minister assured them that Ireland and the EU would continue to provide this support and will continue to follow developments closely. </p><p>  Indeed, at the last EU Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on 10 February, we discussed the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in light of the significant public demonstrations there in the days leading up to the Council.

All are affected by high unemployment, particularly among young people. While they have been hit by the global economic crisis, recovery in the EU should have a positive impact on the region. The European Commission has forecast that the Western Balkans&rsquo; economies should grow by 2% GDP in 2013. This modest recovery is not a guarantee for sustainable growth and convergence, however, and significant challenges remain. The lack of economic growth and job opportunities in some countries has led to public demonstrations recently. </p><p>  The EU, as part of its overall support for the region and for the EU perspective of the Western Balkans, is actively supporting their economic growth and reforms. Our aim is the development of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Western Balkans region. </p><p>  For example, the European Commission is strengthening dialogue on economic governance with the countries of the region this year to help them better prepare for eventual Union membership in terms of economic reform, competitiveness and job creation. This is an initiative that Ireland very much supports. The EU also places the rule of law at the heart of the enlargement process, recognising that this is key for economic development and for creating a favourable business environment and investment climate. </p><p>  As part of our on-going monitoring of the situation in the region, at the last Foreign Affairs Council, on 10 February, we discussed developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina in light of the public demonstrations there in the days preceding the Council. We recalled the importance of that country&rsquo;s leaders working together on important reforms, including economic reforms, in the interests of their peoples and with a view to advancing their country on its EU path. I expect that we will be returning to the subject of Bosnia and Herzegovina at a future Council. </p><p>  We in Ireland also remain fully engaged with the Western Balkans region. My colleague, the Minister for European Affairs, Paschal Donohoe, has recently visited both Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, to express our continued support for their efforts to advance on their respective EU paths.  Both he and I also met with the Foreign Minister of Kosovo when he visited Dublin in January. We discussed the progress that Kosovo has made as well as the challenges that remain and assured him of our on-going support for his country. </p><p>  Together with our EU counterparts, we will remain fully engaged with the region and supportive of the efforts of the countries of the Western Balkans as they undertake the necessary reforms, especially economic reforms, and prepare for EU membership. </p></reply>

Allegations that evidence of war crimes was destroyed is particularly concerning.  The report also makes allegations of human rights abuses by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.</p><p>  In a statement I delivered on behalf of the EU at the twenty-second session of the United Nations Human Rights Council on 27 February 2013, I highlighted concerns regarding the current human rights situation in Sri Lanka, and, in particular, the need for accountability and reconciliation.  In April 2013, Minister of State Joe Costello met with members of the Irish Forum for Peace in Sri Lanka who briefed him on the human rights situation in the country. </p><p>  More recently, at the 24th session of the UNHRC, which took place from 9 &ndash; 27 September 2013, Ireland intervened in the General Debate on human rights situations requiring the Council&rsquo;s attention and expressed its serious concern at abuses in Sri Lanka, including in relation to the treatment of prisoners incarcerated in connection with the conflict, enforced disappearances, torture, and other human rights violations.  Ireland further noted that genuine reconciliation among all groups and communities in Sri Lanka is essential, and requires justice and accountability.</p><p>  At the same session, the European Union also expressed strong concerns regarding the situation of human rights in Sri Lanka and urged the Government of Sri Lanka to implement effectively the recommendations of the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission.  The EU further encouraged the Government of Sri Lanka to fully cooperate with the UN human rights mechanisms and to allow access for all UN special procedures mandate holders.  </p><p>  Ireland, together with our international partners, will continue to take every opportunity, both bilaterally and multilaterally, to urge the Government of Sri Lanka to adhere to its international obligations and respect the human rights of all its citizens, including at the upcoming 25th   Session of the Human Rights Council in March 2014.</p></reply>

I believe that, in addressing human rights concerns, we<font color="#004080"> </font>  must pursue them in the most effective way, taking advantage of the most appropriate opportunities to make our case, privately or publicly, bilaterally or multilaterally, as best fits the situation.</p><p>   A primary approach is to engage with the international human rights machinery which has been established to monitor implementation of universal human rights standards.  As a small state with a limited diplomatic network, Ireland places great value on multilateralism as a platform for raising human rights issue.  This includes engaging actively at the UN Human Rights Council and in the Universal Periodic Review, the principal UN mechanism whereby the human rights record of each individual UN Member State is publicly examined by other Member States.</p><p>   In addition to raising human rights concerns through multilateral channels, Ireland also raises human rights issues in our bilateral contacts.  The conversations are generally conducted on a confidential basis, in line with normal diplomatic practice.  I discuss human rights issues on a regular basis with Foreign Ministers from other countries, including when visiting foreign countries.  I also regularly address human rights issues at Ministerial meetings at the EU level with Foreign Ministers of third countries. </p><p>  Officials in my Department<font color="#004080"> </font>  make Ireland&rsquo;s views on human rights issues clear in their contacts with officials from other governments.  Irish embassies work, within the capacity of their resources and often as part of a coordinated approach, to support the work of human rights defenders and civil society organisations in third countries.  This includes addressing legislative and administrative restrictions on the operation of human rights defenders, drawing on findings by human rights agencies, raising cases with third country governments and contributing to the development of national human rights strategies by the EU.</p><p>  No country is perfect when it comes to human rights<font color="#004080">.  </font>  Ireland&rsquo;s position on the responsibility of each government in relation to the promotion and protection of the human rights of their citizens is quite clear, and none of the countries with which we deal are in any doubt about our views in this regard.</p></reply>

It is set alongside our pro-active engagement in the efforts of the international community to maintain global peace and security, through the UN, the EU and through our bilateral engagement. I see no incompatibility with this approach and the landings of US military aircraft at Shannon Airport, a practice which has taken place under successive Governments for over 50 years. </p><p>  I am unaware of any reports which suggest that Shannon Airport has been used as an &lsquo;advance virtual battle airfield&rsquo;, and there is no evidence to suggest that any person has been subjected to extraordinary rendition through Irish airspace and airports. The Government&rsquo;s complete opposition to extraordinary rendition has been made clear on numerous occasions, and is reflected in the current Programme for Government which states clearly that we &ldquo;will enforce the prohibition of the use of Irish airports and related facilities for purposes not in line with the dictates of international law&rdquo;.  The use of Irish airspace and airports for this practice has not, and will not, be permitted under any circumstances.</p></reply>

We are continuing to follow the situation through our Ambassador in Hanoi, who is accredited to Cambodia, who has been in regular contact with EU colleagues and other partners in Phnom Penh to monitor developments.</p><p>  Successive Irish Governments have actively promoted the protection of human rights as a core element of our foreign policy.  Under the Government&rsquo;s new policy for international development, One World, One Future, we are committed to working to ensure that economic development is compatible with human rights, including the right to decent work.  Our engagement in this area is informed by clear international standards, including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  In this regard, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade currently provides assistance to the International Labour Organisation&rsquo;s programme,  <i>&rsquo;Decent Work Agenda&rsquo;,</i>   through a partnership programme for the period 2012-2015.  This programme seeks to improve the rights and working conditions of workers in industries like the garment sector in countries such as Cambodia.</p><p>  It is clear from reports, including by the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Cambodia, that Cambodian authorities used excessive force against demonstrators early last month, resulting in multiple injuries and fatalities.  I am concerned by these reports, and by the arrests of protestors including several union leaders and human rights defenders  .  We have used recent opportunities, including at the Universal Periodic Review of Cambodia at the Human Rights Council in Geneva in January, to express our concern and to emphasise to the Cambodian authorities that they must respect the right of peaceful assembly.</p><p>  The right of human rights defenders to engage without hindrance, intimidation or harassment should also be respected and protected. While freedom of expression is enshrined in the Cambodian Constitution, recent events have demonstrated that restrictions on freedom of expression persist.</p><p>  Talks to resolve the disputes by garment workers in Cambodia have so far failed to make progress at local level and appear to have reached a political impasse.   It is important now that calm is restored and legitimate grievances are addressed.  We will continue to monitor the situation and to urge, with our partners that these disputes are addressed and resolved through constructive dialogue.</p></reply>

Indeed, the range of security features integrated in the book is unique among passports worldwide.  </p><p>  The issue of a passport is the culmination of a legally-binding process.

The Passport Service continues to balance measures to protect against identity theft on the one hand with maintaining our customer focus.  The application and checking processes have therefore been designed to protect our customers.  I can confirm that new measures were put in place in the last year to improve our processes.  These include changes to staffing structures, enhanced links with other Government Departments and overseas agencies.  I can confirm that these new measures were instrumental in the Passport Service identifying the irregularities that led to the recent launch of the joint Passport Service/An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na investigation.  </p></reply>

As the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, the challenge of how to reach trapped civilians in urgent need of live-saving assistance remains one of most difficult issues. </p><p>  While reaching people under siege is an urgent priority, humanitarian access across the whole country remains exceptionally difficult as a result of increasing disregard by armed groups on all sides of their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. </p><p>  Recent events during the agreed ceasefire in Homs, when UN and Syrian Arab Red Crescent humanitarian teams were deliberately targeted as they worked on the evacuation of people who have been besieged, with little aid, for nearly two years, highlighted the conditions under which humanitarian agencies are working and the ongoing threats to the lives of their personnel.  </p><p>  Ireland welcomes the extension of the ceasefire in Homs and strongly supports the statement last week by UN Under Secretary General and Emergency Relief Co-ordinator Valerie Amos, calling on Security Council members to use their influence on the parties to ensure they abide by humanitarian pauses and ceasefires, give humanitarian actors regular and sustained access, and commit in writing to uphold humanitarian law, and systematic access across lines.  </p><p>  Last month, in Kuwait, at the second international pledging conference for Syria, I pledged a further Irish contribution of &euro;12 million for humanitarian assistance in 2014. This will be disbursed to key UN partners, the Red Cross movement and NGO partners, supporting the provision of life saving humanitarian supplies and essential services such as health, education and protection.  Since the start of the crisis, Ireland has committed to providing more than &euro;26 million for the relief effort in Syria.  We have also provided supplies of non-food items from our emergency relief stocks held in Dubai and specialist emergency personnel under the Rapid Response Initiative.  There has been a huge international effort to provide assistance.  The combined EU pledges in Kuwait amounted to some &euro;550 million.  However, this funding will not have the impact it needs to have if humanitarian agencies continue to be denied access to those in greatest need trapped in areas under siege. </p><p>  Ireland has always argued the need to keep the humanitarian issue at the top of the international agenda while understanding that only a political solution can bring the suffering of the Syrian people to an end.  The ongoing talks in Geneva offer the best hope for a permanent end to the conflict and suffering in Syria.  </p></reply>

With 33 killed, that terrible day saw the highest number of casualties on any single day during the Troubles.  It left a further 300 people injured.    Many families across this island suffered terrible losses during the Troubles, including the Dublin/Monaghan families.  I think of them today and of their ongoing loss.  </p><p>On 11 May 2011, shortly after this Government took office, I met with <i>Justice for the Forgotten, </i>the organization who, as part of the <i>Pat Finucane Centre</i>, provides support for victims of the Troubles in this jurisdiction, including the Dublin and Monaghan bombing families.  The Taoiseach met with them subsequently on 18 July 2013.   Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Department of the Taoiseach officials have met with <i>Justice for the Forgotten</i>   also, most recently on 28 January in Brussels as part of a wider meeting with victims groups and on 31 January in Dublin.  </p><p>  The Taoiseach and I have reiterated our support for the all-party D&aacute;il motions of July 2008 and May 2011 urging the British Government to hand over all original documents in their possession relating to the bombings. </p><p>In a recent publication <i>Lethal Allies</i>, supported by the Pat Finucane Centre, links are alleged between those who carried out the Dublin/Monaghan bombings and those involved in a total of 120 deaths during the Troubles.  These are serious allegations and I have asked to meet with the author of the book, Anne Cadwallader, and with Margaret Urwin of <i>Justice for the Forgotten</i>   next month to discuss them in further detail.</p><p>I am aware that <i>Justice for the Forgotten</i>   addressed the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement on 16 January 2014.  I welcome this and the continued all-party support for their campaign on behalf of the Dublin/Monaghan families.     </p><p>  I have raised the matter of access to information related to the bombings with my ministerial counterparts in the British Government and will continue to do so.  The Taoiseach has done likewise. The Government will continue to pursue the issue at both ministerial and official level.    </p></reply>

This reflects the importance of coherent external action for the pursuit of a number of Government objectives. </p><p>  When I initiated the Review of our Foreign Policy and External Relations in October, I indicated that the whole of Government aspects of our foreign policy will be an important theme. To this end, there has been a broad-based process of consultation, involving Government Departments and State Agencies, to enable Departments to contribute to the Review and to ensure that we take a joined up approach to our foreign policy. I am pleased with the engagement from Departments and Agencies in this process. This is in addition to the regular and ongoing contact between Departments on a broad range of external issues and policy objectives.</p><p>The Government adopted a new policy for International Development, <i>One World One Future</i>  , last May, following a detailed process of consultation including, inter alia, other Government Departments. This Policy, which sets out the vision, goals and priorities for our engagement on international development, will be fully reflected in the outcome of the Review of Foreign Policy and External Relations, in keeping with the importance of international development objectives to other aspects of our foreign policy.</p><p>  The Department of Defence is currently engaged in a consultation process leading to a White Paper on Defence, due to be finalised later this year.  Officials from my Department are in regular contact with the Department of Defence to ensure that we pursue a coherent approach to the issues involved, both in connection with the Review and also on an ongoing basis.  </p><p>  I am confident that these contacts, and the ongoing cooperation across Government, on external relations issues, will ensure that we continue to pursue a coherent, whole of Government approach to the promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s values and interests abroad.</p></reply>

This follows changes to Hungary&rsquo;s Constitution which were approved by the Parliament on   11 March 2013 and which are collectively known as the Fourth Amendment to the Fundamental Law.</p><p>  The latter developments prompted the European Commission to express concern that the amendments to Hungary&rsquo;s Constitution were not compatible with the fundamental values and principles of the EU.  In a joint statement on 11 March 2013, the President of the European Commission and the Secretary General of the Council of Europe noted the approval by the Hungarian Parliament of the changes and expressed regret that experts from the Commission and Council of Europe had not been afforded the opportunity to discuss the amendments with Hungarian officials before final approval. I am on record in the D&aacute;il as expressing Ireland&rsquo;s full support of this joint statement. </p><p>  Moreover,  in its &lsquo;Opinion&rsquo; last June, the Council of Europe&rsquo;s advisory committee on constitutional matters, the Venice Commission, while welcoming language in respect of provision of decent housing and access to public services of the homeless, expressed concern about the new provision in Hungary&rsquo;s Constitution regarding homelessness. The Venice Commission recalled that the Hungarian Constitutional Court had previously struck down a law penalising the homeless for living in public areas and expressed the view that raising such provisions to the level of the Constitution has the effect of preventing future review by the Constitutional Court. </p><p>  While several of the changes brought about by the Fourth Amendment were reversed by the Hungarian Parliament&rsquo;s approval of a Fifth Amendment to the Fundamental Law on 16 September 2013, regrettably the provision regarding homelessness remains intact.</p><p>Ireland would recall that all EU member states have committed to respect the rule of law and protect fundamental   human rights, and to ensure that their national laws comply with EU values. These values are set out in the Treaty and also in the European Convention on Human Rights to which all Member States are party.  I would strongly encourage the Hungarian Government to continue to engage fully with the relevant international bodies to ensure that it meets its obligations as regards respect for democratic principles and the safeguarding of fundamental rights.  </p><p>  I have asked our Embassy in Budapest to keep me informed of developments on this issue.</p></reply>

The provisions relating to civil society organisations were part of a wider package of highly restrictive legislative measures passed by the Ukrainian parliament with little or no debate on 16 January.  The laws were hastily passed in the context of the crisis in Ukraine and were rightly seen as an attempt to stifle the protests.</p><p>The specific changes to the Law on additional measures (Law 721-VII) required NGOs receiving foreign funding and engaging in broadly defined &ldquo;political activities&rdquo; to register as foreign agents or risk closure. The legislation is similar to earlier Russian legislation concerning &ldquo;foreign agents&rdquo; which the Council of Europe described as having a chilling effect on the NGO community in Russia.</p><p>  In an analysis of the Ukrainian measures, the Council of Europe suggested that the aim was not to ensure the financial transparency of NGOs in general but rather to be able to act against NGOs supporting the current protests. The Council of Europe also noted that the label &ldquo;foreign agent&rdquo; is highly derogatory and it is unreasonable to oblige an organisation to assume such a label.</p><p>  At its meeting on 20 January, the Foreign Affairs Council expressed deep concern about the legislation as a whole and noted that it would seriously curtail the actions of civil society organisations.  Following a very strong reaction against the new laws, both domestically and internationally, the Ukrainian parliament took the decision on 28 January to cancel the measures.</p><p>  At its meeting on 10 February, the Foreign Affairs Council welcomed the decision to revoke the laws while noting that further efforts are necessary to find a durable solution to the current political crisis.</p></reply>

IGAD brokered a ceasefire last month and is currently mediating a second round of peace talks focused on resolving political differences between the parties. </p><p>  The EU strongly supports the role being played by IGAD in mediating the ceasefire and peace talks.  IGAD negotiators have been unstinting in their efforts to chart a new political part for South Sudan, and the EU stands ready to assist in practical ways requested by the negotiation team.  The EU, through its Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, is also closely monitoring the peace efforts. </p><p>  In accordance with international humanitarian law, all parties to the conflict have the responsibility to protect civilians.

Ireland, and our EU Partners, welcome the African Union&rsquo;s commitment to establish a Commission of Inquiry to investigate human rights abuses.  The Commission of Inquiry will be an essential part of the process of reconciliation, and I hope that it will be in a position to commence its work shortly. </p><p>  In response to the outbreak of violence, the UN has also strengthened the mandate of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan to ensure the protection of civilians and the strengthening of its human rights investigative capacity. </p></reply>

It has been is severely affected by the consequences of the humanitarian crisis in large parts of the region.  </p><p>Ireland, together with our EU Partners, pursues a strategic and comprehensive approach to the Horn of Africa through the <i>EU Strategic Framework for the Horn of Africa</i>.  This approach encompasses political and diplomatic engagement, development co-operation programming, humanitarian assistance, and support for peacekeeping operations.  EU engagement aims to achieve peace, security and good governance based on the democratic principles of the rule of law and respect for human rights.  The EU actively promotes human rights in the region through its support to human rights NGOs, promotion of women&rsquo;s rights and support for a free and independent media.  The EU has appointed a Special Representative to the Horn of Africa to co-ordinate EU efforts in the region.  </p><p>  Human rights concerns are central to our foreign policy.  Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in countries of the Horn of Africa.  Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU and at the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015.  Ireland supports the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses.  This includes support for the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedure Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. </p></reply>

Many lessons have been learned from previous crises such as the 2004 tsunami and the 2010 Haiti earthquake.  Under the leadership of the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), clear systems have been put in place to ensure the most effective, efficient and rapid delivery of aid possible.  Ireland has been playing our part in ensuring these reforms are implemented, so that responses are timely and effective, and meet the most critical, immediate needs. </p><p>  Two months after the January 2010 Haiti earthquake, an international donor conference was held in New York, at which US $4.5 billion worth of assistance over two years was pledged by the international community in response to the crisis.  UN figures indicate that, by the end of 2012, just $2.38 billion of this had actually been disbursed.  For our part, we worked hard to meet Ireland&rsquo;s commitments to the people of Haiti.  By the end of 2012, our pledge of &euro;13 million had been honoured and exceeded, with support totalling almost &euro;14 million. </p><p>  At the UN in New York in September 2011, the T&aacute;naiste pledged that &euro;10 million in humanitarian assistance would be made available to help the poorest and most vulnerable in the Horn of Africa before the end of 2012.  I am happy to report that this pledge has also been met, with almost &euro;12 million in funding provided by December 2012.  Similarly, at the High-Level International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria in January 2013, I announced a commitment of &euro;4.7 million to support the provision of humanitarian assistance in Syria and neighbouring countries. By the end of 2013, this pledge had been exceeded by over &euro;6.5 million, with a total of &euro;11.3 million in assistance provided throughout the course of the year. Ireland can be very proud of our record on delivery of our pledges.</p><p>  Even though no official pledging conference took place in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan which struck the Philippines in November 2014, according to the UN&rsquo;s Financial Tracking Service, as of 14 February 2014 over US$660 million has been contributed to the response by the international community and a further US$377 million has been pledged but not yet committed. </p><p>  Ireland was one of the first countries to respond to this natural disaster and our contribution to date stands at over &euro;4 million.  The Government also authorised the deployment of a technical mission to explore ways in which Ireland can most effectively contribute to the recovery process.  Further financial assistance in 2014 will be considered on the basis of the recommendations of this technical team&rsquo;s report.</p><p>  In order to promote the importance of ensuring that donor aid pledges are credible, achievable, and properly monitored, the OECD has published a &lsquo;Recommendation on Good Pledging Practice&rsquo;.  This comprises a set of principles relating to pledging practice for financial undertakings to developing countries and is designed to serve as a benchmark to help OECD Member States frame future aid pledges in terms that are clear, practical, realistic, and capable of being monitored.  Ireland strongly supports this OECD initiative and will continue to use all appropriate fora to urge our fellow donors to ensure that they meet their humanitarian commitments in full.</p></reply>

All proposals for funding are rigorously appraised by Irish Aid staff using clear criteria, including quality of intended impact, sustainability, cost effectiveness and efficiency in the use of all resources, including administration costs.   The programmes are subject to regular internal and external monitoring and are evaluated and audited by independent experts, as well as by my Department&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit.  </p><p>  To ensure that our assistance is targeted at those most in need and delivered in the most effective manner we work through a variety of bilateral and other aid delivery channels in partnership with national Governments, local communities, NGOs, and key multilateral partners such as the United Nations. Each of these partners is fully accountable to my Department for all funds received, including those spent on eligible administration costs. </p><p>  In line with best practice and with recommendations from the OECD for improving the accountability of all development financing, Ireland strongly supports the strengthening of partner country capacity and delivery systems.  We provide assistance to national Government oversight institutions, such as the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committees of national Parliaments, to ensure Governments are held to account for the effective expenditure of public funds, including overseas development assistance.  Our management and oversight systems are continually under review to ensure that Irish development funding goes to those most in need, and that we meet the highest standards of accountability.  </p><p>  Providing quality assistance is also about ensuring that we use our aid to strengthen country capacity to deliver sustainable social and economic development. Poverty in many countries is extensive and we know that development assistance alone cannot address all needs.  To achieve a sustainable solution to poverty, countries need to generate their own revenues through increased economic activity based on equitable economic growth, improved employment and better trading opportunities.</p><p>  The approach of leveraging aid for trade is recognised as an effective component of international development.  It is a strategy that is increasingly valued by countries throughout Africa and is a feature of our work across all of our Embassies in Africa.  </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Policy for International Development <i>One World, One Future</i>   recognises the importance of trade for increasing the returns to productive enterprise in developing countries.  This is in line with our Africa Strategy which sets out a comprehensive framework for Ireland&rsquo;s economic, political and development relations with African countries over the coming years and includes strengthened trade, investment, and people-to-people links.  </p></reply>

The Foreign Affairs Council has discussed the situation at each of its meetings since the crisis began in November. Council Conclusions have set out our expectations in the clearest terms including the absolute obligation of the authorities to respect and protect the fundamental rights of the Ukrainian people to association. The Council has stated that a democratic solution must be sought through inclusive dialogue which meets the aspirations of the Ukrainian people.  </p><p>For her part, High Representative Ashton has made several visits to Kiev. I want to take this opportunity to commend her for her tireless efforts on behalf of the EU and indeed the Ukrainian people.  As of now, there have been six EU visits in all since January.  The EU remains committed to Ukraine&rsquo;s political association and economic integration based on respect for common values.    The Union is also ready to continue its efforts with the international community and international financial institutions to assist Ukraine, in line with well-established conditions, to find a sustainable way out of its difficult economic situation.</p><p>The Council of Europe and Organisation Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) are also closely involved in the search for a peaceful and negotiated settlement based on inclusive dialogue.  In that regard, I should mention, in particular, the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Advisory Panel which is to investigate   the violent incidents during the protests.  As I have stated elsewhere, I believe that this panel could be an effective mechanism in helping to defuse tensions.  </p><p>  The situation in Ukraine was discussed at the most recent EU-Russia Summit which took place in Brussels on 28 January.</p></reply>

I have raised the matter in bilateral meetings with the then Prime Minister of Ukraine, Mykola Azarov and Foreign Minister Leonid Kozhara.</p><p>  The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on 30 April 2013, which ruled that Ms Tymoshenko had been unlawfully detained, reinforced the concerns expressed repeatedly by Ireland and its EU partners over her situation.  As the Deputy is aware, High Representative Catherine Ashton and Commissioner Stefan F&uuml;le issued a joint statement in response to the Court&rsquo;s judgment, which urged the Ukrainian authorities to reconsider Ms Tymoshenko&rsquo;s imprisonment and to implement fully all rulings of the ECHR. My full support for this statement is already on record. </p><p>  The EU&rsquo;s position is as set out in the Conclusions of the 10 December 2012 Foreign Affairs Council and in the joint statement of the EU-Ukraine Summit of 25 February 2013: that Ukraine must address convincingly three key areas including the issue of selective justice.  A positive step on Ms Tymoshenko&rsquo;s imprisonment would be extremely helpful and send a powerful signal in that regard. </p><p>  The European Parliament&rsquo;s monitoring mission to Ukraine, which was led by the former President of Poland, Aleksander Kwa&oelig;niewski, and the former President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, engaged actively with the Ukrainian authorities on the issue of selective justice in Ukraine, including Ms Tymoshenko&rsquo;s case. The mission met with her in hospital in Kharkiv frequently during the course of their mission and, in October 2013, called on President Yanukovych to release her for medical treatment on health and humanitarian grounds by way of pardon.</p><p>  Regrettably, a Presidential pardon has not been forthcoming nor was the Ukrainian parliament able to reach agreement on a draft law that would permit Ms Tymoshenko to leave Ukraine for medical treatment.  The unfolding crisis in Ukraine since November may also have affected early prospects for progress.  While many protestors have called for her release, the ongoing tense political situation may perhaps have overshadowed Ms Tymoshenko&rsquo;s particular case.  </p><p>  Nevertheless, together with our EU partners, Ireland will continue to press for progress in addressing the issue of selective justice &ndash; including the individual case of Ms Tymoshenko &ndash; in our bilateral and multilateral contacts with Ukraine. </p></reply>

Talks have proceeded more or less continuously since then.  Ireland and the EU have strongly supported this process, which possibly represents the last chance to achieve a negotiated two-state solution.  EU High Representative Ashton has maintained close contact with US Secretary of State Kerry throughout the process and has regularly briefed EU Foreign Ministers on developments, most recently at the Foreign Affairs Council on 20th January.</p><p>  The United States is understood to be working on framework proposals, to be put to both parties, to focus their engagement on the key issues to be resolved.</p><p>The Foreign Affairs Council adopted Conclusions in December 2013 which expressed the EU&rsquo;s support for the ongoing efforts of the parties, and warned against actions that could undermine the negotiations.   The Council recalled its previous conclusions which laid down its vision for a two-state solution resulting in an agreement on all final status issues, ending all claims, and fulfilling the legitimate aspirations of both parties.  The EU also reiterated its readiness to contribute substantially to post-conflict arrangements for ensuring the sustainability of a peace agreement,   if reached.  A major package of European political, economic and security support to both parties can be expected in the context of a final status agreement.  This includes the offer to Israel and a future state of Palestine of a special privileged partnership with the EU, including increased access to EU markets, facilitation of trade and investment, and enhanced political dialogue and security co-operation.</p><p>  The EU is also convinced of the positive role that countries in the region can also play in advancing the peace process, and remains committed to the on-going dialogue with the Arab States and the strategic importance of the Arab Peace Initiative in this context.</p></reply>

Given the almost complete lack of progress over almost a decade of negotiations, this was a significant and very welcome development. </p><p>According to the agreement, to run for six months with the possibility for this to be renewed, Iran agreed to suspend key aspects of its nuclear programme in return for a limited measure of sanctions relief. The aim is to build confidence on both sides, and provide a window to negotiate a full agreement to settle this issue in the longer term.   Ireland fully supports the path set out in the interim agreement.</p><p>The agreement came into effect on 20 January, at which time an IAEA report showed that Iran had fulfilled its commitment to suspend certain aspects of its nuclear activity, and the EU and US began easing some sanctions, as agreed, in return. Talks between the E3+3 and Iran on securing a lasting comprehensive agreement began on 18 February in Vienna. These negotiations will not be easy, and will require both Iran and the international community to accept compromises. A lasting agreement is achievable, however, and I strongly support their efforts.   </p></reply>

Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world. We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official channels and non-governmental/civil society organisations. Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU or via the positions we take at the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015.  </p><p>  We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses.  This includes support for the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedure Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. The EU regularly makes statements at these bodies on the human rights situations in individual countries and Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.</p><p>  Since March 2006, when the UN Human Rights Council was formed, Ireland has engaged proactively with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism initiated by the Council. The UPR mechanism allows for the review of the domestic human rights records of all 193 UN Member States approximately every four and a half years, based on human rights obligations under UN human rights and other instruments. Any UN Member State can take part in the interactive dialogue (i.e. the actual examination of the State under review) and submit written questions in advance. Ireland was itself examined under the UPR process on 6 October 2011. The process enables UN Member States to raise issues, some of which would have been identified by members of the public and civil society, and to make recommendations about the protection and promotion of human rights in the State concerned.  Ireland has engaged fully with the UPR process and welcomes the open and constructive dialogue associated with it. We have also made numerous interventions during the UPR examination of other states, raising issues of concern such as gender-based violence, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly and the protection of human rights defenders within the State under review.</p><p>  The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law.  In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.  In June 2012 the EU adopted a Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.</p><p>  Ireland and its EU partners have been strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Court&rsquo;s Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.</p><p>  Ireland has also consistently taken the lead in negotiating resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly and in the Human Rights Council on the promotion and protection of human rights defenders, as well as on the implementation of EU Guidelines in relation to human rights defenders in third countries, the aim being to ensure that the latter can operate in an environment free from hindrance and insecurity.</p><p>  Mindful that the risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak, the Government&rsquo;s development cooperation programme, Irish Aid, supports concrete actions designed to promote human rights, including strengthening government systems and in-country human rights institutions (in particular through legal training). Legal aid programmes targeted at victims of human rights abuses are also supported. Irish Aid, the aid programme operated by my Department, has a specific focus on governance in several programme countries.</p><p>  The Government will continue to avail of all the above-mentioned mechanisms and instruments with a view to highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.</p></reply>

Since then the Government of Uganda has refunded in full the &euro;4 million of Irish Aid funds which were misappropriated.</p><p>  Ireland continues to press the Government of Uganda for concerted action following the fraud. To date, 26 Government officials and 31 private firms are being investigated, 6 Government officials are facing trial and 1 conviction has been secured. In total, the Ugandan Director of Public Prosecutions has opened over 100 case files which are being followed closely by our Embassy in Kampala.  In addition, the Office of the Auditor General of Uganda has been conducting follow-on inquiries and audits, with the support of our Embassy in Kampala. While I was in Kampala in December I had a very positive meeting with the Auditor General and his key staff and he outlined clearly his determination to address issues of fraud and corruption in the public domain.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s 2014 country programme in Uganda, which focuses on education, HIV and AIDS, gender-based violence, governance and livelihoods, is built around supporting projects and programmes which operate through trusted non-government systems. In addition, we are continuing to provide direct support to the Office of the Auditor General which uncovered the original fraud at the Office of the Prime Minister.</p><p>  We continue to ensure that strong financial oversight of the aid programme is in place in order that the valuable contribution made by Ireland towards improving the lives of some of the most vulnerable people is maintained, while at the same time providing strong assurance and accountability to the Irish taxpayer.</p></reply>

The Revenue Commissioners have around 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to target and confront non-compliance. These activities include anti-smuggling, audit, assurance checks, debt management, investigations, prosecutions and anti-avoidance.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners attach the highest priority to combating the smuggling of controlled drugs and are committed to playing an active role, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, in working against this criminal activity and those responsible for it.</p><p>  Revenue has primary responsibility for the detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs at points of entry into the State. They maintain an enforcement presence at strategic locations and place particular emphasis on developing an intelligence-based focus at both national and regional level, deploying resources to areas of highest risk. Enforcement strength at particular locations is regularly augmented with additional personnel on a risk-assessment basis, or when particular operations are taking place against illegal activity.</p><p>  Responsibility for controlled drugs interdiction at ports and airports on the West coast is not confined to staff at Sligo and Mayo but is shared among Revenue staff at several locations.  Revenue enforcement officers carry out regular and ongoing monitoring of the coastline, including patrols and physical checks at harbours and piers. This work is supplemented by Revenue's Customs Drug Watch Programme, which incorporates a coastal reporting mechanism. This allows members of the public, maritime and local communities to report, in confidence, suspect or unusual movements at sea or around the coast through a confidential 24/7 free phone facility.</p><p>  Revenue deploys two Customs Cutters, the RCC Suirbh&eacute;ir and the RCC Faire, to patrol the coastline and undertake maritime intelligence gathering duties. These vessels support teams of land-based enforcement officers involved in anti-smuggling duties. The cutters are deployed to cover potential high-risk areas along the coastline.</p><p>  Revenue has two drug detector dog teams based on the western coast, at Sligo and Shannon, which are deployed over the wider geographical area as necessary. Overall, Revenue has 13 detector dogs at its disposal (8 of which are specifically trained in drugs detection) and these dogs can be deployed to any location as required on a risk-assessment basis.</p><p>  Revenue's Customs service works proactively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Naval Service in the fight against drug trafficking as part of the Joint Task Force on Drugs Interdiction.  There is excellent cooperation between these agencies in the sharing of intelligence and the identification and investigation of the criminals involved in the illegal drugs trade.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that Revenue's overall staff numbers have been reduced in recent years in the context of Government policy on civil service numbers. However, the Revenue Commissioners assure me that their enforcement resources have been prioritised and are reinforced as necessary for particular operations.</p><p>  Revenue's work against drugs crime is extensive and multifaceted and is kept under constant review to ensure that it makes the most effective contribution possible to dealing with this societal problem.</p></reply>

It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on an individual property or transaction. The asset was sold by the appointed Receiver after being openly marketed.  What a purchaser does thereafter is a matter for them.</p><p>  On the general social dividend point, Section 10 of the NAMA Act statutorily obliges NAMA to 'obtain the best achievable return for the State' from the management or its acquired loan portfolio. NAMA is obliged to carry out its functions in the context of the overriding commercial objective provided for by Section 10 of the Act and to recover the greatest amount possible for the taxpayer from the sale of loans and properties securing its loans.</p><p>  As part of ensuring this, it is NAMA's clear policy that properties and loans that are for sale are openly marketed.  This ensures a competitive and transparent sales process and the best possible financial returns for the taxpayer.</p><p>  Importantly however, the NAMA Board has committed to giving first refusal to any public authority, including Government departments, State agencies and local authorities, in respect of the purchase of property from NAMA debtors and receivers which may be suitable for their purposes.</p></reply>

Transfers to a BoB may also include AVCs made by the pension scheme member.</p><p>  At the time of the introduction of the AVC access provision, it was indicated at meetings which officials of my Department and the Revenue Commissioners had with pension industry representative bodies that where there was clear evidence that the transfer value to a BoB included AVCs, the individual concerned could avail of the AVC access option in respect of the AVC value in accordance with section 782A TCA.</p><p>  The pre-retirement access to a portion of AVCs which I introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2013 is, by definition, restricted to AVCs. It does not apply to core pension savings. Extending the access provision to BoBs generally, without regard as to whether the BoB includes transfers in respect of AVCs, would be to allow access to such core pension savings. If I was to permit such access in relation BoBs, there would be little rationale argument against extending it to all core pension savings including occupational pension schemes PRSAs and retirement annuity contracts. I am not prepared to go down that road.</p><p>  In my view, it is preferable not to allow early unplanned withdrawals of core pension savings as the inevitable result is to divert savings initially intended to finance retirement to meet other short term financial needs. This clearly poses retirement income adequacy issues and the impact of the early withdrawal of pensions savings on the ultimate value of the pension pot at retirement should not be underestimated.</p><p>  For these reasons, I have no plans to extend the measure beyond AVCs.</p></reply>

The Central Bank may not, however, in every instance be the most appropriate authority to whom the compliant should be made. This will depend on the subject matter of the complaint.</p><p>  Pursuant to Section 33AT of the Central Bank Act 1942, if the Central Bank imposes a monetary penalty in accordance with Section 33AQ or 33AR of the 1942 Act and the prescribed contravention in respect of which the sanction is imposed is an offence under a law of the State, the financial service provider or person concerned in its management is not liable to be prosecuted or punished for the offence under that law.</p><p>  Conversely, the Central Bank may not impose a monetary penalty on a financial service provider, or on a person concerned in the management of the financial service provider, in accordance with Section 33AQ or 33AR, if-</p><p>- the financial service provider or other person has been charged with having committed an offence under a law of the State and has either been found guilty or not guilty of having committed the offence, and</p><p>- the offence involves a prescribed contravention.</p><p>  In this context, it should be noted that, pursuant to Section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942, the Central Bank must report to the appropriate body, including the Garda Siochana, the Revenue Commissioners, the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Competition Authority, any information relevant to that body that leads the Central Bank to suspect that a criminal offence may have been committed by a supervised entity or a supervised entity may have contravened a provision of an Act to which Section 33AK(3)(a)(vi) applies.  In fulfilment of its obligations under Section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942, the Central Bank regularly liaises with other authorities. Also, the Central Bank has, on a number of occasions, publicly announced that it has suspended an on-going investigation under the 1942 Act in circumstances where further pursuing the investigation at the relevant stage risked prejudicing an on-going criminal investigation by the Garda Siochana. </p><p>  The Central Bank is under no obligation to disclose the progress or outcome of an investigation to a complainant or whistleblower. In investigating a matter, the Central Bank is mindful of the rights of third parties, and the need to avoid prejudicing an investigation. Furthermore, the Central Bank is subject to the confidentiality obligations set out in Section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.</p><p>  Part 5 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, Protection for Persons Reporting Breaches, and Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942, the Administrative Sanctions Procedure, are entirely separate and distinct.Where information is received by the Central Bank from a whistleblower, that information is assessed and appropriate action will be taken by the Central Bank on foot of that information.</p></reply>

The Act created a single unitary body - the Central Bank of Ireland - responsible for both central banking and financial regulation.  The new structure replaces the previous related entities, the Central Bank and the Financial Services Authority of Ireland and the Financial Regulator.  The Central Bank Commission was established by the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 and is responsible for ensuring that the statutory functions of the Central Bank are properly discharged.  The Central Bank is now organised into directorates which report to the Deputy Governor (Central Banking), the Deputy Governor (Financial Regulation) or the Chief Operations Officer. The Central Bank Reform Act commenced on 1 October 2010. </p><p>  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 further strengthened the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.  The 2013 Act also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and underpins the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice.</p><p>  In 2012, the Central Bank published its three-year Strategic Plan for the period 2013-2015 which sets out a strategy of assertive risk-based supervision, underpinned by a credible threat of enforcement, in order to deliver on its key strategic priorities over the coming years.  The Central Bank intends that reform of its regulatory and supervisory framework will be deepened over the term of the plan to minimise future risks to financial stability and enhance consumer protection, while continuing to promote a better functioning financial sector.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the reforms introduced in recent years have brought our regulatory system into line with international best practice.  A number of further changes are being introduced as part of the wider EU reform agenda - which was advanced significantly under the Irish EU Presidency - and it will be necessary to review the need for future changes on an ongoing basis to take account of emerging best practice in regulation and to keep pace with developments in the modern financial services sector.</p></reply>

In that regard, subsection (2)(b) of that section provides for a deduction in respect of any rate levied by a local authority while subsection 2(d) provides for a deduction for the cost of management of a premises.</p><p>  Local Property Tax (LPT) is not such a rate and nor does it constitute a cost or expense of management.  Rather, it is a tax arising from ownership of a property that is payable regardless of whether the property is let or not. </p><p>  As indicated in replies to previous Parliamentary Questions, I have accepted in principle the recommendation in the Thornhill report that LPT should be a deductible expense in calculating a landlord's taxable rental income and that this deduction be phased in over a number of years with the start date being determined by the economic and budgetary situation.  However, the manner and timing of this change has not yet been considered and will require a change to section 97 of the TCA 1997.</p></reply>

While the issue of fee rates payable by students is a matter for the higher education institutions I have requested that the Higher Education Authority liaise with the sector in order to establish and report on the practices currently operated by individual institutions and to seek to agree a common approach across the sector.  This review is also intended to examine the issue of Irish students who have been living abroad and intend returning to Ireland to study at third level.  It is hoped that, following this review, revised fee arrangements which will have clear and consistent criteria can be agreed, and will be in place for the next academic year.</p></reply>

The staffing arrangements for the 2014/15 school year (Circular 0007/2014) were published recently.As the teaching allocation to schools, including legacy posts, is enrolment based, it is this which determines whether schools gain or lose teaching posts from year to year.

In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or on the basis of some other criterion. The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in June 2011, I announced the need for the establishment of 20 new primary schools to cater for increased demographics across a number of locations up to 2017, including the Sandymount/ Ringsend area in Dublin 2/4.

The design team will then complete its stage 2(b) report which will be submitted to the Department for review. Assuming no issues arise, the project will then be authorised to proceed to tender and construction.

Two further rounds of negotiations took place in November and December 2013 while the fourth round of negotiations is scheduled to take place in Brussels during week commencing 10 March 2014.  Because of the huge potential importance of the Partnership to the transatlantic economy and the extent of preparatory work undertaken before launching the process, negotiations are taking place at a relatively fast pace.  A political stocktaking meeting between the principal negotiators, Commissioner Karel de Gucht and United States Trade Representative Mr. Michael Froman, took place on 17 and 18  February. This meeting looked at all issues across the negotiating agenda and discussed the best means to keep the negotiations moving forward with the pace and energy that both sides have demonstrated to date.    </p><p>  The negotiations with the United States are aimed at eliminating tariffs, improving market access to the EU and U.S. markets for both parties by agreements on trade in services and investment, improving opportunities for businesses to win contracts in the extensive public procurement markets on both sides and enhancing regulatory co-operation, coherence and development to ensure existing high quality regulations are maintained but the regulatory burden on business is eased where possible. </p><p>  Impact assessment studies undertaken by the EU Commission suggest that as much as 80% of the long term gains from the TTIP will be achieved by changes to regulatory practices, such as the range of technical standards that apply to products sold in both the EU and the US.  As most of the potential gains from TTIP will arise from regulatory convergence and mutual recognition of each parties regulatory regimes, companies and especially SME&rsquo;s will benefit from lower regulatory compliance costs. All of this will provide significant opportunities for Irish businesses to increase their access to the US market and at lower costs, as well as reducing the costs of goods that companies here buy from the US as part of their global supply chains / manufacturing activity or as goods for consumer use.   </p><p>  The EU and the US already have very strong trading and investment ties. The conclusion of a Trade and Investment Agreement with the US would have a significant and positive impact on trade, resulting in new markets for Irish exporters and bringing positive effects on job creation and competitiveness. A comprehensive deal on areas such as common regulatory standards and investment rules holds massive potential for economic growth and jobs which it is estimated could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum and help create approximately 400,000 jobs in the EU. The scale of benefits can be judged from estimates that the agreement could boost the EU economy by &euro;120 billion, that of the US by &euro;90billion and that of the rest of the world by &euro;100 billion.</p><p>  From the outset my Department has encouraged the Commission to seek the most ambitious programme of tariff reductions possible. This is because of the impact on both the costs of doing business in Ireland and the wider competitiveness and consumer benefits. While current tariffs are already low on trade, even low tariffs can act as a tax on trade that in reality serves little or no purpose. </p><p>  At the same time we are seeking progress on deeper and more intense co-operation among regulators so that the onerous costs business face in duplicative regulatory compliance work on both sides of the Atlantic can be minimised or removed. The agreement will not bring about regulatory change which would lower the high quality standards our citizens and consumers have come to expect from the EU. I am committed to having a regulatory regime that ensures the most effective application and protection for EU citizens. Both I and other EU Ministers made this clear during negotiations last June on the Council&rsquo;s negotiating mandate to the Commission on TTIP. </p><p>  It also has to be acknowledged that because of the scale and importance of this agreement, a number of confidence building measures on both sides were linked to getting the talks underway last year. One of these was the lifting of the US ban on imports of Irish beef, again an area that I spoke to the Commissioner about on a number of occasions. I am pleased that the US has published proposals to open its market to Irish beef exports and that work is advancing on the essential veterinarian procedures to be agreed to enable trade to start. However, I would not be supportive of radical changes that would disproportionately affect the sensitive agriculture sectors of the EU economy and I have made these points directly and personally to the Commissioner.</p><p>  In addition to coordinating the interests of other Departments, enterprise development agencies and business associations, to promote our strategic interests as the TTIP negotiations develop, my Department recently engaged international expertise to examine the economic and other impacts TTIP and related potential opportunities. The focus of this study will be to identify key areas and sectors of the economy that will be impacted by the TTIP. This work will help to inform our input to the Commission&rsquo;s negotiating position and to identify appropriate policy responses to be deployed to maximise the potential of this historic agreement and provide an assessment of the longer term implications for enterprise policy.</p></reply>

Wicklow employing 2,443 people.  IDA Ireland has strong relationships with these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.  Wicklow is part of the East Region together with the counties Dublin, Kildare and Meath.  The region as a whole has been particularly successful in attracting FDI with 623 IDA supported companies employing 80,152 people in the region.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland currently have 177 client companies in Co. Wicklow employing in excess of 3,300 people.  In 2013 Enterprise Ireland paid over &euro;2 million to clients based in Co. Wicklow.  To date in 2014 over &euro;23,000 has been paid to County Wicklow based companies by the Agency.</p><p>  The Agency have assured me that they will continue to support new High Potential Start-Ups in County Wicklow in 2014 as well as continuing to support their established clients using the various programmes under their remit.</p><p>  A core focus for Enterprise Ireland is to support the internationalisation of indigenous companies in County Wicklow.  This involves working with both existing clients and new companies on a one to one confidential basis and on a group basis to help them grow internationally.</p><p>  There are many complex factors influencing investor location decision-making such as the increasing preference of investors globally for cities of scale with 1 million plus population, significant challenges from lower cost locations in the UK and Eastern Europe and attractive regional aid.</p><p>  In order to address the lack of investment in certain regional locations, I have requested IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to work with my Department so that we can explore what further initiatives we can take to ensure we have a better approach to enterprise development in regional locations. This exercise will complement the in-depth analysis of our FDI strategy which is currently being undertaken. This analysis, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, the changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that will be introduced in 2014 and our approach to regional development will inform the formulation of an appropriate FDI strategy from 2015 onwards.</p><p>  Last year the Department of Finance produced improved employment forecasts for 2014.  We have now moved from a situation where the private sector was losing over 7,000 jobs per month before this Government came to office, to the present situation where it is creating 5,000 jobs per month.</p><p>  While these are very encouraging signs for the economy, we must continue to build on this progress and support further job creation.  The 2014 Action Plan for jobs is due to be published shortly.  This year&rsquo;s Plan will build on the success of 2012 and 2013 and will once again set out a series of ambitious commitments on the part of the Government to support job creation and retention.</p></reply>

There is no doubt that the members will be scrupulous in completing their work in a totally impartial manner, in accordance with the terms of reference, and free from any influence from interested parties, whether EirGrid or otherwise.  The outputs from the two studies, which will be required to be complete, objective and comparable, will be published before proceeding to the next stage of public consultation on the two projects.  The two studies will take account of environmental (including visual amenity) impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors.  The Independent Expert Panel will have power to commission its own work if there is any perceived deficiency in the studies presented.</p><p>  I met with the Chair of the Panel on 31 January 2014.  I also met briefly with the full Panel on 10 February 2014 prior to the start of its first meeting to thank the members for undertaking the work.  The Panel has now commenced its deliberations including settling the terms of reference to oversee the integrity of the process now being put into place.

The estimated costs of damage caused by the storms between 13 December 2013 and 6 January 2014 of &euro;61.472 m, plus other costs estimated at &euro;10 m, while substantial in the context of the local impact, are well below the non-negotiable GNI threshold of 0.6% (&euro;770m in the case of Ireland) of the Solidarity Fund.

The Programme is administered directly by the European Commission with funding allocated to projects on merit in accordance with established criteria and following a rigorous assessment process.  The table shows that in the period 2007 to 2012 seven Irish projects out of twenty one submitted qualified for funding under LIFE+, resulting in an aggregate EU contribution of almost &euro;8.5 million.   Anecdotally, we understand that this success rate is broadly similar to the average achieved across all Member States.</p><p><b>Irish applications under LIFE+ Programme 2007-2013</b><table><tr><th>Year </th><th>No. of applications submitted </th><th>No. of successful applications </th><th>Total Budget (successful applications) </th><th>EU Contribution <br /><br /><br /><br /></th></tr><tr><td>2007 </td><td>3 </td><td>2 </td><td>&euro;3,266,640 </td><td>&euro;1,652,804 <br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>2008 </td><td>3 </td><td>0 </td><td>- </td><td>- <br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>2009 </td><td>5 </td><td>2 </td><td>&euro;4,147,154 </td><td>&euro;2,226,447 <br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>&euro;3,157,910 </td><td>&euro;1,562,672 <br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>4 </td><td>1 </td><td>&euro;2,225,205 </td><td>&euro;1,108,872 <br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>4 </td><td>1 </td><td>&euro;2,597,685 </td><td>&euro;1,941,188 <br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>13 <br /><br /></td><td>N/A </td><td>N/A </td><td>N/A </td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Total </td><td><br /><br />34 </td><td><br /><br />7 </td><td><br /><br />&euro;15,394,594 </td><td><br /><br />&euro;8,491,983 <br /><br /></td></tr></table>Applications submitted under the 2013 call for proposals are still being assessed by the European Commission. Thirteen Irish applications were submitted under that call, with three of these reaching the final stage of the award process. This significant increase in Irish applications is due partly to a concerted effort by my Department in recent years to raise awareness of the programme and to provide practical support to project applicants. A final decision on the successful applicants under the 2013 call will be made in April.   </p><p>  For the duration of the LIFE+ Programme, Ireland has had an annual national allocation of some &euro;4 million for which matching funding is required. The aim of national allocations, which are based on criteria set out in the LIFE+ Regulation, is to ensure a proportionate distribution of projects throughout Member States.   In its <i>Mid-term Review of the LIFE+ Regulation</i> for the period 2007-2009, the European Commission noted Ireland&rsquo;s percentage use of its national allocation to be 41%.  Similarly, the majority of other Member States failed to draw down their full national allocation in that period.  The Mid-term Review also noted that the greatest number of applications was received from Italy, Spain and Germany, with the total amount awarded to beneficiaries in these Member States totalling some &euro;98 million in 2008, almost half of the total LIFE+ budget available in that year.  A full database of successful LIFE+ applications is available on the European Commission&rsquo;s website at.</p></reply>

For example, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on the arrangements for local authority financing. In addition, under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, the Minister for Finance, from 2014 onwards, is to pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this will contribute to a range of financial supports being provided to local authorities, including General Purpose Grants and funding, on the basis of Service Level Agreements, for water services which local authorities will be providing on behalf of Irish Water. </p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised. Given the significant changes to local government financing already taking place in 2014, as outlined above, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015. This approach allows maximum flexibility in allocating Local Property Tax proceeds in 2014, particularly in terms of General Purpose Grants, with a priority to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases. </p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates.

This power will be available to local authorities effective from 2015, as the relevant sections of the Act will come into operation on 1 July 2014. Section 20 of the Act requires that, in varying the rate, a local authority must take account of its financial position, its income and expenditure, and of the financial effect of the varied rate on the economy of its functional area, including on those persons who will be liable to pay the Local Property Tax. Section 20 also provides that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government may make regulations, including in respect of public consultation requirements prior to the variation of the rate of the Tax.

These requirements flow directly from the requirement for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact established under the Maastricht Treaty, and the associated limitation on budget deficits.  The local government sector must not impact negatively on the General Government Balance (GGB) in any one year.  In order to stay within the overall GGB limit, it is necessary for local authorities to maintain both their current and capital accounts broadly in balance. The only restriction on local authorities is that, in aggregate, capital income equals capital expenditure in the year.  Balance is only required at an overall level and this allows considerable scope for authorities to draw on their existing capital reserves as an element of their overall investment programme.  The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s <i>Action Programme for Effective Local Government</i> sets out Government policy decisions in relation to a range of local government reform measures including a more effective, coherent and comprehensive system of sub-county municipal governance, encompassing both urban and rural areas, to strengthen local government within counties and address weaknesses and anomalies in the current system.  The Local Government Reform Act 2014 provides the legislative basis for the structural reforms set out in the Action Programme.  The Act provides that the local authority for a county will become the successor authority, for all purposes, of each town council in the county.  Section 13 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides that any moneys accruing to a housing authority from the sale of dwellings to tenants, etc., shall be placed in a separate account and, with the Minister&rsquo;s approval, may be used for the provision of housing or for the refurbishment or maintenance of existing housing, or any other related purposes.  Responsibility for this account and other assets of town councils will rest with the successor authority in each case.  It is a matter for every local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources within the GGB limits as set out.</p></reply>

The new regulations are necessary following the widespread instances of failure by owners, designers and builders to comply with their statutory obligations under the Building Control Act 1990 to design and construct buildings in accordance with the building regulations. Arrangements for a smooth transition to the new regulatory environment on 1 March 2014 are well in hand and my Department will continue to work with all parties to ensure they understand their obligations and the steps necessary to meet them.</p><p>  As regards the issue of third party certification, it is not clear what useful purpose would be served by imposing a requirement for independent verification of design or construction by a third party as suggested.  The merits of a designer overseeing the implementation of their design cannot be overlooked.  Neither is there any intention to constrain the capacity of all-in service delivery models in key sectors of the industry.  Enforcement powers under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2007 continue to be vested in the local building control authorities and it is here that independence is called for and in place.</p><p>  Part D of the Building Regulations deals with Materials and Workmanship.  It stipulates that all works are to be carried out with proper materials and in a workmanlike manner.  Proper materials are defined as being materials which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.  Construction professionals who undertake the role of lead designer or assigned certifier and builders will in accordance with S.I. No. 9 of 2014 be required to demonstrate by lodgement of documentation and to certify that compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations, which includes the Part D requirements, has been met.</p><p>  As part of the wider reform of building control arrangements I have undertaken to explore the potential for latent defects insurance on construction projects as an ultimate recourse for consumers.  The professionalism and accountability that the new arrangements under S.I. No. 9 of 2014 will bring to bear should lead to improved quality and reduce risk within the construction sector.  This will in turn lead to market conditions more conducive to insurers and a wider availability and use of latent defects insurance. In that sense better regulation and insurability go hand in hand.</p></reply>

In a minority of cases, for example, where visa required nationals wish to migrate for periods of less than six months, a work permit may not be required but the person must apply for, and be granted, a visa. There is no cap on the number of visas that may be granted.</p><p>  The issue and renewal of work permits is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. Where a person is granted a work permit and requires a visa in order to come to Ireland to take up employment, the matter is expedited by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service subject to normal immigration controls. Re-entry visas are issued to visa required work permit holders who wish to leave the State for short periods for business or personal reasons.</p><p>  It is not possible to show separately figures solely for visas for the purpose of employment as data relating to employment visas are aggregated with a number of other categories such as short term business, conference and business permission visas, visas for medical professionals and event/performance visas.  </p></reply>

The conviction-free "waiting period" before a conviction becomes spent ranges from 2 to 5 years depending on the sentence imposed.

The exceptions to this are contained in the Heads relating to assisted reproduction and surrogacy. I propose to give retrospective effect to provisions allowing the establishment of legal parentage by the couple jointly raising a child, subject to the outcome of the consultation by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and to further detailed legal advices.  Thus, for example, where a child is born to a couple using donor gametes, the couple would be able jointly to establish parentage of the child retrospectively, subject to the conditions set out in the Bill. This is to secure the child's rights in relation to the family in which he or she is being raised and to provide protection for all parties concerned. </p><p>  It is difficult to see how the new obligations which the General Scheme proposes to establish (such as in relation to maintenance) could be made retrospective fairly.  Likewise, it might not be appropriate to give retrospective effect to proposed changes to who is automatically considered a guardian, as this could give rise to substantial legal uncertainty. </p><p>  The consultation process commenced by the Joint Oireachtas Committee will afford an opportunity to civil society and interested parties to make known their views and concerns on the General Scheme, including in relation to the question of retrospection.</p></reply>

I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to Paragraph 2.31 of that Agreement which provides &ldquo;that in order to address the imbalance between those who entered the Public Service since 2011 and those who entered before that date, revised incremental salary scales shall be prepared for same grade entrants to each public service sector as necessary to incorporate the revision of salary scales introduced by Government Decision in January 2011.&rdquo;</p><p>  Following discussions with Public Sector Unions the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform has recently issued guidelines on incorporating the 01 January 2011 and 01 January 2010 public service recruitment pay scales. I can advise that my Department is currently examining the application of those guidelines to the pay structures applicable in the Defence Forces. </p><p>  It is hoped to be in a position to discuss the practical applicability of the guidelines with the Defence Forces Representative Associations in the next number of weeks and to then finalise the technical work to give effect to the revised incorporated scales. I wish to assure the Deputy that everything is being done to progress this work in an efficient and effective fashion and that no member of the Defence Forces will suffer any financial loss arising out of the implementation of this element of the Haddington Road Agreement.</p></reply>

Given the elapse of so many years, and the possible unreliability and incompleteness of contemporary records, the process of assessing eligibility for such a medal in individual cases for this period would be highly problematic.</p><p>  Against this backdrop, the Military authorities have advised that they have no plans to review the position with regard to creating a service medal for the period of the Civil War. In doing so the Military authorities have, however, made it clear that this decision should not be interpreted as diminishing in any way whatsoever, the service rendered by and the admirable personal motivation of the individuals who served during this difficult period of the country&rsquo;s history.</p></reply>

This access is administered through Administrative Instruction A8 for serving members.

Consequently, these records will only be released to persons authorised under the Acts to receive them. This would normally be the closest living relative but this may not always be the case.

The involvement of the Defence Forces arises from requests for assistance received from such Agencies in its Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) role under the multi-agency Framework. At National level, representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning by both my Department and the Defence Forces ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency. The Defence Forces are also represented on the eight Regional Working Groups that have been established under the Framework and, on an ongoing basis, designated members of the Defence Forces, based around the country, act as Liaison Officers to Local Authorities.  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is available for deployment in response to emergencies and crises. </p><p>  Since the onset of the latest period of stormy weather, the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps were placed on standby to respond to requests for support received from the Principal Response Agencies.  The Defence Forces provided assistance on a number of occasions including, for example, when fifty personnel and a number of high wheeled trucks were deployed over a two day period earlier this month to assist with the evacuation of people in Limerick and in the provision of supplies to homeowners in the affected areas. </p><p>  Civil Defence, which comes under the remit of my Department, was also actively involved in dealing with the effects of the recent severe weather. To date over 500 volunteers from 20 Civil Defence Units across the country have been supporting the efforts of local authorities, the HSE and the Gardai in alleviating the effects of the severe weather on local populations . They have been engaged in a wide range of activities including water pumping, evacuating homes, sandbagging, traffic control, transportation of HSE community outreach personnel and the delivery of supplies to isolated homes.</p><p>  The Department, the Defence Forces and Civil Defence attended all the National Co-ordination meetings held in support of this latest severe weather episode. They are in close liaison with the Principal Response Agencies to determine the assistance that may be sought from the Defence Forces and from Civil Defence.</p></reply>

All existing entitlements expire on the 31 December 2014 and a new set of entitlements will be allocated in 2015 to those who are eligible to participate in the new Basic Payment Scheme. </p><p>  Under the new Regulation, Ireland will implement:</p><p> - The Basic Payment Scheme</p><p> - Greening</p><p> - Young Farmers Scheme</p><p> - Coupled Support for Protein Crops</p><p>  In addition, Ireland will establish a National Reserve which will allocate entitlements to eligible persons under the Basic Payment Scheme. </p><p>  The payment that a farmer receives under the new Direct Payment system is no longer a &lsquo;single payment&rsquo; but will be a combination of payments arising from at least two schemes, the Basic Payment Scheme and Greening. Farmers who qualify as &lsquo;young farmers&rsquo; will also receive a payment under the Young Farmers Scheme.</p><p>  To participate in the Basic Payment Scheme and related schemes a person must be an &lsquo;active farmer&rsquo; as defined in the Direct Payment Regulation.</p><p>  Any farmer who received a direct payment in 2013 (Single Payment, Grassland Sheep Scheme, Burren Life Scheme, Beef Data Scheme) is automatically eligible to receive an allocation of entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015. Ireland will also allocate entitlements to farmers who never held entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme, either owned or leased, but who were actively farming in 2013. </p><p>The number   of entitlements that will be allocated to a farmer under the new Basic Payment Scheme will be based on the number of eligible hectares the farmer declares in 2013 and 2015, whichever is less. </p><p>The value   of entitlements that will be allocated to a farmer in 2015 will be based on a percentage of the value held by the farmer in 2014. As of yet it has not been decided whether the &lsquo;value&rsquo; will be based on the total value of &lsquo;entitlements&rsquo; held by a farmer in 2014 or on the value of the &lsquo;payments&rsquo; received by a farmer in 2014. Similarly the status of &lsquo;leased entitlements&rsquo; remains the subject of negotiation at EU level.</p><p>  All entitlements held under the Basic Payment Scheme are subject to convergence whereby low value entitlements will be increased while high value entitlements will be reduced over the five years of the Scheme. All entitlements must reach a minimum entitlement value of 60% of the national average entitlement value by 2019.</p><p>  To qualify for participation in the Young Farmers Scheme, a farmer must be aged no more than 40 years of age in the year when s/he first submits an application under the Basic Payment Scheme, be setting up an agricultural holding for the first time or has set up such a holding during the five years preceding the first submission of the Basic Payment Scheme application and have successfully completed a recognised course of education in agriculture giving rise to an award at FETAC level 6 or its equivalent. </p><p>I have recently established the 2015 Direct Payments Information Centre which any member of the farming community may contact at 0761 064438 or  to discuss their individual circumstances in more detail.</p></reply>

The three children detention schools in the State are located in Oberstown, Lusk, Co Dublin and comprise Trinity House School, Oberstown Boys School and Oberstown Girls School, all of which are located in Oberstown, Lusk, Co Dublin.  Both Trinity House School and Oberstown Boys School are responsible for detention of males up to the age of 17 years.  Oberstown Girls School provides detention places for females up to the age of 18 years.  </p><p>  The average cost per annum of each detention place in Oberstown is estimated by averaging out the number of detention places available over the combined pay and non pay costs of the children detention schools in each year in question.  This results in the following costs:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Annual cost of detention place</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;298,000</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;332,000</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;314,000</td></tr></table> `</p><p>  It should be noted that the emphasis on individual care, education and rehabilitation in the child care model of detention in Oberstown results in staffing costs that are significantly in excess of comparable costs for places in the adult prison system. This is reflected in the annual cost estimates listed above.</p></reply>

Under the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002, as amended, the HSE may charge a fee as may be determined by the Minister for Health.  To date this has been a once off fee of &euro;50.  </p><p><i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>, Ireland&rsquo;s tobacco control policy, sets out recommendations for the future regulation of the tobacco retail environment. The Government proposes to increase the Retail Register fee during 2014, in the context of legislation to provide for the licensing of the sale of tobacco products as outlined in <i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>  . Work is ongoing in relation to this legislation, and as such details are not yet available. </p></reply>

A key component is the improved management of people with asthma in primary care, thereby, avoiding emergency attendance at General Practitioner (GP) out-of-hours services, at hospital emergency departments and in-patient admission services. </p><p>  The initial focus of the work of the NCPA has been primarily on:</p><p>  - The development and implementation of national asthma guidelines based on international best practice for acute and ongoing asthma management and national asthma education initiatives for patients and health care professionals; and</p><p>  - The organisation and better integration of national asthma services at primary and secondary care levels through the development of a national model of care.</p><p>  The acute adult and paediatric asthma guidelines and associated care pathways, treatment protocols and care bundles have now been developed for use in primary and secondary care settings.  The Adult and Paediatric Emergency Asthma Guidelines are both available on the HSE website at .</p><p>  The NCPA has also worked with the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) in the development of &quot;<i>Asthma Control in General Practice</i>&quot;, which is a guideline for managing a patient with asthma in primary care.  This document is available on the ICGP website at .</p><p>  Up to date information is available for patients and their families and carers.  Easily accessible patient asthma education supports have been implemented, in conjunction with the NCPA's key stakeholder, the Asthma Society of Ireland (ASI), to assist guided self management for this chronic condition.  These are available on both the HSE and ASI websites.</p><p>  A self-learning asthma E-Learning 6 modular theoretical programme, based on the national evidence based guidelines and developed by the NCPA in conjunction with the ASI, is also freely available on both the HSE and ASI websites for any health care professionals who wish to update their knowledge.  This will enable health care professionals to underpin their skill sets with theory.  There is also a similar programme available for GPs on the ICGP website.</p><p>  In addition, a practical workshop is being delivered by the respiratory Clinical Nurse Specialists for staff in primary and secondary care.  This education programme will continue throughout 2014.</p><p>  The NCPA has developed a National Model of Care (MOC) for Asthma, which details how physicians, nurses and other health care professionals will work with engaged patients to make the clinical decisions most appropriate to the patient's circumstances, while collaborating with specialist colleagues in providing a safe, seamless patient experience within the health system in Ireland.  The Model of Care is currently at final stages of approval.</p><p>  Implementation of the National Clinical Programme for Asthma is ongoing and will continue in 2014.</p></reply>

In particular, the Programme proposes to change the way care is delivered to people with Type 2 Diabetes and to support a National Model of Integrated Care.  The Model, which is evidence based and clinically acceptable, is the result of an extensive consultation process and agreed by the relevant stakeholders.  The aim is to facilitate the structured care of patients with uncomplicated Type 2 Diabetes in the Primary Care setting only while patients with complicated Type 2 Diabetes will be managed by primary and secondary care services.</p><p>  The Diabetic Retinopathy screening and treatment initiative commenced in 2013 and was successful in inviting 30% of registered patients with diabetes for screening, as planned.  In 2014, it is proposed to screen the remaining 70% of the diabetic population, as set out in the HSE's National Service Plan 2014.  This screening is being carried out through the National Cancer Control Programme Office.</p><p>  A National Model of Care for Type 2 Diabetes has been developed with the joint involvement of health care providers in primary, secondary and tertiary care sectors.  The focus of the Model is the concept of &quot;Integrated Care&quot;, where all health care providers come together to communicate effectively and coherently to manage a person with Type 2 Diabetes.</p><p>  In summary, the Model recommends that:</p><p>  - People with uncomplicated Type 2 Diabetes will be under the governance of their General Practitioner (GP), with the support of a multidisciplinary community based team and have a clearly defined pathway of care, and will be seen three times a year in a primary care setting.</p><p>  - People with complicated Type 2 Diabetes will be under the governance of both their GP and a consultant endocrinologist in a secondary or tertiary care setting.</p><p>  - People with Type 1 Diabetes or complex genetic or secondary causes of diabetes will have their diabetes related care under the governance of the consultant-led diabetes multidisciplinary team in a secondary or tertiary care setting.</p><p>  As part of the phased roll out of the National Integrated Care Diabetes Programme and to support the Model of Care, the Government approved funding for the appointment of 17 Integrated Care Diabetes Nurse Specialists (one per HSE Integrated Service Area).  These Diabetes Nurse Specialists will play a key role in the development of clinically sound collaborative links between primary care and secondary care providers and will also be an essential resource in empowering patients to achieve optimum diabetes control.  To date, 16 of these posts have been filled or have start dates agreed and the remaining post will be filled as soon as possible in 2014.</p></reply>

The primary care infrastructure model offers a good fit for public private financing.</p><p>  In addition to the locations' ranks as a result of the prioritisation exercise, the mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care infrastructure, including those to be delivered by the operational lease mechanism, is dependent on a number of factors including GP participation.     GP commitment to sharing accommodation with HSE staff and delivering health care services from these facilities is essential for primary care centre delivery.   Therefore locations cannot proceed unless GPs are prepared to engage in the process.</p><p>  Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care centres are also subject to suitable locations being offered/provided/available and to successful planning processes.  In addition the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to sufficient financing.   Delivery of primary care infrastructure is a dynamic exercise, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementation.</p><p>  As with all capital projects this programme must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.   There will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer.    There is limited funding available for new projects over the period 2014-2018 given the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place.   Nevertheless, where possible, the HSE's capital programme will include provision to progress primary care centres with the highest ranking following the 2012 national prioritisation exercise by direct/own-build in the event that other delivery mechanisms are not feasible. </p></reply>

The draft contract is available for review on the HSE website and the closing date for receipt by the HSE of written submissions is 21<sup>st</sup> February 2014.</p><p>  This is the first public consultation of its kind. I welcome all views on the type of service to be delivered to children under this new arrangement and look forward to the results of the consultation process.</p><p>  With reference to the specific clause in the draft contract to which Deputy Kelleher refers (Clause 28.4.4), it is intended to reflect and be protective of the HSE's interests given that the primary statutory obligations to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services will rest with the HSE.  It is not in any sense intended to impose unwarranted or inappropriate restrictions on individual GP contractors in advocating on behalf of their patients.</p><p>  A similar clause can be found in the form of agreement with Clinical Dental Technicians, which was introduced in 2011.  The clause in question should be viewed in the context of the entire draft document, where the intent is to balance the duties, obligations and rights of both parties, while at the same time, having due regard to the overriding statutory obligations that will rest with the HSE.</p><p>  I will be pleased to discuss this, and all other provisions contained in the draft contract, with a view to resolving any concerns which the GPs or their representatives may have.</p><p>In relation to Deputy Kelleher's question on reference to the Medical Practitioners Act, 2007, the Act is referred to in &quot;<i>Clause 1 Definitions and Interpretation</i>&quot; of the draft contract, in the context of the definition of &quot;<i>Service Provider</i>&quot;.There are further references throughout the draft contract to the Irish Medical Council as the relevant competent regulatory body under the Medical Practitioners Act, 2007.</p><p>  I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate that the document which has been put out for consultation is a <i>draft</i>. I have no doubt that there will be changes to the text following the consultation process. In particular, it is my intention to meet with the ICGP, the IMO and the NAGP in the coming weeks for detailed discussions on the scope and content of the draft contract. This will afford them the fullest opportunity to raise any and all issues which they may have regarding the draft contact and indeed, to make their own proposals as to how it may be improved.</p></reply>
