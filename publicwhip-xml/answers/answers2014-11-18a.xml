    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-18a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014111800053#WRA00700"><p>The first thing I want to emphasise is that I as Minister for Justice and Equality have no role in relation to prosecutions or decisions whether or not to initiate a prosecution.<br/><br/>In May 2013, the Garda S&iacute;ochana Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) made a Report to my predecessor under Section 80(5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 following its investigation into allegations of collusion between an individual and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br/><br/>In its letter accompanying the report GSOC stated that a file relating to its public interest investigation was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Having considered the file the DPP advised that the file did not warrant prosecution of any individual. Thereafter GSOC considered and decided against launching any investigation of matters which may constitute indiscipline.<br/><br/>The Report by GSOC also contained a series of recommendations related to informant handling procedures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, oversight of those procedures, as well as intelligence handling and information exchange between GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br/><br/>At the time my predecessor sought the observations of the Garda Commissioner on the Report and its recommendations.  In response, the Garda Commissioner pointed that following the putting in place of a code of practice for the management of Covert Human Intelligence Sources many of the recommendations made by GSOC were already incorporated into Garda procedures. The Commissioner also emphasised that informants are clearly instructed that they may not commit crimes or act as <i>agents provocateur.</i><br/><br/>I should emphasise that there has been, since 2010, an independent, external oversight mechanism in place to ensure compliance with the code of practice.  The current holder of this appointment is Mr Justice Thomas Smyth, former judge of the High Court. Mr Justice Smyth's report for 2012 has been published and I am currently making arrangements to publish his reports for 2013 and 2014. I am pleased to note that the Judge has indicated that he received full cooperation from relevant members of An Garda Siochana in compiling his report and he records substantial compliance with the code of practice by An Garda Siochana.<br/><br/>I should mention that the recent Inspectorate report makes a number of recommendations in relation to the handling of information and these will be addressed.<br/><br/>A Memorandum of Understanding, Protocols and Agreement on Operational Matters, agreed by the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) has been in place between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC since the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in 2007. However, a new Memorandum of Understanding, Protocols and Agreement on Operational Matters has been agreed between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC and was signed by the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission on 23rd September, 2013.  The Memorandum of Understanding agrees protocols for operational matters between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC, including the provision of information to GSOC by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br/><br/>There is continued ongoing co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC to address any issues that arise during the course of an investigation. A working relationship is maintained between the two organisations with regular formal and informal meetings between senior management representatives. In addition, the Garda Commissioner has established a dedicated office (GSOC Liaison Office) to process and monitor all such requests and ensure that all correspondence with GSOC is attended to in a timely manner.<br/><br/>In the context of Garda oversight generally, the Deputy will be aware that I recently introduced the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014.  The main purpose of the Bill  is to amend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to expand the remit and powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC). The Bill will bring the Garda Commissioner within the remit of GSOC for the first time. It will also ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides information sought by GSOC for an investigation as soon as practicable.</p></reply>

This was one of the actions agreed by Government as a response to the report by Se&aacute;n Guerin.  A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose.</p><p>  The independent review is well underway and 305 cases have been referred to them.  This is a significant number of cases, and higher than originally estimated, but I think it was important to refer to the panel all of the allegations on hand, so as to ensure that every case where concerns have been expressed would get the benefit of an independent review.  I do think that it is important to say that one outcome of such a review is that in many instances no further action may be recommended.  This is to some extent inevitable in circumstances where, on the one hand, individuals have genuine but necessarily subjective concerns about how their particular cases were originally handled and, on the other hand, counsel have to examine objective evidence and especially whether those cases have been through due process, even if the persons involved remain unhappy with the outcome of that process.</p><p>  I expect recommendations to be submitted in due course and action will be taken in light of the recommendations made by Counsel on the Panel, and each complainant and/or public representative will be notified accordingly.</p></reply>

Section 20 of the 2005 Act provides that the Minister may, following consultation with the Garda Commissioner, determine and revise priorities for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in performing its functions under the Act and section 22 of the Act requires the Garda Commissioner each year to prepare a Policing Plan and, in so doing, to have regard <i>inter alia</i>to the priorities determined by the Minister.<br/><br/>The policing priorities I have drawn up for 2015 focus in particular on strengthening the ability of the Garda&iacute; to meet the varying needs of different local communities, supporting the needs of victims of crime, targeting domestic and sexual violence as well as maintaining the fight against serious organised crime and ensuring a more efficient use of Garda personnel and other resources.  These priorities also focus strongly on the policing and security elements of the Government's broader programme of criminal justice reform. These priorities have been communicated to the interim Garda Commissioner and will inform the 2015 policing plan which will be submitted to me for approval in the coming weeks before it is laid before the houses of the Oireachtas.<br/><br/>As regards the question of additional funding, it is of course the case that significant additional funding has been provided for the Garda vote in 2015, including to allow for ongoing additional recruitment and procurement of additional Garda vehicles.  I have also clearly signalled  in recent days my intention to support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their efforts to address particular deficits identified in the recent Garda Inspectorate report on crime investigation.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that the issues raised in the report are widespread, varied and far-reaching and, when taken together with the review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Haddington Road agreement, will demand significant structural reform within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The issue of additional funding will be addressed within that context. I am working with Minister Howlin to secure the necessary and early investment in upgrading Garda technology to bring outdated paper based practices into the 21st century and I look forward, too, to the significant contribution to this process by the policing authority which is to be established shortly.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-18a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014111800053#WRA01300"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, last week I published the report of the Garda Inspectorate on Crime Investigation and welcomed its analysis as providing the foundation stone for the future development of a 21st century policing service for Ireland.  The report rightly acknowledges the dedication and commitment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and indeed notes that many of the issues raised had been identified in other comparable police forces. We should bear in mind too that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na day in day out has considerable success in bringing offenders to justice and keeping our communities safe.  Nevertheless, as I said on its publication, its findings raise serious concerns and represent a highly challenging analysis of Garda processes and systems.<br/><br/>The Report will play an important role in the overall justice reform programme underway, including the establishment of an independent Police Authority, strengthening the powers of GSOC, and the open competition for the recruitment of the Garda Commissioner.<br/><br/>Implementation of this programme is being overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform, chaired by An Taoiseach, and this Committee will also now take on a role in overseeing delivery of the reforms recommended by the Inspectorate.<br/><br/>There will also of course be a central role for the new Police Authority and Garda Commissioner in implementing the identified reform.  Ahead of the establishment of the Policing Authority, I intend to hold discussions with Josephine Feehily, the Chairman-designate, on the establishment of an effective implementation framework to oversee delivery of reforms in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, along the lines recommended by the Inspectorate.<br/><br/>The incoming Garda Commissioner, who is due to be appointed shortly following an open competition, will also be central in driving implementation of many of the reforms arising from the Inspectorate&rsquo;s analysis.  In advance of this appointment, I have already welcomed the decision of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to establish an Implementation Steering Group to immediately focus on the implementation of the short<font color="#2F2F2F">, </font>medium and long-term recommendations in the Report, and a programme of Risk compliance and Continuous Improvement Teams which will be introduced in each region to support a revised focus on professional standards and to tackle any weaknesses identified in the Inspectorate's report.  I have also asked the Acting Commissioner for an overall response to the Report and its recommendations.<br/><br/>In addition, upon publication of the Report I set out a further comprehensive series of measures being taken to address the issues identified by the Inspectorate including:<br/><br/>- plans for the necessary and early investment in upgrading Garda technology to bring outdated paper based practices into the 21st century<br/><br/>- new Garda measures to improve consistency and accuracy of data<br/><br/>- a review of the report by the CSO to see whether and to what extent it may have implications for the crime statistics which that Office produces<br/><br/>- an expert group to be chaired by the CSO to examine its recommendations, including in relation to crime counting and detection rules, with a view to introducing new national standards<br/><br/>- measures to improve supports for victims, including victims of domestic and sexual violence.<br/><br/>It is clear from the Report that developments in systems and processes in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have not kept pace with developments in broader society and police forces globally.  The Report's analysis has been welcomed by Government and we are determined to act on it.  I can assure the Deputy that we will work to equip An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to meet all of the challenges of 21st century policing, and to put the needs of victims first.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of all resources, including fully sworn members and Reserve Garda&iacute;, among the Garda Regions, Divisions and Districts. Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review in the context of security assessments, crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.<br/><br/>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the full complement of Garda&iacute;, Reserve Gardai and civilians attached to each Garda Station in the DMR North Central Division, on the 31 December 2009 - 2013 and on the 30 September 2014, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is as set out in the table.<br/><br/>The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to any Division may fluctuate due, for example, to promotion, transfer, retirements and resignations.  In these circumstances the Deputy will appreciate that the specific information she has sought is not readily available in the detail requested and I understand that the compilation of such information would involve a disproportionate amount of Garda time and

In this regard, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of all resources, including fully sworn members and Reserve Garda&iacute;, among the Garda Regions, Divisions and Districts. Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review in the context of security assessments, crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.</p><p>  I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of Kildare Garda Division on 30 September 2014, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 305.

This marked a positive step forward for policing in Ireland. Furthermore, the process of recruiting 200 additional Garda&iacute; to the force will continue over the next few months. The Garda Commissioner, will of course, continue to keep the needs of the Kildare Garda Division under review within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.</p></reply>

These Regulations provided for the appointment of an independent Confidential Recipient to whom members of the Force, and civilian support staff, could report, in full confidence, instances where they believed there may have been corruption or malpractice within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br/><br/>The Confidential Recipient was required to transmit each confidential report to the Garda Commissioner (or to the Minister, if the report contained an allegation which related to the Garda Commissioner).  In transmitting a report the Confidential Recipient was obliged to protect the identity of the whistleblower and any communication between the Confidential Recipient and the whistleblower was confidential and was not conveyed to the Minister or the Department officials.<br/><br/>The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 came into operation on 15 July 2014 as part of this Government's comprehensive approach to enhance the protection available to whistle blowers, including Garda whistleblowers.  Section 19 of the Act inserted a new provision into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) to be a prescribed person under the 2014 Act to investigate disclosures relating to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including disclosures from members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Three weeks later I announced the appointment of an Independent Review Group chaired by Mr. Kevin Toland, CEO of the Dublin Airport Authority.</p><p>  The Independent Review Group reported on 11 July - a very rapid turn-around time for which I thank them.</p><p>  The Review identified a number of core strengths in the Department which provide robust foundations and building blocks that will ensure a strong future. The willingness, flexibility and can-do attitude of many loyal staff was acknowledged, along with the significant depth of specialist knowledge and expertise. The Group, however, also found key issues and significant weaknesses that required addressing.</p><p>  My Department immediately began work on a Programme for Change to implement the Group's recommendations. The objective of this Programme is to assist the Department to migrate to a new culture, leadership, management and operating model which delivers a high performing organisation and provides strategic oversight and added value to its agencies. Since that time the Department has engaged in a consultation with all of its key stakeholders, including staff and agencies.</p><p>  Last week I hosted a roundtable consultation in Farmleigh with my Department's agencies to renew relationships with a view to improving the effectiveness of the sector as a whole.</p><p>  The following developments are also relevant:</p><p>  - There is considerable overlap between issues raised in the Civil Service Renewal Plan and the Toland Report.</p><p>  - Consultations with stakeholders on a draft of the next Departmental Strategy Statement, which is linked directly to the recommendations in Toland, are currently taking place.</p><p>  - My Department's Management Advisory Committee has reviewed and formalised its processes in line with the recommendations in Toland - arrangements under which the Committee meets the Minister of the day have also been reviewed and formalised.</p><p>  - Work has commenced on a new HR Strategy and training plan for staff in the Department.</p><p>  - My Department is collaborating with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer on proposals to address IT related issues on a collaborative basis.</p><p>  The kind of organisational change recommended by Toland requires time; this is recognised in the two year timeframe for its recommendations and I am satisfied with early progress that has been made.</p><p>  In the meantime my Departments extensive programme of work continues. In that respect in the period since the Toland Report was published, a number of major initiatives have taken place. For example these include: the publication of the draft Police Authority Bill, which is the most profound reform measure for the Force since its foundation; a Chair Designate of the new Authority has been identified and announced; the Penal Policy Review Group has completed its work; the historic British Irish Visa Scheme has commenced; and the New Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and The Court of Appeal have been established.</p></reply>

It is obviously a very difficult story for her to tell and I admire her bravery in telling it publicly.  It is a pity that those who have questions to answer in relation to her mistreatment have acted in stark contrast, evading and distorting.<br/><br/>I have spoken about the issues arising with my Northern Ireland counterpart, Justice Minister David Ford, and we will be discussing the matter further later this week in the context of a ministerial meeting in the framework of North-South co-operation on criminal justice matters to see whether there are any additional actions that we might usefully consider.<br/><br/>Whatever the circumstances, it is never easy for victims of rape and sexual abuse to come forward with their complaints and to speak out, and when they do they deserve to be listened to and to be treated with sensitivity and respect.  Victims of abuse in this jurisdiction can report sexual offences to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have clear and long-standing guidelines in place for dealing with such complaints which are strongly focused on adopting a sensitive approach to the complainant.  The Garda&iacute; will investigate any complaints of sexual offences reported to them where it is in their jurisdiction to do so, and they work closely with the health and other social services and with services such as the Rape Crisis Centre in dealing with such complaints.<br/><br/>In this jurisdiction there is 24-hour helpline for victims of sexual violence which is operated by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre that is staffed by highly trained people. There are also a range of other numbers available where one can speak to some of the fifteen other rape crisis centres around the country.  Victims can find contact details and information for can be found at  .  I encourage any victims of sexual violence to use these avenues to come forward.<br/><br/>It is not now nor has it ever been acceptable for anyone to seek to suppress the reporting of sexual offences to the appropriate authorities or to seek to protect rapists or sex abusers.  Whenever these brutal crimes occur they need to be investigated thoroughly and in accordance with the law.  The Deputy clearly shares my concern at the grave implications of abusers not being reported to the authorities but instead having been moved elsewhere.  It is imperative that any person or organisation which has information about persons who might pose risks to children passes on that information to the authorities who will pursue it fully.<br/><br/>I understand that the Garda authorities have had some relevant matters reported to them and they are pursuing these and it will be appreciated that it would not be appropriate to go into any detail in respect of these matters which are subject to investigation.</p></reply>

In that context the Government has indicated its intention that the new Authority should be in operation as soon as possible.</p><p>  I have recently published the General Scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Bill 2014 which makes provision for the establishment of the Policing Authority and it is available on the website of my Department. The General Scheme has been referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for scrutiny in parallel with the priority drafting of the Bill which will be brought before the Oireachtas as soon as practicable.</p><p>  The General Scheme sets out a broad range of measures which are required for the introduction of a very significant level of independent public accountability on the part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the delivery of policing services.  In the case of the appointment of the members of the new Authority these measures include open selection competitions and nominations to be undertaken by the Public Appointments Service in respect of 8 of the 9 members.  In addition the appointment of every member will require the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Government has nominated Ms Josephine Feehily as the first Chairperson-designate of the Policing Authority.  Ms Feehily is a woman of unimpeachable integrity and unquestioned ability who will bring a wealth of experience and competences, including in the area of investigations, to her new role.

Such appointments will be made on the basis of a nomination by the Policing Authority following an open competition run by the Public Appointments Service.  In the circumstances the Deputy will appreciate that the role of the Government will be very restricted and that the procedures to be adopted will be transparent.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of all resources, including fully sworn members and Reserve Garda&iacute;, among the Garda Regions, Divisions and Districts. Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review in the context of security assessments, crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.</p><p>  Tackling organised crime remains a key ongoing priority for both the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This priority is clearly reflected in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Policing Plan 2014 which sets out the continued commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to pro-actively identify and target organised crime groups whose activities have such an impact on communities across the country.</p><p>  In this regard, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to tackle organised crime through a range of targeted activities designed to disrupt and dismantle their operations. This involves targeting serious criminals and organised criminal groups through the use of focused intelligence led operations by specialist units such as the Organised Crime Unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p><p>  These units are also supported, as required, by the Security and Intelligence Section which assists with the provision of intelligence briefings and timely information. All of these specialist units operate under the remit of the Assistant Commissioner in charge of the National Support Services and working collaboratively they continue to achieve commendable success in tackling criminal gangs.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also maintains close liaison with other law enforcement agencies internationally and the work of Garda liaison officers who are permanently based in other jurisdictions and in international bodies such as Interpol and Europol greatly facilitates the prompt exchange of information and intelligence on criminal activity.</p><p>  In recent days I have clearly signalled my intention to support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their efforts to address particular deficits identified in the recent Garda Inspectorate report on crime investigation.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that the issues raised in the report are widespread, varied and far-reaching and, when taken together with the review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Haddington Road agreement, will demand significant structural reform within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The particular issues identified with regard to technology will be addressed within that context.</p><p>  In the area of forensics the Deputy will also be aware that the forensic capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be further enhanced by a new national DNA database, which will be established on foot of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act, 2014 and is expected to be operational by the new year.  As regards other areas of forensic science the Garda authorities currently employ  automated fingerprint and ballistics identification systems which I am informed are at least on a par with those used by police forces in other EU jurisdictions.</p></reply>

In the course of an officer's work he or she may have access to, or hear information concerning the personal affairs of a prisoner and/or employee. Such information, irrespective of the format is strictly confidential. I would like to acknowledge receipt of a letter dated  from the Deputy 11th November 2014 regarding the circumstances surrounding his visit to Limerick Prison on 30th October 2014.  I wish to inform the Deputy that I have sought a full report from the Director General of the Irish Prison Service into the circumstance surrounding the visit.<br/><br/>Any member of the Irish Prison Service who discharges or divulges information to any third party or the media is not only contravening clear policy, but is also contravening the law. The divulging of information regarding prisoners' private affairs is very damaging not only to the Irish Prison Service but also to the  families of those who are in prison. The breach of confidence is an offence under the Prison (Disciplinary Code for Officers) Rules, 1996: <i>'Breach of Confidence, that is to say, without proper authority, directly or indirectly disclosing, divulging, communicating, publishing or causing to be divulged, communicated or published any information not lawfully available to members of the public which comes to his or her knowledge from official sources or derives from his or her duties.' </i><br/><br/>It is open to a Governor, where it appears an officer may have committed a breach of discipline of this nature, to carry out an investigation under the Code of Discipline, and if he or she is satisfied that the alleged breach is a serious one, to proceed to an oral hearing on the matter under the Code. The penalties provided for under the Code are (a) a reprimand, or (b) a reprimand plus a reduction in rank or a reduction in pay by deferment of one or more increments for one, three, six or twelve months or any longer period the Governor may specify, or (c) dismissal from the Prison Service.<br/><br/>Any such breach of confidence would also be a breach of the Official Secrets Act 1963 and could be subject to prosecution under Section 13 of that Act. It is clearly open to the Deputy, if he has not done so already to make a complaint  to an Garda Siochana.<br/><br/>I would like to inform the Deputy when officers are recruited to the Irish Prison Service they  are required to sign a copy of the Official Secrets Act 1963.  Staff are also expected to sign to acknowledge that they have received this particular Act in hardcopy and that they have read and understand it.  During their induction, Officers are educated about the use of information and discretion and are made aware of their legal obligations in this regard.</p></reply>

This was one of the actions agreed by Government as a response to the report by Se&aacute;n Guerin.  A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose.</p><p>  The independent review is well underway and 305 cases have been referred to them.  This is a significant number of cases, and higher than originally estimated, but I think it was important to refer to the panel all of the allegations on hand, so as to ensure that every case where concerns have been expressed would get the benefit of an independent review.  I do think that it is important to say that one outcome of such a review is that in many instances no further action may be recommended.  This is to some extent inevitable in circumstances where, on the one hand, individuals have genuine but necessarily subjective concerns about how their particular cases were originally handled and, on the other hand, counsel have to examine objective evidence and especially whether those cases have been through due process, even if the persons involved remain unhappy with the outcome of that process.</p><p>  The review of each allegation consists of an examination of the papers by a counsel from the Panel, and does not involve interviews or interaction with complainants or any other form of investigation, although counsel may recommend that I seek further information to assist in coming to an appropriate recommendation in any particular case.</p><p>  The Independent Review mechanism is not a Commission of Inquiry or Investigation designed to make findings.  The role of the Panel is to consider, based on a review of the correspondence and other documentation provided by the complainants, the steps taken to resolve their complaints to date and what further action, if any, might be appropriate.

The very broad nature of the policing issues that have come to attention requires a multi-faceted response. Overall, the Government&rsquo;s objective is to ensure that the confidence of the public in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is maintained and bring forward the necessary change so that the high quality and respected service that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has provided is continued and enhanced to better meet the realities, requirements and expectations of 21st century policing.</p><p>  Considerable progress has already been achieved with regard to the various elements of the Government reform programme and, in particular, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the following items:</p><p>  - The Independent Review Mechanism, consisting of a panel of counsel established to examine approximately 300 complaints alleging Garda misconduct or problems with investigating misconduct, is continuing its work and has made significant progress;</p><p>  - The Public Appointments Service is currently managing the first open competition to appoint a new Garda Commissioner.  It is expected that the new Commissioner will be appointed by early December;</p><p>  - Following a process undertaken by the Public Appointments Service seeking expressions of interest, the Government has recently nominated Ms Josephine Feehily as the Chairperson-designate for the forthcoming Independent Policing Authority.  As Chairperson-designate Ms Feehily will assist in the final round of the recruitment process for the appointment of the Garda Commissioner as well as preparations for the establishment of the Authority;</p><p>  - I have published the General Scheme of a Bill to provide for the establishment of the new Independent Policing Authority. The General Scheme has been referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for scrutiny in parallel with the priority drafting of the Bill which will be introduced in the Oireachtas as soon as practicable;</p><p>  - I have also recently published the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate&rsquo;s crime inspectorate report. The report deals with crime recording and investigation, and also deals with some of the concerns raised by Mr. Se&aacute;n Guerin SC in his report to the Government earlier this year in respect of certain Garda actions. The report contains more than 200 recommendations for implementation which are being actively pursued;</p><p>  - Work is being finalised on the establishment of a Commission of Investigation into matters identified in the Guerin report;</p><p>  - The Fennelly Commission of Investigation set up to examine the operation of telephone recording systems in certain Garda Stations over many years, as well as other matters, recently sought an extension to its end of 2014 deadline for the submission of its report. However, the Commission has indicated that it will submit an interim report in respect of specific issues;</p><p>  - The report of Judge Cooke&rsquo;s inquiry into reports of unlawful surveillance of GSOC has been published and GSOC has published a redacted version of the report it commissioned into the possible disclosure of confidential information;</p><p>  - The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014 has been introduced to expand the remit and powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC). In addition the Bill contains measures to clarify certain matters raised in Judge Cooke&rsquo;s report and amendments are also being made to legislation in respect of the exercise of certain police powers by GSOC;</p><p>  - The review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Haddington Road Agreement is expected to be completed shortly and encompasses all aspects of the operation and administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</p><p>  - I published the Report of the Independent Review Group on the Department of Justice and Equality in July and I am working closely with the Department&rsquo;s senior management team to implement the report&rsquo;s recommendations;</p><p>  - The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 has amended Garda legislation to allow Garda members to make &ldquo;protected disclosures&rdquo; to GSOC in confidence in respect of alleged Garda misconduct.  The relevant provisions of the Act have been brought into operation;</p><p>  - The recently enacted Freedom of Information Act 2014 extends to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

In that context, I welcome the Report of the Penal Policy Review Group which I published on 17 September.  The Report proposes the adoption of a penal policy with the dual purposes of punishment and rehabilitation both in the imposition and management of criminal sanctions.</p><p>  Some of the report&rsquo;s recommendations can be implemented in the short to medium term, while others will require a more long term approach.  As an initial step, I recently obtained the agreement, in principle, of Government to proceed immediately with the implementation of the following key recommendations:</p><p>  - bringing forward legislative proposals to establish the Parole Board on an independent statutory basis;</p><p>  - preparing proposals and options for Government on reform of sentencing policy including a review of the threshold at which presumptive minimum sentences in drugs and other offences apply;</p><p>  - preparing proposals for Government on legislating for the review's recommendation that Courts set out in writing their reasons for imposing a custodial sentence;</p><p>  - preparing proposals on the potential for increased use of earned remission; and</p><p>  - pursuing options for an open prison for female offenders.</p><p>  The Community Return programme continues to be rolled out nationally and is a novel initiative combining unpaid supervised work for the benefit of the community with early release and resettlement support.  Almost 1,050 prisoners have taken part since October 2011 with 142 currently engaged on the scheme.  Compliance has been almost 90%.  Those who do not comply with the terms and conditions of their release are re-committed to prison immediately to serve the rest of their sentence in custody. </p><p>  Apart from delivering real savings in the form of saved prison bed spaces and reparation to the community, I believe one of the most worthwhile elements of the programme is the positive development in providing a structure and support which can help prisoners to successfully resettle in their communities.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 72,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. </p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant.

The fact that approximately 72,500 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement shows that a significant number of landlords are accommodating applicants of the scheme.</p><p>  It is clearly my preference that a person in receipt of rent supplement should not be refused accommodation due to the fact that they are receiving support from the State.

An overpayment will arise where, in accordance with Part 11 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, a revised decision is made by a Deciding Officer on a claimant&rsquo;s entitlement resulting in a retrospective reduction in their entitlement.  In deciding whether or not the decision should have retrospective effect, Deciding Officers are required to have regard to the facts relevant to the decision on entitlement.  Founding their decision on facts will ensure that the deciding officers&rsquo; actions can result in the Department pursuing all debts.  Customers who have been overpaid have a liability to refund the overpayment (Section 338 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005 (as amended) refers.  </p><p>  When a revised decision is made, the claimant is notified and given the opportunity to appeal the decision within 21 days.  Once the right of appeal has been exercised (or not) the Department will then consider the recovery of the overpayment.  </p><p>  A debt to the Department of Social Protection may comprise of a single overpayment or a number of overpayments.  Once an overpayment has been assessed, and the person has been notified, any correspondence thereafter seeking recovery would refer to the total amount of debt owed.  Therefore, the Department does not have the information requested by the Deputy regarding the number of persons who have been contacted in 2014 regarding scheme overpayments which were assessed against them prior to 2008.</p><p>  When seeking to recover an overpayment, the rate of recovery proposed will be the maximum repayment that the person can afford in order to recover the overpayment as quickly as possible.  Although the Department is empowered to deduct 15% of the weekly personal rate payable in respect of an overpayment without the customer&rsquo;s consent, an officer may, nevertheless, ask the customer to repay the debt at a higher rate, where it is considered that they have the ability to pay.  If the customer does not consent, then a deduction of more than 15% cannot be implemented.  Similarly, an officer can consider deducting less than 15% in certain circumstances.  Once a deduction is put in place it is not recorded if this was as a result of the customer&rsquo;s agreement or in accordance with Section 13 of the Social Welfare Act, 2012 which allows for a deduction of an amount up to 15% of the weekly personal rate payable to a customer without the customer&rsquo;s consent.</p><p>  A social welfare debt will not become statute barred for recovery.  It remains with a debtor for all future entitlement payments, and can be collected thereafter from any remaining estate.  There is no statute of limitations preventing the Department recovering its debts by deduction from entitlements.  Effective debt recovery is seen as an important measure to safeguard public expenditure.  Where someone has been overpaid social welfare it is important that this money is recouped.</p></reply>

Childcare places will be allocated to children up to 13 years of age (part-time places for those children up to 5 years of age and after-school places for those of school-going age). There is a nominal cost of &euro;15 per child per week.</p><p>  Other recent improvements to the CE programme include the new 3-year application for approval for each individual scheme (instead of annual applications) which reduces the administrative burden on both CE sponsoring organisations and the Department&rsquo;s staff.</p><p>  New Programme and Training Monitoring Guidelines were also implemented in 2014.  The monitoring is completed by Departmental staff on-site and aims to ensure compliance with Departmental CE Procedures and to raise the quality of schemes.</p><p>  The new Sponsor Engagement Pack is being rolled out by the Department over the coming months.  This will provide an opportunity for sponsors to meet with DSP staff to get an update on developments on CE and to engage with and to provide feedback to the Department.</p></reply>

As at 14 November 2014, a total of 35,167 internships have commenced with 6,676 participants currently on a JobBridge placement, and 2,078 internship posts currently advertised on the JobBridge website.</p><p>  In County Mayo, there have been a total of 935 internships since the scheme commenced.  Of this, 198 are currently on a placement, with 737 internships completed at this point in time.  A total of 218 of these interns progressed into employment, either with their host organisation or another organisation on completion of their JobBridge placement.</p><p>  Progression into employment on completion of an internship understates the impact of the scheme as many people use their work experience to apply for and secure employment in the months immediately following the internship.  In this regard, an independent evaluation of JobBridge found that 61% of individuals who have participated in the scheme have progressed into employment within five months of completing their internship placements.  A total of 45.2% of these were in full-time permanent employment, 9.3% were in part-time permanent employment, 35.0% were in full-time temporary employment and 10.5% were in part-time temporary employment. The majority of these have progressed to employment with their host organisations, while the remainder took the skills and experiences gained during their internship to employment in the wider labour market. This high level of progression into employment exceeds that of similar schemes across Europe. </p><p>  I am confident that JobBridge will continue as a positive activation programme, and that the scheme will display similar progression rates into employment, into the future.</p></reply>

The decision to re-employ the Chief Medical Advisor was taken due to his specific skills and his involvement in the policy reform of the illness related schemes, the difficulty and long lead-in time for replacing his skills, and the critical importance of ensuring continuity and a high level of service to customers of the Department. The Department held a competition to replace the Chief Medical Adviser in late 2013, however, no candidate was deemed suitable at interview. The position was re-advertised late last month and it is anticipated that an appointment will be made from this competition early next year.</p><p>  As an exception to the current moratorium on recruitment, the Department has limited sanction to recruit temporary clerical officers to cover critical staff absences and to assist with the roll-out of the new Public Service Card. There are currently two temporary staff members who are retired civil servants occupying these posts.</p><p>  The Pensions Authority and the Citizens Information Board come under the remit of the Department. Two retired public servants were re-hired by the Pensions Authority in 2011; one at Higher Executive Officer level and one at Assistant Principal Officer level. Both individuals were recruited directly by the Pensions Authority, on three year fixed-term temporary contracts.  The Citizen&rsquo;s Information Board had one former staff member hired on a contract for service basis from October to December 2013.</p><p>  In all of these cases the rules governing abatement of pensions are applied.</p></reply>

A special non-contributory benefit is an EU term for what in Ireland are regarded as assistance payments; examples are jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.</p><p>  All EU citizens have an unqualified right of residence in another EU Member State for up to three months, although the host State has no obligation to provide social assistance to the migrant person or their family during that initial residence period.  The right of residence for longer than three months for a migrant person who is not employed or self-employed depends on he or she having sufficient resources for himself or herself and his or her family, so as not to become an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system. The right of permanent residence is acquired after five years residence in the host Member State.</p><p>  This particular case reaffirms that an inactive person who does not have sufficient resources so as not to be an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system of a host Member State does not have a right to reside in that State, and is therefore not in a position to invoke the equality provisions of the EU regulations on the coordination of social security systems when it comes to applying for special non-contributory benefits in that State.</p><p>  The implications of this Court of Justice of the European Union ruling are being considered by the Department.</p></reply>

These initiatives included the re-introduction of a Christmas bonus and an increase in the living alone allowance.</p><p>  The Christmas bonus was abolished by the previous Government in 2009.  This year a bonus of 25% will be paid in early December to all long-term welfare recipients including all pensioners and carers. This will cost over &euro;63 million and is in recognition of the position of vulnerable households.</p><p>  There will be an increase in the living alone allowance of &euro;1.30 per week from January, bringing the rate up from &euro;7.70 to &euro;9 for pensioners and people with disabilities.  The living alone allowance is a payment made to pensioners and people with disabilities who live alone and was last increased in 1996.  In Budget 2015 the household benefits scheme, the fuel allowance scheme and the free travel pass were also maintained.</p><p>  The overall concern of the Government in Budget 2015 and previous Budgets has been to protect the primary social welfare rates. Expenditure on pensions is the largest block of expenditure in the Department, representing about a third of overall expenditure.  Because of demographic changes the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.  The savings generated by reductions in secondary benefits were essential to maintain core weekly payments.</p><p>  The adjustments made to the household benefits package in recent years have made it much easier for customers to switch to cheaper energy suppliers, without the loss of any credits they may have built up.  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance provided annual savings of &euro;48 million and meant that the Department was able to retain the other elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence. These are valuable supports for recipients. The Department will spend &euro;230 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for approximately 415,000 customers.</p></reply>

The relief was introduced subject to State-aid approval and discussions and exchanges have been taking place with the EU Commission on that issue. The requirements can be complex and the process can take time.<br/><br/>Arising from those discussions, a number of changes are being made in Finance Bill 2014 to the CGT entrepreneur relief provisions in order that the relief would satisfy the EU Commission's new General Block Exemption Regulations introduced earlier this year, thus obviating the need for formal EU approval of the relief from a State-aid perspective.<br/><br/>The changes involve targeting the relief at individuals involved in newly created enterprises or enterprises created within the last 7 years, placing a cap of &euro;15 million on the total risk finance investment made in each such enterprise and ensuring that the risk finance investment is made by the entrepreneurs at the commencement of the new business.<br/><br/>Other changes are being made to the relief to make it more compatible with the commercial reality of conducting business on the ground.<br/><br/>These changes include:<br/><br/>- Clarifying that an enterprise does not have to be a micro, small or medium-sized enterprise at the date of disposal of the chargeable business asset in order for the individual owner to qualify for the relief.<br/><br/>- Amending the ownership requirement from control - meaning 50% or more ownership of shares - to 15% ownership of ordinary shares, as in practice new enterprises often have two or more individuals as shareholders or co-owners.<br/><br/>- Providing that investment in the new business through a holding company can qualify for the relief as this is a standard investment structure.<br/><br/>- Enabling disposals of chargeable business assets in forms other than a direct disposal of shares in a qualifying company to qualify for the relief.<br/><br/>The revised provisions of Section 597A (as included in section 46 of Finance Bill 2014) will be effective from the passing of the Finance Bill. The CGT relief will apply, among other conditions, where new chargeable business assets have been acquired on or after 1 January 2014.</p></reply>

The Central Bank measures, as set out in the consultation document, would place restrictions on the loan to value (LTV) and loan to income (LTI) ratios banks can apply when lending for house purchase.<br/><br/>A copy of the Consultation Paper is available on the Central Bank website (at ) and comments on the paper can be made electronically to by 8 December 2014.<br/><br/>The Central Bank has proposed that banks will be able to lend, in some instances, above these threshold limits. However, the proposals state that any lending in excess of the loan to value ratio must be limited to no more than 15% of the value of new loans issued and, in respect of exceeding the loan to income ratio, to no more that 20% of the value of new loans. The Central Bank consultation paper indicated that other exemptions will also be available in cases of switcher mortgages (which, allowing for reasonable fees and costs, would not increase the principal), alternative repayment arrangements or other options to address a mortgage repayment difficulty, or residual debt from negative equity mortgages. Any equity realised by a borrower arising from the sale of a house will be available to the borrower to use, if s/he so decides, as the deposit, for the purchase of a new house.</p></reply>

Previously, these profits were exempt from Income and Corporation Tax.<br/><br/>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that figures for the profits earned from the provision of stallion stud services were required to be returned in Income Tax and Corporation Tax returns from the tax year 2008 onwards. The figures from returns are as set out in a table for the tax years 2008 to 2012, the most recent available.<br/><br/><b>Profits earned from the provision of stallion stud services</b><table><tr><th>Tax Year</th><th>Income Tax Returns &euro;m</th><th>Corporation Tax Returns &euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>2008*</td><td>1.1</td><td>0.6</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>0.5</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>0.7</td><td>2.3</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>0.7</td><td>2.2</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>0.7</td><td>6.4</td></tr></table><br/><br/>*These figures do not include fees and profits that were exempt prior to 1 August 2008.<br/><br/>In interpreting these figures it is important to bear in mind that they are profits as opposed to the total fees earned by an owner. Income Tax and Corporation Tax are charged on profits or gains rather than gross fee income. In calculating the profits or gains, stallions are treated as stock in trade which means that income from stud fees and profits or gains on the sale of the stallions are fully taxable in the hands of both corporate and individual owners.<br/><br/>In computing profits, a write-off over 4 years of the &quot;initial value&quot; of the stallion is allowed as a deduction for tax purposes. This reflects the fact that some stallions have a short nomination life and also takes into account that the majority of stallions are unsuccessful at stud. The impact of the deduction on taxable profits during the write-off period is directly related to the success, or otherwise, of the stallion. Without this provision the cost of a stallion would, under normal rules, only be allowed as a deduction upon its disposal or death.<br/><br/>As stallion related profits or gains are aggregated with all other incomes for the purposes of Income and Corporation Tax calculations, it is therefore not possible to specify the separate Income or Corporation Tax yield from these activities. All taxpayers, both individual and corporate, can have a number of sources of income, and can avail of a variety of different deductions and reliefs, which affect the final tax liability. In addition, the profit figures shown above may be reduced by capital allowances or losses to which that taxpayer may be entitled. Therefore, it is not possible to infer from these figures the amount of tax that is generated solely from the taxation of these profits or gains.<br/><br/>The Deputy has also asked for the amount of income associated with the top ten stallion operations. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, to ensure the confidentiality of Revenue's taxpayer information, it would not be appropriate for the Commissioners to reveal the profits of the top ten cases.</p></reply>

Revenue investigates all complaints of this kind and fuel samples are taken from filling stations and referred to the State Laboratory for analysis where the investigating officers have reason to suspect excise fraud. Revenue is also working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a joint investigation of a concentration of complaints in Co. Mayo.</p><p>  Conclusive results have been received from the State Laboratory in one case which indicate the contamination of petrol through the presence of kerosene. A second positive result for contamination is currently under investigation. To date, no evidence of fraudulently contaminated petrol has been found in other samples referred for analysis.</p><p>  Petrol stretching is an offence under section 102 (1A) of the Finance Act 1999 and if Revenue's investigations and the analysis of fuel samples by the State Laboratory indicate the presence of illegal stretching agents in petrol, Revenue will take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the orientation of a Revenue investigation is determined on the basis of a comprehensive evaluation of risk which takes account of all pertinent information. The charging of prices for fuel that are significantly at variance with the generality of prices in a given area is one of many risk factors that they take into account in deciding on the appropriate focus for their investigative work.</p><p>  With regard to the question of insurance, I understand from Insurance Ireland that each insurer investigates individual cases in relation to damage done to car engines because of petrol stretching, it will be a matter of whether this financial loss is included or excluded under the terms and conditions of the individual contract. I understand that some insurers are paying out on these claims.</p><p>  It should be noted that any person who has an unresolved insurance complaint can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman for investigation and adjudication at www. financialombudsman.ie or 1890 88 20 90.</p></reply>

The morning opening time of 8.30am has been in place since 2008, and in response to customer demand trends that saw the majority of customers calling to the office in the early morning. This trend has continued, and the early opening ensures that there is no build up of queues and consequent delays once the doors open. </p><p>  As with any modern service provider, the Deputy will appreciate that good business practice requires Revenue to constantly review the delivery of services to ensure that they can facilitate peaks and troughs in demand levels, as well as changing customer preferences for the way in which they wish to carry out their transactions with Revenue. Revenue will therefore continue to monitor and evaluate customer demands in relation to the CRIO. The Deputy can be assured that a flexible and responsive approach will be taken in the event of changes in demand levels. However, Revenue is confident that the service that the Office currently provides is meeting the current demand level from customers in the Dublin area who wish to carry out their business on a face-to-face basis with Revenue.</p><p>  The key objective of the Central Revenue Information Office (CRIO, is the provision of a best-practice, speedy and efficient service for customers. The Office therefore has a range of state-of-the-art systems in place to facilitate a high quality service. For example, the CRIO has:</p><p>  - a reception area that deals very quickly with callers who have non-transactional enquiries, such as basic information requests. The enquiries of some 66% of callers to the CRIO are dealt with in this area;</p><p>  - the availability of computers whereby customers can carry out their transactions on a self-service basis. CRIO staff are available to provide guidance on the use of Revenue's self-service systems, PAYE Anytime and the Revenue On-line Service (ROS), if required by customers;</p><p>  - a modern electronic queue management system that ensures that queuing times are kept to a minimum for those customers who need to proceed to the counter;</p><p>  - counter facilities that allow many customer transactions to be carried out on-the-spot;</p><p>  - a dedicated team of experienced expert staff who can deal with the wide range of enquiries received in the Office.</p></reply>

Part of that review included a public consultation process. A report on this review was published on Budget Day and is available on the Budget website.<br/><br/>As a result of the review carried out on the EII and SCS, I decided to make some amendments to the schemes in this year's Budget. The EII is being amended as follows:<br/><br/>- The annual company limit is being increased from &euro;2.5 million to &euro;5 million and the lifetime limit from &euro;10 million to &euro;15 million;<br/><br/>- The minimum holding period for shares is being increased by 1 year to 4 years;<br/><br/>- Medium-sized companies in non-assisted areas will be included;<br/><br/>- Internationally traded financial services where certified by Enterprise Ireland will qualify;<br/><br/>- Hotels, guest houses and self-catering accommodation will remain eligible for a further 3 years; and<br/><br/>- The operating and managing of nursing homes will be included for 3 years.<br/><br/>These changes are subject to approval from the European Commission. An application to the Commission for approval will be made shortly, subject to the passing of the Finance Bill by the Oireachtas. It is not possible to provide a timeframe for receipt of the Commission's approval but my officials will be engaging closely with the Commission to ensure that it can be provided as soon as possible. In the interim, the existing incentive will continue to be available to SMEs and investors.</p></reply>

Where the owner is aged 70 or over for the whole of a tax year the rate continues at 5%. The existing 6% rate also continues in all cases where the value of the ARF/vested PRSA is greater than &euro;2 million.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information provided to them in the context of the tax paid on these deemed or imputed distributions does not include information on the value of the ARFs and/or vested PRSAs out of which the distributions are deemed to arise or on the age profile of the beneficial owners of these funds.  Moreover, details of tax paid on actual withdrawals from ARFs or vested PRSAs are not separately collated. There is therefore no basis on which a reliable estimate of the impact on the Exchequer of the change mentioned in the question could be compiled. </p><p>  The deemed or imputed distribution measure which was introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2006 is designed to encourage draw downs from ARFs and vested PRSAs so that they are used, as intended, to fund a stream of income in retirement in the same way as a retirement annuity, for which ARFs and vested PRSAs are supposed to operate as a more flexible alternative. The measure, in itself, is not intended to nor does it give rise to significant tax revenues as it does not apply to actual draw-downs from ARFs and vested PRSAs which are taxed in the normal way. By way of indication, the amounts received by the Revenue Commissioners from tax paid on imputed distributions has averaged about &euro;4 million per annum in the period 2007 to 2013.</p><p>  I should also say, however, that to the extent that the change in the imputed distribution rate to 4% will result in reduced actual draw downs  by affected ARF or vested PRSA owners, that any consequent reduction in tax revenue from this source will be offset to some extent by the increased tax revenue from the beneficial owners of Approved Minimum Retirement Funds (AMRFs) who can avail from next year of the option (also introduced in Finance Bill 2014) to access up to 4% of the value of assets in those funds, subject to tax at the marginal rate.</p></reply>

This ensures that those with very high incomes will only benefit to the same extent, as those with more modest incomes, reinforcing the highly progressive nature of the Irish income tax system.<br/><br/>The changes announced in the Budget will ensure that all those currently paying income tax and/or USC will see a reduction in their tax bill in 2015.

It is clear that the incentive is generating employment in the tax compliant construction sector and increasing sales in building supplies, hardware and related businesses.</p><p>  In the context of Budget 2015, I did consider increasing the amount of relief provided, but I decided that it would be better to extend the HRI to the owners of rental properties who are liable to income tax.  This will support legitimate operators in the rental and construction sectors and help to upgrade the quality of private rental stock, particularly at the lower end.

Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.<br/><br/><b>Group B: &euro;30,150 - </b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.<br/><br/><b>Group C: &euro;15,075 -</b>applies in all other cases.<br/><br/>Any prior gifts or inheritances received by a child from their parents since 5 December 1991 are aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on the current benefit.<br/><br/>In addition to these tax-free thresholds, a number of exemptions and reliefs from CAT are provided in CAT legislation.<br/><br/>Section 82 exempts certain receipts from Capital Acquisitions Tax.<br/><br/>Under section 82(2), <b>normal</b>and <b>reasonable</b>payments made by a disponer, during his or her lifetime, for the support, maintenance or education of his or her children (including the  children of a civil partner), or to a person to whom the disponer stands in loco parentis, or to a dependent relative of the disponer, are exempt from CAT. <br/><br/>The exemption, as it stands, applies to children without any age restriction and the test in relation to what is normal and reasonable is determined by the circumstances of the disponer.  There is evidence that the exemption is being used to provide significant sums tax-free to adult children far in advance of the intention of the exemption.<br/><br/>The proposed amendment to section 82(2) in the Finance Bill is intended to ensure, where there is the need to make provision for support, maintenance or education of children, that the exemption is confined to payments made to minor children and to children under the age of 25 years who are in full-time education. <br/><br/>It is appropriate to note that this exemption is additional to the CAT tax-free threshold available to a child (currently &euro;225,000).  The tightening of the rules also does not affect the small gift exemption under which anyone can receive gifts of up to &euro;3,000 in any year from any other individual.  Adult children can therefore receive up to &euro;6,000 a year from parents without any CAT implications.<br/><br/>Section 82(4) currently provides a similar exemption for normal and reasonable payments made to an orphaned child or to an orphaned child of a civil partner<b></b>for support, maintenance or education, after the death of their parents, from a trust set up by the parents during their lifetime.  However, the legislation currently confines this exemption to <b>minor orphaned children</b>.<br/><br/>The second proposed amendment to this section extends the exemption to orphaned children up to the age of 25 years who are in full-time education, thus ensuring that children of living parents and orphaned children are treated equally for Capital Acquisitions Tax purposes.<br/><br/>I have also introduced an amendment to section 82 at the Committee Stage of the Bill.  This amendment expressly ensures that the exemption applies to a child, regardless of age, who is permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity.  This amendment addresses many of the concerns raised concerning the amendment to Section 82.<br/><br/>As stated, the purpose of the amendment is to ensure fairness in the application of the Gift Tax rules and to ensure that high net worth individuals do not claim exemption for valuable gifts of capital to their children by reference to the exemption provision in section 82 that is only intended to apply to normal and reasonable payments for the support, maintenance or education of children. <br/><br/>Finally, Revenue has stated categorically that it has no intention of pursuing people over routine, normal expenditure within families.  Suggestions have been made in the media that the amendment will result in the Revenue Commissioners attempting to attribute a value to the provision of bed and board by parents to children over 25 who continue to reside with them.  This is not the intention of the legislation and this suggestion may have caused needless concern to people.  The Revenue Commissioners have already informed the Tax Administration Liaison Committee (which includes members of tax practitioner bodies and the Law Society) that the legislation will not be applied in this way. <br/><br/>As a matter of course, Revenue will issue a detailed public statement to practitioners which will outline how the section will work in practice when the Bill is passed into law.</p></reply>

The restructuring of the credit achieves such an outcome.</p><p>  The person who cares for the child for most of the year is entitled to the credit in the first instance.  Agreement as to who will be the primary carer of a child is a matter for the parents or guardians.  However, only the primary carer is entitled to the credit. </p><p>  There is no specific tax credit for children in the tax code.  Therefore, married or cohabiting couples are unable to avail of any additional credit to assist them in the financial maintenance of their children.  In certain cases, such couples may need to maintain two households due to the location of employment, for example.</p><p>  It should be noted that where a primary carer is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting they would not be entitled to the new credit (or indeed the former one).  This is because the child is being cared for, in the main, in a family unit which includes two adults.  In such circumstances the primary carer cannot relinquish the credit to a secondary carer.  For the same reasons it follows that a secondary carer who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, would not be entitled to the new credit (or indeed the former one) regardless of the marital status of the primary carer.</p><p>  As regards the potential of this change to interfere with the level of maintenance payments, if such reasoning were to be applied, then any general tax increase, as a result of an adjustment in tax credits, rates or bands could lead to similar situations.  Ultimately, maintenance payments are a matter for parents and if necessary, the courts to decide. It is not possible, and indeed would not be appropriate, for the tax code to take account of every possible variable.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, as a result of an amendment which I brought forward at Committee Stage of Finance Bill (No.2) 2013, a principal carer who is entitled to the credit and who does not wish to avail of it can choose to surrender it.  A secondary carer may then make a claim for the credit, provided that the qualifying child resides with him or her for not less than 100 days in the tax year.  However a principal carer may not relinquish the credit for a number of reasons.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the tax credit in its current form is working as intended and I have no plans to change it at this time.</p><p>  As regards tax relief for maintenance payments and other costs incurred by separated fathers, the position is that maintenance payments in respect of children are not taxable in the hands of the children or the receiving spouse.  The effect of this is that the payments are treated in the same way as if the taxpayer was providing for the child out of his or her after-tax income.  This is in line with the tax treatment of all other parents, where the cost of maintaining their children is not tax deductible.</p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or in relation to the mortgage interest rates charged.  It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.  It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the details of the accounts of mortgage holders.</p><p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations.  The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. </p><p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors, including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding. </p></reply>

A number of key measures have been advanced in this regard, including:<br/><br/>1. Significant reforms to personal insolvency legislation and the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI), to provide more accessible and flexible statutory frameworks for people with unsustainable personal and mortgage debt to address their position;<br/><br/>2. The launch last month of the 'Back on Track' Information Campaign for People in debt by ISI.  The Back on Track initiative was developed following research and aims to increase the take-up of the ISI services by people in debt through the elimination of ISI application fees up to end 2015 and the introduction of a payment to Personal Insolvency Practitioners, where a credible insolvency arrangement is rejected by creditors.  The ISI has launched a country-wide information campaign to publicise this service;<br/><br/>3. The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, (MABS), offers a free service to consumers facing financial difficulties or who feel they are in danger of facing difficulties;<br/><br/>4. The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) contains important protections for co-operating mortgage holders experiencing genuine difficulty with a mortgage secured on a primary residence and imposes requirements on lenders to:-<br/><br/>- Step 1: Communicate with borrower;<br/><br/>- Step 2: Gather financial information;<br/><br/>- Step 3: Assess the borrowers circumstances; and<br/><br/>- Step 4: Propose a resolution.<br/><br/>If a borrower is not happy with the way that their lender is dealing with them or if they believe they are not complying with the CCMA, the borrower can make a complaint to their lender. <br/><br/>Borrowers can also make an appeal to the lender's Appeals Board if they are not happy with the alternative repayment arrangement offered or if they believe they have been wrongly classified as not co-operating.<br/><br/>If the borrower is not happy with the outcome of the appeal/complaint made to the lender they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO). Further information on how to make a complaint to the FSO is available at .<br/><br/>In addition to the above provisions, the Government is implementing a number of initiatives through the Action Plan for Jobs process, which will help people out of unemployment and back into the workforce, which will over time enable them to address their financial difficulties. <br/><br/>I would like to reassure the Deputy that the Government is very much aware of the difficulties facing those householders and individuals in difficulty meeting their mortgage repayments and it has acted decisively through the introduction of the above measures to tackle the issue of personal indebtedness in a comprehensive and practical manner.  The Government will continue to keep the issue of personal indebtedness under review through the Cabinet sub-Committee structure.</p></reply>

The measure being introduced treats individual shareholders who received &euro;1000 or less from Vodafone as being subject to capital gains tax rules even if they unintentionally made the incorrect choice.  </p><p>  The relief is primarily aimed at small shareholders whose Vodafone shares have their origin in the acquisition of Eircom shares back in 1999.  Many of these people were not professional investors, who invested small sums and who, even after the return of value, have made a loss on their original investment.  They will not pay any capital gains tax on the &euro;1,000 (or less) received.  It should be noted that a return of value of &euro;1,000 in the case of an original Eircom shareholder implies an original investment of about &euro;7,400.  I believe this is an appropriate cut-off point for the proposed relief.</p><p>  The circumstances described in the correspondence do not come within the terms of the proposed legislative amendment.  I do not consider it appropriate or feasible to address by way of legislation situations where people missed the required deadline for returning their choices to Computershare under the Vodafone return of value scheme, whether because they didn't post their instructions in a timely manner or their instructions were not handled in a timely manner on receipt by Computershare.</p></reply>

Based on the current PRD rates structure across all sectors of the public service, it is estimated that the deduction has raised &euro;5.5 billion since it was introduced in 2009 and it continues to be a critical component of the public service pay and pension measures adopted as part of our national fiscal consolidation.  Nevertheless, a start has been made in relation to the amelioration of the impact of PRD on public servants.  As legislated for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, and as provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement, the rate of PRD on the &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 band of pay received in a year fell from 5% to 2.5% on 1 January 2014.  This rate cut is worth &euro;125 annually in gross terms to most public servants, with those taxed at the standard rate enjoying the greater gain in terms of take-home pay boost.</p><p>  The powers granted by the Oireachtas under the Financial Emergency Measures legislation are temporary in nature and predicated on the presence of a financial emergency in the State.  The PRD is reviewable as part of my overall annual review of the wider set of emergency measures introduced under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009-2013.  In the last review conducted in June 2014, I concluded that it was necessary to continue to apply PRD.  My next annual report on PRD and the other emergency measures will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas by end-June 2015. </p></reply>

Under the Act, the only method of appointment to a Civil Service post - either permanent or fixed-term - is as result of being successful in a competition run by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) or by another licence holder such as the head of a Department or Office.  Selection processes are open to all eligible applicants who meet minimum entry criteria.  </p><p>  Agency staff are used for the provision of certain services in the public service such as, for example, facilities management or to meet demands in particular areas such as the health sector.  The use of agency staff is decided upon by individual organisations in the context of business needs in order to deliver the public services for which they are responsible.  In particular circumstances, labour market conditions in some sectors may be such that it is not possible to meet workforce needs other than through the use of agency personnel.   </p><p>  There are no plans to make such agency staff permanent staff which, in any event, could not be undertaken other than in accordance with the legal framework for recruitment into the public service as I have set out above.</p></reply>

The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (DoECLG) wrote to Kerry County Council on 27 February, 2014 indicating that, based on the estimate submitted by the Council to that Department, up to &euro;1,226,920 was being made available to the Council via the Office of Public Works (OPW) to undertake the necessary repair works to damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure identified by Kerry Council in its submission to the D/EC&amp;LG.</p><p>  The estimates submitted by Kerry County Council to the DoECLG included for repair works at Fahamore and strengthening works at Kilshannig estimated at &euro;3,000 and &euro;70,000 respectively.  However, significant strengthening works fall outside of the scope of the Government Decision and this was made clear to all local authorities.  Only the repair works such as those at Fahamore are covered under the allocation.  The programme of works the Council submitted to the OPW detailing how it proposes to spend the total allocation of &euro;1,226,920 included &euro;3,000 for works at Fahamore.  It did not include for works at Kilshannig.  This programme was approved and it is a matter for the Council to prioritise and progress these works and to draw down the funding that was allocated. </p><p>  While an application for funding for substantial strengthening works at Kilshannig estimated to cost &euro;500,000 was submitted by Kerry County Council to the OPW in the context of the storm damage funding process, this application was superceded by the letter of 27 February 2014 from the D/EC&amp;amp;LG to the Council informing it of its funding allocation under the Government decision. </p><p>  The application received from the Council in relation to the proposed significant works at Kilshannig was, in any event, only at a summary level and more detailed planning and feasibility studies and technical analysis would have to be carried out by the Council to ensure all options are fully assessed and considered and to facilitate the allocation of scarce public resources on a priority basis nationally.</p></reply>

To be classified as a Community Hall, the premises needs to be used for purposes which are not for profit or gain and involve participation by inhabitants of the locality generally and are used for purposes which are of a recreational or otherwise of a social nature.  Many sports clubs/organisations achieve exemption from rates of their property under this provision. <br/><br/>However, the Valuation Act, 2001 specifically excludes from this provision, the premises of a club registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904. Therefore, the premises of such a registered club are rateable, which essentially means that clubs that sell alcohol are rateable.  This provision currently has the effect of making the entire premises occupied by the club rateable and not just that part of the premises normally used for the sale of alcohol.  This is because the sale of alcohol is a commercial activity and a registered sports club is competing with other commercial licensed premises, all of which are rateable.<br/><br/>The Government recently announced that we will be proposing an amendment to the Valuation (Amendment)(No.2) Bill 2012 which is currently progressing through the Seanad that will ease the rates burden for many local sports clubs. <font color="#2F2F2F"> </font>The proposed amendment would mean that Community Sports Clubs will only be liable for rates on buildings that are used for the generation of income.  Buildings that are used for the sale of alcohol or food, retail outlets etc. will be rated but buildings that are used for community sport will be exempt.  <br/><br/>In proposing this amendment, we are conscious of situations where local sports clubs can be in competition with commercial operators.  For that reason it is not just the bar area of a sports club that will be valued for rates but any building that is used in the generation of income. <br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">The Bill is scheduled for report stage in the Seanad on 20th November.</font>If and when the legislation is passed, the Valuation Office will issue revised valuations for sports clubs affected by the new provisions to all rating authorities.</p></reply>

The Plan will also provide preliminary costings for the proposed measures.  Until the Plans are finalised, it is not possible therefore to determine the overall level of funding that will be required to implement the Plans and the measures contained therein.  I can confirm however, that I and the Government are committed to ensuring that flood risk management remains a priority area for funding within the overall public capital investment programme.</p><p>  A standardised methodology based on Multi-Criteria-Analysis (MCA), which will enable prioritisation of flood relief measures on a systematic and objective basis is currently being developed as part of the CFRAM Programme.  This is proposed to be based primarily on the overall benefits and impacts of the proposed measures, when assessed against a range of objectives including social, environmental, economic and technical relative to the cost of the measures.  A public consultation process on the aforementioned objectives is currently underway and details are available on the CFRAM website www.cfram.ie.</p><p>  The Government has prioritised investment in Flood Risk Management by allocating some &euro;225 million to the Office of Public Works (OPW) over the period 2012 to 2016 as part of its Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework, giving an annual average allocation of &euro;45 million.  This is a very substantial commitment in current difficult financial conditions and underlines the priority given to this area.  </p><p>  The OPW currently has three major schemes at various stages of construction with another seven schemes due to commence construction next year.  In addition, another twenty three schemes are at various stages of planning, many of which will be expected to move to construction in 2016-2017.  In addition, under the Minor Flood Mitigation &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme, funding has been provided for over 430 projects around the country, since it was introduced in 2009.</p></reply>

In accordance with normal procedure, the scheme documentation submitted to DPER included an Environmental Impact Statement which is a consultants report of the environmental impacts of the works and the Office of Public Works (OPW) proposals to mitigate those impacts as far as possible.</p><p>  The Claregalway scheme is the first flood relief scheme submitted for Confirmation following the introduction of new Regulations in 2012 to give effect in Irish law to EU Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment.  As the Consent Authority for flood alleviation schemes under Section 7 of the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 &ndash; 1995, the Regulations require the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to (a) carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment of drainage or flood relief schemes prior to Confirmation or approval of the proposed schemes and (b) publicise his decision to Confirm or refuse to Confirm a proposed drainage scheme, inform the Commissioners and the public of the decision and to provide for a process for appeal/review of the decision and inform the public of this process. </p><p>  Consultations took place with the Attorney General's Office in order to get clarification on how the new Regulations should be interpreted and implemented in the context of the Confirmation process for drainage schemes under the Arterial Drainage Acts.</p><p>  Based on advice received from the Attorney General's Office, DPER has engaged experts to carry out an independent review as part of the assessment of the Environmental Impact Statement of the Claregalway scheme that was submitted by the OPW.</p><p>  We currently await the outcome of the expert's review and the conclusion of the required public notification process.</p><p>  The OPW remains committed to ensuring that the scheme will be completed as soon as possible and has provided for the cost of the works in its profiles of capital expenditure to 2016.</p></reply>

My Department is currently reviewing this legislation as part of a wider review of consumer contract rights law, and I have asked that possible provisions to regulate the expiry date and other terms and conditions of gift vouchers be examined as part of this review.</p><p>  I am not aware of any specific statutory provisions on gift cards and vouchers in other EU Member States.  Federal legislation in the US prohibits the sale of gift cards with an expiry date of less than five years, while legislation in a number of Canadian provinces prohibits expiry dates for gift cards other than in very limited circumstances.  A recent detailed review of gift card products by the Australian Consumer Affairs Advisory Council, however, concluded that there was insufficient evidence of consumer detriment to warrant a regulatory response.</p></reply>

In this respect the Deputy may be aware that in May of this year the EU&rsquo;s Council of Ministers adopted a new Directive designed to better enforce the EU rules on the posting of workers and so provide more robust safeguards to protect the rights of posted workers and to prevent social dumping.  The Directive also aims to ensure fair competition between service providers and to improve co-operation and co-ordination between the relevant authorities of Member States.  The Directive is due to be transposed by June 2016.  A decision on the manner of transposition of the Directive has not yet been taken.  My Department will engage in a public consultation on the transposition of the Directive early in the new year.</p><p>  The Directive will provide significantly enhanced protection for workers being posted to Ireland and for those employees of Irish companies being posted to other Member States to fulfil contracts secured by their company.  When workers are being posted to Ireland, in future, our National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) will have to be informed of the identity of the service provider, the number of workers being posted, the duration of the posting, as well as details of the location and nature of the services to be provided.  There will also be a designated contacted person from the service provider to liaise with NERA and appropriate records will have to be maintained for inspection.  These provisions will greatly enhance the role of NERA in ensuring vulnerable workers are not exploited and Irish employment law is fully respected.  Similar provisions will have to be in place across the E.U. which will significantly enhance enforcement.</p><p>  Of equal importance, Irish companies will be protected from unfair competition on the domestic market by ensuring foreign service providers cannot unfairly undercut nationally determined terms of employment.  It also provides for more effective co-operation between national authorities like NERA in the area of enforcement.</p><p>  With respect to the Irish company that featured in the programme, I can confirm that NERA has co-operated fully, within the limits of its remit, with the relevant French authorities in respect of requests for assistance in relation to investigations in that jurisdiction.  NERA will continue to offer assistance, within its remit, to the French authorities and to the relevant authorities of other Member States that may seek its assistance.</p></reply>

They pull together all the players &ndash; other Government Departments and Agencies - to support everyone with a good business idea and strengthen the enterprise sector in the local area.  The LEOs are the first port of call in terms of advice, direction, training and, in certain circumstances, grant support for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business.  Contact details for the LEOs are available at .<br/><br/>The LEOs themselves provide a range of financial and non-financial supports to help enterprises at start-up or during business expansion phases.  It should be noted that the LEOs generally only grant assist enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector, which over time can develop into strong export entities and graduate to the Enterprise Ireland portfolio.  However, there are other potential supports available and the LEO staff can advise appropriately.  <br/><br/>For example, the LEOs can advise clients about the Department of Social Protection Back to Work and the Short-Term Enterprise Allowance (EA) Schemes, and the JobsPlus Scheme.  The EA Schemes are aimed at encouraging people getting certain social welfare payments to become self-employed by allowing them to retain a percentage of their social welfare payment for specified periods.  The JobsPlus Scheme is an incentive aimed at encouraging and rewarding employers who offer employment opportunities to the long term unemployed, with grants up to &euro;10,000 available to qualifying employers to offset wage costs where they engage jobseekers from the Live Register.<br/><br/>In addition, any business can use the LEOs as a gateway to accessing finance from Micro Finance Ireland (MFI), which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks.  The Fund available to MFI has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal.  Applications for the Microfinance Fund should be channelled through the local LEO.  Further information can be found on .<br/><br/>Businesses can also access the new online search tool for SME business supports that was launched last May.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is a cross-governmental initiative to help Irish start-ups and small businesses navigate the range of Government business supports for which they could be eligible.<br/><br/>By answering the eight questions in the Tool, a small business will, in one location be able to:<br/><br/>- Find out which of the over 80 Government business supports from 27 different Government Departments, Agencies and Initiatives are available to them;<br/><br/>- Obtain information on the range of Government supports for accessing credit;<br/><br/>- Identify their nearest Local Enterprise Office where they can discuss the outcomes of the guide further<br/><br/>- Download all these filtered results into a document for their further use.<br/><br/>The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at: .</p></reply>

Sanitary and phytosanitary measures have been discussed during all the rounds.  The EU tabled a draft text just before the last round, and it is expected that the US will do likewise in due course.  As regards market access in the agriculture sector, discussions to date have focused on non-tariff issues.  The EU has not yet made an offer with regard to tariffs.<br/><br/>While it is not yet clear when the TTIP negotiations will be concluded, there is an ambition on both sides to make all possible progress over the coming year towards a high standard TTIP agreement.<br/><br/>The EU Commission has put together answers to some frequently asked questions (FAQs) with regard to the TTIP negotiations, included in which is Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). The FAQs can be found at .  <br/><br/>The position of the EU is clearly set out here:  The EU will not be forced to change its laws on GMOs.  Under current EU rules, GMOs that have been approved for use as food, for animal feed or for sowing as crops can already be sold in the EU.  Applications for approval are assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and then sent to EU Member States for their opinion.  So far, 52 GMOs have been authorised.  The safety assessment which EFSA carries out before any GMO is placed on the market and the risk management procedure will not be affected by the negotiations.  <br/><br/>The EU and US already exchange information on policy, regulations and technical issues concerning GMOs and the TTIP is an opportunity to support this cooperation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-18a.362.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014111800061#WRJ01300"><p>The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a binding target of having 16% of its final energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland is committed to meeting this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy.  It is expected that approximately half of the 16% target will be met by energy from biomass.  While the development of the bioenergy sector can lead to both economic and environmental benefits in addition to contributing to reaching our renewable energy targets, there are particular benefits to the rural economy.  The SEAI and the Irish BioEnergy Association commissioned report - <i>Economic Benefits from the Development of BioEnergy</i><i>in Ireland to meet 2020 Targets</i>- found that a very significant proportion of the employment generated in both the construction and operation of the bioenergy facilities and infrastructure will be in rural Ireland. <br/><br/>The proposed new Rural Development Plan (RDP) 2014-2020 provides for some &euro;4 billion in European and national funds for investment in our agri-food industry and the rural economy over its lifetime.  One of the principal objectives of the draft RDP is to support the more sustainable management of natural resources.  The proposed suite of measures in the new RDP, which is currently being examined by the EU Commission, includes a separate Bioenergy Scheme to support the establishment of willow and miscanthus crops for use in renewable energy production.  Support under this measure is particularly aimed at overcoming barriers related to high set up and development costs associated with growing energy crops which are considered a carbon-neutral fuel. The proposed measure will provide grant aid to facilitate the establishment of energy crops and will be paid in respect of ground preparation, seed purchase and planting costs.  In addition to the Bioenergy Scheme, other potential investments in renewable energies can be considered under the LEADER element of the RDP where local development strategies seek to address the cross-cutting issue of climate change.<br/><br/>My officials are at present engaged in intensive bilateral discussions with the Commission with a view to reaching early agreement on a range of informational, technical and policy matters.  Pending formal approval of the draft RDP, my Department will continue to examine the best approach to supporting the bioenergy sector.<br/><br/>However, the vast bulk of biomass in this country is, and will continue to be, provided by the forestry sector.  After wind energy, wood fuel is the largest contributor to renewable energy generation in Ireland. In 2013, 33% of the roundwood harvested in the Republic of Ireland, or over one million cubic metres, was used for energy generation.  The Department&rsquo;s draft forestry programme covering the period 2014 &ndash; 2020 recognises the need to increase the supply of biomass in order to meet renewable energy targets. <br/><br/>My Department also provides information on wood availability and location through the national roundwood forecast system and supports the Wood Fuel Quality Assurance Scheme run by the Irish Bioenergy Association.<br/><br/>Over the last year my Department has worked closely with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in developing the recently published draft Bioenergy Plan. The draft plan (available at ) is to be subject to Strategic Environmental and Appropriate Assessment, including public consultation, which will inform the shape of the finalised plan.  <br/><br/>The plan sets out the broader context for the development of energy from biomass, and the current status with regard to the range of policy areas that must be coordinated in order to create the conditions necessary to support the sustainable development of this sector.  The plan also identifies the necessary next steps to be taken by various government departments, agencies and State bodies in this regard. <br/><br/>In terms of bioenergy's role in meeting Ireland's renewable energy targets, the draft plan recommends the continuation of the most significant biomass policy currently in place which is the REFIT schemes.  Furthermore, the analysis underpinning the plan is that an additional bioenergy-focused measure in the heat sector represents the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals.  Therefore, the Plan also recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources including biomass. The RHI scheme, once designed, will require State Aid approval from the European Commission and further Government approval.  It is proposed to have the scheme in place in 2016.</p></reply>

Measures under his remit in relation to the protection of our surface waters include the following:   </p><p> The Water Framework Directive provides a wide ranging basis for the protection and improvement of inland surface waters, groundwater and transitional and coastal waters.  The Directive requires that Member States take a catchment-based approach to the protection of waters by establishing river basin districts and management plans for these districts.  Comprehensive monitoring of these waters is carried out by Local Authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency.   </p><p>  In addition, measures to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, from agricultural pollution are contained in Ireland's third National Nitrates Action Programme which is given legal effect by the consolidated European Union (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2014. </p><p>  These Regulations establish a legal requirement for farmers to comply with good agricultural practice in the management of all fertilisers on their farms, including manures and slurries.  My Department checks compliance with these Regulations under the Cross-Compliance process and also carries out farm inspections on behalf of Local Authorities.   </p><p>  My Department also funds the Teagasc Agricultural Catchment Programme (ACP), established for the purpose of monitoring the effectiveness of the Nitrates Regulations.  This Programme has published work which shows a positive change in lake water quality.  The decrease in diffuse nutrient losses arises from a combination of agri-environment schemes, the introduction of a group water scheme and the implementation of the Nitrates Regulations.</p><p>  In 2012, the EPA published an interim report entitled &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Environment 2012&rsquo; which related to the 2008-2010 period.  This report ranks Ireland favourably in a comparison of nutrients and chlorophyll against other European countries.  Ireland has the third lowest concentrations of total phosphorus; the fourth lowest concentrations of chlorophyll and ammonia; and the seventh lowest concentrations of nitrate in a representative network of lakes.</p></reply>

This technology has been concentrated on the development of useful agronomic traits in the production of grain maize, cotton, sugar beet, etc.  The EU has authorised the cultivation of only one GM cultivar of maize (predominantly grown in Spain).  The trait in that cultivar is aimed at the control of the corn borer pest and the use of this variety negates the need for multiple applications of insecticides. <br/><br/>The <i>Seralini</i>study quoted in the question has been discredited with the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) finding that the methodology used in the study was flawed and the conclusions drawn not justified by the data provided.<br/><br/>Regarding the use of glyphosate on herbicide tolerant crops outside the EU, both the GM trait utilised in the crop seed and the herbicide glyphosate have undergone rigorous testing throughout the world. <br/><br/>Glyphosate was reviewed in 2002, as part of the EU plant protection product review programme which has allowed its use to date.  The initial review in 2002 was carried out by Germany acting as the Rapporteur Member State (RMS) and this evaluation was peer reviewed by the other EU Member States.  A re-review is currently underway, with Germany again acting as the RMS with Slovakia acting as a Co-RMS.  The process of peer reviewing the evaluation is coming to a conclusion and it is expected that this process will be completed within the next 6 months. <br/><br/>All uses of glyphosate approved in Ireland are in line with approved uses in all other EU Member States.  Uses are only granted if the appropriate risk assessment indicates that safe uses are possible under normal conditions.  Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 regulates the authorisation, marketing and use of plant protection products (PPPs) and as such each registration must conform to the norms, methodologies and principles contained therein.  Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) are currently in place facilitating all currently registered uses.<br/><br/>Regulatory Authorities throughout the world have assessed its safety for human health through oral, dermal and inhalation toxicity studies involving single, repeat and lifetime exposure in rats, mice, rabbits and dogs.  Additionally, there are highly specific tests that evaluate whether glyphosate has any impact on genotoxicity, neurotoxicity, reproductive and developmental parameters and to assess if glyphosate has any carcinogenicity potential following long term exposure.<br/><br/>The comprehensive health assessments conducted by public authorities over the past 40 years have consistently concluded that glyphosate does not pose any unacceptable risk to human health or the environment.</p></reply>

However, it is the case that airline carriers in many instances require their passengers to have a passport in possession before allowing them to board the aircraft. As such, this is not an immigration requirement. Unlike the operational practices at some UK airports, there is generally no segregation of arriving passengers at Irish ports of entry to the State. Consequently, Immigration Officers performing immigration control duties at airports in the State do not know where passengers have travelled from when such passengers present at immigration control desks. It is, therefore, necessary for Immigration Officers to establish where passengers have arrived from, and in order to do this, an Immigration Officer may ask passengers questions with a view to establishing their nationality and port of embarkation. Once satisfied that a person is a citizen of the Common Travel Area (CTA) and that such person has travelled from the United Kingdom, the Immigration Officer will make no further requirement of that person. </p><p>  In circumstances where a person, who is a national of the jurisdictions that form the Common Travel Area, and who has travelled from within the CTA and is not in possession of a passport, an Immigration Officer, in compliance with their duties under immigration legislation, is duty-bound to ask questions designed to establish that the person is a national of the jurisdictions that form the CTA and has travelled from within the CTA and as such is entitled to benefit from its immigration arrangements.</p><p>  For the sake of completeness, I should add that border entry practices in the UK for CTA arrivals vary considerably from place to place. For example, in some UK regional airports, police officers on occasion seek identity documents for passengers from this jurisdiction. In other cases, evidence of having boarded an aircraft in Ireland is sought.</p><p>  In recent years, personnel at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and in the UK immigration authorities have detected abuses within the Common Travel Area. Movements of illegal persons, suspected human trafficking, illegal immigration and substantial levels of social welfare fraud are among the consequences of such abuse. The cooperation of all passengers arriving in the State, including Irish and UK citizens who have travelled from the UK, greatly enhances the ability of Immigration personnel, both here and in the UK, to prevent and detect illegal immigration and associated criminality. </p><p>  It should be noted that in fulfilling their duties at the frontiers of the State members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilise a range of legislative provisions. In particular, such officers will, where necessary, enforce the provisions at section 33 of Air Navigation &amp;amp; Transport Act, 1988, which states, an authorised officer, in the interest of the proper operation or the security or safety of an aerodrome, or the security or safety of persons, aircraft or other property thereon, may require any person on an aerodrome to:</p><p>  - give his name and address and to produce other evidence of his or her identity;</p><p>  - state the purpose of his being on the aerodrome;</p><p>  - account for any baggage or other property which may be in his possession.</p></reply>

Moreover, the circumstances of each case may vary as between someone who has made a will and someone who has died without having done so, and in relation to the legal standing of that person or of a potential beneficiary. I am also aware that other parties concerned in the settling of a deceased's estate such as the banks, financial institutions and the Revenue Commissioners, will have parallel requirements to ensure this is carried out in an orderly fashion in each particular case. <br/><br/>It is my understanding, from inquiries made by my Department, that the Probate Office does not determine when a Grant of Representation needs to be extracted in the estate of a deceased person. Where moneys are held in financial institutions it is for that institution to indicate whether or not they require a grant in order to pay the monies over to the legal personal representative of the estate. Some financial institutions will pay out small amounts of money but the monetary amount in question appears to vary from institution to institution.  As far as I can ascertain, therefore, there is no regulatory requirement for a solicitor, when drafting a will, to advise the testator that probate may be required if the amount distributed exceeds a specific threshold.  Rather, it would seem that such thresholds tend to arise under the administrative requirements of financial institutions in releasing funds of deceased customers.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the above, should a client have concerns about the conduct of a solicitor in dealing with matters relating to wills or probate, then he or she may wish to make a complaint under the Solicitors Acts 1954-2011. Under the Acts the Law Society is the designated regulatory body for solicitors in the State and complaints should be made within that legislative framework. An aggrieved client wishing to make such a complaint under the Solicitors Acts should contact the Law Society directly. Much of the relevant information, including the Society&rsquo;s contact details, is to be found on the website including guidance on how to make a complaint.  The independent Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal is a further route of redress for anyone who is unhappy with the legal services they received from a solicitor.

The report rightly acknowledges the dedication and commitment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and indeed notes that many of the issues raised had been identified in other comparable police forces. <br/><br/>The Report will play an important role in the overall justice reform programme underway, including the establishment of an independent Police Authority, strengthening the powers of GSOC, and the open competition for the recruitment of the Garda Commissioner. <br/><br/>Implementation of this programme is being overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform, chaired by An Taoiseach, and this Committee will also now take on a role in overseeing delivery of the reforms recommended by the Inspectorate. <br/><br/>There will also of course be a central role for the new Police Authority and Garda Commissioner in implementing the identified reform.  Ahead of the establishment of the Policing Authority, I intend to hold discussions with Josephine Feehily, the Chairman-designate, on the establishment of an effective implementation framework to oversee delivery of reforms in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, along the lines recommended by the Inspectorate.<br/><br/>The incoming Garda Commissioner, who is due to be appointed shortly following an open competition, will also be central in driving implementation of many of the reforms arising from the Inspectorate&rsquo;s analysis.  In advance of this appointment, I have already welcomed the decision of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to establish an Implementation Steering Group to immediately focus on the implementation of the short<font color="#2F2F2F">, </font>medium and long-term recommendations in the Report, and a programme of Risk compliance and Continuous Improvement Teams which will be introduced in each region to support a revised focus on professional standards and to tackle any weaknesses identified in the Inspectorate's report.  I have also asked the Acting Commissioner for an overall response to the Report and its recommendations.<br/><br/>In addition, upon publication of the Report I set out a further comprehensive series of measures being taken to address the issues identified by the Inspectorate including:<br/><br/>- plans for the necessary and early investment in upgrading Garda technology to bring outdated paper based practices into the 21st century;<br/><br/>- new Garda measures to improve consistency and accuracy of data;<br/><br/>- a review of the report by the CSO to see whether and to what extent it may have implications for the crime statistics which that Office produces;<br/><br/>- an expert group to be chaired by the CSO to examine its recommendations, including in relation to crime counting and detection rules, with a view to introducing new national standards;<br/><br/>- measures to improve supports for victims, including victims of domestic and sexual violence. <br/><br/>It is clear from the Report that developments in systems and processes in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have not kept pace with developments in broader society and police forces globally.  The Report's analysis has been welcomed by Government and we are determined to act on it.  I can assure the Deputy that we will work to equip An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to meet all of the challenges of 21st century policing, and to put the needs of victims first.</p></reply>

The General Scheme has been referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for scrutiny in parallel with the priority drafting of the Bill which will be brought before the Oireachtas as soon as practicable.</p><p>  The General Scheme sets out a broad range of measures which are required for the introduction of a very significant level of independent public accountability on the part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the delivery of policing services.

The Bill is, therefore, a key component of the Government's strategy to bring greater transparency to legal costs and to reduce their burden on consumers and enterprise. <br/><br/>The Bill makes extensive provision, in Part 10, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged by legal practitioners, along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients. Legal practitioners, whether solicitors or barristers, will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients. This will be in the form of a Notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions. Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in section 117 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not reasonably practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated. A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question. In addition, the Bill sets out that it will not be permissible for legal practitioners to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business and that it will no longer be permissible for barristers to charge junior counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees.<br/><br/>An aggrieved client also has the option of applying for the taxation of disputed legal costs by the Office of the Taxing-Master.  Under the Legal Services Regulation Bill the current functions of the Taxing-Master will be taken over by the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator. The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles. These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account in the adjudication of disputed legal costs. The Bill also provides for the establishment of a public Register of Determinations which will disclose the outcomes and reasons for decisions made by the Legal Costs Adjudicator.<br/><br/>In addition, the Bill seeks to achieve greater flexibility in the legal-services market, more competition and improved access to justice and will pave the way for the introduction of new business structures for legal practitioners which will enable cooperation across a range of legal and other professions so that knowledge and expertise can be joined to meet the needs of consumers in a more modern and cost-effective way. <br/><br/>The various new legal cost transparency measures that I have set out will apply to barristers as well as to solicitors and will enable those availing of legal services to identify costs and their basis more clearly, including by way of comparison with other possible legal service providers and in relation to any potential award. I would expect that, along with those other cost reduction measures that have been introduced by the Government in the procurement of legal services by State Bodies, the new legal costs regime and new legal business models will help reduce such costs and their burden on clients.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>These changes, along with other measures being introduced in the Legal Services Regulation Bill, will better balance the interests of consumers and those of legal practitioners thereby supporting greater competition and choice in the provision of legal services in the State.</p></reply>

The Report proposes the adoption of a penal policy with the dual purposes of punishment and rehabilitation both in the imposition and management of criminal sanctions.</p><p>  The Review Group identified rehabilitation and reintegration as a core principle and significant factor in reducing crime and considers that such aims are best achieved in a non-custodial environment as far as possible.  In my view, prison is not the only solution when it comes to those convicted of lesser non violent offences.  Re-offending can also be tackled head on by imposing a supervised community sanction, with appropriate supports, which could see punishment being served, but which would also lead, not only to rehabilitation, but to a reduced risk of re-offending. </p><p>  In that context, I intend to proceed with the Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill which will strengthen the legislative framework for supervised community sanctions.  In addition, the roll out of the Community Return Programme is continuing.  This is a scheme where carefully selected prisoners can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work.  The scheme represents a move away from releasing prisoners in an unstructured way. </p><p>  Recidivism studies by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), which are available on my Department's website www.justice.ie, have shown that offenders who received either a Probation Order or a Community Service Order in 2007 and 2008 had a re-offending rate nearly 50% lower than those who had received a custodial sentence (41% vs 62%).  This shows that supervised community sanctions can help to reduce re-offending, thereby reducing crime.  </p><p>  As I have stated previously, the publication of these studies will allow the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service access to a comprehensive bank of data in relation to the rate of recidivism among ex-prisoners and offenders.  Along with the implementation of the recommendations of the Penal Policy Review Group, this will help to inform future policy on the management of offenders and will facilitate the formulation of new strategies aimed at reducing recidivism.</p></reply>

There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.<br/><br/>Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  Section 2(2)(d) provides that in exercising its jurisdiction under that section, a court shall take into account and may receive evidence or submissions concerning any conviction of the accused person for an offence committed while he or she was on bail.<br/><br/>In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.  <br/><br/>The criminal law takes a serious view of offences committed by persons on bail.  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served. It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.<br/><br/>I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences continue to be committed by persons on bail. In this regard, I can inform the Deputy that the preparation of the General Scheme of a Bail Bill to modernise the law on bail is at a very advanced stage and I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>While the primary aim of the proposed Bail Bill is to consolidate and update bail law, I wish to take the opportunity to seek, as far as is possible, within the constraints of the Constitution and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, to focus the legislation on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new provisions will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>The new Bill will seek to improve the operation of the bail system and make the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against the commission of offences by persons on bail.</p></reply>

The Commissioner has advised that the Garda Reserve continue to be a significant additional resource available to the Force in terms of supplementing its policing and other functions. I would also like to record my appreciation to Garda Reserve members for the contribution and service they make on a daily basis to the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Together with full time members, they provide vital assistance to communities and neighbourhoods right across the country.<br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that the competition for recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was run by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Garda Commissioner.  It is important that all persons wishing to join the full time force undergo the same competitive selection and recruitment process. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 2013 provides that in a competition for full-time membership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Public Appointments Service shall take into account<i>&quot;any satisfactory service by the person as a reserve member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&quot;</i>.  This provision was introduced in order to acknowledge the beneficial experience and skills gained by a Reserve member and to allow them the opportunity to highlight that experience and skill at any stage of the selection process.<br/><br/>As you will be aware the first intake since 2009 of 100 new recruits commenced training in the Garda College, Templemore, on 15  September 2014. This marked a positive step forward for policing in Ireland.  I would like to point out that twenty-five of this intake were former members of the Garda Reserve.  The process of recruiting 200 additional Garda&iacute; will continue over the next few months. This will bring to 300 the number of recruits in the Garda College and is a measure of this Government's commitment to ensure that recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues seamlessly. The recruits who are already in training will attest as members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in May of 2015 and will be assigned to Garda stations throughout the country by the Garda Commissioner.</p></reply>

However, the Deputy will appreciate that, on occasion, it is necessary for vulnerable prisoners and others to be separated from the general prison population.  <br/><br/>The restriction of a prisoner's regime can occur due to a number of factors including, the protection of vulnerable prisoners.  This is provided for under Rule 63 of the Prison Rules 2007.  A prisoner may, either at his/her own request or when the Governor considers it necessary, in so far as is practicable and subject to the maintenance and good order and safe and secure custody, be kept separate from other prisoners who are reasonably likely to cause significant harm to him/her. <br/><br/>In addition, the Governor may decide, for the maintenance of good order in the prison, to remove a prisoner from general association or structured activity to reduce the negative effect that a prisoner or prisoners may have on the general population.  This is provided for under Rule 62 of the Prison Rules 2007.  There may also be a smaller number of prisoners who would be restricted for medical (Rule 64) or discipline reasons (Rule 67).<br/><br/>The fact that prisoners seeking protection are immediately separated from the general population or from specific prisoners identified as presenting a threat, clearly demonstrates the commitment of the Irish Prison Service to ensure their safety and security.  The status of each prisoner on restricted regime within the prison system is regularly reviewed and they have access to full medical services.  If possible, prisoners can be transferred to other institutions where a restricted regime would not be necessary.<br/><br/>The Irish Prison Service Statistics Unit commenced the collation of a quarterly Census of Restricted Regime Prisoners in 2013.<br/><br/>The number of prisoners on a Restricted Regime 01 October 2014 is set out in the table.<table><tr><th><div>-</div></th><th><div>Prisoners on Restricted Regime</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Mountjoy Male</div></td><td><div>54</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Dochas</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>St. Patrick&rsquo;s</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Cork</div></td><td><div>32</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Limerick </div></td><td><div>60</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Castlerea</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Cloverhill</div></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Wheatfield</div></td><td><div>65</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Portlaoise</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Arbour Hill</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Midlands</div></td><td><div>22</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Training Unit</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Loughan House</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Shelton Abbey</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Total</div></td><td><div>246</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

It is the case that all incidents of this nature are subject to full and determined investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br/><br/>The Deputy will also be aware from my previous correspondence with him in relation to his proposals for a Ramming of Garda Vehicles Bill, which has been the subject of further consideration, is that there is already a range of robust road safety and other legislative enforcement provisions available to the Garda authorities in such circumstances. <br/><br/>Such legislative provisions include the wide range of assault offences contained in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and for which penalties range from up to 5 years imprisonment to life imprisonment depending on the seriousness of the offence involved.  In addition, section 19 Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 provides for specific offences relating to assaults on &quot;peace officers&quot; which includes members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The penalty for this offence was increased from 5 to 7 years imprisonment by section 185 Criminal Justice Act 2006 which also provided for the criminalisation of threats to assault.  I would also add that section 2 Criminal Damage Act 1991 provides for the offence of damage to the property of another person for which the penalty is a maximum of 10 years imprisonment.  The Road Traffic Act 1961 (as amended) provides for offences of driving without reasonable consideration, careless driving and dangerous driving, and an offence of dangerous driving which causes death or serious bodily harm carrying a penalty of up to 10 years imprisonment.  In addition, as the Deputy will appreciate if the ramming of a Garda vehicle resulted in a death,  an offence of attempted murder, murder or manslaughter may be considered applicable  with the resultant penalties including mandatory life imprisonment for a conviction for murder. <br/><br/>In so far as the Deputy's proposals concerning presumptive mandatory sentencing are concerned, I would draw his attention to the Law Reform Commission 2013 Report on Mandatory Sentences, which recommends the repeal of the existing presumptive mandatory minimum sentence provisions for various drugs and firearms offences.  I would also note that the Report on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy which was published in September recommended that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences should be introduced.  <br/><br/>I have requested an updated Garda report in relation to the number of Garda&iacute; injured arising from such incidents and will contact the Deputy directly as soon as that information is available.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

The aim of this Protocol is to manage the distribution of methadone and minimise the risk of diversion for onward sale.</p><p>  I am further informed that as methadone is a controlled drug there is an audit procedure for the total volumes of supply through the wholesalers which is overseen by the Health Products Regulatory Authority. </p><p>  With regard to the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I can inform the Deputy that drug law enforcement remains a key priority area for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in accordance with its role under the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 and the priorities identified in the annual Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Policing Plan. The Garda National Drugs Unit works closely with dedicated Divisional and District Drug Units and other national units in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.  </p><p>  The Annual Reports of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provide further information concerning the type and value of illegal drugs seized by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na each year including methadone seizures.</p><p>  I have requested An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide a report on the issue raised by the Deputy and I will contact the Deputy again as soon as the information is received.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of all resources, including fully sworn members and Reserve Garda&iacute;, among the Garda Regions, Divisions and Districts.  Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review in the context of security assessments, crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b><br/><br/>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of Tallaght, Rathfarnham and Kilmainham Garda Stations on 30 September 2014, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was as set out in the table.<table><tr><th>Station</th><th>Garda</th><th>Reserve</th><th>Civilian</th></tr><tr><td>Tallaght</td><td>171</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Rathfarnham</td><td>72</td><td>6</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Kilmainham</td><td>72</td><td>9</td><td>2</td></tr></table><br/><br/>As you will be aware the first intake since 2009 of 100 new recruits entered training at the Garda College in Templemore on Monday, 15th September 2014.

Having considered the file the DPP advised that the file did not warrant prosecution of any individual.  Thereafter GSOC considered and decided against launching any investigation of matters which may constitute indiscipline.<br/><br/>The Report by GSOC also contained a series of recommendations related to informant handling procedures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, oversight of those procedures, as well as intelligence handling and information exchange between GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <br/><br/>At the time my predecessor sought the observations of the Garda Commissioner on the Report and its recommendations.  In response, the Garda Commissioner pointed out that following the putting in place of a code of practice for the management of Covert Human Intelligence Sources many of the recommendations made by GSOC were already incorporated into Garda procedures.  The Commissioner also emphasised that informants are clearly instructed that they may not commit crimes or act as <i>agents provocateur. </i><br/><br/>I should emphasise that there has been, since 2010, an independent, external oversight mechanism in place to ensure compliance with the code of practice.  The current holder of this appointment is Mr. Justice Thomas Smyth, former judge of the High Court.  Mr Justice Smyth's report for 2012 has been published and I am currently making arrangements to publish his reports for 2013 and 2014.  I am pleased to note that the Judge has indicated that he received full co-operation from relevant members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in compiling his report and he records substantial compliance with the code of practice by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br/><br/>I should mention that the recent Inspectorate report makes a number of recommendations in relation to the handling of information and these will be addressed.<br/><br/>A Memorandum of Understanding, Protocols and Agreement on Operational Matters, agreed by the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC), has been in place between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC since the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in 2007.  However, a new Memorandum of Understanding, Protocols and Agreement on Operational Matters has been agreed between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC and was signed by the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission on 23rd September, 2013.  The Memorandum of Understanding agrees protocols for operational matters between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC, including the provision of information to GSOC by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br/><br/>There is continued ongoing co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC to address any issues that arise during the course of an investigation.  A working relationship is maintained between the two organisations with regular formal and informal meetings between senior management representatives.  In addition, the Garda Commissioner has established a dedicated office (GSOC Liaison Office) to process and monitor all such requests and ensure that all correspondence with GSOC is attended to in a timely manner. <br/><br/>In the context of Garda oversight generally, the Deputy will be aware that I recently introduced the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014.  The main purpose of the Bill  is to amend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to expand the remit and powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC).  The Bill will bring the Garda Commissioner within the remit of GSOC for the first time.  It will also ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides information sought by GSOC for an investigation as soon as practicable.</p></reply>

There are also 1,112 Garda Reserves and over 2,000 Civilians.<br/><br/>The key objective of the station closures in 2012 and 2013 was to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources.

The Commissioner estimated that there are 61,000 more man hours available for frontline services following the station closures.<br/><br/>There are currently over 2,000 full-time-equivalent civilian support staff in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Civilian staff provide vital support services in a wide range of areas, such as human resources, training and development, IT and telecommunications, finance and procurement, internal audit, research and analysis, accommodation and fleet management, scene-of-crime support and medical services.

As regards the existing ground rents, Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act 1978 contains a statutory scheme whereby a person may, at reasonable cost, acquire the fee simple in their dwelling.  Comprehensive details of the manner in which the fee simple can be acquired under this scheme are available on the Property Registration Authority's website (www.prai.ie).  In the case of property other than dwellings, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967 contains provisions which facilitate acquisition of the fee simple in certain cases subject to agreed terms or on terms set out in an arbitration carried out by the County Registrar.</p><p>  As regards the number of dwellings and other properties on which ground rents remain payable, the position is that no such data are available.  The title deeds of individual properties normally contain all the relevant covenants, including details of any arrangements for the payment of ground rent and the amounts involved.  To date, over 80,000 applicants have acquired the freehold title to their properties under the statutory scheme operate by the Property Registration Authority.</p><p>  The position regarding ground rents was considered by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in their 2004 Report 'Private Property'.  The Committee took the view that a ground rent is a form of property right which is constitutionally protected and that abolition of such rents would be unconstitutional in the absence of adequate monetary compensation.  The Committee also noted that where leases were approaching expiry, any legislation providing for the abolition of ground rents would have to provide for the payment of enhanced compensation.  While I have no immediate plans to introduce further legislation in this area, operation of the existing law continues to be kept under review by my Department.</p></reply>

The Government response to the problem is set out in the National Drugs Strategy for the period 2009-2016.  The Strategy provides a co-ordinated and comprehensive response to the issue of drug misuse, founded on a partnership approach.</p><p>  The Strategy, which is being delivered under the stewardship of my colleague Minister for Health, Mr. Leo Varadkar T.D., adopts a pillar based approach to the problem, involving the implementation of a wide range of measures across the five pillars of drug supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department and its agencies continue to actively participate in all of the structures in place under the Strategy and will continue with the ongoing implementation of all actions related to the criminal justice sector as set out in the Strategy.</p><p>  More generally, with regard to the issue of anti-social behaviour in Dublin city I would refer the Deputy to my response earlier today to Parliamentary Question No. 91 in which I outlined the current position regarding action being taken to deal with concerns raised regarding the safety of the city centre.</p><p>  In relation to the question of sentencing, as the Deputy will appreciate, judges are independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  The approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.</p></reply>

The very broad nature of the policing issues that have come to attention requires a multi-faceted response.  Overall, the Government&rsquo;s objective is to ensure that the confidence of the public in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is maintained and bring forward the necessary change so that the high quality and respected service that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has provided is continued and enhanced to better meet the realities, requirements and expectations of 21st century policing.</p><p>  Considerable progress has already been achieved with regard to the various elements of the Government reform programme and, in particular, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the following developments:</p><p> - The Independent Review Mechanism, consisting of a panel of counsel established to examine approximately 300 complaints alleging Garda misconduct or problems with investigating misconduct, is continuing its work and has made significant progress;</p><p> - The Public Appointments Service is currently managing the first open competition to appoint a new Garda Commissioner.  It is expected that the new Commissioner will be appointed by early December;</p><p> - Following a process undertaken by the Public Appointments Service seeking expressions of interest, the Government has recently nominated Ms Josephine Feehily as the Chairperson-designate for the forthcoming Independent Policing Authority.  As Chairperson-designate Ms Feehily will assist in the final round of the recruitment process for the appointment of the Garda Commissioner as well as preparations for the establishment of the Authority;</p><p> - I have published the General Scheme of a Bill to provide for the establishment of the new Independent Policing Authority.  The General Scheme has been referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for scrutiny in parallel with the priority drafting of the Bill which will be introduced in the Oireachtas as soon as practicable;</p><p> - I have also recently published the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate&rsquo;s crime inspection report.  The report deals with crime recording and investigation, and also deals with some of the concerns raised by Mr. Se&aacute;n Guerin SC in his report to the Government earlier this year in respect of certain Garda actions.  The report contains more than 200 recommendations for implementation which are being actively pursued;</p><p> - Work is being finalised on the establishment of a Commission of Investigation into matters identified in the Guerin report;</p><p> - The Fennelly Commission of Investigation set up to examine the operation of telephone recording systems in certain Garda Stations over many years, as well as other matters, recently sought an extension to its end of 2014 deadline for the submission of its report.  However, the Commission has indicated that it will submit an interim report in respect of specific issues;</p><p> - The report of Judge Cooke&rsquo;s inquiry into reports of unlawful surveillance of GSOC has been published and GSOC has published a redacted version of the report it commissioned into the possible disclosure of confidential information;</p><p> - The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014 has been introduced to expand the remit and powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC).  In addition the Bill contains measures to clarify certain matters raised in Judge Cooke&rsquo;s report and amendments are also being made to legislation in respect of the exercise of certain police powers by GSOC;</p><p> - The review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Haddington Road Agreement is expected to be completed shortly and encompasses all aspects of the operation and administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</p><p> - I published the Report of the Independent Review Group on the Department of Justice and Equality in July and I am working closely with the Department&rsquo;s senior management team to implement the report&rsquo;s recommendations;</p><p> - The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 has amended Garda legislation to allow Garda members to make &ldquo;protected disclosures&rdquo; to GSOC in confidence in respect of alleged Garda misconduct.  The relevant provisions of the Act have been brought into operation;</p><p> - The recently enacted Freedom of Information Act 2014 extends to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

This represents 92% occupancy.<br/><br/>I wish to inform the Deputy that at the end of October 2014, there were 3,143 usable cells in the prison system.  2,026 prisoners were accommodated in single cells which accounted for 53% of all prisoners (3,806).  In addition, there were 687 cells which accommodated 2 prisoners, 94 cells which accommodated 3 prisoners and 28 cells which accommodated 4 or more prisoners.  As the Deputy will appreciate the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts into its custody and does not have the option of refusing committals.<br/><br/>I can inform the Deputy that all committals to the prison service are dealt with in a manner which ensures the safety of the prisoner themselves, the staff and the entire prisoner population.  Each prisoner is placed in accommodation deemed appropriate to the individual based on the information made available to the prison staff on committal, which would include, health, offence, criminal connections and possible conflicts with other prisoners.<br/><br/>There are 14 institutions in the Irish prison system consisting of 11 traditional 'closed' prisons, 2 open centres and 1 semi-open centre.

Refurbishment of the A wing commenced in early January 2013 and was completed early this year.  Work and refurbishment work on the D wing is almost complete, it is hoped that the works which include in-cell sanitation will be completed by the third quarter of 2015.<br/><br/>In relation to Cork Prison, a contract for the construction of a new prison to replace the existing facility was awarded late last year and construction began in January, 2014 with an estimated completion date in the third quarter of 2015.<br/><br/>The Business Case for the Limerick Prison redevelopment project was submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in June of last year and approval has been received to advance the project to detailed design stage.</p></reply>

The Inspector of Prisons has recommended a total of 3,982 prisoners in custody.  As of 16 November 2014 there was 3,739 prisoners in custody, or 94% of the Inspector's recommended total.<br/><br/>A full breakdown to include, capacity, number in custody and percentage of bed capacity is set out in the following table as of November 16th 2014.<table><tr><th><b>Institution</b></th><th><b>Bed Capacity</b></th><th><b>Number in Custody</b></th><th><b>% of Bed Capacity</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>Mountjoy Campus</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>-</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Mountjoy (M)</b></td><td>548</td><td>536</td><td>97%</td></tr><tr><td><b>Mountjoy (F)</b></td><td>105</td><td>111</td><td>106%</td></tr><tr><td><b>Training Unit</b></td><td>96</td><td>80</td><td>83%</td></tr><tr><td><b>St Patrick&rsquo;s </b></td><td>34</td><td>7</td><td>21%</td></tr><tr><td><b>West Dublin Campus</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>-</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Cloverhill</b></td><td>431</td><td>360</td><td>84%</td></tr><tr><td><b>Wheatfield</b></td><td>550</td><td>482</td><td>88%</td></tr><tr><td><b>Portlaoise Campus</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>-</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Midlands</b></td><td>870</td><td>800</td><td>92%</td></tr><tr><td><b>Portlaoise</b></td><td>291</td><td>234</td><td>80%</td></tr><tr><td><b>Cork</b></td><td>210</td><td>218</td><td>104%</td></tr><tr><td><b>Limerick (M)</b></td><td>220</td><td>225</td><td>102%</td></tr><tr><td><b>Limerick (F)</b></td><td>28</td><td>27</td><td>96%</td></tr><tr><td><b>Castlerea</b></td><td>340</td><td>317</td><td>93%</td></tr><tr><td><b>Arbour Hill</b></td><td>142</td><td>139</td><td>98%</td></tr><tr><td><b>Loughan House</b></td><td>140</td><td>105</td><td>75%</td></tr><tr><td><b>Shelton Abbey</b></td><td>115</td><td>98</td><td>85%</td></tr><tr><td><b>Totals</b></td><td><b>4,126</b></td><td><b>3,739</b></td><td><b>91%</b></td></tr></table><br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that the average number of prisoners in custody in Ireland has risen in recent years, from 3,321 during 2007 to 4,318 during 2012, an increase of over 30%. Likewise the total number of committals to prison has also risen sharply during the same period, from 11,934 in 2007 to 17,026 in 2012 &ndash; an increase of over 43%.<br/><br/>2013 saw the first significant decrease in prison numbers since 2007. There were 15,735 committals to prison in 2013 which was a decrease of 7.6% on the 2012 figure.<br/><br/>In addition, a 40 month capital programme is being implemented to eliminate slopping out and to improve prison conditions in the older part of the prison estate. I am advised by my officials that work is continuing on the modernisation project at Mountjoy prison. &quot;D&quot; Wing is the last wing in Mountjoy requiring refurbishment and on the completion of this, all cells in Mountjoy prison will have in cell sanitation facilities. Works commenced in early June, 2014 with a completion date of the second quarter in 2015.  This will eliminate slopping out in Mountjoy Prison by 2015. Planning is continuing in respect of the refurbishment and modernisation of &quot;D&quot; Wing workshops.<br/><br/>In relation to Cork Prison, a contract for the construction of a new prison to replace the existing facility was awarded late last year and construction began in January, 2014 with a completion date on the third quarter of 2015.<br/><br/>The Business Case for the Limerick Prison redevelopment project was submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in June of last year and approval has been received to advance the project to detailed design stage.<br/><br/>Finally, I can advise the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service and Probation Service published a joint Strategic Plan for 2013-2015.  Both agencies are working together and have developed a strategy which ensures a more targeted response to women offenders which it is hoped will reduce overcrowding in female prisons. These measures include:<br/><br/>- identifying and diverting women at risk of a custodial sentence through greater use of community sanctions, supports and inter-agency co-operation;<br/><br/>- strengthening early intervention measures in the community through adopting a co-ordinated multi-agency approach;<br/><br/>- improving outcomes for women currently in custody; <br/><br/>- exploring the potentials of women centric alternatives to custody;<br/><br/>- development of a suitable step down facility for women offenders, a pathway such as this from the Dochas Centre to the community would have a positive effect on reducing the numbers in the Dochas Centre;<br/><br/>- enhanced co-operation with the community and voluntary sector.</p></reply>

This includes personnel, Garda vehicles and the various technologies utilised to support frontline Garda&iacute; and intelligence led operations against organised crime.  This process takes account of annual policing priorities determined by me as Minister for Justice in consultation with the Commissioner as provided for under Section 20 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005.</p><p>  The Deputy refers to deficiencies in technology and will be aware that I have clearly signalled in recent days my intention to support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their efforts to address such deficits which were identified in the recent Garda Inspectorate report on crime investigation.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that the issues raised in the report are widespread, varied and far-reaching and, when taken together with the review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Haddington Road agreement, will demand significant structural reform within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The need for additional resources across a number of areas will be examined within that context.  Furthermore, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Commissioner has commenced an in-depth examination of all recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate Report with a view to determining what can be  implemented in the short, medium and long term.  I also look forward to the significant contribution to this process of reform that will be made by the new policing authority which is to be established shortly.</p><p>  Finally, notwithstanding the deficits identified in the Inspectorate's report, there have been recent positive developments with regard to the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An intake of 100 new recruits, including 25 reserve Garda&iacute;, commenced training in September and the process of recruiting 200 additional Garda&iacute; will continue over coming months.  An additional investment of &euro;10 million has been secured for the Garda Fleet  and the forensic capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will soon be enhanced by a new national DNA database, which is expected to become operational very shortly.</p></reply>

These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services. On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison. At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date. Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.<br/><br/>The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled us to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification.<br/><br/>The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015. It is hoped that participation in these programmes will encourage prisoners to pursue a life outside crime<b>. </b>There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning including Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.<br/><br/>International research indicates that vocational training and employment can reduce the risk of re-offending. However, there is no comparable research currently available on the Irish System.</p></reply>

Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application. Currently, approximately, 4,300 persons are residing in 34 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA.<br/><br/>The existence of the direct provision system over the last 14 years has ensured that the State has been able to ensure that those who claim international protection in this country - and do not have the means to support themselves - have been provided with accommodation and a range of ancillary services including health care and education.  During this period, no asylum seeker has ever been left homeless, and over 52,000 people have been provided with accommodation under the direct provision system since its establishment in 2000.<br/><br/>In relation to the quality and standards of accommodation available to protection applicants, I am satisfied that there is a rigorous inspection system in place in which each centre is inspected three times a year, twice by RIA staff and once by an independent inspection company, QTS Limited.  In addition, to ensure transparency in relation to standards in centres, all completed inspection reports of centres undertaken since 1 October 2013 are being published on the RIA website.<br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that I have established an independent Working Group to report to Government on improvements to the protection process, including Direct Provision and supports for asylum seekers.  The terms of reference and membership of the Working Group, under the chairmanship of former High Court Judge Bryan McMahon, is published on RIA's website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie.</i><br/><br/>The first plenary meeting of the Group took place on Monday 10 November with both myself and Minister of State &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in in attendance and a work programme was agreed. A second plenary meeting will take place tomorrow, 19 November. The issues to be examined by the Working Group are complex and require thorough consideration to ensure that any recommendations are practical and sustainable from a budgetary perspective and do not interfere with existing border controls and immigration policies.<br/><br/>I am confident that the Working Group will revert with practical proposals which will assist in improving the living arrangements for protection applicants while they await a final decision on their applications. The agreed terms of reference do not indicate any timeframe for the Working Group's deliberations but I would welcome a report by Easter.</p></reply>

The schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme under which funding is made available on an annual basis to 31 national and major regional youth organisations. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drugs Task Force Projects and certain other programmes including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres. The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.

The Oberstown development project, which commenced on site in September 2013, will enable the extension of the child care model of detention to all under 18 year olds ordered to be detained by the courts on criminal justice charges.   </p><p>  The current information available to me is that the first 3 units of residential accommodation, which will prioritise the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities, are expected to be formally handed over to the Oberstown campus before the end of this month following the required inspection of works and technical approval of the Office of Public Works, managing the project on behalf of my Department.  I am advised that there will be a need for a further period of 6 weeks for staff training and orientation in the new facilities and for the fitting out of the new units with required furniture and equipment.  This is necessary to ensure safe and secure custody of children in the new buildings and that the appropriate health and safety standards are met. </p><p>  The operational date for the new children detention facilities is also subject to the recruitment of the required complement of new care staff to work in the expanded facilities, and the passage of necessary legislation to ensure that all legal issues relating to the detention of children up to the age of 18 are fully addressed.  The recruitment programme is already well underway with some new staff already in place in the children detention schools.  An additional recruitment process for a further phase of recruitment is currently being advanced and it is intended that the required staff complement will be reached in the first quarter of 2015 for the operation of all of the new residential units.  My Department is also progressing the necessary legal changes required in order to transfer responsibility for 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities.  Heads of a Bill to amend the Children Act 2001 were approved by Government in September and it is intended that the Bill will be published next month and enacted as soon as possible thereafter. </p><p>  My Department is reviewing these matters on an ongoing basis and it is my intention that the operation of the first 3 residential units will be achieved as early as possible in the new year.</p></reply>

Following a meeting with a delegation of Russian officials in October 2013 my Department prepared revised draft wording on a number of specific points. This was forwarded to the Russian Authorities in February 2014. In transmitting these revisions it was suggested that should these revisions be acceptable to the Russian Federation, it would be useful for both sides to meet again for further discussions.  </p><p>  In April the Ministry of Education and Science advised the Irish Embassy in Moscow that all proposed adoption agreements were on hold while the Russian Government considered proposals in relation to how they deal with adoption agreements in general. </p><p>  A reply from the Russian authorities to my Department's revised wording was recently received and is being reviewed in my Department. The Irish side has suggested a meeting in Moscow and I expect that these discussions will take place as soon as a suitable date is agreed.</p></reply>

Considerable progress has been achieved since this date, including the publication of the Inter-Departmental Group&rsquo;s Report, the announcement that Judge Yvonne Murphy will chair the Commission and an inclusive consultation process with stakeholders. </p><p>  My priority remains to establish a Commission which can deliver on public expectations in a realistic manner by establishing a full account of what happened in these Homes. To do otherwise would not be in the best interests of the mothers and children who were in these institutions or serve the wider public interest.</p><p>  Following discussions with colleagues across Government the work of developing the terms of reference is now well advanced. In addition, my Department is working with Judge Murphy to advance the operational arrangements and to determine the resources required to support the Commission&rsquo;s work.  The establishment of any statutory investigation is a significant undertaking and it is important that the State&rsquo;s experience of previous statutory inquiries, and the lessons learned, inform decisions on the establishment of this Commission. </p><p>  In parallel with this work I am consulting with a number of key stakeholders in order to update them on the emerging issues and to seek their further views. As I advised the Joint Oireachtas Committee last week, at least some of the issues being raised extend beyond the central focus on Mother and Baby Homes as debated in this House. However, I am confident that this inclusive approach will greatly assist to establish an effective inquiry which has the support of those most centrally involved.</p><p>  Following the finalisation of the terms of reference in the coming weeks it is my intention to bring the matter to Government as soon as possible thereafter.</p></reply>

These inspections will have a developmental focus looking in particular at the quality of children&rsquo;s learning experiences and achievements and how this is supported in settings by management and leadership, curricular provision, the learning environment, adult-child interactions and the use of play based approaches. Practitioners in the Early Childhood settings will also have opportunity to engage in professional dialogue with inspectors who have expertise in the area of early childhood education. This professional dialogue together with the publication of reports will provide valuable advice to practitioners on how to improve the quality of learning experiences for the children.</font><br/><br/><font color="#0D0D0D">  The education-focussed inspections will be a separate programme of inspections but they will complement fully the regulatory, care-focussed inspections by the TUSLA Early Years&rsquo; Inspectorate. Having separate care-focussed inspections and education-focussed inspections conducted by cooperating inspectorates is reflective of practice in other jurisdictions and there is strong evidence that this approach works very well. </font><br/><br/><font color="#0D0D0D">Both the DES and TUSLA Inspectorates are committed to working closely to ensure that the inspection processes complement each other, to minimise disruption to the work of early years&rsquo; settings and to avoid unnecessary administrative burdens on leaders and practitioners in early years&rsquo; centres.  In this regard, appropriate systems will be put in place to facilitate the sharing of inspection information between both Inspectorates. This will build on the collaboration between both Inspectorates during the joint pilot inspections conduced in 2011/2012 which established a shared understanding of respective roles and inspection processes, and an awareness of the demands on pre-school settings. The Inspectorate of the DES will consult with stakeholders in the sector in advance of commencing the programme of education-focussed inspections.</font><br/><br/><font color="#0D0D0D">The learning from carrying out education focused inspections in the Pre-School Year will contribute to long term planning for the regulation of the early years sector, including the assessment of learning and development outcomes for children aged between 0 and 3.</font></p></reply>

The HSE provide a variety of drug treatment interventions to reduce drug-related harm and which encourage problem substance users to engage with, and avail of such services.

The pilot programme, which will be monitored and evaluated, is designed to provide best possible outcomes for these individuals and address their issues of homelessness and addiction using shared resources.  The HSE also cooperate with the local community representatives of the North and South Inner City and with local Garda&iacute; to minimise any negative public order issues that may arise in the vicinity of its treatment centres.</p><p>  The National Drugs Strategy is a high priority in Government and I work closely with my cabinet colleagues, including the Minister for Justice, to ensure its full implementation.

However, different people in various circumstances may require different approaches to treatment and support.  </p><p>  Methadone maintenance treatment is a critical stabilising treatment that enables the people involved to counter their problem drug use and to rebuild their lives.  In conjunction with other services and supports such as counselling, after-care and training, methadone maintenance treatment provides a pathway to recovery for the individual affected by problem substance use.  The National Drugs Rehabilitation Implementation Committee, which is chaired by the HSE, oversees the national implementation of an integrated inter-agency model of care in order to ensure that a person can access the range of services required to support their own recovery. </p><p>  An Expert Group was set up by my Department in 2006 to examine the regulatory framework which would be required to facilitate the prescribing, dispensing and supply of buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine-only products as alternatives to methadone. The Group recommended that a feasibility study should be conducted in Ireland on the use of these products to assess:</p><p>  -  if a regulatory regime, similar to that which applies under the Methadone Treatment Protocol would be necessary for these products, and</p><p>  -  which cohorts of patients would be suitable for treatment with these products. </p><p>  The Feasibility Study commenced in June 2009 in a number of drug treatment clinics and community settings.  An external consultant engaged to conduct an evaluation of the Study reported its findings to the Expert Group in 2011.  The Expert Group recommended that regulations and guidelines similar to those which apply to the prescribing and dispensing of methadone, should also apply to the prescribing and dispensing of products containing buprenorphine/naloxone or buprenorphine-only for the treatment of opioid dependence. The Expert Group concluded that methadone is the drug of first choice in the treatment of opioid dependency, but that buprenorphine/naloxone may be more appropriate for particular cohorts of patients.   </p><p>  The HSE has established an Opioid Substitution Implementation Group to develop a plan for facilitating the wider availability of buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine-only products as alternatives to methadone.  The Group comprises representations from the HSE and my Department, including medical professionals with specific interest in addiction.  I understand that the HSE is currently in discussions with the supplier company in relation to the pricing structure relating to the product. The outcome of these discussions will inform the recommendations of the Group.</p></reply>

A Working Group was established and chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith of DCU, to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures last year. Under its terms of reference the Group made recommendations earlier this year aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system and planning for future service needs.  In April 2014 the Group submitted a report dealing with medical career structures and pathways following completion of specialist training. The Group submitted its final report in June and this dealt with workforce planning. My Department, in conjunction with relevant stakeholders, is pursuing implementation of the recommendations made by the Group to support retention of doctors following qualification. </p><p>  One of the key recommendations was that the relevant parties commence a timetabled IR engagement of short duration to address the barrier caused by the variation in rates of remuneration that have emerged since 2012 between new entrant consultants and their established peers. My Department in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is giving consideration to the result of the IMO ballot rejecting recent LRC pay proposals.</p></reply>

Nurses intending to practice outside the jurisdiction of Ireland must seek registration verification from the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland. In the period 2011 to 2013, the following numbers of new graduate Nurses have requested verification in each respective year; 216, 234 and 264. The number of verification requests for the September 2014 Nursing graduates to the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland currently stands at 105. </p><p>  There are a number of strategies in place to encourage the retention of nurses that include:</p><p>  -  the Nurse and Midwife Graduate Education Programme which offers a structured two-year programme of further education and development to new graduate Nurses, with the further option more recently of a 2 year contract of employment on full salary for those nurses and midwives currently participating in the programme.

These expert committees consider that aspartame is safe for use and have established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) for aspartame of 40-50 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day.  This ADI is applicable to both adults and children over the age of 12 weeks.</p><p>  In 2013, following renewed concerns regarding the safety of aspartame raised by several members of the European Parliament and the publication of several new studies on aspartame, the EFSA undertook a full re-evaluation of the safety of the sweetener.  The EFSA&rsquo;s experts concluded that aspartame and its breakdown products are safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure and reconfirmed the ADI for aspartame of 40 mg/kg/bw/day. </p><p>  Based on current information available the FSAI consider that aspartame is safe for use.</p></reply>

This feature must be addressed.  Figures for November 14 show that compared to the baseline year of 2011, there are 32.0% fewer patients on trolleys, equivalent to 25,182 patients.  However compared to 2013, there are 3.5% more patients on trolleys. This is equivalent to 1,808 additional patients. Performance in this area occurs against a background of a population which is experiencing significant aging with those over 80 years increasing by some 4% annually. </p><p>  I am advised by the HSE, that it is introducing a range of measures to minimise the numbers of patients waiting on trolleys.  The Special Delivery Unit is working with hospitals to improve access times to appropriate care and to reduce the length of stay for key conditions.  New pathways of care continue to be introduced to improve patient flow through hospitals including: minor injury, medical assessment and surgical assessment units and specific pathways for frail older patients.  </p><p>  This work is supported and facilitated through the clinical programmes and the involvement of senior clinical decision makers at all stages of the patient journey.  The Special Delivery Unit is also working with the hospital groups to maximise capacity to accept ED patients by ensuring that appropriate activity is performed at each individual site.  An in-depth review of individual sites is due to commence within the next month, which should lead to sustainable improvement.</p><p>  The Government has also provided additional funding of &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges.  This funding will be targeted at hospital and community services which can demonstrate initiatives to address specific needs of delayed discharge patients most positively. This will therefore improve timeliness for admissions from Emergency Departments and waiting lists.</p></reply>

The increase in prescription charges will account for &euro;43 million of this target. The Government is committed to achieving these savings while protecting front line services to the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>  Medical card holders are required to pay a prescription charge of &euro;2.50 per item for medicines and other prescription items supplied to them by community pharmacists, subject to a cap of &euro;25 per month for each person or family.  Prescription charges do not apply to children in the care of the Health Service Executive or to methadone supplied to patients participating in the Methadone Treatment Scheme. </p><p>  There are no plans to amend the prescription charge, however, I am pleased that the prescription charge is frozen at the level set in 2014 as was announced as part of the packet of health measures in Budget 2015.</p><p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.

It has established a dedicated contact service for members of the Oireachtas specifically for queries relating to medical cards and GP visit cards, which the Deputy may wish to use for an earlier response. Contact information has issued to Oireachtas members.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates under the legislative framework of the Health Act of 1970, as subsequently amended.  In the interest of probity, the HSE is obliged to ensure that a person&rsquo;s eligibility is correctly recorded in line with the eligibility legislation and the national guidelines.  The HSE aims to ensure that every person who is entitled to a medical card or a GP visit card is given the opportunity to avail of his or her entitlement.  All medical card and GP visit card holders are subject to a periodic review of eligibility to determine continuing eligibility.  </p><p>  As part of the review process, where a person who holds a medical card under the EU Regulations, there is only a requirement to demonstrate to the HSE that they continue to qualify under the EU Regulations.  Proof of receipt of a qualifying payment from the UK authorities should be provided to the HSE and there is no requirement to submit income details and details of savings.  As part of the review the HSE has responsibility to establish if an applicant is subject to Irish social security legislation.  A person is considered subject to Irish social security legislation if s/he is in receipt of a contributory Irish social welfare payment or engaged in work in Ireland and subject to PRSI.  If a person is considered subject to Irish social security legislation, that person will not qualify for a Medical Card under EU legislation, but may qualify for a means-tested Medical Card under national legislation.</p></reply>

It is key to maximising patient outcomes.  Continuous professional development is a vital component in building and maintaining professional competence and fitness to practice.</p><p>  With regard to doctors, Part 11 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 provides for professional competence schemes as the formal structures to ensure that all doctors registered and working in Ireland maintain their education, knowledge and skills at an acceptable level.  As of May 2011, doctors are legally obliged to maintain their professional competence by enrolling in approved professional competence schemes and following requirements set by the Medical Council.  In this context, the Council has established a range of professional competence schemes through formal arrangements with the recognised postgraduate training bodies.  Schemes are operated by the postgraduate training bodies and have been developed to drive good professional practice, which is centred on patient safety and quality of patient care. </p><p>  While the pursuit of training by medical practitioners registered in the Trainee Specialist Division is sufficient to satisfy a doctor's requirements concerning an applicable professional competence scheme, the HSE provides the following professional competence supports for other doctors:</p><p>  - Continuing Medical Education (CME) funding for Consultants of &euro;3,000 per annum per claimant.  A revised CME structure ensures that Consultants are facilitated to remain up-to-date with new systems and processes relevant to their work, and all claimants must be registered on a professional competence scheme with the relevant postgraduate training body in Ireland;</p><p>  - annual funding  to recognised training bodies to deliver Professional Development Programmes for NCHDs in non-training posts.  Doctors register with the relevant postgraduate training body in order to access courses and on-line learning appropriate to their needs.  These learning opportunities can be used to earn credits for Medical Council professional competence scheme requirements;</p><p>  - funding, through the Irish College of General Practitioners, of a national Director and 37 tutors who deliver a CME programme for GPs.  The programme is delivered in small groups throughout the country and is free to participants.  Participation in the programme can be used by GPs to earn credits for Medical Council professional competence scheme requirements. </p><p>  With regard to nurses, the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 provides for the professional competence of nurses and midwives.  Nurses' and midwives' continued professional development takes the form of formally accredited education programmes and shorter programmes approved by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI), comprising both theoretical knowledge and clinical skills.  These programmes are delivered by the HSE Centres of Nursing and Midwifery Education, practice development departments within services and Higher Education Institutes.  The programmes supported must be relevant to patient need, the role of the nurse and the organisation&rsquo;s service requirements.  In addition, a number of programmes have been commissioned and are delivered nationally in response to clinical programme requirements and service developments.  The NMBI approves and accredits continuing education courses (Post-registration Category 1) from a few hours to 36 hours contact time.  Currently there are 1781 NMBI-approved Category 1 courses offered across a range of facilities in all areas of practice and geographical locations.  There are also 44 NMBI-approved specialist education programmes offered at postgraduate level across the higher education sector.</p><p>  The HSE has a number of strategies in place to support the continued education of nurses and midwives in the Irish health system via the Office of the Nursing and Midwifery Services Director.  These include:</p><p>  - funding for clinical Higher Diplomas along with part funding for Masters programmes, in addition to support for leadership and management development by the Nursing and Midwifery Practice Development Units and the Leadership and Innovation Centre;</p><p>  - further educational opportunities to support continuous professional development at local level provided by the Centres for Nursing and Midwifery Education;</p><p>  - the Nurse and Midwife Graduate Programme which offers a two-year programme of further education and development to newly qualified nurses and midwives.</p></reply>

All hospital managers are expected to efficiently manage waiting lists in chronological order, except where clinical need dictates that a patient needs to be prioritised.  Performance against waiting list targets is monitored by the HSE on a monthly basis, with the assistance of the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the Special Delivery Unit.  Figures are published retrospectively to ensure their veracity and accuracy. </p><p>  With regard to waiting list targets, these were set in respect of access to both scheduled and unscheduled care following on from the establishment of the SDU in 2012. With regard to unscheduled care, figures for 14 November show that compared to the baseline year of 2011, there are 32.0% fewer patients on trolleys, equivalent to 25,182 patients.  The waiting lists for scheduled care were reduced from 9 months to 8 months in 2013, as analysis of waiting list data indicated that this target is challenging but achievable.  In March 2013, following publication of the first validated outpatient waiting list numbers, a target of 12 months for a first consultant-led outpatient appointment was established.  Progress in streamlining referral processing and targeting capacity gains for increased new appointments has led to an  increase of 3% (64,289) in out-patient attendances between January - August 2014 in comparison to 2013.  Total out-patient attendances year to date were 2,140,031.</p><p>  Despite seeing more patients, demand for services continues to exceed available supply.  The trends indicate that waiting lists are likely to increase further, with capacity to provide services for these patients curtailed by increased emergency admissions and delayed discharges.  The HSE continues to seek improvements in the provision of elective surgery, medical and outpatient services through reform, facilitation of local level initiatives, strict adherence to the National Waiting List Protocol and relevant clinical programme guidelines and networking of services between hospitals in the new hospital Groups, in addition to reducing the number of patients who do not turn up for their appointment, and increasing the number of new patients in outpatient clinics rather than just reviewing previous patients who are often better returned to their GP.</p><p>  The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges and thereby improve timeliness for admissions from Emergency Departments and waiting lists.  The plans to address in-patient and day-case waiting lists are being considered in the 2015 Service Planning process which is currently underway and progress in this area will be a priority for hospital groups throughout next year.</p></reply>

An essential element of the eligibility arrangements is that the public or private status of a patient must be specified on admission to hospital.  </p><p>  Section 55 of the Health Act 1970 (as amended) also provides for the charging of private in-patients.  Where a patient elects to be treated privately by a consultant the hospital must treat that patient as a private patient.  Persons who opt to be private on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care.  The hospital charge applicable depend on the hospital treating the patient and on whether a person is accommodated in a single or multiple occupancy room or on a day case basis.  The application of a charge by a hospital for in-patient services is obligatory under the legislation, irrespective of whether the patient occupies a public designated bed or private designated bed, as it relates to the private service provided.</p><p>  The private in-patient charge goes towards meeting part of the cost of providing the hospital's services to private patients, for example, the cost of non-consultant doctors, nursing, diagnostic services (such as x-rays and other scans), laboratory services (such as blood tests etc.), medicines and capital costs. </p><p>  In the case of a chemotherapy or dialysis patient, best practice is to treat him/her in a seated or reclining position, on a therapy chair or a recliner, rather than on a bed. Treatment trollies are routinely used in day surgery procedures such as colonoscopy.  It is therefore appropriate to charge for the private service provided.</p><p>  The private in-patient charges do not apply to patients receiving accident and emergency treatment.  They only apply where the person has been admitted to the hospital as a private in-patient.</p></reply>

They are authorised for use in Ireland and across the EU for the treatment of depressive disorders and some anxiety related conditions. </p><p>  Depression may be associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self-harm and suicide. This risk may persist, particularly in the early stages of treatment with anti-depressants such as the SSRIs when a patient starts treatment and until significant remission of their depression occurs. Healthcare professionals and patients are advised of this risk through the product information for the individual medicines which specifically highlight the need for monitoring of the patient following initiation of treatment. The approved product information accompanying these products advises that patients and their care-givers should be alerted to the need to monitor for any clinical worsening, suicidal behaviour or thoughts, or unusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms appear.</p><p>   The risk of suicide was reviewed at EU level on a number of occasions, most recently in 2008. During this safety review the existing warnings contained in the SSRI product information were further strengthened throughout Europe and manufacturers of SSRIs were obliged to update the product information on all SSRIs.  The updated warnings were communicated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (formerly known as the Irish Medicines Board) to doctors and pharmacists.</p><p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), in conjunction with medicines authorities in other member states continuously monitors the safety of medicines in a collaborative way and takes actions, as necessary, to ensure that medicines continue to have a favourable benefit-risk profile for patients. As part of the system of monitoring medicines safety, there is a spontaneous reporting system whereby healthcare professionals and patients can report suspected adverse reactions to medicines. The HPRA also reviews, approves and continuously updates the product information and package leaflet of medicines to reflect the current state of knowledge of each medicine and the risks associated with its use.

The service is under the governance of Crumlin, staff are employees of Crumlin, and the service has always been  accountable to the CEO and under the governance of the hospital&rsquo;s Board in the same manner as other clinical departments.  A decision has been made by OLCHC to discontinue the separate identification of the service as the National Centre for Medical Genetics, in the interest of clarity on governance arrangements. </p><p>  There have been rapid and progressive developments in the area of genetics and genomic medicine over the past five years, and this rapid development is expected to continue. Accordingly a national genetic and genomic medicine network is required that reflects this growth and expected future changes. The HSE has advised that, on 17 November, a meeting was held with the leadership team of the Genetics Department at Crumlin to address their concerns, and to outline plans to map out this national and regional network governance structure with the involvement of staff in the service.  </p></reply>

The apparent arrest, detention and prosecution of this individual for the peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of expression is of great concern.  It is our understanding other interested governments are also monitoring this case closely and that the case has been raised with Iran at the highest level including with the Iranian President.</p><p>  Ireland has always attached priority to safeguarding the position and rights of human rights defenders and has continually advocated that civil society actors must be free to operate in a safe and enabling environment, free from repression.  Ireland's concerns on issues of tolerance of civil society and freedom of expression have been raised with the Iranian authorities, as part of our ongoing dialogue with them on the need for greater respect for human rights within Iran, and we will continue to do so, including making reference as appropriate to the infringements of basic human rights highlighted in this case.</p><p>  In the 2010 Universal Periodic Review of the human rights situation in Iran at the United Nations in Geneva, Ireland raised concerns over human rights violations, including with regard to freedom of expression, association and assembly.  We noted reported attacks against and the detention of human rights defenders and deplored attempts to restrict peaceful demonstrations and actions.  We further voiced our concerns about serious deficiencies in the area of gender equality.  Further concerns in relation to treatment of religious minorities and the continued excessive use of capital punishment in Iran were raised by Ireland in the second Universal Periodic Review of Iran which took place in October 2014.</p><p>  Human rights defenders and those promoting important issues such as gender equality should not be detained for simply exercising their rights, and all those arbitrarily detained in such circumstances should be immediately released.  This concern has been consistently conveyed to the Iranian authorities, and we will continue to do so.  Ireland will continue to follow closely the human rights situation in Iran and to monitor this case in that context.</p></reply>

The Permanent Representative of Kenya was also appointed.  The new goals, which will take effect after 2015, will be known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and should be adopted at a Summit of world leaders in New York next September.</p><p>  The appointment is a great honour for Ireland, and a great responsibility.  The challenge for the two co-facilitators will be to build consensus among the 193 Member States on a very broad and comprehensive agenda.  The new development goals will entail responsibilities and actions for all countries, and will aim to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030 and achieve sustainable development at a global level by addressing challenges in areas such as energy, food, water, climate, urbanisation, peaceful societies and effective governance.</p><p>  Ireland and Kenya are currently co-facilitating consultations at the United Nations on how the inter-governmental negotiations will be carried out.  We are also working with our colleagues in the EU to ensure that the process will culminate in a successful outcome at next years' high-level summit, and that the new SDGs, which will have a profound impact on the lives of the world's poor, will reflect our priorities.

This is currently subject to a third party appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and a decision on that appeal is awaited. <br/><br/>  My Department has no record of having received an application for grant aid for capital works from the third named school.</p></reply>

The continued allocation of the concessionary post is dependent on the teachers concerned remaining on the staff of the school and the appropriate enrolment figures being maintained.<br/><br/>The school referred to by the Deputy was allocated a concessionary mainstream teaching post upon amalgamation in 2007.  The post was allocated on the basis of the school operating on a split site and the school was informed that the post would remain in place until the school moved to a new building, on one site.  This happened at the start of the current 2014/15 school year and the concessionary post was withdrawn. <br/><br/>  The staffing arrangements for the 2014/15 school year (Circular 0007/2014) were published on 24 January, 2014.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing arrangements also include the provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolment for September 2014. <br/><br/>  The staffing process also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board, including developing school grounds.  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.  The school referred to has been approved for a developing school post for the 14/15 school year as a result of this appeals process.</p></reply>

The decision as to whether to accept sponsorship or partake in promotions is one for the Board of Management to take and naturally, the Board of Management should only engage in activities that are in the best interests of their students.</p><p>  Private companies are also free to promote their business in accordance with accepted marketing practices. There are  accepted marketing standards, such as compliance with advertising regulations which guide, inform and control the relationship between the vendor and the potential customers. Decisions in relation to participation in promotions are taken at individual school level and there is no requirement that schools report to my Department on this issue.  The data requested by the Deputy in relation to the numbers of companies involved is therefore not available within my Department.</p><p>  In making such decisions, it is  important that schools strike a balance between the potential  benefit to be gained from positive links with businesses while at the same time protecting children and their parents from inappropriate marketing etc.  In this context, my Department's circulars - while entrusting school authorities with deciding which activities to engage in - explicitly require them to ensure that pressure is not placed on parents to buy particular products.</p><p>  My Department recognises the sensitivities attached to the issue of promotion initiatives linking schools, pupils and parents to commercial activity. However, it would be inappropriate to prohibit marketing or sponsorship initiatives, provided that such schemes do not place undue pressure on parents in terms of additional expenditure, that children are protected from engagement in inappropriate promotional activity and that the schemes are linked to desirable projects of educational value.</p><p>  I have previously stated my position that schools need to be accountable generally to parents and we need greater levels of communication, engagement and transparency  in how schools serve their communities.  In that context, I am planning on introducing legislative amendments to underpin a Parents' and Students' Charter. The legislative amendments will set out the key principles that should apply in the relationship between a school and its parents and students. They will  also create a power for the Minister to publish statutory guidelines that will be based on these principles and which  will set out detailed actions and standards that will apply in all schools.</p><p>  The legislation will require consultation with the education partners on the detailed content of the Charter.  Issues such as that raised by the Deputy can be considered as part of this process.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the 30 September 2013. The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.

In  this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or on the basis of some other criterion. The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.  <br/><br/>  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally  obliged to publish its enrolment policy. <br/><br/>  Equality legislation, which also outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. The  legislation provides that any school that has this objective may admit a  student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students. <br/><br/>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Educational Training Board or to the Secretary General of my Department. <br/><br/>  The Child and Family Agency, is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The  Agency can be contacted at 01 6352854 or by E-mail at info@tusla.ie.<br/><br/>The Deputy may be aware that the Government gave approval in March of this year for drafting the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2014 and drafting is currently underway. <br/><br/>  The objective of the Admission to Schools Bill is to provide an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent.  <br/><br/>  A key objective in designing the framework is to create greater confidence for parents that the admission criteria laid down by schools are legitimate, reasonable and fair.</p></reply>

At this time there is no funding available within my Department's 2014 financial allocation for the payment of the 2014/2015 Minor Works Grant. <br/><br/>  On the announcement of the Medium Term Education Capital Investment Framework  2012-2016 on 10 November 2011 the priority identified was to deliver major school projects and smaller projects devolved to schools to meet demographic demands. It was signalled at that time that given the need to focus on meeting the demand for additional school places that it was unlikely that funding would be available for a minor works grant in the coming years.  <br/><br/>  As the annual increase in student numbers is projected to continue at primary  level until 2018 and at post-primary until 2025, I am not in a position to re-introduce the Minor Works Grant on an annual basis.</p></reply>

The Bill is listed among the Bills expected to be published during the Autumn Session, as part of the Government&rsquo;s Legislation Programme. Drafting of the Bill is currently being finalised within the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. I intend to seek Government approval to publish the Bill in the coming weeks, with the objective of introducing it and progressing its passage through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible thereafter. </p><p>  The General Scheme of the Bill was developed, following extensive public consultation processes both by my Department and by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht. In the latter regard, the Joint Committee&rsquo;s Report on the outline Heads of the Bill was given full consideration, and a number of changes were made to reflect its findings, including reducing the interval between proposed National Low-Carbon Roadmaps from 7 to 5 years and enabling the National Expert Advisory Body on Climate Change to publish directly its annual and periodic review reports. </p><p>  With specific regard to a mitigation target for the year 2050, the General Scheme of the Bill explicitly commits the State to compliance with EU and international obligations in respect of climate change. Ireland already has greenhouse gas mitigation targets up to the year 2020, and discussions are ongoing with respect to targets up to the year 2030. This target-setting process will undoubtedly continue in relation to the periods up to the years 2040 and 2050. Given that Ireland will likely be subject to binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets up to the year 2050 as part of the EU process in any event and that a long-term vision of low-carbon transition is already set out in the National Climate Policy Position, published in April 2014, I do not consider it either appropriate or necessary to include a national 2050 target in legislation. </p><p>  The General Scheme of the Bill provides for the establishment of a National Expert Advisory Body on Climate Change to provide independent advice to Ministers and the Government on the development of National Low-Carbon Roadmaps and National Climate Change Adaptation Frameworks and to publish annual and periodic review reports. The Expert Advisory Body is to comprise a chairperson and between 8 and 10 ordinary members, four of whom shall be ex officio members comprising the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Teagasc and the Economic and Social Research Institute. In terms of appointing a chairperson and the remaining ordinary members, it is important to note that the Government will consider the range of qualifications, expertise and experience necessary for effective performance of the advisory body.  The inclusion of the ex officio members will help underpin this much-needed expertise and experience on these matters, as well as providing a link with relevant agencies working in the field so as to ensure effective implementation. Within this context, it should also be noted that is intended to put in place appropriate arrangements so that the Expert Advisory Body can operate effectively in performing its functions appropriately. Accordingly, I am not minded to alter this arrangement. </p><p>  Finally, with respect to climate justice, one of the most effective ways of lessening the effects of climate change in developing countries is for developed countries such as Ireland to engage in developing further their national mitigation measures in respect of greenhouse gas emissions, and the General Scheme of the Bill provides for just such action. Furthermore, it would be important to note in this context that despite difficult economic circumstances, Ireland has maintained significant support, including public finance, for climate action on adaptation in developing countries. While the vast majority of Ireland&rsquo;s annual climate finance returns come from Irish Aid, Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, it should also be noted that my own Department also made a contribution of &euro;33 million over two years during the Fast-Start Finance period (2010-2012) supporting the Global Climate Change Alliance and the Least Developed Countries Fund.</p></reply>

The overall social housing funding provision for 2015 has been increased by in excess of &euro;200 million, with capital funding increasing by &euro;180 million, which will allow for significant expansion in social housing provision.</p><p>  The specific allocations to be provided in 2015 for each of the various funding schemes and programmes will be published in the 2015 Revised Estimates Volume in December. That will include the breakdown of my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Investment Programme and at that point, my Department will be working with all local authorities, including Meath County Council, to agree individual allocations across all the social housing activities. Specific allocations for subsequent years will be part of the normal budgetary processes for those years.</p><p>  More broadly, plans in relation to the future delivery of social housing are now being developed as part of a new Social Housing Strategy, which will be considered by Government shortly. The Strategy will contain clear, measureable actions to increase the supply of social housing, based on innovative solutions that will harness new funding streams, in order to continue to protect the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our society.</p><p>  Pending the finalisation of social housing funding allocations for 2015 to all local authorities, they are continuing to work on projects announced in March 2014 involving a local authority housing construction programme valued at &euro;68 million nationally and delivering 449 new units of accommodation, and over &euro;46 million allocated to Approved Housing Bodies to provide 416 units of accommodation nationally, for people with special housing needs. Funding to Meath County Council under these measures is a combined &euro;4.27 million, in respect of some 30 social housing units.</p></reply>

The scheme provided funding, additional to that provided for in the 2014 local authority budget, for works related to public area enhancement.</p><p>  While the scheme was not absolutely prescriptive, suggestions to local authorities as to what might constitute suitable projects included providing additional support for initiatives such as local area Tidy Towns committees, improvement works to public parks and recreational walking areas, cleaning and tidying of older graveyards or the cleaning and making safe of derelict buildings. Local Authorities were also asked that wherever possible works should be undertaken in co-operation with local community efforts. </p><p>  The provisional grant to Sligo County in respect of this scheme was for &euro;70,000 and was conditional upon 25% matching funding being provided by the local authority. While funds were provided to the County Councils only, it was expected that County Councils would ensure that Town and Borough Councils were also assisted in their efforts. All expenditure under this scheme was to be completed by the end of September 2014.</p><p>  Sligo County Council were approved a grant allocation of &euro;70,000. Their application included projects relating to: village and town enhancement projects in association with Tidy Towns Committees and community associations; development of public walks; and area enhancement works in advance of festivals and events for the benefit of local communities to promote tourism. Sligo County Council certified that the grant allocation claimed was spent on the general enhancement of the public areas.</p><p>  I understand from Sligo County Council that the specific works referred to in the Question were not carried out under this scheme. The works were intended to contribute to a scheme to replace the current hoarding with decorative railing. It was not possible to advance the design and procurement and have these works completed within the time frame required under the Public Area Enhancement Scheme.</p></reply>

Section 5 of the Act provides that the shareholders of Irish Water are Ervia (formerly Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann), the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance. The Memorandum and Articles of Association of Irish Water provides for the allocation of one Class A share to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and one Class B share each to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance. The Articles of Association provides that the holder of A shares has the right to vote at any general meeting of the company but does not have any entitlement to any participation in the profits or the assets of the company.  The Articles of Association provide that the holders of the B shares do not have the right to vote at any general meeting of the company but the B shareholders do receive whatever dividends or distributions as may be determined from time to time, hence providing that the two Ministers have full ownership of the economic value of Irish Water.</p><p>  Section 46 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 prohibits each of the three shareholders from alienating their shareholding in Irish Water, which in effect places a statutory prohibition on the privatisation of Irish Water.</p><p>  There is no European legislation requiring Ireland to liberalise the water services market.  Article 345 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU clearly establishes a &quot;principle of neutrality&quot; in relation to the rules governing the system of property ownership in the Member States. The European Union cannot, therefore, adopt legal acts affecting the rules governing the system of property ownership, including those affecting the ownership of undertakings providing a public service, such as the provision of water. In a Communication earlier this year, the European Commission confirmed that it will continue to ensure full respect of Treaty rules requiring the European Union to remain neutral in relation to national decisions governing the ownership regime for water undertakings.</p></reply>

It aimed to provide the spatial vision and principles to achieve a better balance of social, economic and physical development and population growth between regions through the co-ordinated development of nine gateway cities and towns, and nine hub towns, together with complementary policies to activate the potential for lasting economic development in their hinterlands and wider regions.<br/><br/>While the existing NSS remains in place and having regard to the significantly changed economic circumstances that the country now faces, the Government recently approved the commencement of the preparation of a new National Planning Framework as a successor to the NSS. Arrangements in this regard will now be put in place and this will be a significant area of activity during 2015.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. The Act defines the customer as the occupier of the premises in respect of which the water services are provided.<br/><br/>The approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. On 30 September 2014, the CER issued a determination on the plan and full details and associated documentation are available on the CER website at the following link:<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>A range of flexible payment options will be available to Irish Water&rsquo;s customers. Furthermore, Irish Water has acknowledged in its water charges plan that in some circumstances it may be appropriate to extend payment terms for some customers.<br/><br/>Consideration is currently being given to elements of the water changing regime, including measures to ensure water charges are modest and affordable and to bring the necessary certainty and clarity to the charging arrangements.<br/><br/>With the installation of domestic water meters, it becomes possible to identify domestic properties with leaks. If Irish Water suspects that there is a leak at a domestic property it will inform the property owner/occupier accordingly. The occupier will also be able to check this as it will usually manifest itself as a high meter read or a continuous flow of water through the meter. If the leak is on the public side of the infrastructure it is the responsibility of Irish Water to locate and fix the leak. If the leak is on the private side of the supply pipe it is the responsibility of the customer to locate and fix the leak, as set out in the Water Services Act 2007; however, the Government has agreed to provide additional funding to Irish Water for their capital investment to include a free first fix scheme. Irish Water has made a proposal to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) regarding a &lsquo;first fix&rsquo; policy and it is understood that the CER intend to hold a public consultation in advance of a decision and implementation of the scheme in Quarter 1 2015.  The CER has decided that where a customer leak has been identified under the &lsquo;first fix&rsquo; policy, the customer&rsquo;s charges will be capped at the assessed level until the leak is fixed by Irish Water.</p></reply>

Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. They may be contacted via email at or by telephone on 1890 578 578.<br/><br/>The employment terms and conditions for Irish Water staff are a matter for the company and I understand that the particular pay model is something which was inherited from the parent company Ervia and therefore was not directly put in place by Irish Water. Like other commercial semi-state bodies, pay models are negotiated between management and unions and are then subject to a ballot as necessary. This occurred in Ervia&rsquo;s case and the pay model was implemented in 2011.<br/><br/>Ervia has in place a competitive market based pay model, which offers market based pay ranges for all employees. Under the pay model salaries, below that of the Managing Director, are calculated by reference to the relevant median market rate. An amount is then deducted which is referred to as a Performance Related Award (PRA) which is an element of pay at risk. The remaining amount is the base salary. <br/><br/>As such, Irish Water does not pay increments or any form of automatic pay award; the PRA element of pay is only earned subject to performance. Every individual in Irish Water has a clear set of objectives set for the year and performance pay awards would be based on a structured performance review that requires company performance, business unit performance and individual performance metrics to have been met.<br/><br/>Irish Water has indicated to my Department that revenue outturn would have most immediate consequence for staff whose performance objectives are directly related to revenue collection, therefore impacting their individual performance review.  Irish Water revenue collection performance would also be a factor in determining annual business performance in Irish Water and within the Ervia Group, thereby affecting the metrics associated with company and business unit performance which would impact on an individual&rsquo;s performance review.<br/><br/>I have been advised by the Chairman of Ervia that the Board has decided that the PRA element of the Irish Water Pay Model should not apply for 2013 and 2014. In addition, the Board has decided that the Pay Model should be subject to an independent review and this is already underway.</p></reply>

Given that local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, public service demands, infrastructure and income sources, the Government has decided that no local authority will receive less allocation from LPT in 2015 than they received from the Local Government Fund in 2014 , prior to any decision taken locally to reduce LPT rates.  80% of LPT will be retained locally to fund vital public services in 2015. The remaining 20% will be re-distributed to provide top-up funding to certain local authority areas that have lower property tax bases due to the variance in property values across the State.<br/><br/>Certain local authorities, with stronger property bases, will receive additional income in 2015 from LPT compared to their 2014 General Purpose Grant. The Government has decided that these local authorities will use this surplus funding in two ways, with a portion available for their own discretionary purposes and the remainder, if any, to fund some services in the Housing and Roads areas for which they currently receive Central Government funding. The portion that will be retained for discretionary purposes by these authorities will be an amount equal to 20% of the total expected LPT income in their respective areas (before any decision to vary rates) or, in the case where that surplus will be less than 20%, the full amount. It will be a matter for the individual local authorities to decide how to spend that discretionary funding.<br/><br/>Effective from 1 July 2014, local authorities may vary the rate of LPT in their administrative area for the following year by up to 15% of the basic rate of the tax. The power to vary LPT rates has been given to local authorities to further increase their autonomy. Elected members are already responsible for finalising the annual budget of the local authority &ndash; it is a reserved function for them &ndash; and the power to vary LPT rates will enable them to directly influence the level of LPT income they have to meet their expenditure requirements in the future.<br/><br/>The decision to vary must be taken by resolution of the Council and must be notified to the Revenue Commissioners by 30 September each year in order to apply for the following year. For 2015, 14 local authorities availed of the opportunity to reduce the basic rate of LPT by the levels set out in the table below.

A similar approach applies to funding sanctioned by local authorities to approved housing bodies, which can be for either new build or the acquisition of existing housing units.</p><p>  There are some instances where funding for social housing developments is linked to job stimulis programmes and, in those cases, it is a requirement that funding is used for new housing developments. However, in general, it is a matter for each local authority, as the housing authority for its area, to identify the social housing need and to respond as required. Where acquisitions are undertaken for social housing purposes, I expect local authorities to do so in a way that is sensitive to issues such as tenure mix and impact on the local housing maket.</p><p>  Budget 2015 has seen the provision of capital funding for social housing provision increased by &euro;180 million. This will see an acceleration of local authority direct build and acquisition of properties. The targets for housing units to be delivered through this increased funding is 946 units delivered by local authorities and 440 through approved housing bodies.</p></reply>

The statutory certificates of compliance must be signed by a registered professional, i.e. a person who is included on the statutory registers of architects or building surveyors established in accordance with the Building Control Act 2007, or who is a Chartered Engineer. These are the construction professions typically involved in the design of construction works in Ireland and reference to these professions in regulation is entirely appropriate.</p><p>  Architectural Technology is not currently classed as a regulated profession in Ireland which means that there is no designated competent authority which has the power to approve or restrict access to the profession in Ireland under national or EU law. That said, I am aware of the valuable contribution to the construction industry that is made by architectural technologists and I welcome and support the recent moves made by both the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland (RIAI) and the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists (CIAT) to put this important discipline on a professional footing. Both bodies have recently agreed to the development through Quality Qualifications Ireland structures of an agreed common standard for Architectural Technologist in line with the National Qualifications Framework.</p><p>  The regulation of professions is in the first instance a matter for industry representatives working in concert with relevant industry stakeholders. Neither I, as Minister, nor my Department, have any role in the assessment or validation of professional qualifications. Nevertheless, where robust arrangements for the regulation of key disciplines such as that of Architectural Technologist can be achieved, in a manner capable of serving the public interest for quality and safety in the built environment at a reasonable economic cost to consumers, I would be happy to sponsor legislation to place such arrangements on a statutory footing.</p><p>  It is also worth noting that, depending on their personal background and experience, it may be open to persons who are Architectural Technologists, and who possess the requisite experience and competence in the design of buildings, to seek inclusion on either of the statutory registers in respect of Architects or Building Surveyors. A number of Architectural Technologists have already succeeded in gaining inclusion on the statutory registers to date and are thus in a position to avail of the many opportunities to act as Design Certifier and   Assigned Certifier that will continue to arise as a consequence of SI No. 9 of 2014.</p></reply>

The rates of duty applicable for the quarterly and half-yearly options are 28.25% and 55.5% the annual charge respectively. This additional cost element takes account of the extra workload for staff in motor tax offices and the National Vehicle and Driver File unit, and the resultant administrative costs and printing costs that arise, including the issuing of renewal notices.</p><p>  The estimated annual income from the increased charges for quarterly and half-yearly vehicle licences is in the region of &euro;50 million. A loss in income from this source would have a negative impact on revenue and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system or through the taxation system generally.</p><p>  I have no plans currently to adjust the basis for paying motor tax on a quarterly or half-yearly basis.</p></reply>

The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5bn in network upgrades and approximately 1.6m of the 2.3m addresses in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next number of years. In the last month alone, two companies have announced projects to deliver direct fibre connectivity to approximately 500,000 homes and businesses in every county in Ireland including Navan. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>  In addition, I understand that at least one operator has published a programme to roll out fibre based broadband networks in 36 locations in County Meath by July 2016 including Longwood.</p><p>  Under EU State Aid Guidelines Member States cannot intervene where commercial investors have plans to roll out services. My Department is currently finalising a national mapping exercise which will identify those areas that require a State intervention.</p><p>  I expect to publish the map for public consultation next week. Those accessing this map will be able to identify their own house or premises and see whether it is in the proposed intervention area. Where a house or premises is not in the proposed intervention area it means it either currently, or will in the near future, have access to commercial high speed broadband services. The map will be subject to change as new information becomes available or commercial investments are announced in the future.</p><p>  A further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy will be launched in mid-2015. My Department is also working closely with the European Commission with a view to obtaining State Aid clearance for the programme.</p><p>  A detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a potential preferred bidder or bidders towards the end of 2015.</p><p>  This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government.

In September I launched the current phase of the consultation process on the Green Paper, which takes the form of a series of stakeholder seminars on the various priority areas. The four seminars held to date have covered the topics of infrastructure, empowering energy citizens, markets and regulation, and ensuring a balanced and secure energy policy. They were all well attended and feedback to my Department suggests that the seminars were well received by the attendees and instructive for my Department. Community groups were represented at all the seminars so far and will continue to be.  The final two priority topic seminars will be completed by mid-December and three regional seminars are being arranged in the North-West, the Midlands and the South to facilitate wider public engagement with communities from those regions.</p><p>  In addition, the second phase of public consultation on the Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework will commence shortly with the publication of a Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment scoping document. Building on the 2012 Government Statement on Strategic Infrastructure, this phase of consultation will explicitly seek views on community engagement and benefit with a view to developing policy in this area. The Renewable Electricity and Development Framework is expected to be completed in 2015.</p><p>  It is also important to note various community level initiatives supported by Government including the development of community energy through the Better Energy Areas and Communities Programme which is administered on my behalf by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. The programme allows community and locally based organisations to apply for funding on a competitive basis to support sustainable energy upgrades to existing buildings and facilities. It also promotes the creation and development of locally based entities that can inspire and mobilise community resources to lower energy bills and boost local employment.</p></reply>

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy. In 2013, 7.8% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirements were met from renewable sources, with energy from biomass accounting for 3.2%. Biomass is expected to contribute up to half of the 2020 renewable energy targets, both here and in the EU as a whole.<br/><br/>Last month I published a Draft Bioenergy Plan which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website (). The draft Plan will undergo Strategic Environmental and Appropriate Assessments, including public consultation, which will inform the content of the finalised Plan. These assessment processes will commence shortly.<br/><br/>The draft plan recommends the continuation of the REFIT schemes and the Biofuels Obligation Scheme. Furthermore, the analysis underpinning the plan is that an additional bioenergy-focused measure in the heat sector represents the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals. Therefore, the plan also recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. The RHI scheme, once designed, will require State Aid approval from the European Commission and further Government approval. It is proposed to have the scheme in place in 2016.<br/><br/>The draft Plan recognises that, although Ireland will remain a net importer of biofuels in the transport sector, meeting demand for biomass from indigenous sources could deliver significant economic benefits. Consequently, the draft plan also contains measures to stimulate and support the supply of Irish biomass. In this regard, the key recommendations include: the continued support for the Afforestation Programme; the continuation of the Bioenergy Scheme for energy crops; and the establishment of Bioenergy Ireland, a joint venture between Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte.<br/><br/>Furthermore, in terms of developing new sources of biomass, the draft Plan provides that the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government will endeavour to optimise the availability of waste for energy and that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will continue its support for innovative energy uses for animal by-products.</p></reply>

I am advised that ESB has conducted some limited trials on biomass co-firing at Moneypoint and will continue to monitor developments in this area. Notwithstanding this, I am advised that there are a number of important issues that would demand further consideration before biomass could be used extensively at Moneypoint, including:</p><p>- conversion of Moneypoint to biomass would require significant levels of operator capital investment and plant redesign;</p><p>- substantially more biomass than is available domestically would be required with large amounts of the resource having to be imported leading to questions in relation to sustainability and security of supply;</p><p>- the commitment of substantial amounts of biomass to Moneypoint would divert scarce biomass away from the renewable heat sector, where biomass can be used more efficiently and where fewer alternative technologies exist; and</p><p>- support tariffs substantially higher than those available for wind, which has been the most cost effective renewable technology in the Irish electricity market, would also be required which could lead to increased electricity prices.</p><p>  In that regard, electricity from biomass, including co-firing with peat, is already supported through REFIT. The recently published draft Bio Energy Plan recommended that REFIT 3 would be kept under review to ensure the most cost effective way to support co-firing of biomass with peat.</p><p>  In relation to the peat fired generators in the Midlands, I am advised that ESB has also completed biomass co-firing trials at West Offaly and Lough Ree power plants. These trials have identified some significant technical and commercial issues, including uncertainty regarding the biomass supply chain, that need to be addressed before biomass co-firing could be a realistic option. Bord na M&oacute;na is already co-firing its plant at Edenderry with biomass now accounting for 25% of the fuel mix.</p></reply>

Further detail on these wind farms is publicly available on the EirGrid and ESB Networks websites.  <font color="#0D0D0D">Wind is a variable source of renewable energy and thus the amount of energy supplied by wind each day fluctuates. However, the average energy derived from wind generation in 2013 was 17% of total electricity.</font><br/><br/><font color="#0D0D0D">  It should be noted that EirGrid and ESB Networks, the system operators, do not hold information on the number of wind farm projects being planned or seeking planning permission in Ireland, and have no role in assessing the commercial viability of proposed wind farms nor in making planning decisions. However, they have provided information on the number of expected wind farm projects contracted to connect to the electricity grid. In this regard, 214 wind farms are contracted to connect to the grid (152 to the distribution grid and 62 to the transmission grid). It is important to note that this figure may change as some wind farm developers may decide not to proceed with their projects for commercial reasons or may not receive the required planning permission.</font></p></reply>

It comprises over 100 projects ranging from large projects such as the North South transmission line, to smaller projects such as upgrades of existing lines.  Grid25 will provide capacity to facilitate regional economic development, together with job creation and growth. It will allow for long term growth in the demand for electricity and ensure the efficient operation of the All Island Single Electricity Market. It will reduce our dependency on imported fossil fuels by putting the infrastructure in place to enable us use our own natural resources, and to reach our 2020 renewable energy target.</p><p>  The overall Grid25 Strategy was forecast to cost up to &euro;4 billion at its launch in 2007. EirGrid reviews all projects and strategies at regular intervals to take into account relevant developments including economic conditions and electricity demand forecasts. In 2010, a review of Grid25 resulted in EirGrid reducing the estimated cost of the programme to &euro;3.2 billion. EirGrid is currently undertaking a further review, with the outcome expected in Q1 2015.</p><p>  The issue of how the various projects under the Grid 25 Strategy will be financed is a matter for EirGrid and not one in which I, as Minister, have a role. However, in relation to network investment costs, the Commission for Energy Regulation undertakes reviews of such costs incurred by both EirGrid and ESB every five years with additional monitoring carried out annually, with a view to ensuring that the significant network investment needed is efficient and delivered at the lowest possible cost to electricity consumers, while also ensuring security of supply and greater fuel diversity.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State-led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5bn in network upgrades and at least 1.6m of the 2.3m addresses in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next number of years.  In the last month alone, two companies have announced projects to deliver direct fibre connectivity to approximately 500,000 homes and businesses in every county in Ireland including seven towns in County Cork.

However, the provision of incentives or compensation to land owners affected by the construction of a greenway through their lands is a matter for the local authority in charge of delivering the specific project given that the consideration of any such payments can substantially increase the cost of project delivery.</p><p>  The following sets out my Department's views with regard to the various options which can be considered in delivering greenways.</p><p>  The permissive access model is a worthy mechanism for certain cycling and walking projects, particularly on a local level.  It is a low cost community based model that provides access to the natural environment without interfering with the property rights of the landowners concerned.  In many cases, the landowners become champions of the project, supporting the role of the local authorities and the work of agencies such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p><p>  In terms of the best land access models for greenway delivery, the use of publicly owned land is advantageous from the perspective of reducing costs.  Negotiated permissive access, from the perspective of cost and public ownership, continues to have value but, for projects of national scale, consideration must be given to land purchase by agreement or if necessary by CPO.  The process of obtaining permissive access is resource intensive and I would have my doubts that such a process could be deployed on projects of national scale where agreement would need to be secured with hundreds or more landowners.</p><p>  Greater investment is now being provided for greenways and it would be precarious to rely on permissive access where the associated agreements may be withdrawn at any time without recourse to the State.  Of course, as already stated, it will be a matter for all developers of cycling infrastructure to consider access to land on a case by case basis and to take a multi-criteria approach in the route selection process.  The key consideration should always be to select an approach that will maximise the future use of the amenity concerned.</p><p>  In the context of developing major cycling infrastructure projects that traverse long sections of privately owned land, I fully support the need to consider negotiated financial agreements or, if required, CPO.  However, I certainly recommend that all other options are considered before land purchase is decided upon.</p></reply>

Apart from multipoint tolling the NRA Demand Management report also includes other measures specific to the effective operation of the M50 which merit consideration. These include:<br/><br/>-  the use of a variable speed limit so that the speed limit could be dropped to say 80 km/h at peak times thus improving the carrying capacity of the road<br/><br/>-  ramp metering which would effectively limit the flow of traffic (using traffic signals) on to the M50 at interchanges<br/><br/>-  Smarter Travel Planning measures. <br/><br/>As regards multi point tolling on the M50 it is my position that no new tolls will be introduced during my term as Minister for Transport.The likely impact of multi-point tolling would be to push vehicles on to other roads and through local communities.  Looking to the future and increased travel demand as the economy recovers further we will need to address congestion across the Greater Dublin Area, and not just on the M50.  <br/><br/>In August my Department  published a draft Strategic Framework for Investment in Land Transport document for public comment.  The intention is that the Strategic Framework for Investment in Land Transport, when finalised, will inform how issues such as demand management measures will be dealt with in the future.</p></reply>

I expect to receive a report from the NTA on the outcome of the review by early 2015. In the meantime the NTA will publish an interim shortlisting report shortly in order to provide information on the review progress and to ensure a transparent process. </p><p>  I also expect early in 2015 to receive the updated DART Underground business case and the preliminary business case for the Swords/Airport Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) scheme from the NTA. </p><p>  I will then consider the options for addressing key public transport deficits in the GDA having regard to the costs and benefits of each project and to available Exchequer funding as well as other possible sources of funds. I expect to finalise this review  by mid-2015.</p></reply>

Currently, this is a 'straight-to-court' offence which attracts 5 penalty points on conviction.</p><p>  However, section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2014, when commenced shortly, will bring this offence within the Fixed Charge Payment System and will attract 3 penalty points on payment of the Fixed Charge. </p><p>  Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 477 of 2006), the Road Safety Authority has responsibility for the delivery of the National Car Test.  The RSA has overall responsibility for the operation, oversight, development, quality assurance and delivery of vehicle testing arrangements. </p><p>  I am advised that any car owner will receive an NCT appointment within 28 days.  I understand that, in order to meet this standard, in some cases, the National Car Testing Service (NCTS) holds requests on a waiting list until a suitable slot is found. In the majority of cases, customers are given a slot within the required timescale.  However, if a slot is not found within 28 days, the test should be offered free of charge. </p><p>  Also, to further facilitate demand, an NCT may be undertaken up to 90 days in advance of the test due date without affecting the expiry date of the new certificate. This system is in place to ensure that owners have ample time to have their vehicle tested before their current NCT certificate expires. The RSA has been running an advertising campaign to highlight this. </p><p>  The RSA informs me that it is in a favourable position to deal with current demand and that the NCTS has been testing record numbers to date in 2014, with the number of vehicles tested each month being approximately 12% higher than in the corresponding months in 2013.</p></reply>
