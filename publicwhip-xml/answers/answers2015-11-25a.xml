    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-11-25a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015112500073#WRA00600"><p><i>Bonamia ostreae</i>, a parasitic organism that gives rise to Bonamiosis in oysters, has been present in native Irish oysters (<i>Ostrea edulis</i>) since the 1980s. It is widespread within Europe and also in the USA and Canada.  The parasite was first diagnosed in Cork Harbour in 1987 following the detection of significant losses in native oysters.  How or precisely when the parasite was introduced is unknown.</p><p>Subsequent to that, the pathogen spread steadily along the western seaboard to many of our native oyster growing areas.  The exact route of spread is unknown but movement of infected animals, equipment and boats are all possible vectors.</p><p>Localised wild oyster beds have shown significant mortality (up to 80-90%).  Other beds in the same infected areas have shown very little mortality.  However, the most recent information available for these sites shows much lower, but still variable, rates of mortality.</p><p>The only areas with significant populations of native oysters that remain free of the parasite are Tralee Bay and Kilkieran Bay (Co. Galway).  The Marine Institute operates a surveillance programme in these bays; consisting of annual sampling and testing.  The programme has been running since the early &lsquo;90s. </p><p>The pathogen is listed in Council Directive 2006/88/EC (On animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof, and on the prevention and control of certain diseases in aquatic animals) and by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).  Infection with <i>the organism </i>is, therefore, reportable and infected stocks are subject to control measures.  Strict movement controls are in place in Ireland and it is mandatory to notify either suspicion of the presence of the disease to the Marine Institute or to report the presence of increased mortality in susceptible populations - in this case, the native oyster.</p></reply>

These cover both the eligibility of the land declared to draw down payments and also cross compliance aspects, to ensure adherence with EU regulatory requirements in the areas of public, animal and plant health, environment and animal welfare and ensuring that the farm is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition.  The basis for these inspections is governed by EU legislation and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must be conducted each year. Details of these inspections and the regulations involved are published in the Terms and Conditions of the schemes which are sent to every applicant annually.  These inspections are a necessary requirement in order to draw down approximately &euro;1.7 billion of EU funds annually and to avoid EU disallowances.  The inspections are subject to repeated audits by the European Commission, the European Court of Auditors and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Office and this ensures an independent verification that inspections are conducted in full compliance with the legal requirements.  In abiding with the findings of these audits my Department ensures that these inspections are conducted in a fair and equitable manner and in full accordance with the legislative provisions.  Furthermore the Department&rsquo;s inspecting officers are very experienced and are regularly trained to ensure that they carry out inspections in a professional manner. In implementing the inspection programme, my Department also takes maximum possible account of the realities of farming. </p>  <p>  Of equal importance is the fact that appropriate appeal mechanisms are in place to protect the interests of farmers if they have difficulties with the inspection findings or if they consider that the inspection has not been conducted in accordance with legislative requirements.  Under this process a farmer may initially seek to have the inspection outcome reviewed internally by an officer more senior than the inspecting officer.  Where the farmer remains dissatisfied, the decision can be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office and ultimately to the Office of the Ombudsman, both of which bring an entirely external and visibly independent dimension to the process. </p></reply>

All TAMS schemes have been opened and the applications received under the first tranches of both the Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme and the Dairy Equipment Scheme are now being processed.  The first tranche for the Pig and Poultry Scheme closed on the 30<sup>th</sup>October and for the Low Emission Slurry Spreading scheme on the 20<sup>th</sup>November.  The first tranches for the Organic Capital Investment Scheme and the Animal Welfare, Safety and Nutrient Storage Scheme will be closing on the 30<sup>th</sup>November.  Interest in TAMS to date has exceeded expectations and clearly many Irish farmers are looking once again at the benefits of investing in their enterprises and expanding production.  Under the Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme a total of 520 applications have been received, while over a thousand applications have been submitted for the Dairy Equipment Scheme.</p><p>All applications received are being examined and approvals will commence when all of the required checks have been undertaken.  This is a complex process and as all applications for TAMS 2 must be made under a tranche-based approach, we are required to evaluate, rank and assess all applications received together. My Department is working to ensure approvals issue at the earliest possible juncture.</p></reply>

Any decision on distribution obviously had to await the adoption at EU level of the relevant legislative provisions.  In order to effectively address the existing market disturbance in the dairy sector, the European Commission deemed it appropriate to provide aid to Member States in the form of a one-time financial grant as part of its recent announcement on a package.  The aim of this is to support farmers in the relevant sectors who are experiencing the most acute price fall and consequences of the prolongation of the Russian import ban. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware Ireland has been granted an allocation of &euro;13.7 million from an overall fund of &euro;420 million.  The relevant Commission Regulation, as revised at the request of Member States, including Ireland, provides scope for a national top up of up to 100% to this EU payment.  Member States are afforded the flexibility to distribute this aid through the most effective channels at their disposal.  It is a clear requirement of the provisions regarding this aid that the funds need to be distributed on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory criteria and also needs to ensure that farmers in the relevant sectors are the ultimate beneficiaries of the targeted aid.</p><p>In conjunction with stakeholders, I have been considering how best to utilise these funds to support Irish farmers.<i></i>I have discussed these matters with representatives of the dairy sector, most recently at the dairy forum.  I took the opportunity to update stakeholders regarding progress to date and to seek their opinions regarding how best to distribute this aid.  In addition my Department have also had discussions with representatives of the Irish pig sector.  I am currently finalising consideration of various options and intend to announce final decisions regarding the aid levels and mechanisms in the very near future.</p></reply>

As the competent authority, it is the only body which is lawfully authorised to carry out any inspections of lands.  Notwithstanding this, I requested the Director of Agriculture Appeals to carry out a review of the findings of the Department in relation to the eligibility of the land parcels in Keelderry.  Officers of the Agriculture Appeals Office conducted a visit to the Keelderry Commonage 23 January 2014.  The officers of the Agriculture Appeals Office as a result of their visit and having examined all evidence available to them recommended that the findings of the Department in relation to the eligibility of this land be upheld.  I understand that all applicant shareholders have been provided with a copy of this report by the Agriculture Appeals Office.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied therefore that the review which was carried out by the statutorily independent Agricultural Appeals Office was fair, in-depth and comprehensive.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-11-25a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015112500074#WRB00900"><p>The main targets set out in the Food Harvest report published in 2010 were, by 2020, to increase the value of:</p><p>- Primary output in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sector by 33% (from a 2007-09 average baseline)<b>,</b></p><p>- Agriculture, food (including seafood) and drink exports by 42% (from a 2007-09 average baseline),</p><p>- Value added production by 40% (from a 2008 baseline).</p><p>In addition to these value increases, the dairy industry targeted a 50% increase in<b></b>milk production by 2020, to be progressed following the abolition of milk quotas in April this year. </p><p>Progress on these targets is monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis.  The fourth annual report <i>&ldquo;Milestones for Success 2014&rdquo;</i>, published in September 2014, showed that the sector had achieved very significant progress on these targets and illustrated the manner in which the Food Harvest 2020 vision of &lsquo;smart, green, growth&rsquo; is being attained.  The Milestones report showed that, compared to the Food Harvest baseline:</p><p>-  primary output had increased by 32% in 2014;</p><p>-  Agri-food exports had increased by 27% in 2014;</p><p>-  and value added had increased by 29% in 2012 (latest data available). </p><p>Food Wise 2025, the new ten year strategy for the agri-food sector published in July this year, builds on the successful vision of Food Harvest 2020.  It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper. Food Wise includes more than 380 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p><p>If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee which drew up the Food Wise Strategy believes that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025:</p><p>- Increasing the value of agri-food exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion;</p><p>- Increasing the value added in the agri-food, fisheries and wood products sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion;</p><p>- Increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion;</p><p>With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agri-food sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development.</p><p>Realising these growth projections will be challenging, but I am confident that they can be achieved. </p><p>I chair the High Level Implementation Committee, including senior officials from relevant Departments and State agencies, which will drive implementation of the Food Wise recommendations.  The HLIC met for the first time in September.  The second meeting will take place later this morning, dealing specifically with sustainability, which will be at the core of the strategy&rsquo;s implementation.  The implementation of Food Wise will be influenced by the final Environmental Analysis Report on Food Wise, which will be presented to the HLIC today.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-11-25a.31.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015112500074#WRB01100"><p>Farmers in these areas who manage Natura land or have commonage already have automatic access to GLAS and are guaranteed priority entry to the scheme as Tier One candidates.  Destocking of commonage land in the Twelve Bens/Maumturk complex and the Owenduff/ Nephin Beg complex commenced in the year 2000 when all shareholders were required to reduce sheep numbers by 30% due to serious overgrazing problems pending the preparation of Commonage Management Plans (CMPs ).  In June 2002, implementation of site-specific CMP s commenced with many commonages within these sites requiring destocking in excess of 50%.  Compliance with CMP requirements was recognised through REPS payments, while farmers outside of REPS were entitled to claim compensation under a national scheme operated by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. </p>  <p>  Following a Judgment against Ireland by the European Court in 2002 for failure to protect the habitat of the Red Grouse in these areas, the European Commission required further destocking of the hills in 2006.  As this was seen as an additional requirement over and above what was being compensated for under existing REPS contracts, the National Parks and Wildlife Service made a top up payment to the farmers concerned under the national scheme operated by them.</p>  <p>  As I said at the outset, the farmers concerned already have automatic access to GLAS.  In relation to GLAS Plus, the increased payments available under this measure are also automatically applied where the annual cost for a farmer of addressing a combination of Tier 1 Priority Environmental Assets (PEAs) exceeds &euro;5,000 per annum.  In such cases, these farmers move into the GLAS Plus category, where the ceiling for annual payment is &euro;7,000.  However, it is important to note that, with the exception of those managing bird habitats, farmers hoping to benefit from GLAS Plus must have more than one Priority Environmental Asset.  For example, if a farmer has both commonage and privately-owned Natura land, he or she is a candidate for GLAS Plus if the cost of addressing both actions exceeds &euro;5,000.

The provisions of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 are designed to encourage the development of a climate which supports the optimum protection of the health and welfare of all animals, irrespective of species, whether kept for commercial, domestic, sport, show or for other purposes.  Under the Act, penalties for offences have been increased significantly.  On summary conviction, a person may be fined up to &euro;5,000 for each offence and/or sentenced to up to 6 months imprisonment, on conviction on indictment, a fine of up to &euro;250,000 for each offence and/or imprisonment for up to 5 years may be imposed.  The Act provides a framework within which the welfare of animals can be safeguarded and I am hopeful that the significantly increased levels of penalties for offences of animal cruelty provided for under the Act will act as a deterrent to animal welfare abuses.  The imposition of penalties in a particular case, is a matter for the Courts and I have no function in the matter.  I am satisfied that the penalties set down in the Act in respect of cruelty offences should provide a sufficient deterrent. I have no plans to increase penalties further.</p>  <p>  A wide range of offences have been detected and prosecuted since the Act came into operation on 6 March 2014.  Such offences include acts of overt cruelty as well as neglect, failure to feed animals and keeping animals in an unsuitable environment.  As well as my Department, both ISPCA and DSPCA have officers authorised under the Animal Health and Welfare Act.  These officers are bringing forward cases through the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Chief State Solicitors Office.</p></reply>

In addition, over 102,350 applications have been received under the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC ) scheme from applicants with eligible designated lands.  Under EU Regulations, all these applications are subject to robust administrative checks prior to payment.  The main element of the administrative check is an area assessment.  This is achieved by using the Land Parcel Identification System which currently records some 1 million individual land parcels.</p>  <p>  The work of my Department in this critical area must meet demanding EU and national audit requirements.  Only valid applications under the BPS and ANC that fully comply with the requirements of the EU legislation are paid.   Consequently, all applications under the Schemes are subject to administrative checks.  Cases that do not pass the validation process go into error and cannot be paid until the error concerned is resolved.  These errors include over-claims, dual claims and incomplete application forms.  In addition, applicants under the ANC scheme must fulfil a 7 month minimum stock retention period and an annual stocking density requirement.  My Department enters into correspondence, mainly through the issuing of query letters to farmers, in order to resolve these error cases.</p>  <p>  In relation to the BPS and Greening Payment, I am pleased to confirm that advance payments began issuing in Ireland on 16 October 2015.  This is the earliest that payments can commence under the governing EU Regulations.  In addition, I can confirm that the level of the advance payment was set at 70% for 2015 rather than the normal 50%.  The increase in the advance payment for 2015 is, in particular, due to the difficulties encountered in the dairying and pigmeat sectors. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that Ireland is among the earliest to pay the BPS /Greening in the European Union and, to date, 114,372, farmers have received payments totalling &euro;725.7 million.  In relation to the ANC Scheme, I can confirm that payments commenced, on schedule, on 23 September 2015 and that to date, 83,294 farmers have received payments totalling &euro;177.5 million.  There are no advance payments under this scheme and, as previously stated, many farmers cannot be paid until early 2016 when they comply with the stocking requirements of the scheme.</p>  <p>  As outstanding cases under the BPS and ANC are processed and are cleared of any outstanding error, they will be sent for payment.  My Department is prioritising the processing of all such outstanding cases with regular payment runs continuing over the coming weeks for all fully processed cases.  In addition, balancing payments under the BPS and Greening are scheduled to commence from 1 December.</p></reply>

The US is one of our leading trading partners, and we have a large and growing agri-food trade surplus with them (exports of &euro;570m last year, compared to imports of &euro;268m).  </p>  <p>  We have significant offensive interests in these negotiations.  We see worthwhile opportunities in the US for cheese, powdered milks and sports products, and further opportunities for branded packaged butter, if we can reduce tariffs and remove some regulatory barriers.  Prepared consumer foods and fish could also benefit from trade liberalisation.</p>  <p>  Beef is a unique sector in that we have both offensive and defensive interests.  In the long term, any significant increase in beef imports to the EU could have adverse effects on the Irish industry.  That was confirmed by a number of recent studies, and is an issue we have raised strongly with the European Commission.  Therefore we have legitimate concerns about the size, composition and administration of any quota offered to the US. </p>  <p>  Of course, we should also seek a significant EU quota for beef to the US as part of any TTIP agreement.  Following the re-opening of the market, Irish beef exports now fall under a 65,000 tonne quota for &lsquo;other countries&rsquo; on a first come, first served basis.  This is mainly filled by Latin American countries.  When we get access for manufacturing beef we would stand to benefit greatly from a specific EU import quota in the US, and this can only be achieved through TTIP. </p>  <p>  A number of key issues in these negotiations arise in relation to hormone treated beef, food standards, GMOs and Geographical indicators.  In this regard, it will be important to ensure that the principle of equivalence continues to apply so that even where food production processes in the EU and US are not identical they will provide equivalent guarantees regarding the standards of production.  This principle is recognised by both sides in the negotiations as the basis for an agreement.  Equally it is important that both the EU and United States retain the policy space to restrict certain practices and processes on social and ethical grounds and this is also recognised, in principle, by both sides.</p>  <p>  This is particularly relevant in relation to the use of hormones in meat production.  The EU Commission has made it clear that it will not allow the importation of hormone treated meat into the EU and this is well understood by the US side.</p></reply>

In collaboration with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Environmental Protection Agency, we have sought to encourage the use of animal by-products as &quot;valuable by-products not waste&quot;.  Electricity and heat produced from anaerobic digestion (AD) are supported under the REFIT 3 scheme, and the issue of electricity tariffs is a matter, in the first instance, for my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The current rates of tariff for AD technologies available under the scheme were calculated following analysis by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources along with other relevant Departments and agencies, including my own. Since the introduction of the scheme in 2012, I understand there have been a number of applications from AD plants for support. </p><p>I recognise the role that a resource-efficient agriculture sector can play in contributing to renewable energy targets, especially where it can improve its competitiveness and promote job creation. <i></i>In 2006, my Department launched a Pilot Waste Processing Facilities Scheme with funding of &euro;4 million in order to provide grant-aid for the installation of anaerobic digesters on ten Irish farms.  To date, two applicants have been paid under the Scheme and an extension to the end of 2016 has been given to another applicant to finalise an on-farm project. </p><p>As a large ruminant livestock producer, it is notable that methane contributes a significant portion of Ireland&rsquo;s agriculture greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  While it is possible to produce and utilise methane through AD of stored manure, analysis to date would suggest that costs are a significant factor.  </p><p>In early 2015, the Bioenergy Steering Group was formed by DCENR with the purpose of furthering the vision set out in the <i>Draft Bioenergy Plan</i>.  Four working groups were established, aiming to develop measures on four aspects of Bioenergy, one of which is looking at electricity and heat.  Public and private sector stakeholders will contribute to each working group.  My Department continues to work closely with DCENR in assessing the potential of bioenergy from the agriculture and forestry sectors, including from AD and is actively involved in all of the four working groups.  The work of these groups will be important in informing future policy developments in relation to bioenergy.</p></reply>

The welfare of greyhounds involved in coursing is provided for in the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 which <i>inter alia </i>requires that persons who course greyhounds must have regard to the <i>&ldquo;Code of Practice in the Care &amp;amp; Welfare of the Greyhound&rdquo;,</i>developed jointly by the ICC and BnG.</p><p>The ICC has assured my Department that it has extensive systems and practices in place to underpin the welfare of hares and greyhounds involved in coursing and that it goes to great lengths to ensure the highest standards of welfare are adhered to. </p><p>A Monitoring Committee on Coursing is in place, comprising officials from my Department, the ICC and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), to monitor developments in coursing and in that regard the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interests of both hares and greyhounds. </p><p>Hares can only be collected for coursing by clubs affiliated to the ICC in accordance with the terms of two licences granted by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. </p><p>These licences contain 26 conditions which have refined over the years, the majority of which are central to hare welfare.  These include a variety of measures, including a requirement that a qualified veterinarian attends at all coursing meetings to report on the health of the hares, a prohibition on the coursing of hares more than once in the same day, a prohibition on the coursing of sick or pregnant hares, and a requirement that hares be released back into the wild during daylight hours. </p><p>The ICC also attends to the welfare of the hare and undertakes a range of actions to address issues related to health and welfare.  Coursing clubs are required to comply fully with directives, instructions and guidance notes issued by the ICC in all matters relating to the capture, keeping in captivity, tagging, marking, coursing and release of hares, and the muzzling of greyhounds. </p><p>A review of the outcome for the most recent season indicates that the procedures and processes in place in terms of animal welfare are appropriate given that 99.4% of hares were released back to the wild at the conclusion of coursing. </p><p>I have no plans to ban hare coursing, but I have no hesitation in saying that it is critically important that those involved in the sport must operate in accordance with the regulatory framework and with the welfare of both hares and greyhounds in mind at all times. </p></reply>

In excess of 3,500 learners participate annually in Teagasc further education programmes and higher education programmes which are jointly delivered with various Institutes of Technology and Universities.  Typically, over two-thirds of learners attend the 7 agricultural colleges in the Teagasc network with the balance attending part-time programmes at 12 Teagasc Regional Education Centres and local advisory offices.  Apart from this, in excess of 5,000 adult farmers and industry personnel participate in short term training programmes annually.  Teagasc currently employ just over 1,200 staff working in the research, advisory and education directorates.  The allocation of resources to particular directorates is an internal operational matter for Teagasc management to determine.  My Department has responded positively to the demand that has arisen for additional college places in recent years sanctioning a number of exceptional appointments in the agricultural colleges. </p>  <p>  My Department has also been working closely with Teagasc to address staffing issues in relation to the delivery of the part-time Teagasc Green Cert.  In conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Teagasc was approved to appoint 40 new temporary teachers to meet the demand from young farmers for Green Cert courses.  It enabled Teagasc to increase enrolments from 500 in a typical year to 2,300 since late 2014. Subject to demand, it has been agreed that Teagasc can recruit a further 30 temporary teachers and 7 admin staff for the Green Cert bringing the total allocation of temporary resources to 77. It will help to ensure that every farmer who requires a Green Cert place can be accommodated. </p>  <p>  More generally, we have recently agreed new delegated sanction arrangements to provide Teagasc with greater flexibility over permanent staff appointments in research, advisory and education.  The arrangements will enable Teagasc to replace staff when they retire and to make new appointments in specified grades, subject to compliance with multi-annual pay ceilings.  While Teagasc must remain within its overall pay budget, the flexibility provided by the new arrangements will allow them to fill a significant number of critical vacancies and to react faster when such vacancies arise in the future.  I understand Teagasc plan some appointments in the agricultural colleges to meet the current spike in demand for places.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the new arrangements will greatly assist Teagasc in delivering much needed advice; support and training to farm families and the wider agri-food industry.</p></reply>

I also called for the restoration of Aids to Private Storage for cheese, which was introduced by the Commission in September 2014 but discontinued shortly after.  In addition I called for the existing aid rates in the PSA schemes for butter and SMP to be reviewed immediately. </p>  <p>  Another key request was increasing the advance of the Basic Payment and other elements of Direct Payments Scheme and from 16th October 2015 to 70%, to alleviate cash flow difficulties.  In addition to these more immediate concerns I made it clear that from my perspective, it would be necessary to give longer term consideration at EU level to responses to volatility issues.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that the final decision at Council in September took significant account of Ireland&rsquo;s requests.  Unfortunately a temporary top-up in the intervention price for SMP did not enjoy the support of all Member States.  However the improved PSA scheme for SMP, which will include longer periods for storage as well as the improved aid rates, the re introduction of PSA for cheese, the provision allowing 70% advance in the single farm payment, the provision of increased funding for promotion and the provision of almost &euro;14m in targeted direct aid for farmers can go some way towards alleviating the worst effects of the current market downturn. </p>  <p>  The Common Market Organisation Regulation provides that when necessary, reference thresholds shall be updated in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure in the light of developments in production and markets.  The Commission, supported by a number of member states, have been reluctant to engage in such a review, preferring to utilise enhanced supports in other areas.  Furthermore, they have made it clear that the legislative procedure under which this would be undertaken would entail an 18 month lead in time.  In circumstances where it was not possible to obtain member state approval for a temporary increase in threshold prices the prospects of securing approval for a longer term increase in such prices are remote.</p></reply>

The hectares declared must be eligible and must have an agricultural activity carried out on them.  The governing EU regulations define an agricultural activity as the production, rearing or growing of agricultural products, including harvesting, milking, breeding animals, and keeping animals for farming purposes and maintaining an agricultural area in a state which makes it suitable for grazing or cultivation<i>.</i>An applicant is free to choose an activity that best suits their farming enterprise and if s/he so wishes can choose to just top the land.  Where an officially approved environmental management plan under the Birds or Habitats Directives requires certain management practices to be conducted on agricultural areas, such management practices will take precedence in determining the level of agricultural activity to be conducted on agricultural areas declared for payment.  Article 32(2)(b)(i) of Regulation (EU) 1307/2013 provides that an eligible hectare includes any area which gave a right to payments in 2008 under the single payment scheme and which no longer complies with the definition of 'eligible hectare' as a result of the implementation of Directive 92/43/EEC, Directive 2000/60/EC and Directive 2009/147/EC.</p><p>In that regard, the 2015 BPS Terms and Conditions set out details with regard to land eligibility and payments.  Section 1.7 refers to land eligibility and states that in order to draw down payment in respect of BPS entitlements, applicants must have an &ldquo;eligible hectare&rdquo; to accompany each entitlement. An eligible hectare is land that is used for an agricultural activity.  Section 1.7 of the Terms and Conditions further makes reference to The Birds and Habitats Directives and provides that land that no longer complies with the definition of eligible hectare as a result of the implementation of Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds or Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora is eligible for payment where the following conditions are met:</p><p>(i) The land must have been claimed under the 2008 Single Payment  Scheme;</p><p>(ii) The land must have been eligible for payment under the 2008 Single  Payment Scheme;</p><p>(iii) Any increase in the ineligible area should be directly linked to the  management requirements for the habitat.</p><p>Where an applicant is claiming on land that is otherwise considered ineligible, such land will be deemed eligible for payment where the applicant satisfies the requirements as set out above.  In the event any BPS applicant is dissatisfied with the findings of any inspection case he or she can of course, in the normal course of events, avail of the appeals process.</p></reply>

The Control Regulations were introduced so that there is a common EU level playing field and to provide for an effective range of controls across EU waters.</p><p>One of the key elements of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy is the introduction of a phased ban on the discarding of unwanted fish catches.  The first part of the landing obligation, the ban on discarding pelagic stocks such as herring and mackerel, came into effect on the 1<sup>st</sup>of January 2015.  The EU Commission adopted a Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1393/2014 on 20 October 2014 which implements a discard plan for certain pelagic fisheries in north-western waters in line with the recommendation of the North West Waters Member States Group. <b></b>A Control Experts Group from the North West Waters Regional Group of Member States has been set up and has produced a draft set of recommendations on additional control measures for the pelagic sector in respect of the landing obligation in pelagic fisheries.  These draft recommendations have been sent to the Pelagic Advisory Council and the North Western Advisory Council in accordance with article 18 of the CFP basic regulation (EU No 1380/2013) for their observations. </p><p>When these are received, the draft recommendations will be considered by the NWW Member States Group.  A meeting of this Group is planned for the 25<sup>th</sup>November and the control report will be considered.  The measures recommended by the Control experts cover a range of actions including the use of cameras or other remote sensing equipment on all large pelagic vessels, both freezer vessels and our own RSW (Refrigerated Seawater Tank vessels) to support the landing obligation.  It also recommends control observers &ldquo;for individual trips to address dynamically &ndash; assessed risks of a more transient nature.&rdquo;  It is important to note that the flag Member State would be responsible for placing control observers on its vessels.  I consider that any strengthened control measures must provide tools to both the flag Member State and the coastal Member State to better monitor and control fishing activities.  We will continue to work closely with the North Western Waters Member States to identify the control actions that are most useful so that the landing obligation is fully respected. </p></reply>

The difference in numbers between shellfish and finfish reflects the greater number of operators conducting shellfish aquaculture and also, crucially, the hugely complex nature of the assessment process involved in respect of finfish. This is not to suggest that the assessment process is simple in the case of shellfish - it most certainly is not. However, the requirement for a mandatory Environmental Impact Statement in the case of finfish cultivation in the marine environment adds a significant regulatory requirement on operators and on my Department when conducting assessments.In addition, my Department in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service is conducting an &ldquo;Appropriate Assessment&rdquo; process in respect of designated NATURA bays. This process was agreed with the European Commission and is designed to ensure that Ireland is in full compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.</p><p>This process includes the following steps:</p><p>-a detailed data collection in Marine Bays/Estuaries</p><p>-detailed analysis of raw data collected</p><p>-setting of Conservation Objectives by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in respect of each site</p><p>-carrying out Appropriate Assessments of each licence application / fishery plan against the detailed Conservation Objectives set, and</p><p>-determination of Licences on the basis of the Appropriate Assessment and other relevant factors</p><p>The Appropriate Assessment process has now been completed in respect of twelve bays &ndash; Castlemaine Harbour, Roaringwater Bay, Dundalk Bay, Lough Swilly, Donegal Bay, Dungarvan Harbour, Ballycotton Bay, Kenmare Bay, Valentia Harbour/Portmagee Channel, Galway Bay, Clew Bay and Drumcliff Bay/Cummeen Harbour.</p><p>The completion of the process on a bay by bay basis enables my Department to assess applications for new licences or the renewal of licences. Pending a decision on the renewal of licences, operators may lawfully continue their aquaculture activity under the provisions of Section 19A (4) of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act.</p><p>The regulatory procedures in respect of all aquaculture activities have never been stronger and represent a good balance between the need to develop the Industry and provide the highest level of protection for our marine and coastal environment. They are however highly complex in nature and resource intensive. The Deputy will be aware that in Food Wise 2025 I have undertaken to commission a review of the existing aquaculture licensing system involving all key stakeholders, to identify the current shortcomings and bottlenecks (legislative, resource and logistical), and implement necessary changes to the aquaculture licensing system as a matter of priority.  This measure is a further indication of the importance I attach to getting our licensing system fit for purpose in the context of the challenges and opportunities facing the industry in the medium to long term.</p><p>There are a number of finfish and shell fish licence applications currently under consideration by my Department in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act and the 1933 Foreshore Act. </p><p>Notwithstanding the significant complexities involved in the aquaculture licence determination process I expect to be in a position to make in the order of an additional 100 licence determinations by 1<sup>st</sup>April 2016.</p></reply>

Under this programme for forestry, significant measures were included aimed specifically at encouraging farmers to plant native trees. These measures are the Native Woodland Establishment scheme and the Native Woodland Conservation Scheme. The first of these schemes provides financial assistance which covers 100% of the costs of establishing new native forests. An annual premium payment of &euro;635 per hectare is also available each year for 15 years; this rate is the highest rate available of all afforestation planting categories. In order to ensure a higher level of planting of native trees on farms all afforestation must include native woodlands alongside aquatic buffer zones in water sensitive sites such as aquatic Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and sensitive fisheries areas when establishing new forests. This will provide a filtration buffer zone slowing down runoff from upland areas and helping to prevent sediment reaching rivers and streams.    </p>  <p>  Promotion of native woodlands on farms is also included in the Native Woodland Conservation Scheme which aims to support the appropriate restoration of existing native woodlands and (where appropriate) the conversion of existing non-native forest to native woodland. </p>  <p>  In addition to these two native woodland schemes the Department also supports the improvement and management of native woodland seed stands including sessile oak and pedunculate oak seed stands within ancient woodlands. The aim is to increase the supply of home produced seed from native species which can then be used in nurseries to grow native trees for new planting and reforestation including planting as part of the Native Woodland Establishment measure. </p>  <p>  While economic growth and activity is an important justification for the Departments &euro;482 million forestry programme it is vital that this is done in a sustainable and balanced way. The careful and well structured approach to native woodlands as I have described is a clear signal of my Department&rsquo;s intent to continue its development of the forestry sector in a manner which maximises the environmental benefits of forestry including climate change mitigation. The Forest Service of my Department is responsible for delivering this strategy and is best placed to continue this role under its current structure. Consequently my Department has no plans to establish a dedicated unit as described by the Deputy. </p></reply>

However, my Department plays an important role in the enforcement of this legislation under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators. The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement. This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b></b>Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulate that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have systems to identify any person who supplies the business with a food, and a system to identify other businesses to which their product has been supplied. This is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system. There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail. </p><p>My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants. Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating in EU Member States and third countries. Labelling and documentary checks are routinely conducted by the Department. </p><p>The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards. The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department. Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the FVO to ensure compliance. Inspection finding reports are published on the FVO&rsquo;s website. </p></reply>

Live exports serve a dual purpose as a means of satisfying market demand for live animals and providing alternative market outlets for cattle farmers in Ireland.  Total live exports for 2014 were 237,000 head, of which over 72,000 went to the UK - a 10% increase over 2013. Specifically, over 54,000 head were exported to Northern Ireland, which is comparable with the 2013 figure. So far in 2015, approximately 8,500 head of cattle have been exported to Britain, 50% down on 2014. This is a function of better prices being received domestically for beef producers and an almost 10% increase in the live trade to Northern Ireland, up by over 4,000 head in the year to date. This trade has been assisted by the relative strength of sterling in recent times.   </p>  <p>  Dairy farmers expanding their production may have also played a part in decreased live cattle exports to Britain. With the abolition of milk quota it can be assumed that some farmers have elected to hold on to calves and weanlings which would be normally destined for foreign markets.</p>  <p>  A strong system of transport links is in place to facilitate these exports and extra roll-on roll-off ferry capacity for livestock exports has been added since the beginning of this year. Three dedicated vessels and three roll-on roll-off ships are currently approved for export of live animals. The process to approve two more dedicated vessels is also well underway.</p>  <p>  Bord Bia, in its ongoing interactions with British customers, will continue to pursue all possible opportunities to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner in addition to actively supporting the development of the live export trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity.  </p></reply>

The Department of Social Protection, through Intreo, identifies and refers eligible and suitable clients to the Momentum programme. The current phase of Momentum is coming to a conclusion and a decision has yet to be taken on whether or not it will operate again next year. Should it be decided to repeat the programme, the Department will together with the Department of Education and Skills and SOLAS consider if, and if so how, eligibility might be extended to people with disabilities who may be receiving payments other than jobseekers&rsquo; payments.    The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed. The main plank of the guarantee is through early engagement with young recipients of jobseekers payments to provide them with assistance in finding and securing sustainable jobs. Engagement with this process is mandatory for young jobseekers&rsquo; recipients. For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training. Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. </p>  <p>  As those young people with disabilities who approach Intreo offices for employment-related support receive immediate engagement, the main innovation provided by the Youth Guarantee is already in place for this group, as is access to the full range of supports and programmes available for young people more generally. The difference in the treatment of young persons in receipt of disability/illness support payments is that engagement with the Intreo service is on a voluntary basis, unlike job-seekers where participation in activation measures through the Intreo service is mandatory.  </p>  <p>  There is also a range of additional supports that are specific to people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  These supports include the wage subsidy scheme (WSS), the EmployAbility (supported employment) service, the reasonable accommodation fund for the employment of people with disabilities and the disability awareness training scheme. For those who are in receipt of invalidity pension or illness benefit (for at least six months) and who feel they now have some capacity for work, the partial capacity benefit (PCB) scheme allows them to work and retain a portion of their social welfare payment. </p></reply>

The maximum payment for a person aged 18-24 years of age is &euro;100 per week, while for a person aged 25 years of age, the maximum weekly payment is &euro;144.  It is not possible to give an exact breakdown of the individual payment rates for each cohort of participant on JobBridge, but of the total of 1,398 participants aged under 26 years on the programme, a total of 1,139 are in the age category 18-24 while there currently 259 people aged 25 years participating on the scheme.  </p>  <p>  The Department has commissioned another independent evaluation of JobBridge, the results of this evaluation are expected in early 2016 and will inform any further changes to the scheme.</p></reply>

The Revised 2015 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;3.01 billion.    </p>  <p>  In line with other EU and OECD jurisdictions reduced rates for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients were first introduced in 2009 and further extended in 2014.  </p>  <p>  Reduced rates for those under 26 years of age is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.  If a young person does not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.  The measure aims to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.</p>  <p>  The Christmas Bonus is payable to customers who have been in receipt of jobseekers allowance for more than 15 months.  Budget 2016 increased the amount of this bonus from 50% to 75% of the normal weekly payment amount subject to a minimum payment of &euro;20.  The bonus payment will be included in the normal weekly payment in the week commencing 30 November 2015.</p>  <p>  Based on data at the end of October 2015, there are approximately 38,000 jobseekers aged 25 and under and it is estimated that 22,000 of these may be eligible for the Christmas Bonus.</p></reply>

Credits protect an employee&rsquo;s social insurance entitlements by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods of unemployment, illness etc.   </p>  <p>  To qualify for credits a worker must have paid at least one PRSI contribution while working and have had an attachment to the workforce in the last 2 tax years, as evidenced by having paid or credited PRSI contributions in that period.  If these conditions are met, credits are awarded in specific circumstances.  These circumstances include proven unemployment or certified illnesses, receipt of specific social welfare payments, participation on certain training or employment schemes and entitlement to certain statutory leave, such as Parental Leave.  Credits on their own, do not give an employee entitlement to social insurance benefits.  In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes.  </p>  <p>  Where individuals enter the workforce for the first time, including those previously in Direct Provision, they may be entitled to pre-entry credits.  The purpose of pre-entry credits is to enable new entrants to the social insurance system to qualify for benefits within a reasonable period after their date of entry, once they have sufficient paid PRSI contributions.  They are awarded upon the payment of a worker&rsquo;s first paid PRSI contribution as an employee.   Pre-entry credits are awarded:- </p>  <p>  (i)   from the beginning of the relevant contribution year to the date on which they began to work i.e. their date of entry into social insurance as an employed contributor, and</p>  <p>  (ii)  for the two previous contribution years before entry into insurable employment.  </p>  <p>  In effect, the award of pre-entry credits to those previously in direct provision and who take up employment, will provide recognition for social insurance purposes, of a period of between 2 to 3 years spent in Direct Provision Centres.  Any proposal to increase the level of credits awarded for additional periods spent in these centres would have financial implications in terms of increased social insurance entitlements, and would have to be considered in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

Flexibility has been applied across divisions, for example, where a participant&rsquo;s training is leading to a Major Award in Childcare or in Health and Social Care.</p>  <p>  In allocating the budget to schemes, the Department also take into consideration whether the training can be provided by the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) at no additional cost to the scheme.  In this context, it should be noted that approximately 4,000 components of learning were accessed by CE participants in 2014 through the ETBs, the majority of which were accredited.</p></reply>

Participants on the scheme are expected to continue to make efforts to find full-time work.  There are currently 381 participants on the scheme with a budget of just under &euro;2 million for 2015.</p>  <p>  To qualify for the part-time job incentive scheme a person must be in receipt of jobseeker's allowance for at least 390 days.  In addition, a person must have been in receipt of a higher jobseeker's payment rate than the appropriate part-time job incentive supplement payable.  The part-time job incentive supplement rate is &euro;119 per week for a single person and &euro;193.90 per week where an individual was getting an increase for a qualified adult.  There is no increase for qualified children.</p>  <p>  I recently sought and received special sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to extend the part time job incentive scheme to customers who have exited the one parent family payment due to the scheme reforms.  This sanction is specifically for former one-parent family payment recipients whose youngest child is aged 14 or over, who are working more than 3 days out of 7 and, as such would not be entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  This particular extension to the scheme will be available to participants for one year giving them time to increase their hours to 19 per week and qualify for the family income supplement.</p>  <p>  Of the 25,500 customers who exited the one-parent family payment scheme in July 2015, my Department has recently written to 392 customers who, due to their specific work pattern and the age of their youngest child, may benefit financially from availing of the part time job incentive scheme.  These customers have been invited to meet a case officer in their local Intreo Centre to discuss their situation.</p></reply>

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and maintain revenue to reduce the budget deficit. It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced, and is applied at a low rate on a wide base.  </p>  <p>  The USC, like the Income Levy before it, does not apply to social welfare payments, such as the contributory and non-contributory State pensions, or payments of a similar nature.  However occupational pensions, including occupational pensions of retired civil servants, are liable to the USC if the payment is greater than the exemption threshold, which for 2015 is &euro;12,012.  </p>  <p>  As you are aware, delivering on a commitment in the Programme for Government, the USC was reviewed by my Department in the lead up to Budget 2012. The report is available at www.finance.gov.ie. The issue of  USC applying to occupational pensions of retired public servants who entered the public service before April 1995 was examined as part of that review.  Such individuals are (or were) liable to modified rate PRSI, which does not generate an entitlement to the State Pension.</p>  <p>  The Government decided not to exempt the occupational pensions of these individuals from the USC charge as it would be very costly and difficult to achieve, and it would involve all income earners with the equivalent income benefiting from the exemption.  In addition, it would also undermine the principle of the USC being applied to income with few exceptions. </p>  <p>  However, as a result of the review of the USC, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum. Budget 2015 provided for an increase in the exemption threshold to &euro;12,012 and I announced in my recent Budget speech that this threshold will increase to &euro;13,000 per annum from 1 January 2016. It is estimated that over 700,000 income earners will not be liable to USC at all from next year.  </p>  <p>  This exemption threshold equalises the position for single individuals whose sole source of income is the State Contributory Pension with Public Service pensioners whose pension is at an equivalent level. Furthermore, I intend to continue to reform the tax system in future budgets, subject to having the required fiscal space.  </p>  <p>  For the reasons outlined, I do not consider the application of the USC on Public Service pensions to be discriminatory. I would point out that the changes to the income tax system included in Budget 2015 mean that individuals who paid Income Tax and/or USC in 2014, including pensioners, are seeing a reduction in their tax bill this year where incomes are equal. Budget 2016 is now continuing this process of reducing the tax burden on low and middle income earners including, among other changes, a decrease in the three lowest rates of USC announced to take effect from January 2016.</p></reply>

Where a credit union wishes to provide services to its members, in addition to the services that are provided for under the 1997 Act, an application may be made to the Central Bank for approval to provide such additional services in accordance with the provisions set out in sections 48-52 of the 1997 Act.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that since 2010 it has received less than 10 applications for approval of additional services under sections 48-52 of the 1997 Act. These have all been received in the last 15 months and are currently at various stages in the approval process, with a number having been fully approved.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated to credit unions that where they are considering offering debit card services to members, the credit union should, in the first instance contact the Registry of Credit Unions to inform them of any such proposals. I have been informed by the Central Bank that a small number of credit unions are currently offering card services to members or are involved in card services pilot schemes.</p>  <p>  I have been further informed by the Central Bank that it is, in principle, supportive of credit unions developing additional services and is open to working with the credit union sector to ensure that prudent and appropriate development can be facilitated within the regulatory framework. In its role of supporting the sustainable and prudent development of the sector, the Central Bank wants to ensure that proposed changes to the business model are prudently structured and implemented. Given a number of areas identified in feedback received on consultation paper 88-CP88, and through other engagements with sector stakeholders, the Central Bank will engage with interested parties to participate in focused dialogue in the coming months. Dialogue will initially centre on:</p>  <p>  -  the services credit unions wish to develop in the areas of card services and payment accounts; and </p>  <p>  -  credit unions' aims regarding longer term lending including further developments on the provision of mortgages to members.</p>  <p>  To commence this engagement process, an initial meeting with a number of credit union stakeholders, including the representative bodies and a number of credit unions was held by the Central Bank in mid-November.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank also informs me that the Annual Information Seminars for 2015 are currently taking place and will run until late November and these will also provide an opportunity for the Central Bank to engage with individual credit unions and hear their views on business development.</p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.</p></reply>

The Central Bank had briefed industry representatives in August that it was proposing significant increases in those levies in 2015. The proposed increases were driven by a proliferation of legislative regulation and corresponding regulatory activity; a need to meet a shortfall from 2014's levies; and an increase in staff pension costs arising from Financial Reporting Standard 17 (which was coupled with prevailing low yields on the bond market).</p>  <p>  The Central Bank's original proposals have since been revised to partially mitigate those increases as per a statement of 30th September 2015 published on the Central Bank's website. The revised proposals significantly reduced the increase in pension costs charged to the regulated sector in 2015 which is instead spread over coming years thereby easing the burden on financial services sector firms this year. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that a robust regulatory environment benefits the financial services industry by promoting stability, a level playing field and facilitating prudent development and innovation. A well regulated financial services sector also benefits consumers, industry, and the economy at large. In order to ensure a well regulated financial services sector the Central Bank must be sufficiently resourced, particularly in terms of staff who are key to an effective regulatory regime. Pensions are a standard component in financial regulation costs given their link to staff costs.  </p>  <p>  Under Section 32D of the Central Bank Act 1942, the Central Bank is required to seek my approval for the Regulations prescribing industry levies. As part of that process officials from my Department met with intermediary industry representatives in order to hear their concerns on the increase in levies payable by their members. Following the publication of the Central Bank's revised proposals, which significantly reduced the pension element of the 2015 levies, I approved the Regulations prescribing the 2015 levies on 7 October last.</p></reply>

The incentives include exemption from income tax on pension contributions made from annual relevant earnings based on a percentage of those earnings which increases with age and subject to an overall earnings limit of &euro;115,000 per annum. Pension fund growth is also exempt from tax while the retirement benefits drawn down at retirement are subject to tax at the individual's marginal tax rate with the exception of the permissible tax-free retirement lump sum.</p>  <p>  Revenue approval of the various pension saving arrangements ensures that the tax incentives outlined above are confined to pension schemes and plans that are taken out for the sole purpose of providing retirement benefits at the appropriate age in line with tax law and Revenue rules. </p>  <p>  As regards personal pensions plans such as Retirement Annuity Contracts or PRSAs, an individual must have a source of "relevant earnings" in order to effect such a plan. In general, this covers income taxable under Schedule E from non-pensionable employment and trading and professional income (Schedule D, Cases 1 and 2). Income from investments such as rental income from property, cannot be used to effect such a plan as it is not a source of "relevant earnings". This reflects the fact that pension income replaces an individual's earned income once they retire. In contrast, individuals with investment income do not lose that income source at the point at which they reach what could be considered "normal retirement age". The income will continue as before and they have the investment asset, for example, a property or properties, which may be converted to a capital sum with which they can purchase an annuity if they so wish. </p>  <p>  Having excluded investment income from "relevant earnings" for the purposes of private or supplementary pension provision and the tax reliefs on contributions that go with it, it would appear contradictory, to say the least, from a policy perspective to then allow tax relief at a later date on rental income from a property designated a "pension property" by the property owner which appears to be what is envisaged in the details supplied with the question.</p>  <p>  Where an individual owns a property and rents it out, the rental income is receivable directly by the landlord and accordingly is taxable in the year that it is receivable. There are a number of allowances and deductions available to reduce the tax on rental income paid. These include, for example: a deduction of 75% of the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair rented premises; the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant; and the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property.</p>  <p>  However, for the reasons outlined, I have no plans to introduce further changes or additional tax incentives as requested.</p></reply>

There is extensive detail on this initiative on NAMA's website, .  Under this initiative, NAMA identified the properties to the Housing Agency under a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) which in turn has engaged with local authorities to ascertain demand and with local authorities and approved bodies to determine the allocation of properties for which demand was confirmed.  NAMA has no role in determining which properties or the number of properties that are required for social housing or in decisions relating to the location or allocation of properties by the Housing Agency.  </p><p>Of the 6,500 properties made available by NAMA, demand has been confirmed by local authorities for just over 2,500 and more than 1,600 of these have already been delivered.  The 4,000 residential properties not taken up for social housing have been either sold or rented in the private housing market by NAMA debtors and receivers and in that way have contributed to increased market supply.  In determining demand, local authorities based their decisions on criteria such as location and wider planning and housing policy considerations.  There were also cases where the related properties were sold or rented by their owners or appointed receivers in the time taken by local authorities to assess and confirm demand.</p><p>Where demand is confirmed for a property, NAMA makes whatever funding is needed, more than &euro;50m to date, to ensure that  previously unfinished properties are completed and comply fully with all building standards.  In addition to facilitating the sale or lease of properties through its debtors and receivers, NAMA has established a social housing SPV, NARPS, which directly leases properties to approved housing bodies.  NAMA has developed standardised long-term leasing arrangements and attractive lease terms to facilitate this process. </p><p>I am advised that there has been extensive engagement between NAMA and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and all the other stakeholders, including the Housing Agency, local authorities and approved housing bodies, on this initiative and all of the parties have worked extremely hard to ensure that properties for which demand has been confirmed are delivered as quickly as possible, notwithstanding the substantial construction and wider compliance work that is required in many cases.  </p><p>As the NAMA Chair recently pointed out to the Public Accounts Committee, following this initiative, there are now very few unoccupied houses across NAMA's entire portfolio.</p><p>The issue of social housing is, as the Deputy is aware, directly impacted by the level of housing output generally in the economy.  NAMA is, in this respect, making a very substantial contribution to increased housing supply.  It funded close to 50% of new housing output in Dublin last year despite having an exposure to less than one-third of all Dublin residential development land.  The NAMA Board has also indicated that it could fund up to 20,000 additional new homes on a commercial basis in the five years to end-2020, approximately 90% of which could be in Dublin and the greater Dublin area where demand is greatest.  NAMA-funded residential developments are subject to the same planning and social housing provisions, including Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), as all other residential development projects in the State.  Therefore, NAMA's major contribution over the coming years will be in funding vitally needed new residential supply and will contribute to future delivery of social housing through Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) as part of this funding.</p></reply>

When fully rolled-out from 1 January 2018, this means that all public service pensions in payment with pre-PSPR values of up to &euro;34,132 will be fully exempt from PSPR, while those pensioners not fully removed from the reach of PSPR will, in general, benefit by &euro;1,680 per year.  The cost of these  changes is estimated at about &euro;90 million on a full-year basis from 2018. </p><p>The issue of post retirement pension increases will have to be addressed in the medium term, as we move beyond the FEMPI era towards a more normal environment for pay and pension setting, while continuing to ensure the affordability of the cost of the public service over the long term.  However at this juncture, I believe that the current PSPR ameliorative measures represent a fair and sound basis on which, in the improved but still constrained fiscal space, public service pension reductions may be restored in a phased, moderate and progressive fashion, with those on lower PSPR impacted pensions benefiting to a greater extent. </p></reply>

The following is a list of Agencies/Bodies established under the aegis of my Department since March 2011.<table><tr><th>New State Agencies</th><th>Date established</th></tr><tr><td>The Low Pay Commission</td><td>The Low Pay Commission was established on 26 February 2015, initially on an interim basis, and subsequently on a statutory basis under the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015, enacted on 15 July 2015.The Commission has 9 members, one of whom acts as an independent chairman.  The primary duty of the Commission is to make recommendations to me each year regarding the national minimum hourly rate of pay, but it may also examine other related matters, at my request.</td></tr><tr><td>Workplace Relations Commission (WRC)</td><td>With effect from 1 October 2015, the activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court were merged into a new Body of First Instance, known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).In addition, the appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal are now incorporated into an expanded Labour Court.  From 1 October all complaints fall to be referred to the Workplace Relations Commission in the first instance, and, on appeal, to the Labour Court.This heralds the biggest reorganisation of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations and employment machinery in almost 70 years and is the result of four years of reform driven by my Department.<br /><br />A single Contact Portal and information service, workplacerelations.ie, a single complaint form replacing 30 individual complaint forms, and a process supported by a modern IT infrastructure ensures a better experience for all in need of assistance to resolve their employment grievances.  </td></tr><tr><td>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission</td><td>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission was established on 31 October 2014 as a result of the merger of the Competition Authority and National Consumer Agency.  The Commission currently has 4 members (with one vacancy) and has a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law and will build on the work of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority to protect and strengthen competition, empower consumers to make informed decisions and protect them from harmful business practices.  </td></tr></table></p><p>Other reforms of State Agencies or bodies under the aegis of my Department, since March 2011, have been:</p><p>The dissolution of Forf&aacute;s, as a statutory body and  the integration of its research capability into my Department, with effect from 1 August 2014, under the Industrial Development (Forf&aacute;s Dissolution) Act, 2014.  As part of the dissolution of Forf&aacute;s, the functions of the Irish National Accreditation Board were transferred from Forf&aacute;s to the Health and Safety Authority.</p><p>The transfer of enterprise functions from Shannon Development to IDA, EI and tourism functions to Bord F&aacute;ilte took place during the last quarter of 2013.  The legislation to merge Shannon Development and Shannon Airport into a new commercial state company, State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014, was enacted on 27 July 2014.  Responsibility for the newly formed Shannon Group plc rests with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p>The dissolution, on 15<sup></sup>April 2014, of the 35 County and City Enterprise Boards, as separate statutory bodies, under the County Enterprise Boards (Dissolution) Act, 2014.  Under the legislation, the functions, assets and liabilities of the County Enterprise Boards were transferred to Enterprise Ireland (E.I.), and these functions are now being delivered on behalf of E.I. by the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), within the Local Authority structure. </p><p>In addition, following enactment of the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act 2012, Microfinance Ireland was established as a private limited company in August 2012, as a subsidiary of the Social Finance Foundation and has charitable status.  </p><p>Microfinance Ireland has been funded by the Government to provide loans to newly established and growing microenterprises across all industry sectors that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.</p></reply>

According to the 2014 Annual Employment Survey, which contains the latest available figures, there are 35 multinational companies based in the Midlands, employing approximately 3,800 people across the region.  6 of those companies are located in Co. Longford employing c560 people. In Co. Westmeath, FDI has performed well and there 16 companies employing c2,300 people. 3 of those companies are based in Mullingar, employing c150 people. </p>  <p>   IDA Ireland&rsquo;s plans for the Midlands Region, which includes the towns listed about,  are incorporated into the Action Plan for Jobs: Midland Region which I launched on the 29th June. This plan sets out over 120 actions aimed to deliver enhanced employment growth in the region over the coming years with a target of increasing employment in the region by approximately 14,000 by 2020. </p>  <p>  In June 2015, IDA Ireland appointed a dedicated Regional Manager to the Midlands Region and IDA Ireland will be targeting at least 25 additional FDI projects in the Midlands Region over the next 5 years.  Supporting the increase in investment in this and all regions across the country will be a &euro;150m property investment plan spread out over five years.  The funding will be used to upgrade Ireland's business and technology parks, make investments in a number of strategic utility-intensive sites and build new advanced technology buildings in a number of regional locations. An advanced office building is planned for 2017 for Co. Westmeath as part of the programme. This is in addition to an advanced technology building, which was completed in 2014 in Athlone and is available for FDI investment.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland has put a digital marketing campaign in place to market the Midlands Region for potential investors and this is used overseas by IDA executives, to showcase potential locations within the Midlands Region including Mullingar and Longford.  Currently, IDA Ireland positions the Midlands Region as having a strong cluster in medical technology and life sciences. The Midlands is home to key clients such as Abbott, Covidien, Integra, GeneMedix, Freund, Utah, KCI, and AMS. Examples of where the cluster effect benefits investment decisions include the announcement in 2014 by Jazz Pharmaceuticals and American Medical Systems, both located in Athlone, who are already seeking planning permission to expand after only two years.  As well as the FDI sector, this cluster is supported by over 600 people employed in medical technology related industries from the indigenous sector, in areas such as manufacturing to delivery of elements of the supply chain.</p>  <p>  Given the global economic operating environment in recent years, the existing client base has performed consistently and retained its presence.  IDA Ireland actively engages with its existing client base to support them in growing their business to retain jobs and expand their existing footprint in the region.  In this respect, Patterson Pumps, located in Mullingar, announced a 30-person expansion at the opening of its new manufacturing facility in September 2015.</p>  <p>  The Succeed in Ireland initiative is supported by IDA Ireland, which partners with ConnectIreland to support any potential investors identified to locate in Ireland and Arc Consulting in Longford is an example of this in practice.  IDA Ireland also has regular engagement with the Chief Executives of the local authorities of Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly to ensure that there is a continuous line of communication open and a mutually supportive approach taken, considering the role that Local Authorities now have for economic development.</p></reply>

The statutory instruments designate the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission as the competent authority in the State for the purpose of the Directive and the enforcement of the regulations. They also set out the requirements which a dispute resolution entity must fulfil in order to be recognised as a qualified ADR entity and specify the information which a trader must make available to a consumer. </p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is currently accepting notification requests from dispute resolution bodies who are seeking to be notified as qualified ADR entities and the necessary documentation is available on their website. As required under the regulations, the Commission will establish and maintain a list of ADR entities that have been notified to it and which satisfy the quality requirements specified in the Directive. </p>  <p>  In relation to the related Council Regulation (EU) on online dispute resolution for consumer disputes, the position is that I signed the necessary implementing regulations into national law on 9 November, 2015 (S.I. No. 500 of 2015). The statutory instrument designates the European Consumer Centre Ireland as the ODR contact point in the State for the purposes of Article 7 of the Council Regulation and specifies the functions it will carry out as the ODR contact point. The electronic online dispute resolution platform will be provided by the European Commission and is due to commence operation on 9 January, 2016. </p></reply>

Under this legislation, Member States are permitted to introduce compulsory electronic identification of cattle with effect from 18 July 2019 and are obliged to have facilities in place to provide for the use of electronic identifiers (electronic tags or electronic bolus) as an official means of identification with effect from the same date.</p><p>My Department will facilitate the introduction of electronic identification (EID) of bovines in accordance with the requirements of the aforementioned EU Regulation. There are no provisions in the Regulation in relation to the mandatory introduction of electronic identification of bovines in advance of 18 July 2019. Nevertheless, my Department already provides for the use of EID tags in the current contract for the supply of bovine tags on a voluntary basis but there is very low demand (approximately 1% of herd keepers) for cattle EID tags which cost approximately &euro;1 more than the conventional tag.</p><p>In view of the foregoing, I have no plans to introduce mandatory EID for bovine animals. However my Department will keep the position under review in the context of consultation with all the stakeholders and developments at EU level. It is difficult to project the precise exchequer savings, if any, that would accrue following the mandatory introduction of EID. The purpose of the disease levies is to contribute towards the cost of the disease eradication programme and it would not be appropriate to link reduction in farmer disease levies to the mandatory introduction of EID in the bovine herd.</p></reply>

Some 4,000 individual farmers are involved, which indicates that on average about 30% of shareholders across all commonages have opted to join GLAS. In addition to those who have opted to join GLAS, a similar number of shareholders are already managing their commonage lands under the earlier agri-environmental scheme AEOS. Many of these farmers intend to see out their AEOS contracts before joining GLAS, confident in the knowledge that they will receive priority access to the new scheme when they do decide to join. A phased recruitment to both GLAS and to the various Commonage Management Plans was specifically anticipated in the scheme design, and specific provision has been made to accommodate these farmers on that basis.</p>  <p>  All-in-all, I believe we have made excellent progress in this area under Tranche 1 of GLAS and the uptake to date is an important step towards the establishment of greatly enhanced management regimes for these upland areas. I would expect that the second tranche of GLAS, which closes on 7 December, will contain a further significant number of commonage applications. </p>  <p>  Turning to the question of Commonage Management Plans, there is no requirement for any such plans to be submitted until next year. My Department has already laid out the detail of what is to be included in these plans and is currently finalising the provision of functionality on the online GLAS system which will allow Commonage Management Plans to be submitted in electronic format. I would not expect to see the first plans submitted until early 2016, with most coming in later that year.</p></reply>

Farmers with land identified as important for the bird are guaranteed access to the scheme as priority candidates in Tier One of GLAS.  I have also provided that such farmers will be automatically approved for GLAS Plus should they be farming sufficient area of habitat.  I would strongly encourage all farmers with hen-harrier land to take up this measure under GLAS, which offers a payment rate of &euro;370 per hectare.  Farmers can earn up to &euro;7,000 per annum through a combination of GLAS and GLAS Plus payments and some 1,400 hen-harrier farmers have already been approved into the new scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have recently announced that I intend to introduce a further scheme of assistance under the Locally Led Agri-Environment measure, to cater for farmers who are farming large tracts of hen-harrier land.  One of the principles of the planned locally-led measure is to explore new ways of managing farming effort for the benefit of the environment, and in this case for the benefit of the hen-harrier.  The detail of what type of actions will be applied under this new scheme is still being developed and this in turn will direct how the Locally Led Scheme interfaces with GLAS. </p>  <p>  When the new scheme is designed, it has then to be negotiated with the EU Commission and formally introduced by amendment to the Rural Development Programme.  I expect that this process will be concluded early next year.  However, only one amendment of the RDP is allowed annually, which means that a number of items will be bundled together and presented for approval at the same time.  The proposed amendment is necessary to get EU approval not alone for the new Hen Harrier scheme, but also for the various other locally-led schemes that I intend to introduce.  After approval has been received I will be in a position to open a Hen-Harrier Scheme.</p></reply>

Funding for the Scottish Derogation is financed mainly from the Basic payment scheme and 2,800 applications have been processed to date at a cost in 2015 of &euro;550,000 from that ceiling and these farmers have been notified accordingly.

All TAMS schemes have been opened and the applications received under the first tranches of both the Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme and the Dairy Equipment Scheme are now being processed. The first tranche for the Pig and Poultry Scheme closed on the 30 October and for the Low Emission Slurry Spreading scheme on the 20 November. The first tranches for the Organic Capital Investment Scheme and the Animal Welfare, Safety and Nutrient Storage Scheme will be closing on the 30 November.  Interest in TAMS to date has exceeded expectations and clearly many Irish farmers are looking once again at the benefits of investing in their enterprises and expanding production. Under the Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme a total of 520 applications have been received, while over a thousand applications have been submitted for the Dairy Equipment Scheme. </p>  <p>  All applications received are being examined and approvals will commence when all of the required checks have been undertaken. This is a complex process and as all applications for TAMS 2 must be made under a tranche-based approach, we are required to evaluate, rank and assess all applications received together. I am aware that a number of farmers with proposed investments in dairy equipment are keen to commence work as quickly as possible. My Department is working to process approvals as quickly as possible and to make payments at the earliest possible juncture.</p></reply>

Teagasc has agreed and documented grievance procedures  which  include the right to appeal by any staff member who feels they have not been dealt with fairly.  I am advised that the person in question disputed his unsuccessful application for a Post of Responsibility in Teagasc Mayo in 2007.  His appeals were processed through all of the internal Teagasc appeals  procedures as well as external independent hearings in both the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.   I understand that through all of these processes, no basis was found to overturn the original decision of the interview board. </p>  <p>  This issue has also been the subject of considerable correspondence between that individual and my Department over a prolonged period.  The Department has been consistent in informing him that it has no role in resolving issues pertaining to promotion competitions in Teagasc.  He has also been advised that any candidate who is unhappy with the outcome of a competition can seek legal advice, and pursue whichever civil remedies that may be available, if they consider agreed procedures have been breached. </p>  <p>  At the request of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office, officials from my Department met with the individual concerned in September 2014 to hear his complaints regarding what he perceives to have been an unfair and improper selection process.  My Department conducted a detailed, impartial examination of a dossier presented at that meeting to determine whether it included any new evidence, which would warrant an investigation into events which at that point characterised as fraud.  The papers related to the circumstances surrounding the selection process for posts of responsibility in Teagasc in 2007 and the subsequent grievance procedure hearing. </p>  <p>  I am advised that having assessed the information, it was considered that the issues raised appear to be firmly in the sphere of industrial relations, that the normal employment appeals avenues had been employed, and that the matter did not warrant investigation by my Department.  Accordingly, my Department is not in a position to take the matter further. The individual concerned is of course free to consider such other avenues of redress as may be available to him through the Courts. </p></reply>

In addition to these value increases, the dairy industry targeted a 50% increase in<b></b>milk production by 2020, to be progressed following the abolition of milk quotas in April this year. </p><p>Progress on these targets is monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis. The fourth annual report <i>&ldquo;Milestones for Success 2014&rdquo;</i>, published September 2014, showed that the sector had achieved very significant progress on these targets and illustrated the manner in which the Food Harvest 2020 vision of &lsquo;smart, green, growth&rsquo; is being attained. The Milestones report showed that, compared to the Food Harvest baseline: primary output had increased by 32% in 2014; agri-food exports had increased by 27% in 2014; and value added had increased by 29% in 2012 (latest data available). </p><p>Food Wise 2025, the new ten year strategy for the agri-food sector published in July this year, builds on the successful vision of Food Harvest 2020. It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper. Food Wise includes more than 380 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p><p>If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee which drew up the Food Wise Strategy believes that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025: increasing the value of agri-food exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increasing value added in the sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion; and increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion. With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agri-food sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development. Realising these growth projections will be challenging, but I am confident that they can be achieved. </p><p>I chair the High Level Implementation Committee, including senior officials from relevant Departments and State agencies, which will drive implementation of the Food Wise recommendations. The HLIC met for the first time in September. The second meeting today will deal specifically with sustainability, which will be at the core of the strategy&rsquo;s implementation. The implementation of Food Wise will be influenced by the final Environmental Analysis Report on Food Wise, which will be presented to the HLIC today. </p></reply>

The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement. This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b></b>Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have systems to identify any person who supplies the business with a food, and a system to identify other businesses to which their product has been supplied. This is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system. There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.  </p><p>My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants. Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating in EU Member States and third countries. Labelling and documentary checks are routinely conducted by the Department. </p><p>The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards. The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department. Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the FVO to ensure compliance. Inspection finding reports are published on the FVO&rsquo;s website. </p></reply>

All of the fisheries resource within the area comes under the remit of the EU&rsquo;s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). <font color="#FF0000"> </font>The new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) provides the framework for the long term conservation and sustainability of fish stocks around our shores and is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters.  </p><p>A key element of the new CFP is to apply the precautionary approach to fisheries management and thereby ensure that exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and maintains populations of harvested species above levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) . This will be phased in gradually and shall be achieved by 2015 where possible and on a progressive, incremental basis at the latest by 2020 for all stocks. This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks and more sustainable fishing patterns as more fish are left in the sea to mature and reproduce leading to increased abundance of fish, and over time to higher quotas for Irish fishermen. The CFP specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY. All member states must respect the CFP provisions. I am committed to the ambitious objective of achieving MSY by 2015 where possible and by 2020 at the latest.</p><p>The EU Commission has noted that the state of fish stocks in European Atlantic and nearby waters continues to improve which I believe indicates that we are finally starting to see the benefits of prudent and responsible fisheries management practices. Scientific information on the state of the fisheries resources exploited by the Irish fleet is compiled by the Marine Institute and is published in the Stock Book each year.</p></reply>

This imperative informed my approach to the negotiations in 2012 and 2013, and it continues to inform the process by which the various elements of CAP reform are now being delivered.</p>  <p>  Taking the direct payments system as an example, the Deputy may recall that I proposed an alternative approach to the redistribution of direct payments than that originally advocated by the European Commission, precisely because I wanted to ensure that the direct payments system could be made fairer and more equitable while at the same time ensuring that the level of transfer of payments between farmers was not of a scale that might jeopardise our objectives for the development of the sector. We now have a system which satisfies these two requirements. The advance payments that commenced last month - which will be followed by balancing payments from next week - represented the start of a process that, by 2019, will see a considerable shift in the balance of payments from those previously receiving very high rates per hectare to those previously receiving much lower rates of payment. I believe that this not only makes the direct payments system fairer, but also ensures that it continues to provide support and income stability that will allow farmers to respond to the demands of the market. As such, it also provides a vital tool to help us achieve the objectives outlined in the Food Wise 2025 strategy.</p>  <p>  I have also taken significant steps to encourage the participation of young farmers in agriculture, which is vital in terms of securing the critical role that farm families play in the development of the sector. In addition to providing for a top-up of direct payments, I have ensured that young farmers are prioritised in the allocation of payment entitlements from the national reserve. These direct payments measures are further complemented by supports under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme where, for example, enhanced support for capital investment by young farmers has been made available under the TAMS schemes. </p>  <p>  More generally under Pillar 2 of the CAP, I am focussed on the socio-economic development of our farms and of our rural areas so that all farm families have an opportunity to realise their potential. Schemes for improving sustainability (such as GLAS and the Beef Data and Genomics Programme) and competitiveness (such as TAMS) are complemented by continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now known as Areas of Natural Constraint). I believe this combination provides a vital range of supports that will allow farm families to continue to benefit from the CAP in an equitable manner while supporting their development over the coming years.</p></reply>

My Department engages on an ongoing basis with many third countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Irish embassy staff, the meat industry and the European Commission on various market access issues.</p>  <p>  Since taking office I have led trade missions to a wide variety of destinations, including China, the United States, Algeria, Japan and the Gulf States, in order to promote Irish food and beverages, including meat exports, and to open up new markets abroad. These initiatives have led to several notable successes in securing agreement to export Irish beef to Japan, Singapore, Egypt, Iran, the US, Canada and Oman; to export sheepmeat to Singapore, South Africa, the Philippines, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, Canada and Oman; and to export pigmeat to Australia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Serbia. </p>  <p>  In relation to China, the ban on boneless beef from Ireland has been lifted for animals under 30 months. Further work is required before trade will commence, and my Department is at present engaging with the Chinese authorities on these technical details. The beef market in the US was opened in January 2015 and as of the start of November 2015, an estimated 1,300 tonnes valued at &euro;8.5 million has already been exported. This is a strong start to this trade considering that the first exports only went in March 2015 and some of the plants were only approved for export as recently as September. In relation to the Philippines, Ireland has now become their second-largest supplier of beef, and Ireland supplied around 20% of their beef imports during the first quarter of 2015. </p>  <p>  Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across the EU. This wide portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years and reflects the success of Bord Bia&rsquo;s differentiation and premiumisation strategy, which focuses on the main attributes of Irish beef: environmental sustainability, grass-based production systems, full traceability, quality assurance at all stages and superior eating quality. Among Bord Bia&rsquo;s key initiatives in 2015 is the continued development, global promotion and marketing of the Origin Green initiative, which establishes Ireland as a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink. Over 200 companies are currently working with Bord Bia to develop and commit to sustainability plans setting out clear targets in emissions, energy, waste, water, biodiversity and corporate social responsibility activities.   </p>  <p>  The sheep sector is an important component of our agriculture sector and the third largest farming sector in Ireland with over 34,000 producers and an output value of over &euro;230 million in 2014. Sheepmeat exports in 2014 totalled some &euro;210 million. The market in Hong Kong opened for exports of sheepmeat in 2014 and exports of sheepmeat were valued at almost &euro;9 million in 2014.   </p>  <p>  The poultry sector plays an important role within the Irish agricultural economy, accounting for approximately 2% of gross agricultural output and supporting around 5,000 jobs, mostly in rural areas. Export values for poultry meat have increased steadily in recent years to c. &euro;310 million in 2014, growing by 20% in the last year alone, as the value of trade was driven by larger shipments of processed products. A high proportion of these exports are destined for the UK and redirected to international markets through agents for &lsquo;fifth quarter&rsquo; product like chicken feet. Strong fundamentals increased demand in almost all regions of the world in 2014. This is expected to continue in 2015, although some easing in global poultry prices is expected.   </p>  <p>  The development of a viable pigmeat sector is a priority for me, given the crucial role which the industry plays in supporting approximately 7,000 jobs including production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services. In 2014 export volumes jumped by approximately 7%, with growth to the UK, Continental Europe and International markets. Export values were up by 3% and are in the range of &euro;570 million, continuing the steady growth seen in recent years. Although the increase in Irish pigmeat exports to international markets in recent years has been negatively impacted by the restrictions of the Russian trade ban, this has been offset by the opening of alternative markets such as Vietnam and the Philippines. These Asian markets will continue to provide valuable opportunities for Irish pork producers into the future. </p></reply>

Agri food exports account for 7% of GDP and continue to grow year on year.</p><p>My colleague, the Minister for Health, has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation and new EU food information regulations which were adopted by the Council of Health Ministers in December 2011. However, my Department plays an important role in the enforcement of this legislation under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</p><p>Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators. The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement. This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b></b>Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have systems to identify any person who supplies the business with a food, and a system to identify other businesses to which their product has been supplied. This is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system. There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail. </p><p>My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants. Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating in EU Member States and third countries. Labelling and documentary checks are routinely conducted by the Department. </p><p>The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards. The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department. Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the FVO to ensure compliance. Inspection finding reports are published on the FVO&rsquo;s website. </p></reply>

The average price received by producers for an R 3 steer in 2015 to date is &euro;4.01, over 10 % higher than the 2014 average.</p>  <p>  In 2015, I have rolled out a number of supports for Beef farmers . The BDGP involves an investment of over &euro;300 million in suckler farming over the next 6 years under Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan (RDP). The scheme aims to improve the genetic merit of Irish beef cattle, which will in turn lead to increased returns for beef producers and improve the environmental sustainability of the beef herd. The scheme also aims to reverse the decline in the maternal index seen in recent years in the Irish beef herd. This investment is a huge vote of confidence from the government in the Irish Beef herd&rsquo;s potential into the future.   </p>  <p>  Beef farmers can also avail of my Department&rsquo;s Knowledge Transfer Programme and my Department provides significant funding for bodies such as Teagasc, Bord Bia, ICBF and AHI, which are a vital part of the support infrastructure for beef.   </p>  <p>  Participants in the programme will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 for each of the first eligible 6.66 hectares and &euro;120 for each of the remaining hectares up to the maximum payable area. The maximum payable area is based on the number of calved suckler cows in each herd in 2014. The payment rates provide for a higher payment linked to the first 10 animals on each herd as I felt it was important to favour smaller herds through this programme. The payment rate of &euro;142.50 is the maximum amount which could be provided based on the cost incurred and income foregone associated with the actions under the BDGP, as negotiated with the European Commission. The BDGP is the only animal based scheme in the Rural Development plan   </p>  <p>  Ireland is a major exporter of beef, supplying more than half a million tonnes annually to a wide array of European and International markets. Irish beef is now purchased by more than 85 EU supermarket chains, along with numerous high-value food service and manufacturing customers. The Origin Green sustainability programme is central to Bord Bia's promotional strategy for Irish beef, alongside the Beef and Lamb Quality Assurance scheme (BLQAS). One of the fundamental elements of Origin Green relates to the sustainability survey carried out at the time of the farm audit. With over 47,000 certified farms in BLQAS, Ireland is the first country in the world to measure on-farm sustainability on such an extensive basis. The programme has already proven to be a unique advantage in communicating with key customers, and is the envy of other major beef producing countries. Earlier this year, Ireland became the first European country authorised to resume exporting beef to the US market and this market is already worth almost &euro;9m. Similarly, China offers future huge potential for Irish beef exports and my Department is working with the Chinese authorities to have the final technical issues resolved before trade can commence.   </p></reply>

Surveys led to further findings of the disease. The first step was the introduction of national legislative measures in November 2012 under the Destructive Insects and Pest Acts 1958 and 1991 which listed the disease as a pest and which also regulated the import of ash seed, plants and wood. In December 2012 ash was delisted from the list of tree species approved under the afforestation grant schemes and thereafter the Department also delisted ash for the trees species approved under the agri-environment options scheme (AEOS and now GLAS). The National Roads Authority agreed in 2013 to suspend the use of Ash in any roadside plantings and since then it uses alternative species.</p>  <p>  Also in December 2012 the Department introduced a new scheme to restore forests affected by ash dieback, by supporting the removal and destruction of trees and leaf litter affected by the disease and the replanting of the forest with an alternative species. The number of individual ash trees destroyed as part of this exercise is not recorded, however to date 713 hectares of ash has been removed under the scheme. In addition, over the same period, the Department has overseen the removal of several thousand ash plants and trees in nurseries and from along roadways. </p>  <p>  An &ldquo;All Ireland Chalara Control Strategy&rdquo; was launched by Minister of State Tom Hayes and Minister Michelle O&rsquo;Neill on 9th July 2013. This strategy, developed jointly between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Northern Ireland (DARD) establishes an all island framework for the policy of identification, control and eradication of the causal agents of ash dieback.   </p>  <p>  Surveys have been conducted by the Department year on year since the first occurrence of the disease in Ireland was confirmed. Similar surveys are undertaken by authorities in Northern Ireland. The systematic and targeted plant health surveys in relation to the disease undertaken by the Department over this summer (2015) and the associated laboratory tests were completed in October. The results were collated earlier in November and show there has been a significant increase in confirmed findings in forest plantations, an increase in confirmed findings in hedgerows and roadside plantings, as well as an expansion in its known geographic distribution.   </p>  <p>  There are now confirmed findings of the disease in some 110 forest plantations distributed over 18 counties, findings of the disease have been made in native hedgerows in 13 counties, and findings of the disease have been made in roadside plantings in 11 counties. </p>  <p>  Further to the results of the summer surveys north and south, within the framework of the All-Ireland Chalara Control Strategy of July 2013, a comprehensive review is now being undertaken by the Department and DARD of policy options in relation to the disease. </p></reply>

This contribution to the German led Battlegroup is the Defence Forces major contribution to the EU Rapid Response under the Common Security and Defence Policy.  Most of the preparations will take place in Custume Barracks Athlone, with the Battlegroup Certification Exercise taking place in Germany in April 2016.

Member States offered strong messages of solidarity and support.  I extended my condolences to the French Minister and the French people and pledged Ireland's support for France at this difficult time. </p>  <p>  The High Representative, Fredericka Mogherini, clearly outlined that Article 42.7 of the treaty does not give rise to any coordinated EU action or CSDP operation and that EU institutions have no function in the matter. The HRVP noted that it is an issue for France and the Member States acting on a bilateral basis.  The meeting was advised that France will engage in bilateral discussions with other member States with a view to seeking support for all aspects of its response to the threat from the &ldquo;Daesh&rdquo; and in response to the atrocity committed in Paris. </p>  <p>  The meeting of Defence Ministers then continued with an introduction by Commissioner Bieńkowska of the Commission&rsquo;s European Defence Action Plan, the main objective of which is to bring together the core elements of the Commission&rsquo;s policy on the internal market, industrial policy and research. Member States were supportive of this work in conjunction with the European Defence Agency (EDA) in the area of defence.   </p>  <p>  Discussion then moved to Capacity Building in Support of Security and Development (CBSD) and the challenges inherent in same. The discussion took place on the basis of a draft implementation plan prepared by the European External Action Service (EEAS) and Commission services.  HRVP Mogherini noted that funding remains a particular concern, calling on Defence Ministers to push for national coherence with their respective Development Ministers on the funding issue and having regard to the clear link between security and development.  In addressing the meeting, I welcomed the initiative. I suggested that pilot projects in this area could provide a useful tool to prove the underlying theory behind CBSD to the Development Community.  Recognition of the link between peace-keeping, development aid and NGO activities was also needed in terms of feeding into Development Aid Policy.  Agreeing with the notion that &lsquo;Prevention is better than Intervention&rsquo;, I also suggested that member States should identify short to medium term solutions while the various funding options were being considered and that the establishment of Trust Funds into which MS could contribute might be a worthy interim solution in this regard. </p>  <p>  The NATO Secretary General, Jens Stolenberg, who was invited to attend the item on Capacity Building in Support of Security and Development gave a brief overview of NATO&rsquo;s current activities in the field of &lsquo;Defence Capability Building&rsquo; &ndash; NATO&rsquo;s version of CBSD - citing the initiative as another opportunity to further develop EU/NATO cooperation. </p>  <p>  The last section of this session saw Ministers briefed on the ongoing CSDP military operations which focused on the future development of   Operation Sophia (EUNAVFOR MED) the CSDP Naval operation in the Mediterranean, and the EU Military Assistance Mission in the Central African Republic (EUMAM CAR). It is proposed that the mission in the Central African Republic will transition to a training mission and initial planning will commence. A renewal of UN Security Council Resolutions for Operations Althea and Atalanta was confirmed. </p>  <p>  The final working session of the meeting was in EDA Steering Board format, where Member States agreed   the key taskings and the way ahead. A 2016 budget of &euro;30.5m was approved and a further meeting will be held in December to revise the 3 Year Planning Framework, which had been devised based on an expected increased budget of &euro;33m. </p>  <p>  In the margins of the meeting I met with a number of colleagues to discuss issues of mutual interest. I also had a discussion with the Italian Minister for Defence in relation to our ongoing Naval Service humanitarian search and rescue operation. The Italian minister commented very positively on the work being done by the Naval Service and welcomed Ireland&rsquo;s support for what is a difficult mission and at a difficult time. </p></reply>

The mission has two aims: (1) to reform the chain of command in areas of training, logistics and military policy to ensure compliance with civilian authority and (2) to re-structure and train MAF units. There are 10 members of the Permanent Defence Force deployed to EUTM Mali, of whom 6 are part of a joint UK/Ireland training contingent. </p><p>A UN stabilisation force, Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), is also currently deployed to stabilise the country following the Tuareg rebellion.

French personnel serve on UN-mandated missions in various locations including Mali. The purpose of an Irish deployment, if any, would be to ensure the continued effectiveness of UN peacekeeping missions where France may withdraw forces from these missions so as to address its security requirements. </p><p>The framework, within which the French authorities will request the aid and assistance required, military and otherwise, will be further clarified over the coming days. </p></reply>

A Cross-Departmental Group on Integration was established in March, 2014 with a mandate to review the activities being undertaken by Government Departments and agencies directed to promoting the integration of migrants, preparing a Draft Integration Strategy taking account of the policies and actions already being implemented, and undertaking consultation with key stakeholders.  A public consultation process was subsequently launched as part of the review. Over eighty submissions were received from stakeholders, a large number of whom met with the Cross-Departmental Group on Integration. The Group also held a number of thematic meetings focussing on key policy areas relevant to the integration of migrants, including education, access to public services and social inclusion, and the promotion of intercultural awareness and combatting racism. Work on the development of the updated Integration Strategy is ongoing  and a draft was recently sent to key stakeholders for their observations with a view to the Strategy being published as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Slovakia&rsquo;s reservation, along with the armed services, also includes armed security forces, armed corps, the National Security Office, the Slovak Information Service and the Fire and Rescue Corps.

Many people lost their lives over the course of the troubles and many suffered terrible injuries as a direct result of that paramilitary violence.  Our thoughts are with the victims of violence and their families.</p>  <p>  The devices to which the Deputy refers were viable improvised explosive devices and they were all attributed to loyalist paramilitaries.  They were unjustified and unacceptable attempts to cause death, injury or damage and, or course, to terrorise.  Thankfully no serious injuries resulted from these devices.  However, we should recall that one man, Martin Doherty, lost his life having been shot by those who placed the bomb at Widow Scallan's pub.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that these incidents were the subject of full investigations at the time at which they occurred and that those criminal investigations remain open.</p></reply>

This means, for example, that children born between 2 February 2011 and 30 June 2012 qualified for free pre-school from September 2015. Children who turn 3 from 1 July  2012 are below the age range for eligibility for ECCE in the 2015/2016 programme year but will qualify for the 2016/17 programme year.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2016 it was announced that, from September 2016, children will be eligible to start free pre-school when they turn age 3, and can continue in free pre-school until they start primary school (once the child is not older than 5&frac12; years at the end of the relevant pre-school year i.e. end June).</p>  <p>  This extension of free pre-school will increase the number of children benefitting from free pre-school from about 67,000 per annum, to 127,000 in a given programme year. Accommodating this increase requires a significant increase in capacity in the pre-school sector; pre-school services need time to consider and implement any needed infrastructural or service changes, and to put in place extra staff resources. The September 2016 implementation date was set to allow pre-school providers to put such measures in place.</p>  <p>  It is appreciated that this does mean that a small cohort of children, including those mentioned by the Deputy, while continuing to avail of the 38 week entitlement to free pre-school currently provided under the ECCE programme, will not benefit from additional free pre-school provided under this new budgetary measure. However, should an earlier start date have been chosen, the likelihood is that there would not have been sufficient capacity in the sector to accommodate all children.</p>  <p>  However, you will appreciate that this extended provision, when introduced, will ensure that, from the age of three, all children in Ireland will be able to access free education, either in pre-school or in primary school. This is a significant step forward for children and families.</p></reply>

Under Budget 2016, I lifted these restrictions as part of a major package of strategic investment in affordable, quality and accessible childcare. This package included a further &euro;16m investment in the expansion of the CCS Programme, to include its roll-out to private childcare providers, in a targeted manner.</p>  <p>  CCS expansion will be rolled out in phases. Phase 1, which took effect in October 2015, lifted the expansion restriction within existing CCS services. Phase 2 expanded the CCS Programme to other community/not-for-profit childcare providers not currently under contract to deliver the CCS Programme. Phase 2 was announced on 10th   November 2015 and applications are currently being processed. Phase 3 will come into effect in early 2016 and will make up to a further 8,000 places available in areas identified as being in significant need of CCS provision. Providers of these CCS places will include existing community not-for-profit childcare providers, and for the first time, private childcare providers where gaps in provision exist. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the significant barriers childcare presents to parents wanting to take up employment, education or training, and the complexities of working through the different childcare programmes funded by my Department, the Budget 2016 package also funded the establishment of a dedicated Project Team to develop a single Affordable Childcare Programme to provide working families with good quality childcare at a cost they can afford. Work on the Affordable Childcare Programme will begin immediately, so that it can be in place in 2017. This single programme will replace the existing CCS, along with the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes, comprising the After-School Childcare (ASCC), Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS), and Community Employment Childcare (CEC). It will provide a new simplified subsidy programme, available through both community/not-for-profit and private childcare providers. As more investment is made available over the coming years, it can be directed to families through this subsidised programme. The objective is to make childcare more affordable for more families.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2016 it was announced that, from September 2016, children will be eligible to start free pre-school when they turn age 3, and can continue in free pre-school until they start primary school (once the child is not older than 5&frac12; years at the end of the relevant pre-school year i.e. end June). </p>  <p>  Currently, children are entitled to one year's free pre-school (i.e. 38 weeks during the pre-school year) under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  Until September 2016, it is current eligibility that determines access to free pre-school.  A child who has already benefitted from that entitlement in 2014/2015 will not therefore be eligible to re-register for free pre-school.</p></reply>

In 2016, current funding of &euro;51m will be provided by my Department for these schemes.</p><p>The <i>Value for Money and Policy Review of the Youth Funding programmes 2014 </i>examined three of the targeted funding schemes, the Special Projects for Youth scheme, the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund, and Local Drug Task Force projects scheme. The schemes support the provision of youth services for young people who are at risk of drugs, alcohol misuse, early school leaving, homelessness or who are living in disadvantaged communities.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of a complex area to do with the impact youth service provision has in young people&rsquo;s lives.  Overall, the review found that the youth programmes can provide a significant contribution to improving outcomes for young people and should be considered for on-going public funding. The review makes a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead to ensure an evidence-based and outcomes focussed programme designed to secure the optimal outcomes for young people. </p><p>I intend that the implementation of the recommendations in the review will commence over 2015 and 2016 and in the context of the roll out of the new National Youth Strategy 2015-2020 which my Department published on 8th October, 2015. My Department has initiated a detailed consultation with the youth sector and providers of youth services about the review's findings and recommendations. Consultations have taken place with the national youth organisation, local youth services and youth officers of the Education and Training Boards that administer funding on behalf of my Department, and with other youth interests. A number of regional events were held, an online forum was set up to facilitate discussion with youth service providers and young people were involved in the consultations that took place in the context of the National Youth Strategy.</p><p>The new Youth Employability Initiative which I announced in October, has been designed having regard to the recommendations in the review, in particular, in relation to targeting those young people who are most at risk of unemployment and ensuring that programmes to enhance their employability are outcomes focused. The Initiative, which is being funded by Dormant Accounts, will provide &euro;600,000 in funding to voluntary youth services for programmes for young people who are not in education, training or employment.The learning from the Youth Employability Initiative will inform the development and operational arrangements for the new youth funding programme for disadvantaged young people recommended in the Value for Money and Policy Review.</p><p>My Department is committed to working collaboratively with the youth sector interests in the development and implementation of the new programme over the next two years.</p></reply>

The Committee has an advisory and consultative role to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in matters to do with youth work, including the coordination of youth work programmes and services. In line with these provisions, a new National Youth Work Advisory Committee was appointed by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with a term of office of one year with effect from 28 January 2013. The Committee continued to work with my Department and assisted with the development of the new National Youth Strategy, in particular in identifying in what ways the youth work sector can contribute to shared policy objectives for young people. </p><p>I launched the National Youth Strategy 2015-2020 on 8<sup>th</sup>October, 2015. The strategy sets out Government&rsquo;s aims for young people, aged 10 to 24 years, so that they are active and healthy, achieving their full potential in learning and development, safe and protected from harm, have economic security and opportunity and are connected and contributing to their world.  The implementation structures established by my Department under <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People</i>will oversee the roll out of the National Youth Strategy. There is no doubt that the youth work services have a significant contribution to make to realise the goals of the National Youth Strategy as part of a cross sectoral, whole of society approach to supporting young people in their everyday lives.  For this reason, the key youth sector interests are represented on the structures established by my Department to support the implementation of <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures</i>. At national level representatives of the voluntary youth services have been appointed to the Advisory Council. At local level, youth sector representatives participate in the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees. Key Government departments and agencies that have an interest in children and young people and that had served on the National Youth Work Advisory Committee are represented on the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium and on the Sponsors Group that have been established under <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures</i>to drive the effective implementation of the policy framework.  <i></i></p><p>There have been other significant policy and legislative developments that are relevant to the provision of youth services and the role of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee. These include, the setting up of the North South Education and Training Standards Committee for youth work and the introduction of the Education and Training Boards, Act 2013 which, <i>inter alia,</i>provides for a statutory function for Education and Training Boards in supporting the provision and assessment of youth work services at local level.  At EU level, the Council of Ministers for Youth has adopted an EU Youth Strategy and has taken a number of policy initiatives to promote quality in the provision of youth work services. The National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-making 2015-2020, which I published in June, 2015 is particularly relevant. I am deeply committed to ensuring that young people are involved in the preparation, planning and implementation of policies that impact on their lives. </p><p>My Department works closely with the youth work sector, the Education and Training Boards, other government departments and agencies and consults with young people themselves in the development and delivery of policies and services for children and young people. </p><p>I intend that the role of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee will be considered in the light of these developments and in relation the implementation arrangements in place to achieve our national strategies objectives and to secure the best possible outcomes for young people.</p></reply>

The process involves bringing together young people, youth organisations, youth representatives and policy-makers across the EU to jointly discuss issues affecting young people and feed into youth policy at national and European level. </p>  <p>  The EU Structured Dialogue process with young people is managed on behalf of my Department by the National Youth Council of Ireland. It is overseen by the National Working Group which includes officials from my Department, youth workers, youth researchers and experts from the National Youth Council of Ireland </p>  <p>  Themes for the dialogue with young people are selected for eighteen month cycles. The current Trio Presidency of Italy, Latvia and Luxembourg which will conclude on December 31 2015, selected the theme &ldquo;Youth Empowerment for Political Participation&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that Irish young people made a very positive and purposeful contribution to the European Structured Dialogue process over the last cycle. During this time, over 1000 young people in Ireland were consulted. Focus groups were held across the country and three youth delegates were selected to represent Ireland at each of the EU Youth Conferences held under the three presidencies.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that, at the EU Youth Conference in Luxembourg, held last September, a number of final joint recommendations were agreed upon which sought to empower young people for active participation in the political process across Europe. These included recommendations to strengthen the role of youth work for political empowerment of all young people and recommendations to increase synergies and cooperation between different actors. The recommendations were presented to the EU Council of Ministers for Youth, which I attended on  23 November 2015.</p>  <p>  I am advised that work to advance these recommendations in Ireland will be progressed through a National Implementation Project which will be funded under the EU Erasmus+ programme in 2016.</p>  <p>  The incoming Trio Presidency of the Netherlands, Slovakia and Malta has selected a theme of &ldquo;Ready for life, Ready for the World&rdquo; for the fifth cycle of Structured Dialogue which will begin in January 2016. The theme will focus on essential life skills and competences of young people in a diverse, connected and inclusive Europe for active participation in community and working life. The Structured Dialogue National Working Group has commenced preparations for the consultations with young people in Ireland which will commence in the New Year.</p></reply>

Under the Directive, known as the Cross Border Healthcare Directive (CBD), insured patients are entitled to have costs of cross-border healthcare reimbursed if the healthcare in question is among the benefits to which they are entitled in their Member State of affiliation.  The HSE endeavours to reimburse the cost of treatment incurred or the cost of providing such healthcare in the State, whichever is the lesser, to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of a claim for reimbursement, in line with Prompt Payment legislation.</p>  <p>  Each Member State is free to set its own payment policy for cross-border healthcare; by means of reimbursement to the patient or by direct payment to the healthcare provider.  That policy decision is a discretionary matter for each Member State under the Directive and, similar to the majority of Member States, Ireland has no plan to introduce a policy of direct payment to healthcare providers for healthcare provided in other Member States.</p></reply>

This function is currently being carried out by the HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) which was established in 2005 to oversee the implementation of the then national suicide prevention strategy and to coordinate suicide prevention initiatives around the country.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Government launched &lsquo;Connecting for Life&rsquo;, our new strategy to reduce suicide for the period 2015 &ndash; 2020.  The new Strategy, which has an implementation focus on youth mental health, sets out a vision where fewer lives are lost through suicide, and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and wellbeing.  This includes a greater focus on the important area of support for families and communities in suicide prevention, and will include providing community-based organisations with guidelines, protocols and training on effective suicide prevention.</p><p><i></i>Connecting for Life provides a detailed and clear plan to achieve each of the goals it proposes, with defined actions and a lead agency and key partners in place for each individual objective.  This plan will be supported by robust implementation and governance structures, as well as resourcing and communications frameworks.  The Strategy assigns specific responsibility to the NOSP as a statutory agency to fulfil a number of tasks, including the development and implementation of surveillance systems, the implementation and evaluation of the Strategy, the development and provision of suicide prevention training and education programmes, increasing national awareness about suicide prevention and setting out a national suicide research and prevention programme.  NOSP, together with the Department of Health, other Government Departments, NGO and community partners are proceeding with the implementation of Connecting for Life.</p><p>Funding for suicide prevention has increased significantly in recent years from &euro;3.7 million in 2010 to the current level of &euro;11.55 million, which includes an additional &euro;2.75 million provided this year for additional Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention and for priority actions in Connecting for Life.  I would like to assure the Deputy that dealing with the high levels of suicide and deliberate self harm is a priority for this Government, and this is reflected in the significant investment in suicide prevention and mental health services generally in recent years.</p></reply>

Animal testing of ingredients contained in cosmetic products has been banned since 2009 irrespective of where the testing takes place.  A number of complex tests were given an extended deadline until March 2013.  However, since March 2013 there is a legal requirement to use alternative methods to animal testing as the full marketing ban is actively implemented by Member States.  In Ireland this ban was transposed into Irish legislation by means of the European Union (Cosmetic Products) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No 440 of 2013).  Regulation 19 of these Regulations sets out the penalties which apply to an offence committed under the Regulations.</p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the competent authority for cosmetics in Ireland and is responsible for the implementation of the testing and marketing bans on animal testing in this context.</p>  <p>  With regard to testing of animals for scientific purposes, Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes was transposed into Irish law by the European Union (Protection of Animals used for Scientific Purposes) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No 543 of 2012) and came into effect in January 2013.  Regulation 85 of these Regulations sets out the penalties which apply to an offence committed under the Regulations. </p>  <p>  This legislation represents an important step towards achieving the final goal of full replacement of procedures on live animals for scientific and educational purposes as soon as it is scientifically possible to do so.  One of the requirements of the legislation is that studies on animals shall not be carried out when a scientifically satisfactory non-animal method is available.</p>  <p>  The HPRA is the competent authority for the implementation of the legislation on scientific animal protection in Ireland.  The HPRA is satisfied that all establishments in Ireland that hold animals for scientific purposes do so in compliance with the legislation.</p></reply>

The report recommended that the number of critical care beds in the system should increase from 289 to 579 over the period 2010 to 2020.  A HSE the National Clinical Programme for Critical Care was subsequently established and, in 2014, the Programme launched a centralised, &lsquo;hub-and-spoke&rsquo; Model of Care for Adult Critical Care, which was informed by the recommendations of the Prospectus report.</p>  <p>  The Annual National Clinical Programme for Critical Care Capacity Census records adult critical care capacity i.e. the commissioned and actual critical care bed stock and critical care staff provided in critical care services in hospitals, and available to care for critically ill adult patient.  There is now a more co-ordinated approach to the planning and delivery of critical care, within and across hospital groups, with a focus on small hospitals managing routine urgent or planned care locally and more complex critical care managed in the larger hub hospitals where the relevant clinical critical care expertise can be provided.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query regarding the implementation of the report recommendations and the cost of same, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

I offer sincere condolences to the families of those who have been killed and wish those injured a full and speedy recovery.</p>  <p>  I strongly condemn all the acts of terror which have been perpetrated in Mali this year, including the attack on a restaurant in Bamako in March, in which five people were killed; the attack on UN peacekeepers in April in which three people died; and the attack on a hotel in S&eacute;var&eacute; in August, in which up to twelve people lost their lives.</p>  <p>  Such senseless acts of violence undermine the significant progress which has been made in Mali through the signature earlier this year of the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation.</p>  <p>  With our partners in the EU, Ireland has welcomed the signature of this Agreement, which we believe will allow all communities in Mali to unite in fighting terrorism and to live together in peace and security. Provided that all parties stand by their commitments, the Agreement represents the best possible compromise by which a lasting peace in Mali can be secured.</p>  <p>  The UN peace-keeping mission, MINUSMA, is also playing a critical role in consolidating peace, security and stability in the country.</p>  <p>  All the parties involved in the peace process in Mali have an obligation to ensure that full advantage is taken of the window of opportunity which the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation has presented to them.  Above all, the parties must seek to ensure that prospects for the future of Mali are not further darkened by the terror and violence which was witnessed so tragically in Bamako on Friday and which has blighted the country for so long.</p>  <p>  Ireland is currently participating in the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) with 10 members of the Defence Forces.  We have also deployed a Human Rights and Gender Adviser to the Civilian CSDP Mission, EUCAP Sahel Mali.  Since the beginning of last year, we have provided humanitarian funding of over &euro;2 million to the country, and we will continue to monitor developments closely over the coming period.</p></reply>

This issue arises from a disused piggery which presents a water pollution risk and which has been the subject of court proceedings.  While primary responsibility under the Water Pollution Acts rests with the local authority, my Department has participated in the task force established at the behest of Longford District Court in order to consider the possible means by which this pollution risk could ultimately be eliminated. The task force has met on three occasions and has monitored the on-going position while considering options for the containment of the risk and ultimate site resolution opportunities.</p>  <p>  In November 2015, my Department provided funds of &euro;50,000 to Longford County Council to alleviate the immediate risk of pollution to waters. This funding was used to remove some 220,000 gallons of soiled water from the site which alleviated the emergency situation and created additional storage capacity on site.</p>  <p>  While a final engineering solution to this problem is being prepared, a site survey report commissioned by Longford County Council indicates the presence of some hazardous waste at a number of locations around the site and advises that this material should be removed before any further works are carried out. In this context, and in order to ensure that the presence of this hazardous waste material in no way impedes future works which may be required to prevent pollution, my Department has written recently to Longford County Council and has committed funding to support the costs associated with managing this particular aspect of the case.</p></reply>

Following a number of discussions with my Department, the Society of the Motor Industry in Ireland (SIMI) indicated their intention to establish a representative body for producers, as defined under the End-of-Life Vehicle Regulations 2014.  End-of-Life Environmental Services (ELVES) Ltd. has now been established by SIMI and is a representative body for all of the major car producers operating in the country.  This is an essential first step towards the introduction of a compliance scheme approach for the end-of-life vehicle sector.  However, ELVES Ltd. does not, as of yet, have any regulatory role or function under the current regulations.  My Department is currently working on revised regulations to allow for the establishment of a compliance scheme approach within the ELV sector. Under these new regulations, any potential compliance scheme will have to fulfil a number of conditions and will have to operate under an approval issued by my Department. </p>  <p>  My Department has had discussions with ELVES regarding its structure and operational activities . I expect that the revised ELV Regulations will be completed before the end of this year and I will then be in a position to approve ELVES as the compliance scheme for the sector.  Details as to how the scheme will operate in practice and how it will interact with the car recycling sector are in the process of being finalised and discussions are on-going with both the producers and the car recycling sector in this regard.   </p></reply>

My Department does not fund any service directly but provides funding to housing authorities on a regional basis as a contribution towards costs incurred; housing authorities also provide funding from their own resources.  The purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.  Details of the &lsquo;Section 10&rsquo; Exchequer funding provided, for the years 20 11 to 2014 and allocated for 2015, by my Department to housing authorities towards the operational costs of homeless accommodation and related services are set out below.  A significant portion of the funding provided annually by my Department goes towards costs incurred by housing authorities in funding the provision of homeless services by providers, such as Focus Ireland, Simon Communities of Ireland, Peter McVerry Trust, Crosscare, De Paul Trust, Salvation Army, etc.  Service Level Agreements are in place between housing authorities and service providers in respect of homeless services funded under Section 10.  These service providers may also receive other funding from other Government departments and agencies. </p><p><b><i>Section 10 Funding 2011 &ndash; 2015 </i></b><table><tr><th>2011</th><th>&euro;48,123,050 </th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;46,545,963 </td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;45,000,000 </td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;49,205,774 </td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;52,849,125 (allocation) </td></tr></table></p><p>Furthermore, as confirmed in the Budget 2016 announcement, I have secured funding of &euro;70 million for homeless services in 2016, which is an increase of approximately 32% on the 2015 allocation.  In addition, my Department is currently liaising with all the regions with regard to any possible requirement for further Exchequer funding in 2015, on the basis of expenditure actually incurred over and above their allocations, with a view to ensuring that any such funding requirements will be addressed before year-end.</p><p>The Action Plan to Address Homelessness ( December 2014 ) included a commitment to commission an evaluation of the homelessness sector including its structures, service delivery and coordination arrangements.  Accordingly, my Department has commissioned an independent review of homelessness services.  I expect that the draft report will be submitted to my Department before the end of this month. </p></reply>

This function is carried out by a Homeless Unit consisting of six employees - an Assistant Principal, two Higher Executive Officers, two Executive Officers and a Clerical Officer; two of these employees are on works sharing patterns.  This unit is incorporated into the Homelessness and Housing Inclusion Supports Section, and the Principal Officer heading this Section also devotes the majority of his time to homelessness matters.  In addition, the staff of other Units within the Housing Division, also work on issues in relation to homelessness, as does the Assistant Secretary heading the Housing Division, and the Secretary General.  This reflects the fact that the long-term solution to homelessness rests on increasing the supply of homes.  In November 2014 I launched the Government&rsquo;s Social Housing Strategy 2020: Support, Supply and Reform.  This six-year strategy sets out to provide 35,000 new social housing units at a cost of &euro;3.8 billion and also provides for the delivery up to 75,000 units through local authority housing support schemes.   </p>  <p>  Delivering on the Strategy and addressing homelessness involves a co-ordinated approach across the Department&rsquo;s Housing Division, including other Business Units such as Housing Policy and Finance; Housing Assistance Payment and Current Programmes and Social Housing Capital Investment, and also involving the professional and technical staff who advise on project proposals and building standards and regulations.  My Department also has access to outside expertise and resources, such as the Housing Agency, as required. </p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland is conducting a two stage process for the selection of local development strategies to support the delivery of the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  Stage one of the process is now complete and those successful at stage one have moved to stage two of the process, which is the preparation of local development strategies for their areas.   </p>  <p>  The preparation and submission of local development strategies is underway in each of the 28 designated sub-regional areas.  A minimum period of six months to end-January 2016 has been allowed for the submission of strategies by all Local Action Groups, with the majority expected to submit strategies within that timeframe.  To date, four local development strategies have been received and these are being considered at present. </p>  <p>  Based on progress made to date, I expect that my Department will enter into contracts with a small number of Local Action Groups before year-end or in the first weeks of 2016.

These schemes support electricity generated from a range of renewable sources including small scale hydro. Small scale renewable generation is eligible to apply for support under the REFIT schemes. Further information is available on my Department's website, .</p><p>Analysis of the potential of microgeneration technologies such as small scale wind, solar (including photovoltaic) and small scale hydro, has been carried out by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). The SEAI's findings, along with responses to the consultation on the Green Paper on Energy Policy (May 2014) in Ireland, will inform future policy on the provision of any market support for microgeneration. The findings will also be taken into consideration in the preparation of the Energy White Paper which will be published in 2015. </p><p>On 31 July last the Department launched a consultation on a new support scheme for renewable electricity. While the initial phase of the consultation closed on 18 September 2015, there will be two further opportunities to contribute at key stages in the design of any new scheme. The consultations will be informative regarding the technologies that will assist in meeting our future renewable energy targets. Subject to Government approval and State Aid clearance from the European Commission, the new scheme would become available in 2016. </p><p>Hydro-power developments have the potential for significant impact on the aquatic resource and it is essential that where such schemes are permitted, the fisheries resource is adequately protected, without interference to fish movement, habitat or water quality. The development of hydro generation requires planning permission from the relevant planning authority in accordance with the provisions of the Planning Acts, having due regard to other relevant legal frameworks and guidelines. The principal legislation governing the protection of fish in the development of hydro generation is set out in Part 8, Chapter 5 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959, as amended. Consideration must also be given to the protection of fisheries afforded by the Water Framework Directive, the Habitats Directive and other relevant EU legislation.</p></reply>
