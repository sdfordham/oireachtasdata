The amount a worker is paid will go a long way towards achieving this.  In that regard the Low Pay Commission has been tasked with, on an annual basis, examining and making recommendations on the national minimum wage.  The national minimum hourly rate of pay increased to &euro;9.15 per hour on January 1 this year following Government acceptance of the Low Pay Commission recommendation of July 2015 to increase the rate from &euro;8.65 per hour.</p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s second report on the national minimum wage was submitted to Government yesterday and the recommendation made by the Commission that the national minimum hourly rate be increased by 10 cents to &euro;9.25 will be considered by Government in the context of Budget 2017.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government contains a commitment to develop a new Working Family Payment targeted at low-income families.  I am informed that over the course of the next six months, my colleague the Minister for Social Protection will develop proposals for this new payment.  </p>  <p>  I am also informed that in doing so, the Minister will be guided by two principles.  Firstly, that the payment should ensure that work pays and that no family is better off on welfare than at work, and secondly, and of equal importance, that the payment has a positive effect on child poverty.</p>  <p>  As the deputy will appreciate, changes to the tax system can also have a significant impact on take home pay but these are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

This can be seen in the Agency&rsquo;s record 2015 results, in which a total of 18,983 jobs were created with employment in IDA Ireland client companies rising to over 187,000. The Agency has also made regional development a cornerstone of its five-year strategy and is targeting a minimum increase in investment of 30%-40% in each region outside Dublin. National statistics show progress is being made towards reaching that goal, with 53% of new jobs created last year based outside of Dublin, compared to 49% in 2014. 12 IDA supported companies employed a total of 3,518 jobs in County Tipperary and 95 of these jobs were created last year.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that data on site visits is not an accurate measure of the level of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) activity in a region or county, partly because approximately 70% of all FDI investment won by IDA Ireland comes from its existing client base, rather than new companies. </p>  <p>  There were three IDA Ireland-sponsored visits to Tipperary during 2014, with a further 12 taking place in 2015. There have been four such visits to the county in quarter one this year. Statistics for quarter two should be available within a few weeks. </p></reply>

We are aiming to ensure the unemployment rate is within the 1% of the State average. </p><p>Key sectors targeted as part of the Plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agrifood, manufacturing/engineering and tourism, including active promotion of the tourism potential of the Lakelands Region. </p><p>The plan is being monitored and driven by an Implementation Committees. This committee comprises representatives from the Enterprise Sector, as well as the Local Authorities, Enterprise Agencies and other public bodies in the region. </p><p>The first progress report is currently in preparation. I expect it to be completed and published in the third quarter of 2016.</p><p>The UK remains a market opportunity for Irish business, and I am conscious that a decrease in the value and/or the volume of exports to the UK will affect industry, including SMEs and agrifood sector enterprises. </p><p>The Government has adopted an initial Contingency Framework to map out the key issues that will be most important to Ireland in the coming weeks and months. </p><p>My Department and the enterprise agencies are fully committed to supporting business in this period of heightened uncertainty; however, we do so against the background of a strong economy and a highly competitive enterprise sector.</p></reply>

Regional development is a cornerstone of the Agency&rsquo;s five-year strategy, as is evident from the ambitious target set to increase investment by 30%-40% in each region outside Dublin.</p><p>National statistics in connection with job creation and site visits show that real progress is already being made. Of the record 18,983 new jobs created by IDA Ireland clients in 2015, 53% were based outside of Dublin, compared to 49% in 2014. Similarly, 57% of site visits in 2015 were to locations outside of Dublin, up from 43% in 2014. </p><p>In Clare, Tipperary and Limerick 132 IDA-Supported companies supported 18,966 jobs last year. </p><p>I set out below a breakdown of site visits to Tipperary, Clare and Limerick for the period in question. As the table shows, there was a total of 114 IDA Ireland-sponsored site visits to these three counties. </p><p>With regards to data on site visits for this calendar year, information is only yet available for the first three months. That is because IDA Ireland collates such data on quarterly basis and the information has yet to be compiled in respect of the second quarter. The number of site visits for the second quarter should, however, be available within a matter of weeks. </p><p><b>IDA Ireland-sponsored Site Visits 2014-2015 and 1st Quarter 2016</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>Site Visits Q1 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>22</td><td>40</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>3</td><td>12</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>34</td><td>64</td><td>16</td></tr></table></p></reply>

There are currently no sanctions in place in relation to Saudi Arabia.</p>  <p>  The European Parliament resolution cited by the Deputy called for &ldquo;an initiative aimed at imposing an EU arms embargo against Saudi Arabia&rdquo;.  No arms embargo has been announced or introduced.  If an EU embargo is introduced in relation to Saudi Arabia, my Department will ensure that export licences are issued in compliance with that embargo. </p>  <p>  I understand that there is not a national ban on the export of dual-use and military items from the Netherlands to Saudi Arabia.  Earlier this year the Dutch Parliament passed a motion that the government strictly apply the terms of the EU Common Position on the assessment of military export licences when considering export licence applications involving Saudi Arabia.  They called on the government to deny any licences involving Saudi Arabia where there is a risk that military and dual-use goods can be used for violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. </p>  <p>  All proposed exports of military list and dual-use products to Saudi Arabia, as with all other destinations, are reviewed by my officials on a case-by-case basis with regards to the EU Common Position on the assessment of military export licences.  In addition, applications involving Saudi Arabia are examined by officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade having regard to any foreign policy concerns that may arise. </p></reply>

In effect, employment rights legislation does not apply to independent sub-contractors with the exception of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 and the Equality Act, 1998. </p><p>Ireland has a well-resourced and proactive labour inspectorate, which now forms part of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and there are already existing mechanisms in place to tackle this issue.  Inspections are undertaken on the basis of risk analysis which identifies certain sectors, as a result of complaints received and on a routine basis. Where the WRC inspection service receive complaints in relation to bogus self-employment or bogus sub-contracting, they are forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners and/or the Department of Social Protection (Scope Section) for investigation either solely by the recipient, or jointly with the Workplace Relations Commission. </p><p>In most cases it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed. Where there is doubt in relation to the employment status of an individual the relevant Departments and Agencies will have regard to the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals. This Code was drawn up and agreed in 2007 by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Department of Social and Family Affairs, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers Federation.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Finance and Department of Social Protection have conducted a joint public consultation on the Use of Intermediary-Type Structures and Self-Employment Arrangements.  </p><p>Clearly there is a convergence of interests between my Department and the Departments of Finance and Social Protection in addressing this issue.  Apart from the significant losses to the Exchequer arising from cases of so called bogus self-employment, the practice has serious implications from an employment rights perspective.  In this respect it is important that individuals are correctly designated as regards employment status, so that those who ought to be designated as employees are not deprived of employment rights.

As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has lead responsibility for promoting the development of a vibrant, competitive and progressively regulated aviation sector.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery is available to assist in the resolution of this dispute.  I would urge both parties to engage fully in negotiations at local level and with the State's industrial relations machinery  in order to resolve their differences in this instance.  Even what often appears to be an intractable dispute is capable of resolution where both sides engage constructively and in good faith in this voluntary process.  The principle of good faith implies that both sides in a dispute make every effort to reach an agreement and endeavour, through genuine and constructive negotiations, to arrive at a conclusion that is satisfactory to all concerned. </p></reply>

An agreement would be the world&rsquo;s largest bilateral trade and investment deal, and a successful conclusion is expected to benefit Ireland more than any other EU Member State.  Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises are particularly well placed to take up opportunities to trade more easily with the US.  Studies have shown that the benefits to Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole.  Ireland strongly supports these negotiations and is working to ensure that our interests are fully reflected in the texts of the negotiations.</p>  <p>  Regulatory cooperation is about cutting the costs for EU and US companies of complying with each other's rules and regulations, for example where there is unnecessary duplication. For example in the case of the EU Canada Agreement  both sides have agreed to recognise each other&rsquo;s conformity assessment certificates for electrical goods, electronic and radio equipment, toys and machinery.  This will not lead to any lowering of standards or deregulation on either side of the Atlantic.  The Commission has made it clear that basic laws and principles of the EU, including the precautionary principle enshrined in Article 191 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the EU (TFEU), will not be affected by the negotiations. As you may be aware, the precautionary principle is a risk management measure whereby if there is the possibility that a policy or action might cause harm to the public or the environment, the policy or action in question should not be pursued. Neither the interpretation nor the application of the precautionary principle will be put in question by this or any other trade negotiation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the different negotiating positions can be viewed in the Reading Room in my Department.</p></reply>

It found low working hours can arise in different forms in employment contracts. The UL report made a range of recommendations relating to contracts, hours of work and notice, minimum hours, how contracted hours should be determined, collective agreements, data gathering and wider contextual issues.</p>  <p>  The policy response will be informed by the UL study itself and also the extensive material and practical examples provided by respondents to the public consultation conducted by my Department. In this respect some 48 submissions were received which contained a broad range of views for and against the findings and recommendations made by UL. </p>  <p>  The policy response will address the concerns expressed in the UL study and in the public consultation about the issue of workers on low hour contracts who consistently work more hours each week but whose contracts do not reflect the reality of their hours. The proposals will also seek to ensure that workers are better informed about the nature of their employment arrangements and their core terms and conditions at an early stage in their employment.  Furthermore the proposals will include provisions aimed particularly at low paid, more vulnerable workers. In developing a policy response, my overriding concern is to find balanced and workable solutions to the several issues raised in the UL report.</p></reply>

Whilst numbers are decreasing we still have a body of work to do for regional and rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  The North East/ North West Action Plan for Jobs aims to deliver 28,000 extra jobs to Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Louth, Monaghan, and Cavan by 2020. </p>  <p>  Key targets in service of this goal include a 30 - 40% increase in IDA investments up to 2019; and an increase of 300 to 500 in numbers of Udaras na Gaeltachta supported jobs in the North West.  Sectors targeted include traditionally strong sectors like agrifood, manufacturing/engineering and tourism, as well as future growth areas such as digital payments, cleantech and creative services.</p>  <p>  Key actions to be delivered over 2015-2017 include a new IDA Advanced Building Solution in Sligo; the establishment of a North West Regional Skills Forum to ensure the flow of critical skills to local enterprises; collaboration between the Enterprise Agencies, ETBs and Institutes of Technology to develop a marketing proposition around the Insurance and Technical Services cluster in the North West; and a Regional Innovation Forum for the North East/North West region to support more companies to innovate and engage in R&amp;D.</p>  <p>  In some regions employment growth has been slower than in others.  The Regional Action Plan process is about addressing that imbalance. While 120,000 is still too high, unemployment has fallen in all eight regions in the year to Q1 2016.  In this regard, it is important to record that, in 2015, almost two-thirds of the 21,118 new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland companies were outside Dublin. Also in 2015, of the record 187,056 employed in IDA companies, 59% are employed outside Dublin.</p></reply>

The proposal is available on the EU Commissions website (www.trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/july/tradoc_154800.pdf).</p>  <p>  Encouraging green innovation &amp;amp; trade in green technologies are two key areas of the chapter.  The proposal emphasises the end goal of progressively phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption.  It also promotes the development of cost-effective, clean, safe, secure and sustainable low-emission technologies, energy-efficient solutions, and renewable energy sources; sustainable transport and sustainable urban infrastructure development; addressing deforestation and forest degradation; emissions monitoring; and market and non-market mechanisms.</p>  <p>  The EU Commission tabled the proposal for discussion with the US during last week&rsquo;s negotiating round in Brussels.

It is very important to Ireland as it will build on our already rewarding economic relationship with the US and create new opportunities to stimulate growth, create employment and continue to grow our economy.</p>  <p>  Given our historic economic and cultural ties, Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises are particularly well placed to take up opportunities to trade more easily with the US.  The study estimates that the benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole.  It suggests a boost to GDP of 1.1%, growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5%, and an increase in real wages of 1.5%.  It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs.  The findings are backed up in a recent comprehensive interim independent report contracted by the EU Commission, carried out by Ecorys Consultancy and published on 13 May 2016.  The report estimates that a comprehensive agreement would boost Irish GDP by 1.4%.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the UK decision will not take effect for some time and that the precise implications of the referendum result will now depend on the period of negotiation ahead, involving the UK and our EU partners.</p></reply>

By this measure Ireland has a relatively large proportion of wage earners who would be classified as low paid, ahead of the UK and Portugal.  This is confirmed by recent research from Logue and Callan (ESRI, 2016), which indicates that, for Ireland, while the median wage increased between 2005 and 2013, the proportion of low wage employees was broadly stable for 2005, 2008 and 2010 at 20%, although it increased to 23% in 2013.</p>  <p>  However, under this Eurostat definition, the threshold for low pay is set relative to the level of earnings in an individual country, rather than to the absolute value of the wage itself.  Thus, a person earning &euro;10 per hour in a country where the median wages are &euro;16 per hour would be deemed to be low paid, whereas a person earning &euro;8 per hour in a country where the median wages are &euro;12 per hour would not be deemed to be low paid.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s mean hourly earnings are, in fact, the second highest in the EU after Denmark (Eurostat, 2014).  In fact, the mean hourly earnings in 12 of the 21 EU countries for which Eurostat provides data are below, and in many cases significantly below, the low pay benchmark for Ireland.  In practical terms, for example, an employee in Ireland, where the median earnings are &euro;16.43 per hour (see LPC Report 2016, based on EU SILC data for 2014 &ndash; latest available) who earns &euro;10.90 per hour (or &euro;22,100 per year) would be deemed to be low-paid, whereas an employee in a country with median earnings of &euro;12 per hour who earns only &euro;8.10 per hour (or &euro;16,400 per year) would not be considered to be low-paid.</p>  <p>  The authors of the ESRI paper point out, also, that Irish wage rates are among the highest in the EU on a purchasing power parity basis (Eurostat, 2015).  This would appear to be in contradiction with what the Unite report says on this issue.</p></reply>

This included the Duffy/Cahill expert examination of legal protections for workers. The Duffy/Cahill report provides a comprehensive analysis of the relevant provisions of employment law and company law. It makes a number of proposals for reform of the law, which are primarily concerned with amendments to employment law. My Department conducted a Public Consultation on the report following its publication on 26 April. The submissions received in response to the consultation are important in terms of assessing how the suggested reforms could operate in practice and in identifying any unintended consequences. They will inform the response to the report which will be brought forward for consideration by Government. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Company Law Review Group was asked to review company law. This was with a view to recommending ways company law could be potentially amended to ensure better safeguards for employees and unsecured creditors. The work of the Company Law Review Group is progressing in this regard. </p>  <p>  Separately, authorised officers have sought information from a number of parties in relation to the collective redundancies that took place in OCS Operations Limited on 12 June 2015.

Prosecutions, if appropriate, remain an option under the Act. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that one of the parties from whom the authorised officers sought information initiated proceedings in the High Court challenging the powers of the authorised officers. The hearing of submissions in the case concluded last week and judgement was reserved to a future, unspecified date.

At an individual level the resources required to achieve a minimum essential standard of living is very dependent on family circumstances and thus the interaction of individual earnings with household income and State-provided supports such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement as well as supports available in relation to housing, education and health all contribute to an individual&rsquo;s standard of living.</p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated. The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement. It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. </p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission was established last year and its primary function is to, on an annual basis, examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels. The Commission presented its first report in July 2015 in which it recommended an increase of 50 cents per hour to the minimum hourly rate bringing it to &euro;9.15. That increase, which was accepted by Government, came into effect on 1st January last. </p>  <p>  The Commission presented its second report before the statutory deadline of 19th July 2016, which, in line with the practice established last year, is provided to Government and published immediately thereafter.</p></reply>

A summary of the key actions that will be taken to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision has been published.</p><p>As outlined previously, my own Department has been, and will continue to be, fully engaged in the risk analysis and contingency planning work that is being undertaken at cross-Government level, led by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p><p>Since the announcement of the UK referendum result on 24 June, as part of my contingency plans, I have established a Coordination Group within my Department consisting of relevant enterprise, single market, and trade officials, together with the Chief Executive Officers of IDA and Enterprise Ireland, to oversee the management of our immediate response, including the messaging to businesses both at home and overseas. I chair this Group, and I will continue to do so as part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing response as developments unfold at EU level and bilaterally with the UK.</p><p>Also on that day, I met with representative business organisations, including IBEC, ISME, the SFA, and the Irish Exporters Association, to provide an update on immediate responses to reassure business in the aftermath of the result. </p><p>Since then, I have had meetings with a range of other representative organisations, including American Chamber of Commerce Ireland (AmCham), Dublin Chamber of Commerce, and the Irish Farmers Association.</p><p>I have also written to my newly-appointed counterparts in the new UK Government &ndash; Liam Fox, the Secretary of State for International Trade, and Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy &ndash; to confirm my intention to work together with them as the upcoming negotiations develop, and to request an early opportunity to discuss our priorities.</p><p>In addition, the enterprise agencies under my remit will continue to deliver on their commitment to supporting business and jobs in this period of heightened uncertainty.</p><p>In this regard, on the day after the referendum result, the CEO of IDA Ireland, wrote to the 1,200 Foreign Direct Investment companies who have operations in this country.  That contact was designed to reassure those companies regarding Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to the EU and on our commitment to FDI.  He reassured those companies that the IDA will work with them to help sustain their existing business in Ireland and to grow additional business opportunities here. </p><p>Engagements by the IDA both with their existing client companies and with new prospective investors, on issues arising as a result of the UK Referendum will, of course, continue on an ongoing basis. Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to our membership of the European Union, which provides for full access to that market for businesses located in this country, and our specific advantages for inward investment, will be highlighted by my Department and by the IDA at every opportunity. </p><p>Earlier this month, Enterprise Ireland reported that its client companies saw an increase of 10% in exports in 2015 amounting to an all-time high of &euro;20.6bn. The export figure is now almost double what it was 10 years ago (&euro;10.73bn in 2005). </p><p>As regards the UK vote to leave the European Union, and the importance of the UK market, EI client exports to the UK increased by 12% last year to reach &euro;7.5bn. Significantly however, in the context of Brexit, UK exports, as a share of total exports, have reduced from 45% to 37% over the period 2005 to 2015 as EI clients have diversified their export base. High Growth Markets (e.g. China, Brazil, etc.) have continued to increase in importance over the past 10 years and now account for 12% of total exports compared to 7% in 2005. </p><p>Despite the continued diversification of the Enterprise Ireland client export base, the UK&rsquo;s vote to leave the EU will present significant new challenges for Irish companies exporting to the UK. In response, Enterprise Ireland has begun its plans to support clients exporting to the UK, including:</p><p>1.<b>Information and Guidance:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland will run an information campaign including: practical guides, online information and webinars, an updated UK market access guide and regional seminars in Ireland and the UK. Further details are available at www.enterprise-ireland.com/brexit.</p><p>2.<b>UK Market Support:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland's UK team will support clients to identify key business opportunities in the short and medium terms. They will also provide advice and support on responding to the implications of Brexit such as improving competitiveness and reducing supply chain costs. </p><p>3.<b>Competitiveness and Market Development Supports:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland will intensify its work with clients, to improve their competitiveness in the market, through its management capability and development programmes. </p><p>4.<b>Market Diversification Support:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland will intensify its strategy of supporting clients to diversify into new markets. As part of this strategy, Enterprise Ireland will intensify its International Trade &amp;amp; Investment events schedule for the rest of 2016 to include trade missions and events to Northern Europe, USA, China, India and other high growth markets.</p><p>5.<b>International Sector Clustering Strategy:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland will expand its focus on promoting Irish sectoral cluster capabilities in key sectors to international buyers in growth markets including Northern Europe, USA and Asia Pacific.</p><p>Regarding specific North South Enterprise development issues, my Department co-funds <i>InterTrade Ireland</i>the Cross Border body which operates a range of programmes to develop businesses on a cross border basis..

The aim of the 8 Plans is to strengthen and develop regional collaboration by encouraging state agencies, local authorities, regional bodies, higher education institutions, the private sector and communities to come forward with innovative ideas to boost job creation in their respective regions.</p><p>A key objective of each of the plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the aim of having the unemployment rate of each region within one per cent of the national average.</p><p>In total, 246,000 additional jobs are targeted in the Regional Action Plans for 2015-2020 inclusive. With 45,000 jobs created last year, this leaves 200,000 to be achieved by end 2020, as per the Programme for Government.</p><p>Achieving these ambitious targets at regional level requires a renewed focus on building on regional strengths, assets and areas of competitive advantage to develop the attractive and competitive environments for business to start, grow and succeed on international markets and to attract inward investment. That is what each of the regional Action Plans sets out to deliver. Collaboration between the private and the public sector has been a core element in each plan&rsquo;s development, and will be central to each plan&rsquo;s delivery.</p><p>Supporting the implementation of the Regional Action Plans is a fund of &euro;250 million announced in February 2015  <font color="#2F2F2F"> to be provided over the next five years to Enterprise Ireland and IDA.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  This comprises a &euro;150m Regional Property Programme delivered by IDA and up to &euro;100 million available through three Enterprise Ireland competitive calls. </font>These competitive calls are open to all regions, and are targeted at innovative and collaborative approaches to supporting local job creation. In June this year, I announced an initial allocation of &euro;5million in competitive funding for 48 local and regional initiatives across the country under two competitive regional funding calls administered by Enterprise Ireland; the LEO Competitive Fund and the Community Enterprise Initiative. Further competitive regional funding calls will be rolled out on a phased basis.</p><p>Delivery of each Plan is being overseen by a Regional Implementation Committee, with membership drawn from industry, local authorities, Enterprise Agencies, education sector and other key stakeholders and agencies.  Each of the Regional Implementation Committees has met at least once, with the first meeting of the Dublin APJ Committee due to take place in September.</p><p>The Regional Action Plan process is underpinned by robust reporting arrangements, with twice yearly updates to be published in each region, setting out the progress on each of the actions due for delivery.  The first Progress Reports on the implementation of the Plans, covering the period to end-June 2016 are currently being prepared and will be completed and published in Q3 2016.</p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) were established in April 2014 as the &ldquo;First Stop Shop&rdquo; support service for micro and small businesses in each Local Authority area. Their aim is to promote entrepreneurship, foster business start-ups and develop existing micro and small businesses to drive job creation and to provide accessible high quality supports for their clients&rsquo; business ideas. </p><p>Under the terms of the Service Level Agreement between Enterprise Ireland and each Local Authority, the LEOs are required to produce annual Local Enterprise Development Plans (LEDPs) setting out clearly what the LEO intends to deliver over the following 12 months, including jobs directly related with each investment. The Plans identify and prioritise the key enterprise sectors and entrepreneurial capacity challenges that need to be targeted in each LEO&rsquo;s functional area.</p></reply>

This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.  As the Deputy will appreciate is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for determining the distribution of Garda resources among the Garda Regions, Divisions and Districts.</p>  <p>  The overall response to the problem of drug misuse is set out in the National Drugs Strategy for the period 2009-2016.  The Strategy provides a co-ordinated and comprehensive response to the issue of drug misuse and is very much founded on a partnership approach.</p>  <p>  Tackling the supply of drugs remains a key element of our overall Strategy and, in line with it and the Policing Plan, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to prioritise tackling drugs and organised crime as a core focus of its work.  In this regard multi-disciplinary approaches are utilised to ensure that those involved in illicit drugs activity are effectively targeted including through the use of drugs legislation, the proceeds of crime legislation, money laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>  <p>  In addressing drug trafficking An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has in place a number of strategic partnerships both nationally and internationally including with Revenue's Customs Service, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Irish Naval Service, Europol, Interpol and the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre Narcotics based in Lisbon. </p>  <p>  Substantial Government resources are being provided to support all of this work and in also supporting the considerable work in drug detection being done by Revenue's Customs Services to prevent the importation of drugs into the State.  </p>  <p>  Notable successes continues to be made by our law enforcement authorities in this area including, for example, the work done by the National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau which led to 51 significant seizures of a wide range of controlled drugs with an estimated street value in excess of &euro;24 million being made during 2015 and the related arrests of the persons involved in the trafficking of these substances. </p>  <p>  Finally I can advise the Deputy that the level of resources being provided to address the problem of drug supply is one which is subject to ongoing assessment including through the oversight of our National Drugs Strategy.  In this regard I would point to the 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which, in addition to the recruitment of new trainee Garda&iacute;, also provides additional funding for Garda surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing, all of which will be of assistance to our overall drug law enforcement response.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that as of the 31 May 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 676 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Region West (D.M.R. West) of which there were 88 assigned to Clondalkin, 92 Garda&iacute; assigned to Ronanstown (Rowlagh) and 74 Garda&iacute; assigned to Lucan Garda Stations.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers. Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 851 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 350 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year. So far 534 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide with another 150 more planned to attest in November.  Of the newly attested members, 50 have been assigned to the DMR West Garda Division. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government, "A Programme for a Partnership Government" commits to continuing the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements, the current rate of recruitment will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year.  We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake in coming years.</p>  <p>  In accelerating recruitment it is, of course, essential to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to train larger numbers without any diminution in the quality of its training programme, and to provide appropriate supervision and support to newly qualified Garda&iacute; to ensure that victims, and the public generally, are well served by their policing service. My officials are also engaging with Garda management as a matter of priority in relation to the preparation of a recruitment plan for the next five years that will deliver increased numbers of Garda&iacute; without any compromise on the quality of those recruited or the training programme.</p></reply>

Section 9(10) of the Act provides that the Commissioner is independent in the performance of his functions and decisions with regard to the revaluation of rating authority areas is his sole prerogative and the statute does not accord me, as Minister, any role in this regard. </p>  <p>  The national revaluation programme is the first general valuation of all commercial property in the state since the middle of the 19th century.  It is a very significant undertaking and involves the valuation of some 146,000 properties.  Completing the first revaluation and getting every Local Authority onto the subsequent, recurring 5-10 year cycle of revaluations, provided for in the legislation, will represent a sea-change for the rateable valuation system. </p>  <p>  Significant progress is being made and the programme has established a momentum which is being built upon as the Commissioner has made valuation orders for the revaluation of seven more Local Authority areas which are the County Council areas of Kildare; Leitrim; Longford; Offaly; Roscommon; Sligo and Westmeath.  I wish to inform the Deputy that the work of revaluation is currently well under way in County Kildare as it is in the other six counties and the initial results are expected during the first quarter of 2017.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the terms of the valuation order for the Kildare County Council Rating Authority Area which the Commissioner signed on 23 November 2015, the publication date for the valuation list of all relevant properties in the County following revaluation will be 15 September 2017 and for rating purposes, the effective date for the valuation list will be 31 October 2017.  Initially, and in keeping with the legislation, during the first quarter of 2017, it is expected that proposed valuation certificates will issue to all commercial ratepayers informing them of the proposed valuation of their property and advising them that if they are dissatisfied with the proposed valuation or with any other particular stated in the certificate, they have a right to make representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days.  Any such representations received will be considered and final certificates of valuation will issue informing them that if still dissatisfied with the valuation or with any other detail therein, they have the right to make a subsequent appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, an independent body, established for that purpose.</p></reply>

Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 851 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 350 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year.  So far 534 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide with another 150 more planned to attest in November.</p><p>The Programme for Government, &quot;<font color="#2F2F2F">A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; commits to</font>continuing the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements of around 300 this year, the current rate of recruitment will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year.  We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake in coming years.</p><p>In accelerating recruitment it is, of course, essential to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to train larger numbers without any diminution in the quality of its training programme, and to provide appropriate supervision and support to newly qualified Garda&iacute; to ensure that victims, and the public generally, are well served by their policing service. My officials are also engaging with Garda management as a matter of priority in relation to the preparation of a recruitment plan for the next five years that will deliver increased numbers of Garda&iacute; without any compromise on the quality of those recruited or the training programme.</p></reply>

Multi-disciplinary approaches are also utilised to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted, including through the use of the proceeds of crimes legislation, money-laundering legislation, the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 relating to organised crime and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>  <p>  While we should not underestimate the difficulties which the Garda authorities face in tackling organised crime activity, we continue to see the significant results of their efforts in the arrests made and persons being brought before the Courts, as well as the ongoing drugs and firearms seizures made.</p>  <p>  With regard to the question of membership, I am advised that membership of criminal groups tends to be fluid with groups merging and splitting on an ongoing basis. In addition many modern groupings are transnational in nature. With this in mind, the Deputy will appreciate the difficulty in attributing precise figures to membership at any particular point in time.</p>  <p>  In support of the efforts of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to deliver highly-mobile and responsive Garda patrols in both rural and urban communities.  Since 2012, over &euro;34 million has been invested in renewing the Garda fleet to support front line Garda responses with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015 and a further &euro;46 million is being provided under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  The Government is also investing in airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems.  The increased budget allocation for 2016 will also facilitate additional funding for Garda surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing.</p>  <p>  Having regard to more recent serious organised crime activity, a number of targeted additional measures have been announced in support of the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>I have recently announced a range of measures including legislative proposals to provide additional powers to the Criminal Assets Bureau in targeting the proceeds of crime, an additional allocation of &euro;55 million to be made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year in support of targeted measure and a review of our legislation to see whether there are other changes in the law which might be made to address the reality of groups intent on carrying out a sustained series of killings while endangering the safety of communities.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has also announced the establishment of a new Garda Special Crime Task Force to augment existing responses to organised crime at a local level.  </p>  <p>  In addition, at the request of the Garda Commissioner earlier this year, funding was approved for the establishment of a dedicated Armed Support Unit (ASU) for the Dublin Metropolitan Region in order to enhanced armed support capability in Dublin and to free up the resources of the Emergency Response Unit.</p>  <p>  These measures have been brought forward alongside the proposals announced for accelerated recruitment into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

The success of the Garda measures to tackle burglary being implemented through Operation Thor is borne out by latest CSO crime figures which show a very significant decline in property related crime.  The decrease in burglary for the twelve months ending 31 March 2016 is 18.4% compared to the previous twelve month period.  The figures for the first three months of the year show an even greater decrease with 36.47% less burglaries than in the first three months of 2015.  I have asked the CSO to forward the available statistics in relation to the specific information requested directly to the Deputy<b><font color="#000080">.</font></b></p><p><b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>The recently announced package of additional resources to support Garda operations in 2016 includes provision for the ongoing implementation of Operation Thor.  An additional &euro;50 million is to be provided for this intensive policing and crime prevention activity, including Operation Thor.  So there will be no let-up in the pressure which the Gardai are bringing to bear on the organised gangs engaged in burglary, including the mobile gangs who have targeted rural communities in various parts of the country.  These strong policing measures are backed up by the specific legislation targeting repeat burglars with previous convictions which was enacted in the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015.  I am very pleased that these provisions are now available to Gardai in relation to prosecutions arising from Operation Thor.</p><p>Underpinning all of these measures is the Government&rsquo;s intention to increase Garda numbers to 15,000 by way of recruitment into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While in the short term substantial funds are being provided for overtime working, we are working on measures to accelerate the planned programme of recruitment so that additional new Garda&iacute; are provided as quickly as possible, alongside further civilian and specialist staff recruitment.</p></reply>

People with disabilities are only half as likely to be in employment as others of working age.  The reasons for this are complex, and include level of education and skills, fears around loss of benefits, employer know-how, low expectations, and limited re-entry to work following onset of a disability, as well as a higher incidence of ill-health.</p><p>The Strategy is a cross-government approach that brings together actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.  In tandem with that, it seeks to ensure there will be joined-up services and supports at local level to support individuals on their journey into and in employment.</p><p>The Strategy's six strategic priorities are to:</p><p>- Build skills, capacity and independence;</p><p>- Provide bridges and supports into work;</p><p>- Make work pay;</p><p>- Promote job retention and re-entry to work;</p><p>- Provide coordinated and seamless support;</p><p>- Engage employers.</p><p>The Government has already taken a number of key decisions as recommended in the Strategy including:</p><p>- The public service employment target of people with disabilities will be increased on a phased basis as set out in the Strategy from 3% to 6% over the life time of the Strategy;</p><p>- Special public service competitions for people with disabilities will be arranged and we will open up alternative recruitment channels for people with disabilities;</p><p>- The establishment of a national help line and disability information service launched on 2 January 2016 to provide expert guidance and peer support to employers in relation to the employment of staff with disabilities.</p><p>The key implementation issues relate to coordinating Departmental efforts in this area, rather than to additional funding.  Implementing the Strategy will require continuing interdepartmental cooperation and a joined-up approach to supports and services for jobseekers and workers with disabilities.  There is ongoing collaboration in the delivery of the Strategy between my Department and other Departments.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>Given the complex cross-government nature of the Strategy an oversight implementation group has been established under the independent chairmanship of Fergus Finlay.

Under this section it shall be an offence, where, in the context of prostitution, a person purchases a sexual service from another person.  The person offering sexual services is not liable to any offence under this section.  </p>  <p>  On foot of Government amendments introduced during Committee stage in the Seanad, persons who offer sexual services were removed from the existing solicitation and loitering-related offences under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993.  This was in recognition of the exploitation associated with prostitution and the need to decriminalise the women and men involved in offering sexual services.  People who solicit the sexual services of others &ndash; that is the buyers and pimps &ndash; remain subject to prosecution for the solicitation and loitering offences under the 1993 Act.</p>  <p>  This did, however, give rise to concerns that the Garda&iacute; would be left with no means of combating any public nuisance if sexual services were to be offered, for example, in a residential area.  There was also concern that the provision could be exploited by criminal gangs or others.    </p>  <p>  In order to address these concerns, an amendment was made to section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.  That section addresses a number of behaviours, for instance intoxication in a public place, for which a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can issue a direction to a person so behaving to leave the area.  Failing to comply with that direction can give rise to an offence.  Loitering for the purpose of offering sexual services has now been added to the behaviours covered by section 8.  </p>  <p>  The effect of the proposed amendments will be that on-street prostitution will not be an offence, but the Garda&iacute; will still have the power to move persons offering sexual services on from a public place, when necessary. </p>  <p>  It is currently an offence under section 11 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to keep or manage a brothel.  While I understand that this provision can prevent persons offering sexual services from working together with others, I am particularly concerned that any decriminalisation of brothel-keeping would create a legal loophole ripe for exploitation by the organised crime gangs involved in the trafficking and exploitation of women in prostitution.  Women would come under pressure to claim they were working independently when that is not the case and the Garda&iacute; would be limited in the actions they could take to close brothels and disrupt the activities of criminal gangs.  For this reason I have no plans to amend provisions relating to brothel keeping at this time.</p></reply>

This survey series, currently being conducted by Red C on behalf of my Department, is the most comprehensive survey of SME credit demand in Ireland, covering 1,500 respondents and involving over 6,000 direct telephone calls to SMEs.  SMEs of all sizes and trading in all sectors, excluding property development and speculative activities, are included.  The survey covers demand for credit from both bank and non-bank sources.</p>  <p>  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the most recently published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey covering October 2015 to March 2016, which can be found at www.finance.gov.ie.  The results of this survey shows that, when pending applications are excluded, 89% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved (up 4% from the previous survey).  Working capital requirements were provided as the main reason for applying for bank finance with 39% of respondents stating that they required finance for working capital (down 9%).  When asked about sources of finance for working capital, internal funds/retained earnings were the main finance source of working capital with 67% of working capital coming from this source (up 4%).  The survey also showed continued positive trends in terms of trading performance, profitability and employment.</p>  <p>  My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small and medium sized businesses.  The SME State Bodies Group provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance.</p>  <p>  Some of the main policies introduced to encourage access to credit for small and medium businesses include:</p>  <p>  - The Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014.  On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at www.supportingsmes.ie.</p>  <p>  - The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been established as a means of ensuring that SMEs are provided with sufficient finance for growth.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is an initiative designed to increase the availability of funding to SMEs at a lower cost and on more flexible terms than have recently been available on the Irish Market.  The SBCI does not lend directly to SMEs.  It uses a network of lending partners known as 'on lenders' to make its funds available to SMEs.  More information on the SBCI can be found on www.sbci.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  - The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.</p>  <p>  - The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides support in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions.  Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund (www.microfinanceireland.ie).</p>  <p>  - The Credit Review Office helps SME or farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  They also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank.  The Credit Reviewer and his team have overturned more than 50% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.  Further details are available at www.creditreview.ie.</p>  <p>  - The Government remains committed to the SME sector, as reflected in the recently published Programme for a Partnership Government, and sees it as a key engine of ongoing economic growth.  In this context, the Action Plan for Jobs 2016 includes a dedicated chapter and associated integrated set of actions to support the financing for growth in the SME sector.  My Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate participants in the SME sector to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.  This work will be particularly important in light of the outcome of the UK's referendum on membership of the EU.</p></reply>

This work is supplemented by Revenue's Customs Drug Watch Programme, aimed at encouraging members of the public, coastal and local maritime communities etc. to notify Revenue in confidence of suspect or unusual movements at sea or around the coast through a confidential 24/7 Drugs Watch free phone facility.</p>  <p>  I know that Revenue is active in targeting and combatting drugs smuggling and is fully committed to tackling this criminal activity and those responsible for it.  I am advised by Revenue that it has an enforcement presence at all key airports and ports and at other strategic locations and that it places particular emphasis on developing an intelligence-based focus at both national and regional level, deploying resources to areas of highest risk.  Enforcement strength at particular locations is regularly augmented with additional personnel on a risk-assessment basis, or when particular operations are taking place against illegal activity.</p>  <p>  Revenue works closely with other agencies in the State, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Products Regulatory Authority, in acting against the illegal drugs trade, and plays a key role as well in the implementation of aspects of the National Drugs Strategy relevant to its remit.  The relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to target organised crime groups that are involved in a range of criminal activities, including the illegal drugs trade.  I believe that this work to tackle cross-jurisdictional organised crime is being supported and reinforced by the establishment, in the framework of "A Fresh Start: The Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan", of the Joint Agency Task Force, which includes the Revenue Commissioners.  In addition, Revenue is involved actively in international fora, including the EU's Customs Cooperation Working Party, Europol and the World Customs Organisation, in working together with other administrations, agencies and services to counter the trafficking of drugs and drugs precursors.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue treats action against the trade in illegal drugs as a key priority and that it will continue to be a central element of their work.</p></reply>

In April 2015 the Central Bank wrote to each bank setting out supervisory requirements with regard to mortgage arrears resolution that conform to their published Internal Guidelines on Sustainable Mortgage Arrears Solutions.  </p>  <p>  In relation to homeowners in financial difficulties, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), a statutory code under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989, is designed to provide appropriate and effective consumer protection measures and to ensure that borrowers are treated in a fair and transparent manner.  The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.  Lenders are required to comply with all aspects of the CCMA and non-compliance with the CCMA is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  In June 2015, the Central Bank published the outcome of a themed inspection of lenders' compliance with the CCMA.  As part of this theme seven lenders were inspected under 4 keys area.  The Themed review found that while all of the lenders had implemented frameworks as required by the CCMA, weaknesses of varying degrees were identified across a number of lenders as well as a number of good practices.  Formal supervisory requirements, with specific timelines for remediation, have been imposed on those lenders where risks to borrowers were identified and all lenders that were subject to the CCMA themed inspection have provided responses to the issues raised with them.  The Central Bank of Ireland continues to engage with these lenders as part of their on-going supervisory engagement to ensure compliance with the CCMA. </p>  <p>  The CCMA requires all regulated lenders to wait at least eight months from the date the arrears arose, before legal action can commence against a co-operating borrower.  Separately, regardless of how long it takes the lender to assess a case, and provided that the borrower is co-operating, the lender must give three months' notice to the borrower before they can commence legal proceedings where the lender does not offer an alternative repayment arrangement or the borrower does not accept an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender.  This gives co-operating borrowers time to consider other options such as a Personal Insolvency Arrangement. </p>  <p>  In addition my Department continues to monitor and publishes Mortgage Restructures data on a monthly basis that covers mortgage accounts for the six main lenders.  The figures in the latest publication for May 2016 (published on 14 July) show that Primary Dwelling Home (PDH) mortgage accounts in arrears continue to decline and now stand at 65,458 representing an improvement of 19% compared to May 2015. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I must reiterate that active engagement by indebted borrowers with their lender is key to achieving a sustainable resolution, and I would urge borrowers in arrears, who have not already done so, to take that first step by contacting their lender directly or to contact the Dedicated Mortgage Advisory Service at MABS for an independent assessment of their situation and advice on available resolution options.   </p></reply>

The latest figures from Eurostat estimated that nominal unit labour costs (a widely used measure of competitiveness internationally) in Ireland declined by 4.2 per cent annually in 2015, the largest decline across all EU Member States for which data are available.    </p>  <p>  The decline in unit labour costs in 2015 is a continuation of the trend of substantial improvement in Ireland's economy-wide cost competitiveness since 2008 (the peak year for unit labour costs in Ireland).  It is estimated that nominal unit labour costs in Ireland fell by 20 per cent between 2008 and 2015.  This compares with increases of 9 per cent in the UK, in the euro area and in the European Union as a whole, over the same period.</p>  <p>  Following the crisis, Ireland's relative competitiveness as measured by the real harmonised competitiveness index has continued to improve as a result of reductions in relative prices together with favourable exchange rate movements.  In addition, relatively low consumer price inflation in recent years has contributed to the improvement in Ireland's competitiveness as Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to those of our euro area peers.  For instance, annual HICP inflation in Ireland has been below or equal that of the euro area every year since 2008. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, as a small regional economy in a single currency zone, Ireland is vulnerable to losses of competitiveness.  The UK's vote to leave the European Union has caused some volatility in the currency market.  Challenges for Irish exporters would arise should there be a prolonged period during which the sterling rate was low against the euro. </p>  <p>  The gains in Irish competitiveness achieved since 2008 have been hard-won through productivity improvements and wage and price moderation.  It is important that this competitiveness is preserved and continues to support growth and the improvement in real living standards.  In this regard we must be cognisant that favourable exchange rate movements can reverse, as can be seen for example in the recent strengthening of the euro against sterling. Similarly, gains from the fall in oil prices may unwind in the future.  This highlights the importance of maintaining competitiveness-oriented policies to help address emerging uncertainties.</p></reply>

I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in relation to the charges applied by credit institutions.  Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, as amended, requires that credit institutions, prescribed credit institutions and bureaux de change must make a submission to the Central Bank if they wish to introduce any new customer charges or increase any existing customer charges in respect of certain services.  Section 149 does not cover interest rates rather it applies to fees and commissions only.  The Central Bank may direct the institution not to impose the new or increased charge or it may approve the charge, or approve it at a lower level than requested by the institution.  Once approved, the bank is entitled to impose the charge.  </p><p>My Department published a report on the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges in December 2013.  This contains a detailed description of the process by which the Central Bank makes decisions on whether or not to approve proposed charges.  It is available on my Department's website at <i>www.finance.gov.ie</i>.  Among the key findings of the review was that while fee and commission income has become a more important source of income to the banks in recent years, net fee and commission income in Irish banks was well below the average of their European peers. </p><p>The European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009 (the Payment Services Regulations) include requirements for banks and other payment institutions to provide information to the consumer about charges, interest and exchange rates on the accounts and these are reflected in the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012, which contains requirements in relation to the provision of information on charges to consumers.  The website of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) also lists the various charges imposed by the various financial institutions in Ireland for different types of transactions <i>www.ccpc.ie</i>.</p><p>Irish financial institutions have varying models for charges and have different regimes and conditions under which they are willing to grant transaction free banking.  Individuals' use of their bank account will be specific to each individual and I would again strongly encourage people to look at this comparison site with their specific circumstances in mind in order to decide which institution offers the best product for their pattern of account usage.</p></reply>

Payments to the EU budget are made on a twice-monthly basis over the course of the year and Ireland became a net contributor to the EU budget in 2014.</p>  <p>  On 12 July 2016, the CSO released updated National Income and Expenditure (NIE) Accounts for 2015 which included a very significant upward revision in Ireland's GNI for 2015.  As mentioned above, GNI is an important input into the calculation of Ireland's EU Budget contributions, representing c. 75% of our total contributions. </p>  <p>  We currently estimate the impact of the CSO revision on our EU Budget contribution for 2017 as c. &euro;380 m.  However, other mitigating factors mean the overall increase in the EU budget contribution is now estimated to be in the order of &euro;280 m when compared to the forecast underlying the Summer Economic Statement (SES).</p>  <p>  It must be emphasised that the final impact depends on a number of variables including the size of the overall EU budget for 2017 (which is not due to be agreed until November 2016), GNI movements in other EU Member States and other EU budget operational developments.</p>  <p>  The estimate is also premised on the likely ratification of the Own Resources Decision (ORD) by all Member States this year (it is now ratified by 27 out of 28 Member States).

In the absence of a globally accepted definition and list of fossil fuel companies, a company-by-company analysis of the Fund's entire holdings would be necessary to determine the full exposure.  A preliminary and unaudited value of the Fund's investment in the Oil, Gas and Consumable Fuels industry group, as defined by the leading equity index provided by MSCI Inc, indicates exposure currently of approximately &euro;50 million via both equity and fixed income investments.  This figure has reduced substantially over 2014 and 2015 as global investments are being gradually sold to finance investments in Ireland, as they materialise.  </p><p>These legacy investments in fossil fuel companies should be considered in the context of ISIF's Irish portfolio and its significant commitment to renewables.  The ISIF investment strategy states that the Fund's energy allocation of &euro;800 million will include a significant element of renewables investment, and in that light the Fund is committed to investing in the energy sector is a manner that is consistent with the State's commitment to make the transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and sustainable economy. </p><p>To date the Fund's investment commitments in this regard include:</p><p>- &euro;44 million for the &euro;500 million Dublin Waste to Energy project.</p><p>- &euro;35 million commitment to NTR's onshore wind fund.</p><p>- Investment in the Bluebay SME credit fund which has made loans to Gaelectric and Mainstream, Irish headquartered renewable energy developers.</p><p>- Being a cornerstone investor in the Irish Infrastructure Fund (IIF) which holds a number of Irish onshore wind assets, forestry, and a designer/manufacturer of high power density high efficiency power supplies.</p><p>As part of its on-going commitment to operating to high international standards the ISIF has recently published its Sustainability and Responsible Investment Policy which is available online:<i>  . </i></p><p>The Policy emphasises climate change as part of the integration of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) into its investment decision making.</p><p>As a responsible investor the ISIF monitors the issue of fossil fuel divestment across both its Global and Irish portfolios and is focussed on both Ireland's commitments under COP21 and national decarbonisation and energy security objectives for the Irish economy, which currently remains very highly reliant on imported fossil fuel.</p><p>The National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, which established the ISIF on a statutory basis provides that the ISIF shall review its investment strategy after 18 months of operation and that in reviewing its investment strategy shall consult with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and that the Minister for Finance may consult with other Government Ministers, as appropriate.  This review will be conducted in the second half of 2016 and the issue of Fossil Fuel divestment may be considered as part of this process.

These figures indicate that real GDP grew by some 26 per cent last year.  This is significantly stronger than the previous estimate of 7.8 per cent.</p>  <p>  This substantial upward revision is largely related to the activities of a small number of large multinational firms and reflects a number of exceptional factors which have limited impact on actual activity in the Irish economy. </p>  <p>  The main channels through which these factors affect Irish GDP figures include:</p>  <p>  - The effect of 'contract manufacturing' where Irish headquartered multinationals contract the production of goods to third party companies abroad but these products are recorded in Ireland's trade balance;</p>  <p>  - The relocation of intellectual property-related assets or patents to Ireland.  Ceteris paribus, this will reduce the level of royalty imports and as result increase Irish GDP;</p>  <p>  - An increase in new aircraft imports to Ireland for international leasing activities generating substantial fee income without significant employment effects;</p>  <p>  It is important to note that these factors do not reflect activity levels we are seeing on the ground.  Although these revisions have significantly boosted investment and net export growth, they do not have a direct bearing on employment and wealth creation for Irish citizens. </p>  <p>  It is important to stress that whilst these headline GDP figures have clearly been distorted and are exaggerated in an Irish context, more concrete indicators of the underlying levels of economic activity point to a continuation of a now firmly-rooted recovery.  Specifically, indicators such as consumer spending, tax trends and labour market developments all confirm that Ireland's economic fundamentals remain strong.</p>  <p>  It is also important to stress that the figures published by the CSO are compiled in accordance with best international practice and statistical standards.  They measure what they are supposed to measure.  However, in a small, open and very globalised economy such as Ireland, it is clear that relevance of these figures as a metric by which underlying economic trends and changes in living standards can be assessed is considerably less than elsewhere.</p>  <p>  With this in mind, the Central Statistics Office is to put together a group of experts to provide guidance on how a more relevant indicator could be produced and published alongside these figures in the future.  My Department will be represented on this group.</p>  <p>  The national income and expenditure results are the definitive measure of Irish national output and reflect all available information at the time at which they are published.  However, GDP in all countries, but especially in Ireland, is always subject to revision.</p>  <p>  Irish GDP is volatile by comparative standards due to the small open nature of the Irish economy.  The best way to mitigate risks associated with this volatility is through prudent management of the public finances and competiveness-oriented policies.  That is what the Government will continue to do.</p>  <p>  In light of the exceptional nature of these growth figures I also wish to make clear that the Government will not formulate policy on the basis of these inflated figures.  Rather, policy will continue to be designed on the basis of more normal growth rates in the region of 3&frac12; to 4 per cent per annum over the coming years. </p>  <p>  So, in other words, these upward revisions to GDP for largely technical reasons are not being used to formulate policy.  Similarly, in the event of a downward revision for purely technical reasons, there would be no reason to react from a policy perspective.</p>  <p>  In summary, the figures for last year greatly overstate the "true" level of economic activity here.  The figures measure what they are supposed to measure, but for a small, open and globalised economy, GDP must be interpreted with caution.  However, it is clear that the economy is growing solidly and the Government will form policy on the basis of "normal" growth rates.</p></reply>

The objective was to boost tourism and create additional jobs.  While the VAT rate was due to revert to 13.5% in 2014, it was decided to retain the 9% rate on tourism activity in Budget 2014 because the initiative had proved to be a major success, helping create over 15,000 new jobs at that time, as well as protecting existing jobs.  This decision was informed by statistics on VAT and tourism by the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office, as well as a Report undertaken by my Department entitled "Measuring the impact of the Jobs Initiative: Was the VAT reduction passed on and were jobs created?", published by the Department of Finance in November 2012 with the Department's Medium-Term Fiscal Statement.</p>  <p>  In my last Budget I did not make any changes to the rate, stating that while the case for retaining the measure for the hotel sector in Dublin is diminishing each year, with room rates rising particularly during major events, the case for retention of the measure for the rest of the country remains.  The Government, in the Programme for Partnership Government, has committed to increasing revenue from overseas visitors, growing employment in the tourism sector and increasing the number of visits to Ireland, through the retention of the 9% VAT rate on tourism related services, among other measures, providing that prices remain competitive.</p>  <p>  Various reports on the 9% rate have been undertaken by third parties since its introduced, these have been analysed by my Department, in addition to updated statistics on VAT receipts, tourism related employment levels, hotel occupancy and international and EU comparisons, among other indicators.  </p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners most recent estimated cost to the Exchequer of the reduced 9% VAT rate, since its introduction in 2011 to end 2015 is &euro;2.1 billion.</p></reply>

Rather than the redundancies occurring as a result of adverse globalisation impacts, the reason being cited by the company for these redundancies is a direct consequence of the bringing into force of EU legislation, namely the EU Tobaccos Products Directive 2014/40/EU.  The European Commission has been consulted by the Department and has confirmed that this rationale does not constitute eligible grounds for the making of an EGF application.

It is estimated that only 1 to 1.5% of children in pre-school will require, and therefore be eligible for, this scheme of additional capitation.</p><p>Details of the supports which will be available under AIM can be found at <i>www.preschoolaccess.ie</i>which contains comprehensive information on the access and inclusion model and on how to apply for the new schemes and supports.</p><p>Questions relating to provision of such services in pre-school settings should be addressed my colleague, the Minister for Children &amp;amp; Youth Affairs.</p><p>When children transition to primary school they can access supports, including additional resource and learning support teaching, access to special needs assistance and assistive technology where the needs are indicated in professional reports.  These resources are allocated annually to schools by the National Council for Special Education which provides these resources in line with my Department's policies.</p><p>At present there are no plans to replace this model of support by introducing the AIM model in primary schools and accordingly it is not possible to provide an estimate of the cost of the introduction of this model in primary schools.</p></reply>

This is contributing to what we know is already a considerable strain on some students and their families to participate in higher education with knock-on effects on completion rates.  The reality is that dealing comprehensively with this issue will only take place as part of a more general programme to address the major housing and homelessness issue.</p><p>  Accordingly, my colleague Mr. Simon Coveney T.D., Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, yesterday (19 July 2016) published &quot;Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness&quot;, following Government approval of this comprehensive and ambitious Plan.  The full plan can be accessed at: <i></i>.</p><p>  This Plan provides a multi-stranded, action-oriented approach to achieving many of the Government's key housing objectives, as set down in the Programme for a Partnership Government, to significantly increase the supply of social housing, to double the output of overall housing from the current levels to at least 25,000 per annum by 2020, to service all tenure types, and to tackle homelessness in a comprehensive manner.</p><p>  This whole-of-Government Plan has been developed in close collaboration with other key Government Departments and Agencies, under the oversight of a dedicated Cabinet Committee chaired by An Taoiseach.  The Plan was also informed by the Report of the Special Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness (published on 17 June 2016), as well as through extensive consultation with stakeholders.  </p><p>  My Department has worked closely with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in the development of this Action Plan, with a specific focus on Student Accommodation, and the following measures detailed in the Plan are of direct relevance to this issue:  </p><p>1. The Department of Education and Skills in conjunction with a number of other key stakeholders will prepare and publish a national student accommodation strategy, which will set out a broad framework for delivery of an enhanced level of accommodation and which will inform local authority housing strategies and the land management process in general, in order to provide suitably located and affordable sites.  This will be prepared with a view to developing a national policy on specific needs and mechanisms for the development of appropriate on-campus and off-campus student accommodation.</p><p>2. My Department will work with stakeholders to prioritise and progress viable projects to provide additional student accommodation in key urban areas.  This will be done with a view to bringing onstream proposals capable of delivering an additional 7,000 student accommodation places by end 2019, on or off campus, in addition to projects already committed to.</p><p>3. Dedicated delivery structures, such as Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), will be established in the Higher Education Institutions (HEI) sector to access Housing Finance Agency (HFA) funding and complete any required policy, regulatory or legislative changes necessary.  This will be done with a view to providing additional funding mechanisms for the HEI sector, in conjunction with the HFA.</p><p>4. My Department will help to fund a Student Housing Officer to work with the Union of Students in Ireland, local authorities, AHBs and housing providers to identify and expand short-term capacity enhancing measures in the student accommodation sector.  This will be done with a view to assisting students in finding appropriate accommodation.</p><p>5. Funding mechanisms will be established for Institutes of Technology to support the development of their student accommodation capacity.  This is to facilitate the Institute of Technology sector in developing their potential for on-campus student accommodation through addressing current borrowing capacity and funding constraints.</p><p>6. The Department of Housing Planning and Local Government in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills will carry out an assessment of scope for provision of additional student accommodation on local authority or other publicly-owned lands with a view to maximising the potential for student accommodation provision on suitable sites as part of mixed developments.</p><p>7. The Department of Housing Planning and Local Government will enable student accommodation projects for 100 units or more to go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as well as maximise the opportunities for joint venture projects on local authority sites to proceed through the Part 8 process and prepare guidance on planning policies around student accommodation developments.  This will be done to enhance certainty and reduce delivery timescales and costs associated with bringing student accommodation proposals forward.</p><p>The Actions in the Plan in relation to Student Accommodation build on the report, Student Accommodation: Demand &amp;amp; Supply, which was published last year by the Minister for Education and Skills and which sets out clearly that the demand for student accommodation outstrips supply in certain areas, and will continue to do so in the coming years.</p><p>The full report can be accessed at <i></i>.</p><p>  The previous Minister for Education and Skills introduced two immediate actions following the publication of this report. </p><p>  Firstly, funding was provided by the HEA to the Union of Students (USI) in Ireland to progress short-term solutions for students in need of accommodation.  This funding will allow USI to develop their homes.<i>usi.ie</i>website, to communicate more effectively to student and homeowners, and to carry out research into this important issue.</p><p>  Secondly, the establishment of an inter-departmental steering group to examine the recommendations contained in the HEA Report and to provide a co-ordinating mechanism to ensure that the higher education institutions have access to information on new potential funding and delivery models.  </p><p>  In addition to this, I should point out that a number of our Higher Education Institutions have Student Accommodation projects ongoing, or in the pipeline, with a number of additional on-campus Student Accommodation bed-spaces to come online from September 2016.  Maynooth University has 296 new on-campus bed spaces, and UCD has 350 new on-campus bed spaces, which are due to come onstream in Autumn 2016.  Six other Higher Education Institutions are currently engaged in, or going through the planning phases for student accommodation projects, namely, National University of Ireland Galway, Trinity College Dublin, University of Limerick, Dublin City University, University College Cork and Dublin Institute of Technology.</p><p>  However, an even greater level of provision of student accommodation is required and accordingly this Action Plan commits to the development of a National Student Accommodation Strategy in 2017 by the Department of Education and Skills in conjunction with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and other stakeholders including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance.  This will set out a broad framework for delivery of an enhanced level of accommodation and will inform local authority housing strategies and the land management process in general in order to provide suitably located and affordable sites.</p><p>  I very much welcome the commitments contained in the plan and I look forward to working with colleagues on a cross-Departmental basis to ensure that the commitments contained in the Plan are implemented as soon as practicable.</p></reply>

The Board of Management/ETB determines seniority based on the special needs assistant's date of commencement of duty as an SNA in the school/ETB.</p><p>  In addition, my Department has recently issued a circular regarding the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs (Circular 35/2016 can be accessed via the link <i><i></i></i>)<i>.</i><i></i>The supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs were established on foot of proposals brought forward by the Labour Relations Commission when the Haddington Road Agreement was being agreed.  These supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs continue to operate under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to that agreement. </p><p>  Circular 35/2016 details the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 16/17 school year and also outlines that where a school/ETB has an additional allocation of SNA hours/posts, then that additional allocation of hours/posts must be offered to any existing part-time SNAs in that employment, in order of seniority, before the employer has recourse to recruitment.  This circular builds on the introduction of a supplementary assignment panel process for SNAs which was introduced three years ago, giving SNAs the alternative of redeployment instead of redundancy, giving SNAs greater stability and a better chance of a full-hours contract. </p><p>  The purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school/ETB.  Furthermore, it means that, before an employer opts to recruit a further person as an SNA(s), they must ensure that all existing part-time SNAs in their employment, in order of seniority, have been offered a full-time position in the school or, in the case of ETBs, a full-time position in a school within the ETB scheme. </p><p>  The only exception that can be made to this rule is where a school/ETB has a determination in writing from the NCSE/SENO stating that their allocation must be split amongst a specific number of SNAs and/or stating that the allocation must be implemented in a specific fashion to address the care needs of the pupil(s).  In cases where this exception is being invoked by a school/ETB then this written determination from the NCSE/SENO must be provided to the existing part-time SNA(s) affected.  It should also be noted that the position in relation to the allocation and distribution of Infant days, which is a distinct and specific feature of the SNA scheme, remains unaffected. </p><p>  If an SNA believes that Circular 0035/2016 regarding the allocation of extra hours to current SNAs was not adhered to in their school i.e. they were not furnished with information regarding either a written determination from the NCSE/SENO and/or the invocation of the Infant Days principle then they should contact the dedicated e-mail address (<i>snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie</i>) and my officials will ensure that the relevant information regarding the matter is provided to them by their employer.</p><p>  The Supplementary Assignment Panel arrangements are reviewed by my Department on an annual basis in consultation with the school management bodies and the two unions representing SNA staff (IMPACT and SIPTU).</p><p>  Finally, as already outlined, my Department has set up a dedicated e&ndash;mail address with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e&ndash;mail address: <i>snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie</i></p></reply>

This group was chaired by Mr. Peter Ward SC, who consulted extensively with all the stakeholders and interested parties . The report was published in September 2014 and can be found on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  The report recommended a suite of measures which will lead to more job security for fixed-term and part-time teachers.  It recommended seven changes for implementation from the commencement of the 2015/16 school which my Department implemented. Circulars 23/2015 and 24/2015 detailing the arrangements and procedures for the implementation of the recommendations of the report were published on March 27 2015 and are available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  One of the key features of the new procedures is that the qualification period for the granting of an initial Contract of Indefinite Duration (CID) is reduced from a period of continuous employment in excess of three years with the same employer to a period of continuous employment in excess of two years. </p>  <p>  In their deliberations the expert group considered the issue of the exclusion from qualification for a CID of a teacher who is covering for another teacher absent on an approved scheme of leave of absence.  The report recommended that a teacher covering for another teacher on career break or secondment should not be disqualified from entitlement to a CID on that ground.  However the group having considered the issue of teachers covering for teachers who are job-sharing concluded that these teachers should not be included in this arrangement.</p>  <p>  My Department recently reached an agreement with INTO and TUI which includes the immediate commencement of discussions on implementation of the medium and longer term recommendations made in the Ward Report.  As part of this process, appropriate measures to improve the ability to increase the working hours of part-time teachers will be considered, having regard to the curricular needs of schools and the effects of the measures being implemented in the first phase of the Ward Report recommendations.</p>  <p>  ASTI has issued a directive to their members to withdraw from the Croke Park hours. ASTI's decision to withdraw from these hours means that the union has repudiated the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  In opting to withdraw from the Lansdowne Road Agreement, ASTI members are also opting to forego a series of benefits and protections, as communicated by my Department previously.  These include avoiding an increment freeze, continuation of the alleviation of the FEMPI Act 2013 pay cut for higher earners, the Supervision and Substitution payment of &euro;796 due to be paid on 1 September and protection against compulsory redundancy.  A further significant consequence of withdrawing from the Lansdowne Road Agreement will be the withdrawal of the benefits introduced for new teachers under the Ward Report, which enable them to gain permanent employment and full hours more quickly than before.</p>  <p>  Under Circular 0045/2016 issued by Department, Circular 0024/2015 (which introduced improved CID arrangements for teachers) is withdrawn with immediate effect in respect of teachers not covered by the Lansdowne Road Agreement.</p></reply>

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p>  <p>  My Department's NEPS service records details of the number of individual pupils/students with whom its own staff are directly involved and for whom assessments are provided under the aforementioned SCPA however my Department does not record centrally detail of private assessment undertaken by outside agents.</p></reply>

A review of this pilot has been completed and a report of the review is currently being finalised.  I understand that the review will indicate that the new model has been positively received by schools and parents. </p>  <p>  Under the pilot some 23 additional teaching posts were allocated to school participating in the pilot.  The full year cost of this provision was &euro;1.4m. It should however be noted that participating schools did not access resources through the existing NCSE model. It is not possible to determine whether any of the schools would have additional allocations under that model.  Accordingly the figure of &euro;1.4m should not be regarded as an additional cost to the Department but as an alternative cost.</p>  <p>  Additional costs relating to hiring meeting facilities to accommodate training and information days for participating schools as well as travel and subsistence costs for teachers and principals attending the numerous training and information events amount to approximately &euro;31,000. </p>  <p>  Throughout the pilot my Department gathered information from the participating schools.  This information was gathered using surveys, information and training days, self-reflective questionnaires and a formal review undertaken by my Department's Inspectorate. </p>  <p>  Through these processes, schools indicated that they welcomed the increased flexibility and autonomy provided by the model to allocate resources based on need.  Most schools believe the model allows more scope for team teaching, targeted interventions, mix of in-class and group work, with less focus on withdrawal and one to one teaching.  All schools welcome the move away from the unnecessary labelling of children in order to secure resources. Schools also welcomed that they no longer need to wait for diagnosis and that this facilitates intervention at an earlier stage based on the schools identification of need.</p>  <p>  In addition schools indicated a belief that they were broadly well supported in meeting the needs of children with Special Educational Needs. </p>  <p>  When the full review has been finalised, I will consider its findings and will then consider the next steps for the new model including the timeframe for its introduction. </p></reply>

The focus of both current and future provision is on the development of an inclusive school environment through the whole school planning process, teaching practice, admissions policies, codes of behaviour and whole school evaluation.

At primary level, learning/language support hours are allocated on the basis of mainstream classroom teaching posts in the school.  At post-primary level, learning/language support is allocated on the basis of pupil numbers.  Schools have autonomy to deploy this resource between learning support and language support depending on the specific needs of the school.</p>  <p>  The revised arrangements also provided for additional permanent teaching posts to be given to schools with high concentration of pupils that require language support.  Further additional temporary language support posts are provided on the basis of appeals to the Staffing Appeal Boards.  The appeal criteria are set out in the published staffing arrangements.  My Department does not have comparative figures on the cost of temporary EAL allocations before and after 2012.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a statutory role under the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act to provide me with policy advice in relation to matters concerning the education of persons with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  The NCSE published policy advice in 2013 which identified that the current model for allocating resource teachers to schools is potentially inequitable and recommended the development of a new allocation model.  In developing its policy advice the NCSE consulted widely with education partners, representatives from the school sector, parents, and disability representative bodies.</p>  <p>  The NCSE recommended that a new model be developed based on the profiled needs of each school, including consideration of Standardised Test performances in schools, and a schools social context, rather than primarily on school size and the diagnosed disability of individual children.  It is intended that this new model will reduce the inequities in the current system, and also ensure that we are not unnecessarily labelling children from a young age in order to access resources. </p>  <p>  Although there was widespread support for the implementation of the new model, there was not time to address all of the issues in relation to the proposed new model in time to allow for it to be implemented this year.</p>  <p>  A pilot of the new model, which involved 47 schools finished in June and run for the duration of the 2015/2016 school year.  This pilot was developed in order to test the model in a number of schools and to allow for the practical effect of the application of the new model in pilot schools to be gauged.  It also allowed us to take into account the learning experiences of schools, principals, pupils and the views of parents over the course of the pilot, prior to the full implementation of the proposed new allocation model.  A review of this pilot is underway and is currently being finalised.</p>  <p>  The review will note that the new model has been positively received by schools and parents.</p></reply>

The system uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and information from my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and at post-primary level.  Following the 2015 demographic analyses, 13 new schools will open in 2017 and 2018 to cater for increased demographic needs nationwide.</p><p>A range of areas nationwide are experiencing increased demographic pressure and these are being kept under review by my Department to take account of updated data and the impact of capacity increases in these areas.</p><p>The school planning areas in County Meath are experiencing some demographic growth.

Those SNAs will then be in a position to cater for the care needs of those designated pupils, as the need arises, and as they require assistance, with the level of support being provided reflecting actual need at any given time.</p><p>The provision of a quantum of SNA support to schools gives schools the autonomy and flexibility to manage their allocation in order to utilise this support to the best possible effect. It allows schools to target support to those pupils who have the greatest degree of need at any given time, recognising that the level of need that a child may have may be variable over time. Schools are in a position to use their educational experience and expertise to manage the level of support which has been allocated to them to provide for the care needs of identified children as and when those needs arise.</p><p>The majority of children who have care needs require attention and assistance at certain times of the school day and require intermittent intervention at particular points. There are a relatively small number of children, who for medical or sensory reasons associated with their condition, require full time care support throughout the school day. For such children, access to full day support will be provided for and this will be reflected in the schools' quantum of SNA allocation. </p><p>All schools were asked to submit applications for SNA support for the 2016/17 school year to the NCSE by 29th February this year. The NCSE continues to accept applications in recognition that enrolments may not have been completed or where assessments were not completed. The NCSE will consider these applications and make further allocations to schools in respect of valid applications which have been received to September.</p><p>I recently announced the provision of an additional 860 SNA posts for the coming school year, bringing to 12,900, the total number of  SNAs available for allocation to schools, which is an increase of almost 22% in the number of posts available since 2011, which was 10,575 posts.</p><p>The NCSE advised all schools of their allocations for SNA support for the coming 2016/17 school year, on 14th June, 2016, based on the number of valid applications received to date.</p><p>Details of all of the allocations which have been made to schools for SNA support, on a per county and per school basis, have been published on <i>www.ncse.ie. </i></p><p>It should be noted that SNA support allocated to a school by the NCSE can change from year to year as students who had access to SNA support leave the school, as new students with care needs enrol and as students develop more independent living skills and their care needs diminish over time.</p><p>Where a school wishes to appeal the SNA allocation which has been made to them, they may do so through the NCSE appeal process, details of which are set out at <i>www.ncse.ie.</i>The option to invoke the NCSE appeals process is open to the school/parent in question, but to date no appeal has been received by the NCSE.</p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, while Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available the NCSE website.</p></reply>

Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more pupils, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with the parents, teachers, staff and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a pupil suffers from an illness requiring medication, that appropriate treatment is available.</p>  <p>  The administration of medicines in primary schools is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) and the organisations representing school management at primary level. While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures that must be followed where a teacher or teachers agree to do so.</p>  <p>  The position is that either the parents of the child should make themselves available to administer medication as required or where they wish the staff in the school to administer it they should indemnify the school.</p>  <p>  Where a child requires adult assistance to administer medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of pupil/pupils for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school when appointing an SNA.</p>  <p>  Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner. It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally.</p>  <p>  It is my Department's experience that once the matter has been discussed in detail with the Board of Management and staff of a school, and once all parties are clear as to the procedures to be followed, arrangements can normally be made to administer the type of medicine which may be required.</p></reply>

It was developed as part of the implementation of the recommendations of the Keane Report in 2011 and is one part of a concerted effort across the whole of Government to tackle the mortgage arrears crisis.</p><p>The Scheme targets the most acute arrears cases where a situation is unsustainable and was never contemplated as a solution for the vast majority of arrears cases.  Under this initiative a household with mortgage difficulties moves from being a homeowner to being a social housing tenant.  The householder voluntarily surrenders the property to their lender who, in turn, sells the property to an Approved Housing Body (AHB).  The AHB becomes the landlord and the household remains in the family home.</p><p>The lender is the main point of contact for the borrower and only lenders can put an application forward for the Scheme.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS)can advise borrowers in mortgage distress how to access the Scheme, but it is up to the lender to offer the borrower access to it.  I would urge any borrower who is having difficulty paying their mortgage to contact MABS to better understand the options that are available to them. </p><p>While the MTR scheme is the responsibility of my Department, the Housing Agency co-ordinates the day to day operation of it on my Department &rsquo;s behalf.  Information on the MTR process is available on the Housing Agency website:   .</p><p>I can confirm that if a borrower is involved in bankruptcy proceedings thisdoes not make them ineligible for the MTR Scheme. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, published on 19 July 2016, contains a number of actions that build on recent reforms focused on ensuring that there are a range sustainable long term debt resolution options for borrowers.  Included in the Action Plan is a specific commitment to examine how the MTR scheme can be improved to facilitate more households accessing the Scheme.  This examination will include alternative financing, purchasing and contractual arrangements, as well options to encourage greater flexibility from lending institutions in supporting MTR.</p></reply>

The prescribed application form for such support requires applicants to provide certain information on their current and previous accommodation, including whether they received a notice to quit or an eviction notice in respect of their current accommodation and the reasons for leaving previous accommodation.  My Department does not collate day-to-day information on the number of applications made to each local authority nor the specific contents thereof.</p><p>Statutory Summaries of Social Housing Assessments are carried out at regular intervals and they provide information on the number of households on local authority housing waiting lists.  Only those households which have been assessed as being eligible and in need of such support following the carrying out of the prescribed application process by the relevant housing authority are placed on the list. The most recent summary, carried out as at 7 May 2013, provided details on the number of households categorised as having a housing need due to an unsustainable mortgage.  Details of the 2013 Housing Needs Assessment are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i></i>.</p><p>The 2016 Summary of Housing Assessments is now underway, and future summaries of social housing assessments will be carried out on an annual basis, providing up-to-date and comprehensive data on the numbers of households qualified for social housing support on an on-going basis, including the level of households which have a housing need arising from unsustainable mortgages.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, enacted on 4 December 2015, introduced a number of measures to address rent stability.  The Act provides, inter alia, that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies is increased from 12 to 24 months and this new provision will apply for a 4 year period.  In addition, the Act increased the minimum period of notice of new rent from 28 days to 90 days. Each of these new provisions commenced on enactment.  Further provisions to support rent stability in the 2015 Act include that a notice of new rent must be in the prescribed form, include details of dispute resolution procedures available through the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) and be accompanied by details of the rent sought in respect of 3 comparable dwellings in the area.</p><p>Ultimately, the key to addressing rising rents and preventing homelessness is through increasing the supply of homes.  In publishing Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness on 19 July 2016, the Government has set out a practical and readily implementable set of actions that aim to increase annual housing supply to 25,000 units per annum by 2020, thereby creating a functioning and sustainable housing system.

Some of these acquisitions, as well as some of the approved construction projects, were under the Capital Assistance Scheme whereby approved housing bodiesdeliver social housing for those with specific needs such as elderly people, persons with intellectual or physical disability and homeless persons.</p><p>In 2015, my Department provided over &euro;12.1 million to Kildare County Council for the delivery of new social housing units, under both construction and acquisition programmes and the figure to date in 2016 is in excess of &euro;8.3 million.  In addition to the funding provided by myDepartment, Kildare County Council also contributes significant levels of funding from their own resources for the delivery of units.</p><p>The delivery of new social housing units through a public private partnership (PPP) model is also being pursued.  The PPP programme will have an investment of &euro;300 million to deliver 1,500 social housing units and it is being rolled-out in three bundles.  The first bundle of the PPP sites, to provide over 500 new housing units, was announced in October 2015 and covers six sites, one of which is to deliver some 75 units at Craddockstown, Naas, County Kildare.</p><p>The measures in the new Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness will ramp up delivery of housing from its current under-supply across all tenures and provide for new targets, funding and reforms to achieve the plan&rsquo;s ambitious objectives.

However, since the waste industry began releasing its proposed prices under pay-by-weight last month, the Government relayed its concern to the industry regarding the reported escalation of waste bills for customers of certain companies.</p>  <p>  On foot of this, I actively engaged with representatives of the waste industry to agree a way forward that results in customers paying no more than they are currently paying for waste over the next 12 months.  The approach agreed with the industry is by way of a price freeze to end-June 2017.  The operation of the price freeze by the industry will be closely monitored by Government and, in the event of evidence being presented of the agreement being breached, legislative options will be considered to address the issue. In this regard, my Department has held three meetings with representatives of the waste industry since 1 July   2016 and will continue to liaise with operators as necessary with regard to the consistent implementation of the agreement.</p>  <p>  Legislation has been introduced to remove mandatory pay-by-weight charging for household waste collection.  However, it is still open to a company to charge on a pay-by-weight basis, albeit in the context of the aforementioned price freeze.  Indeed, many companies already have a pay-by-weight element to their charging structure and their customers are quite happy with this approach.  In this regard, it is intended to roll out a comprehensive education and awareness programme on pay by weight so that more householders can make an informed decision around their pricing plan.  However, as I have already indicated, the Government will review the operation of pay-by-weight and make decisions regarding its further roll-out, regulation and oversight by July 2017.</p></reply>

Over the last 5 years, it would appear that planning permissions for apartments are actually increasing rapidly.</p>  <p>  In addition, and more importantly to ensure their consistent application, including in the many local authority areas with no minimum standards, the 2015 Guidelines were drafted in a manner that avails of amendments to the Ministerial powers under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to issue guidelines to planning authorities; the amendments concerned were inserted by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2015. </p>  <p>  The 2015 Act enables statutory guidelines to expressly state &ldquo;Specific Planning Policy Requirements&rdquo; to be applied by planning authorities, or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as appropriate, in the exercise of their planning functions and, where any conflict arises between such guidelines and local authority development plans, the requirements of the guidelines take precedence.</p>  <p>  While not all aspects of the 2015 Apartment Guidelines are mandatory, they identify a number of specific planning policy requirements that must be applied by local authorities.  These include minimum apartment unit floor areas. </p>  <p>  The 2015 Guidelines updated previous 2007 Guidelines, which, in practice, had little if any real effect in terms of actual development, due to the post-2008 economic downturn and after which, despite challenging economic conditions, a number of local authorities set differing and higher minimum floor area standards. </p>  <p>  The confusion of different standards and inconsistencies between local authorities, even within the Dublin Region, and the cost implications of associated lift, access and parking requirements, were considered by my Department to raise wider concerns about adverse impacts on the viability of new housing development generally, and apartment development specifically, both in relation to public and private housing.</p>  <p>  Housing, or more specifically tackling the lack of its provision, is the single biggest issue facing this Government.  The new guidelines provide for a more consistent approach to apartment development, addressing the plethora of ever-escalating minimum floor area requirements and resultant uncertainty which, in the absence of the guidelines, would have adversely impacted not only on supply, but supply at affordable prices.</p></reply>

Under this programme, an initial 22 units at Poppintree, Ballymun, were delivered and fully occupied in May, and another 131 units are expected for completion in the Dublin City Council area by the end of this year.  In addition, 44 units are to be delivered in the Fingal County Council area by the end of this year.  Under the first phase of the Programme, a further 305 units will be provided for this purpose across the four Dublin authorities.</p>  <p>  Building on this, I announced as part of Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness published on 19 July 2016, that the total output of the Rapid Build Housing Programme will be increased to 1,500 units, to assist in achieving our aim of moving the existing group of homeless families out of hotels as soon as possible.  200 units will be delivered by the end of this year (as outlined above), 800 in 2017 and a further 500 in 2018.  Furthermore, if the units are ultimately not required to meet the needs of homeless families, they will be used by local authorities for general social housing allocations. </p>  <p>  In relation to the development at Poppintree, Ballymun, Dublin City Council entered into a contract in November 2015 for the delivery of the 22 rapid-delivery units at a cost of &euro;4.265m excluding VAT.  This is the original tender cost and remains the approved cost, equating to approximately &euro;194,000 per unit.  I understand that the final account between the Council and the provider is pending agreement.  The average cost per unit must be considered in the context of their early delivery,  requiring advanced fast-track construction methods, and the quality of the finished units which have a superior energy efficiency rating.  It can be anticipated that there will be reduced costs associated with further rapid- build schemes as a result of a more competitive procurement environment and the scale of additional provision now proposed.</p></reply>

No. 9 of 2014), which require greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.</p><p>The key impact on costs associated with the implementation of S.I. No. 9 of 2014 lies in the requirement for the appointment of an Assigned Certifier whose role, in conjunction with the builder and the project team, is to draw up and execute an appropriate inspection plan and to certify the building&rsquo;s compliance with Building Regulations on completion.  In effect, the statutory Certificate of Compliance on Completion certifies that a building is compliant with all relevant requirements of the Building Regulations.</p><p>As part of last year&rsquo;s review of the first twelve months of the operation of the regulations, my Department prepared a Sample Preliminary Inspection Plan for a Single Unit Dwelling on a Single Development in order to identify the key stages that would require inspection during the construction of a single unit dwelling on a single development and to estimate the costs associated with such an inspection plan. </p><p>The cost calculations published to accompany the Sample Preliminary Inspection Plan demonstrated that the Assigned Certifier role could be achieved at an approximate cost of &euro;3,800 inclusive of VAT. Where additional design work is required the combined cost of assigned certifier duties and additional design work will be of the order of &euro;6,000 inclusive of VAT.  These costs relate to the implementation of the inspection plan on a single non-complex dwelling.  A copy of this plan and all other documents released as part of that public consultation are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i></i>.</p><p>Ultimately, the fees for professional services are determined by market forces and are outside the scope of my Department&rsquo;s regulatory powers.  Nevertheless, during the public consultation, a number of respondents confirmed that the y were already providing assigned certifier services for between &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000 per dwelling which supports the estimated costings prepared by my Department for single non-complex dwellings.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this transition process, Minister Naughten is already fully engaged in policy development and issues relating to the climate change agenda within the newly expanded remit of his Department.</p>  <p>  In accordance with section 4 of the 2015 Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government must submit a National Mitigation Plan (NMP) to Government for approval by June 2017.  In line with the requirements of section 4(3)(a) of the Act, arrangements are currently being made to activate the formal statutory process required to facilitate the preparation of the first NMP. Notwithstanding this statutory process, work has been underway for some time on developing the NMP, with a draft due to be published for consultation by end 2016. </p>  <p>  The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place a particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that. </p>  <p>  The ultimate objective of successive National Mitigation Plans is to incrementally achieve this low-carbon transition vision by 2050.  In that context, the National Mitigation Plan will have regard to Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the current 2009 Effort Sharing Decision, the Paris Agreement and any likely future EU and international obligations that may arise, including new national targets to be agreed under the EU&rsquo;s 2030 Climate and Energy Package.   </p></reply>

The project was delivered by the Walkinstown Association for People with an Intellectual Disability (WALK). </p>  <p>  The objective of the DACT programme was to explore a variety of routes towards ensuring that people with disabilities were enabled to avail of progression, education and development opportunities within the world of work. Similar to many other projects with EU funding, a key criterion used when selecting projects for the programme was that appropriate learning should be capable of being independently mainstreamed into the future.  Given governance issues and procurement requirements, it was never intended that the funding for these projects would continue in the long-run or that they would become ongoing service delivery organisations in their own right.</p>  <p>  The WALK PEER programme was subsequently successful in obtaining additional funding from the HSE and a private-sector organisation, which allowed the project to continue for another year until July 2016. Following a request for further funding to my Department, it was recognised that there was a need for some short-term support to enable it to continue service provision until the end of the year. </p>  <p>  One of the findings of the evaluation of the DACT projects is that there continues to be gaps in the nature of supports for high dependency individuals that are pre-activation in nature.  My Department is collaborating with other relevant Government Departments, with a view to resolving the situation and providing a coherent approach at national level for this group of people.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, under Action 5.1 of the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities, the National Disability Authority chairs a working group that seeks to develop an effective co-ordinated policy approach to assist individuals with disabilities, including those who require a high level of support, to obtain and retain employment having due regard to the implementation of the HSE&rsquo;s New Directions policy.  To this end, the working group aims to draw up an implementation plan that provides a seamless continuum of support for people with disabilities particularly with regard to the key transition points from school to education and employment. It is envisaged that the work of this group will be completed in the autumn. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Increased maximum rent limits under the rent supplement scheme were recently introduced with effect from Friday last, 1 July 2016.  This measure fulfils the early implementation of the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment to increase rent limits in line with geographic variations in market rents.  </p>  <p>  In recognition of the ongoing difficulties in the rented market, my Department continues to implement a targeted, flexible, case-by-case approach where rents may exceed the maximum limits.  This ensures that people at risk of homelessness through the loss of their tenancy continue to be supported under the rent supplement scheme. Over 8,800 persons at imminent risk of homelessness were supported through increased payments under the rent supplement scheme.</p>  <p>  Financial support is also provided by my Department towards rent deposits under the Exceptional Needs Payments (ENP) scheme.  This form of assistance is very important to those on low incomes who rely on the rented market to meet their housing needs. Up to the end June 2016, some 1,170 ENPs have been made towards rent deposits at a cost of over &euro;730,000.</p>  <p>  Increased stability for rent supplement households will be provided through a combination of increased rent limits, ongoing flexibility, financial supports under the ENP scheme, together with the advocacy supports provided under Threshold&rsquo;s Tenancy Protection Service.  These measures together with the recent reforms to the private rental sector notably that rent reviews can only take place if it has been 2 years or more since the previous review, should provide for increased certainty and security.</p>  <p>  Any person experiencing increased rents or facing the threat of the loss of their tenancy are encouraged to contact the Community Welfare Service responsible for their rent supplement clam.  Threshold&rsquo;s Tenancy Protection Service is also available to people residing in Dublin, Cork, Galway and the commuter areas of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow. </p></reply>

In doing so it is hoped to promote competitiveness and productivity. </p><p>Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment has fallen substantially to just over 15% in June 2016.  This compares with a figure of almost 21% just one year ago, and with a peak level of over 31% in mid-2012.</p><p>Although the labour market situation is improving considerably as the recovery continues, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate the young unemployed back into work.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy (published January 2016) and the Youth Guarantee plan (published January 2014). </p><p>The key objective of Ireland&rsquo;s policy response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement by case officers with young people to assist them to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  Where young people do not find work relatively quickly, additional supports may be offered, both through reserved places on existing employment and training schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  Overall, over 19,100 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2015 (see Table 1 attached to this reply). </p><p>Pathways to Work 2016-2020 continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and further commits to a number of additional measures.  These include increasing the share of workplace-based interventions for youth unemployed; ensuring that monthly engagement, at a minimum, is consistently applied and maintained; restructuring the First Steps programme; and implementing the Defence Forces Skills for Life programme.</p><p>I am confident these measures, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in youth unemployment to add to the substantial improvements that have already been seen over the last few years.</p><p><b>Table 1.

In particular, the role of entrepreneurs and the self-employed will be central to this ambition.  They are a diverse group and include farmers, tradesmen, small business owners, professionals, freelancers and consultants, some work part time, others work every waking hour every day. </p>  <p>  Core to the provision of a more supportive environment for the self-employed is the commitment in the new programme to introduce an improved PRSI scheme for them. In addition, we will also ensure that the Earned Income Tax Credit available to the self-employed will match that available to employees, over a number of budgets.  This process commenced in Budget 2016 with the introduction of a &euro;550 tax credit. </p>  <p>  I want to ensure that appropriate sustainable supports are available to the self-employed in the event of certain contingencies arising.  The self-employed already have access to State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardians payment (contributory), maternity benefit and adoptive benefit on the same basis as employees.  They will also gain access to the new paternity benefit which will be introduced later this year. </p>  <p>  However, unlike the position with employees, they are not covered for certain contingencies such as long-term illnesses or disability.  I have already indicated that extending social insurance coverage to the self-employed is a personal priority for me as Minister.  I intend to extend, over a period of time, the range of benefits which the self&ndash;employed can access through social insurance.  I want to start by providing access to benefits for long-term illness/incapacity and to treatment benefits.  So, a self-employed person injured or incapacitated during the course of their work or on the way to or from it, will have a stronger safety net to protect them. </p>  <p>  The former Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare published a report in 2013 which examined the options for extension of cover to the self-employed.  The Group recommended that the rate of contribution for Class S self-employed should be increased and paid on a compulsory basis in order to pay for cover for long-term illnesses.</p>  <p>  The Group concluded that &ldquo;extension on a voluntary basis, through either an &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; or &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; basis, could lead to the selection of bad risks and would undermine the social solidarity and contributory principles that underline the social insurance system.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  My Department is currently examining the costs and financing an extension of benefits as well as the phasing in of access to the benefits.  This examination includes a survey of a random sample of the self-employed population who rely on Class S social insurance benefits. </p>  <p>   The survey is being carried out by my Department to get their views on priorities for increasing access to social insurance entitlements and the level of contribution the self-employed would be willing to make for more benefits.  </p>  <p>  The result from this survey will help inform and shape the development of future social insurance policy for the self-employed.  Therefore, I encourage any self-employed individuals invited to participate to make every effort to do so. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-20a.592.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000081#WRO03700"><p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, my Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  The ENP scheme is demand led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  The scheme does not provide an arrangement for repayment.  The Government has provided &euro;30.3 million for the ENP scheme in 2016.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should be advised that a personal micro credit scheme providing for small scale loans by Credit Unions to borrowers who have difficulty accessing low cost credit has been piloted in 30 credit unions. The loans under the scheme range from &euro;100 to a maximum of &euro;2,000, and have a maximum interest rate of 12% per annum.  Over 1,200 loans have been drawn down under the scheme to date, with an overall value of over &euro;720,000.  The average individual loan value drawn down is &euro;500.  The focus of the pilot scheme was social welfare recipients who availed of the loans from their Credit Union and were facilitated, with their consent, in the repayment of such loans through the Household Budgeting facility, operated by An Post.  The deductions from their weekly social welfare payments are then transmitted on to the relevant Credit Union. </p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government provides for the roll-out and extension of the personal microcredit scheme.  Following an evaluation of the pilot, the Implementation Group, which is chaired by my Department and comprises all relevant stakeholders, is committed to achieving this aim.  </p>  <p>  Incremental progress is being made towards extending the geographical coverage of the loan scheme through efforts to recruit credit unions to participate in the scheme.  Engagement is continuing with the Credit Union representative bodies and individual credit unions to encourage wider participation. </p>  <p>  While the pilot scheme was targeted towards social welfare recipients with access to the Household Budgeting facility, the scheme has recently been extended to include all social welfare recipients, provided the loan repayments are made by direct debit or standing order.  Efforts are also underway to examine ways the personal micro credit scheme can be made available to low-income individuals and families.  The Implementation Group is working with the relevant stakeholders to find solutions within prudential lending guidelines. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In doing so it is hoped to promote competitiveness and productivity. </p><p>Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment has fallen substantially to just over 15% in June 2016.  This compares with a figure of almost 21% just one year ago, and with a peak level of over 31% in mid-2012.</p><p>The key objective of Ireland&rsquo;s policy response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement by case officers with young people to assist them to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  Where young people do not find work relatively quickly, additional supports may be offered, both through reserved places on existing employment and training schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment.</p><p>Places on most of these programmes are demand led. While it was anticipated that take-up on the relevant programmes in 2014 might be as high as 28,000, actual take-up was 23,000.  As the economy has improved, inflows into these programmes have decreased further, reflecting the drop in youth unemployment.  Overall, over 19,100 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2015 (see details in Table 1 attached to this reply). </p><p>Pathways to Work 2016-2020 continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and further commits to a number of additional measures.  These include increasing the share of workplace-based interventions for youth unemployed; ensuring that monthly engagement, at a minimum, is consistently applied and maintained; restructuring the First Steps programme; and implementing the Defence Forces Skills for Life programme.</p><p><b>Table 1.

We attach great importance to combatting all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.</p><p>In cooperation with our EU partners, we consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council.</p><p>I have repeatedly condemned the horrific crimes by Daesh against religious and ethnic minorities in Syria and Iraq.  Daesh has boasted of its use of murder, torture, mass sexual violence and forced religious conversion in areas under its control and has committed grave crimes against members of all religious denominations in Syria and Iraq.  </p><p>Removing the threat to Christian communities and other religious minorities requires effective action at EU and UN levels to prevent and counter international terrorism, especially the actions of Daesh, in line with international law and human rights.</p><p>International terrorism has featured high on the EU agenda in the past 18 months.  In discussing international terrorism, the Council has given particular priority to countering the actions of Daesh.  Comprehensive conclusions on a &lsquo;<i>Regional Strategy for Syria and Iraq as well as the Daesh threat</i>&rsquo; were adopted by the Council in May 2016.  As has been underlined previously by the Council, there will be no resolution of the conflict in Syria in the absence a political solution. </p><p>In the wake of the horrific attack in Nice, EU Ministers had a further discussion on international terrorism at the Foreign Affairs Council earlier this week.  I noted that while good progress has been achieved through the EU&rsquo;s external action, we must do more and must urgently consider what further action can be taken to improve the effectiveness of our response.</p><p>The EU&rsquo;s approach is guided by and consistent with the approach taken by the UN to countering Daesh.

Obviously it arises particularly in the wake of the outcome of the UK referendum in June.  Of course, I am well aware that, in individual Member States, there are those who would wish to leave the Union.  However, this is not the position of any other Government or Parliament.</p>  <p>  The European Union engages with the big issues of the day, whether they relate to stability, jobs and growth, or to challenges external and internal, such as migration and international terrorism.  It is important to continue to engage with these issues at the EU level if we are serious about addressing them.  They cannot be addressed at national level.</p>  <p>  As the leaders of twenty-seven Member States agreed on 29 June, &ldquo;The EU is a historic achievement of peace, prosperity and security on the European continent and remains our common framework.  At the same time many people express dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs, be it at the European or national level.  Europeans expect us to do better when it comes to providing security, jobs and growth, as well as hope for a better future. We need to deliver on this, in a way that unites us, not least in the interest of the young.</p>  <p>  &ldquo;That is why are starting today a political reflection to give and impulse to further reforms...&rdquo;</p>  <p>  An informal meeting of the 27 Heads of State or Government will take place in Bratislava on 16 September, with a view to a first collective discussion on the renewal of the EU.  </p>  <p>  The Government will participate actively in this process, aiming to put the citizen at the heart of the EU agenda for sustainable investment, competitiveness, growth and jobs.  </p></reply>

This remains the core issue in the conflict - no long-term peace can be achieved without agreement on political change in Syria.</p>  <p>  The cessation of hostilities remains critical to the negotiations.  There can be no prospect of meaningful negotiations if the violence continues.  The reports of Assad regime helicopters barrel bombing opposition held areas underline the urgent need for a comprehensive political solution.  I note the concerns expressed by the opposition that the Assad regime is seeking to undermine the negotiations by its ceaseless campaign of violence against civilians.</p>  <p>  I call on all parties, including all members of the International Syria Support Group, to support the UN&rsquo;s efforts and to commit themselves to work sincerely and with urgency for a nationwide ceasefire, a negotiated peace agreement which will protect the rights of the Syrian people and preserve the pluralistic character, unity and sovereignty of a free and democratic Syria at peace. </p>  <p>  Ireland strongly endorses the efforts of the United Nations to renew peace negotiations based on the 2012 Geneva communique principles and UN Security Council Resolution 2254, in particular the ending of violence, the formation of a transitional governing body with full executive powers and a constitutional reform process which would protect Syria&rsquo;s multi-ethnic and multi-sectarian character.  While recognising the need for a political transition and an end to the Assad regime, I want to make clear that it is the Syrian people&rsquo;s right to decide on Syria&rsquo;s future national leadership.</p>  <p>  I believe that there must also be legal accountability for victims of the Syrian conflict and in 2014 Ireland co-sponsored a resolution called for referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.  I would also note that the UN Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry has reported that the Assad regime is responsible for the majority of crimes against the Syrian people. </p></reply>

Our Embassies and Consulates take every opportunity to promote Irish business abroad, conscious that trade is a key driver of the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s merchandise trade continues to grow.  Last year it reached more than &euro;182 billion, the highest figure ever.  The European Union is our largest trading partner, accounting for about 56% of total trade, of which the UK last year accounted for 26% of exports and 44% of imports; Germany 13% of exports and 14% of imports; and Belgium 24% of exports and 3% of imports.  And trade with the EU is growing.  Last year, the value of total trade (imports and exports) with the EU reached more than &euro;101 billion.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s services exports and imports to EU countries have also grown significantly in recent years.  There was a slight decline in the value of services exports and imports immediately following 2008, but subsequent years have shown growth, particularly in services exports.  Services exports to the EU-27 grew by 13% between 2013 and 2014, exceeding growth in services exports to North America, Africa and Asia. </p>  <p>  Other major trade partners are the United States (23 percent of exports and 12 percent of imports) and China.  Trade with NAFTA countries (US, Canada and Mexico) has been growing strongly over the past decade with the value of imports and exports combined up approximately 61%.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I am determined to lead the Government&rsquo;s efforts to diversify and open up our exports globally.  This is critical to Ireland&rsquo;s economic success, but takes on a renewed importance in light of the UK&lsquo;s decision to leave the EU. </p>  <p>  On 20 July I am chairing a meeting of the Export Trade Council to consider, along with other key Ministers and the State Agencies, how to step up our efforts in this regard.</p></reply>

I outlined to the Foreign Secretary the issues of most concern to Ireland; ensuring stability of the peace process in Northern Ireland, preservation of the Common Travel Area, and the continuation of the very important trading links between our two countries.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Taoiseach and Prime Minister May had a positive discussion on the evening she took office, where the Taoiseach also highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s major priorities.</p>  <p>  I also spoke with the newly appointed Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, at the beginning of this week.  I look forward to meeting him in person in the very near future and to working closely with the Secretary of State to further our shared goal of protecting Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests.</p>  <p>  Both the Taoiseach and I will attend the extraordinary summit meeting of the British Irish Council in Cardiff on Friday 22nd  July.  This meeting will provide another valuable opportunity to meet with our UK colleagues from the British Government and the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, as well as representatives of the Crown Dependencies, and to collectively consider the key challenges arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU and how we best work together in that new context.</p>  <p>  As Ireland will continue as a fully committed member of the European Union, we will also work with our EU partners to ensure the greatest degree of understanding of Ireland&rsquo;s unique position as we, as part of the Union of 27 Member States, negotiate the terms of the UK&rsquo;s exit.  I have had many conversations in recent weeks with various EU colleagues where I sensitised them to the particular concerns of Ireland as the only Member State that shares a land border with the UK.</p>  <p>  In relation to the steps taken to identify the implications of a British exit from the EU, contingency planning was carried out across Government in advance of the referendum, and a summary of the contingency framework was published on 24 June.  This contingency planning is a dynamic and ongoing process which takes into account the most recent developments to allow for more targeted and effective engagement, both in relation to dealing with issues as they evolve and in responding proactively to opportunities that arise.  </p>  <p>  Some restructuring is also underway to develop capacity in key areas &ndash; for example, in the Department of the Taoiseach and in my own Department, including in key Embassies abroad, as well as in other relevant Departments.  In addition, the Taoiseach has announced that he will chair a new Cabinet Committee to oversee matters relating to the UK departure.</p></reply>

A range of factors are taken into account in considering our diplomatic representation overseas, including our national political, economic and trade priorities, as well as the availability of resources.

The CEOs of Concern, Tr&oacute;caire, GOAL, Christian Aid, Tearfund, World Vision, Plan Ireland and Oxfam attended.  Each of these NGOs has received Irish Aid funding for humanitarian work in response to the Syria crisis.</p>  <p>  The focus of the meeting was on the devastating humanitarian impact of the Syria crisis, the migration crisis and the possibilities for the promotion of a long-term political solution.  The NGOs recognised Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to provision of humanitarian assistance to Syrian refugees and host communities in Syria and neighbouring countries, which has been crucial in alleviating suffering. Ireland has pledged &euro;20 million in support for the Syria crisis this year, which will bring our total humanitarian assistance to Syria to &euro;62 million since 2012 by the end of this year.  We are working with our UN, EU, Red Cross and NGO partners to maximise the effectiveness and impact of this funding. </p>  <p>  My Department meets regularly with the Irish NGOs on this and other crises.  The Minister of State for the Diaspora and International Development, Mr. Joe McHugh, T.D., met with the CEOs and colleagues from a number of humanitarian NGOs last week in Dublin to reflect on the World Humanitarian Summit which he attended in May, shortly after his appointment.

The management of public expenditure has played an important role in ensuring that these key fiscal targets have been achieved.</p>  <p>  Managing the delivery of public services within Budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and their Department and measures are in place to help ensure that these budgetary targets continue to be met.  My Department is in regular communication with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters.  The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against the published expenditure profiles.  There is regular reporting to Government on these matters, and information is published monthly, as part of the Exchequer Statement.</p>  <p>  As set out in the end-June 2016 Exchequer returns, total gross voted expenditure for the first half of the year amounted to &euro;26.3.  This was &euro;7 million behind the published profiles based on the Estimates for 2016 published in December 2015.  An additional &euro;500 million was provided to the Department of Health in the June Estimates to deal with spending pressures including in the acute sector and to ensure service levels are maintained in relation to health and social care.  Additional resources of &euro;40 million have also been allocated to the Justice Group of Votes to support an intensified response by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the recent spate of serious crime related violence in Dublin.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy suggests, Public Service Reform was a key element of the Government's response to the crisis and the strategy for recovery.  The reforms implemented over the past five years enabled us to maintain and improve public services in the face of the necessary reduction in staff numbers and budgets, at a time of increased demand for public services.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made since the publication of the first Public Service Reform Plan in 2011.  The current Public Service Reform Plan was published in January 2014 and covers the period 2014-2016.  While maintaining an emphasis on efficiency and reducing costs, this Plan puts a particular focus on improved service delivery and achieving better outcomes.  The first Progress Report on the Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016 was published in March 2015 and can be seen on my Department's website.  The second Annual Progress Report on the Public Service Reform Plan 2014-16 published in April 2016 sets out the significant progress that has been made over the last year in implementing the cross-cutting reform actions set out in the Plan.</p></reply>

This increase reflects certain expenditure pressures in Health, Education and Social Protection arising from demographics, additional expenditure in Agriculture arising from the roll-out of the Rural Development Programme, and the carry-over impact of certain Budget 2016 measures, including the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  An adjustment is also included to take account of expected lower numbers on the Live Register.  Further detail in relation to these amounts for the period 2017 to 2019 is set out in Table 1.7 on Page 8 of the Mid-Year Expenditure Report 2016 published by my Department this month.</p><p>The ex-post forecast in the SES shows an increase in gross voted current expenditure between 2016 and 2021 of &euro;6.78 billion.  The difference between the pre-Budget increase of &euro;2.62 billion and the increase in the ex-post forecast represents the indicative allocation to gross voted current expenditure of fiscal space amounting to a cumulative &euro;4.16 billion over the period 2017 to 2021.  This indicative allocation by year is set out in Table 1.1 on page 2 of the Mid-Year Expenditure Report 2016.<table><tr><th>-</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>2019</th><th>2020</th><th>2021</th></tr><tr><td>Pre-Budget Forecast</td><td>&euro; bn</td><td>&euro; bn</td><td>&euro; bn</td><td>&euro; bn</td><td>&euro; bn</td><td>&euro; bn</td></tr><tr><td>Gross Voted Current Expenditure</td><td>51.87</td><td>52.58</td><td>53.20</td><td>53.60</td><td>54.03</td><td>54.49</td></tr><tr><td>year on year change</td><td></td><td>0.71</td><td>0.62</td><td>0.41</td><td>0.43</td><td>0.46</td></tr><tr><td>Ex Post Forecast</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gross Voted Current Expenditure</td><td>51.87</td><td>53.18</td><td>54.41</td><td>55.76</td><td>57.21</td><td>58.65</td></tr><tr><td>year on year change</td><td></td><td>1.31</td><td>1.23</td><td>1.36</td><td>1.45</td><td>1.44</td></tr></table></p><p>Turning to capital investment, the pre-Budget forecast in the SES includes the increases set out in the Public Capital Plan published in September last year.  Table 1.1 in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report 2016 summarises the indicative allocation by year of the cumulative additional &euro;5.14 billion in capital expenditure included in the ex-post forecast in the SES.</p><p>Tables 1.5 and 1.6 in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report 2016 set out the pre-Budget current and capital expenditure ceilings by Ministerial Vote Group for the period 2017 to 2019.  The costs relating to the Lansdowne Road Agreement are included in a central provision and will be allocated by Department as part of the Budget 2017 Estimates process.  Further detail in relation to expenditure on a Departmental basis is also set out in the Annex to the Report.  Pre-Budget ceilings in respect of current expenditure have not been set on a Departmental basis for periods after 2019.  Consequently, the figures included in the pre-Budget forecast in the SES use the aggregate overall increase of c. &euro;0.4 billion in respect of demographic related costs for 2019, adjusted for a lower amount being available for reallocation within expenditure from Live Register savings in subsequent years.</p></reply>

These organisations vary in scale and complexity, ranging from large acute hospitals to local community based organisations providing social care services.  Funding provided to agencies for the provision of services under Section 38 of the Health Act 2004 relates to 23 non-acute agencies and 16 voluntary acute hospitals currently within the HSE Employment Control Framework. </p><p>Section 38 agencies have played a very important role in the development of our health and social care services.  Some agencies delivering services under Section 38 arrangements are amongst the very best we have in terms of the quality of care provided and the systems of governance employed.  However, there is a requirement for all such agencies to continually review their governance processes in order to ensure these are sufficiently robust.  </p><p>The HSE has a Governance Framework in place which incorporates national standardised documentation, and guidance documents, that enables the HSE to contractually underpin the grant-funding provided to all voluntary and non-statutory Service Providers.  This Framework seeks to ensure the standard and consistent application of good governance principles, which are robust and effective, to ensure that both the HSE and the Providers meet their respective obligations.  It is reviewed and updated as required.</p><p>The HSE established a Compliance Unit in late 2014 to strengthen the system of oversight for Section 38 and 39 Providers.  A key element of this oversight are the Service Arrangements Part 1 &amp;amp; Part 2, which underpin the HSEs relationship with the Service Providers and in this context, a comprehensive review of the SA documentation (Parts 1 and 2) was conducted in 2014/2015 to further strengthen the governance with Providers.  This review involved input from all relevant internal stakeholders and also an extensive engagement took place with representative bodies from the voluntary sector.  This has resulted in a strengthening of oversight arrangements for these agencies.  </p><p>Service Arrangements with agencies under Section 38 and 39 of the Health Act involves the purchase of health and social services from agencies in accordance with strict criteria set out in governance documents and outlined in the National Financial Regulation, <i>NFR- 31 Grants to Outside Agencies </i>and detailed in a comprehensive operational manual.</p><p>I have no plans to amend the Health Act to change the current arrangements.  The HSE will review all Section 38 Providers during the period 2016-2018.  These reviews involve an examination of key governance processes and documents, including obtaining confirmation that there are internal financial controls and that formal financial procedures are in place in these organisations.  Six of these reviews are currently underway.  The outcomes of the reviews will both inform the HSE&rsquo;s relationship with the agency concerned and any further enhancement of the HSE&rsquo;s overall governance framework.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-20a.775.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000085#WRS02600"><p>I would like to reassure the Deputy, on foot of recent reports in the media concerning trauma services, that the work underway in developing a policy on a national trauma policy is about getting the best outcomes for a particular, small category of patients who sustain traumatic injuries.  It is not about closing Emergency Departments or diminishing services.  There are currently no plans to close or remove trauma services from any hospital.  To put this in context, Emergency Departments provide 24/7 access for emergency and urgent presentations across the spectrum of medical and  surgical conditions and major trauma patients represent a very small percentage of total Emergency Department activity.</p>  <p>  A trauma patient needs access to the best service that has the right resources to match their often multiple and critical needs in the shortest time possible.  The aim of developing national policy on trauma networks is to ensure that trauma patients are brought to the right place at the right time for the right care so they can make the best recovery possible.  It is about building on the strengths of pre-hospital care, all of our acute hospitals and post-acute services to provide an optimal configuration of trauma services.  The implementation of Hospital Groups provides an opportunity for hospitals to work together to enhance trauma services for patients.  Each Hospital Group will develop a Strategic Plan to describe how they will provide more efficient and effective patient services and reorganise their services  across the Group to provide optimal care to the populations they serve and future arrangements for trauma management will be informed by  trauma policy . </p>  <p>  The need for a national trauma system has been recognised for many years.  In June 2015 the National Clinical Programme for Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery published the Model of Care for trauma and orthopaedic surgery and strongly recommended that a national approach to trauma services should be taken.  The RCSI (the professional body representing all surgeons and emergency medicine specialists) also called for its establishment at their annual scientific meeting last year.  </p>  <p>  Last year, the then Minister for Health appointed a National Steering Group to develop policy on a major trauma system for Ireland.  This is a joint initiative from the Department of Health and the HSE, developed in recognition that we do not have a coordinated trauma network structure in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Steering Group has been working with the Department of Health, the HSE and all relevant HSE National Clinical Leads, including Surgery, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care, Critical Care, Orthopaedics and Trauma on the development of the policy.  The group has not yet reported, I have  not seen any output from this group and the Group's recommendations are not expected until later this year.</p></reply>

The Act  obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.</p>  <p>  On foot of the Keane Report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  The Director General of the HSE, on accepting an interim recommendation of the Group, made a decision to award medical card eligibility to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer from 1 July 2015, with the card to be held for a period of five years.  The Clinical Advisory Group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions and its final report is due shortly. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware the agreed Programme for a Partnership Government states that the Government will extend medical cards to all children in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA).  The DCA is a monthly payment for a child with a severe disability, aged under 16 years, who requires ongoing care and attention substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age. </p>  <p>  If the HSE is made aware that a person has special needs, whether at application or review stage, assistance will be afforded to help that person complete the application whether at application stage or at review stage.  The local health office can be contacted or LoCall 1890 252 919 to request this assistance.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this increase in demand, the number of patients waiting on trolleys in EDs has decreased; for Q1-2, 2016, we have seen a reduction of just over 7% in numbers of patients waiting on trolleys, in comparison with 2015. </p>  <p>  The increased pressure on our hospital system results in part from demographics; preliminary results from Census 2016 indicate population increases of 3.7% since 2011.  Census 2016 results have not yet available in terms of age profile, however, from 2002 - 2011, the cohort of the population aged over 65 grew by 23% and is projected to rise further.  Adults over 65 years of age (12% of the population) use 53% of hospital in-patient care.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has therefore estimated the rate of increase in demand at approximately 3% per annum; however, recent 2016 hospital attendance reports would indicate that 3% is at the lower end of the scale.  The Minister for Health met with the HSE National Director for Acute Hospitals on Friday, 15th July, regarding the recent rise in numbers of patients on trolleys and proposed measures to address trolley numbers.  It was agreed that the HSE Special Delivery Unit will continue to maintain a strong focus on ensuring that hospitals improve performance in managing ED pressures, as well as on expanding care pathways for frail elderly people who present in EDs.</p>  <p>  Ongoing efforts to address ED overcrowding include the development of more Primary Care Centres and widening the range of services that primary care can offer and expansion of Community Intervention Teams.  Hospital capacity has recently been increased by opening or reopening 374 additional beds and employing more than 750 nurses and almost 80 consultants; reducing delayed discharges from hospitals; and improving how hospitals manage surges in demand for emergency care.  Funding of &euro;40 million has been provided for a Winter Initiative, which will provide for expanded services over the next two winters.  </p>  <p>  General measures to reduce hospital overcrowding include commitments to progress new ED facilities for University Hospital Galway and Beaumont Hospital, Dublin.  These are in addition to capacity expansions already underway in University Hospital Galway and Our Lady Of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, and new ED facilities which have already opened at the Mater Hospital in Dublin, in Wexford General Hospital and St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Kilkenny.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-20a.815.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000086#WRT03100"><p>A key challenge for our health system is ensuring timely access to health services.  There has been a considerable increase in demand for care in our health system in recent years.  100,000 patients have an elective in-patient procedure and 800,000 have a planned day case procedure.  Up to the end of May 2016, there has been an increase of over 19,000 scheduled in-patient / daycase procedures, in comparison to the same period in 2015.</p>  <p>  The key issue for patients is how long they wait.  It is important to note that approximately 60% of patients wait less than 6 months for their required inpatient/daycase procedure and that 91% of patients wait less than the maximum permissible waiting time of 15 months for that procedure.</p>  <p>  I met with the HSE National Director for Acute Hospitals on Friday, 15 July, regarding proposed measures to tackle waiting lists.  I requested that the HSE prepare an action plan, setting out specific measures that the HSE will implement, in conjunction with hospitals, between now and the end of 2016 in order to tackle waiting lists.  I have agreed with the HSE that the action plan should focus on process improvement in how hospitals manage their waiting lists, with a particular focus on validating waiting lists, as well as on actions to reduce waiting times for those patients waiting longest.  The HSE will report to my Department on a regular basis regarding progress on implementing the action plan. </p>  <p>  This Government recognises that a sustained commitment to improving waiting times is required.  Consequently, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to &euro;15m funding to the NTPF to address waiting lists in 2017, as part of the Programme&rsquo;s commitment to a continued investment of &euro;50m per year to reduce waiting lists.  This commitment seeks to utilise the expertise of the NTPF to further assist the HSE in addressing specific waiting list pressures.  The Department of Health has commenced engagement with the NTPF and the HSE to deliver on these waiting list commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p></reply>

People with disabilities are only half as likely to be in employment as others of working age.  The reasons for this are complex, and include level of education and skills, fears around loss of benefits, employer know-how, low expectations, and limited re-entry to work following onset of a disability, as well as a higher incidence of ill-health.</p>  <p>  The Strategy is a cross-government approach that brings together actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.  In tandem with that, it seeks to ensure there will be joined-up services and supports at local level to support individuals on their journey into and in employment.</p>  <p>  Both my Department and the HSE are represented on the Comprehensive Employment Strategy Oversight Group chaired by Fergus Finlay, and are actively progressing the health-related actions found in the Strategy.</p></reply>

The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders.</p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  Currently, 2725 people live in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under '<i>Transforming Lives</i>', the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions.  I welcome the fact that the needs of people moving from congregated settings will be fully taken into account during this process as the model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan.</p><p>In terms of housing, the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government are working in collaboration to support the transition of people with a disability from institutions to social housing in the community under the Government's<i>National Housing Strategy for People with Disability 2011 to 2016.</i></p><p>The HSE's 2016 National Service Plan has set a target of 165 people to move from institutions in 2016 into suitable accommodation.  This is being supported by &euro;20 million in capital funding from the Department of Health in respect of acquiring and renovating properties in priority institutions  identified by the HSE.</p><p>In addition, I am pleased to note that the Department of the Environment is providing &euro;10 million under the Capital Assistance Scheme to provide suitable accommodation for people transitioning from institutions in 2016.  The HSE estimate that a further 100 people could benefit from this initiative. &euro;1 million in ring-fenced leasing funding is also being made available by the Department of the Environment in 2016 to support people moving from institutions into suitable social housing in the community.  This demonstrates the joined up commitment of both Departments to support the de-congregation programme.</p><p>The HSE has developed a three strand approach to accelerate transitions from institutions in the period 2016-2021, with a target of 900 people to move to more suitable accommodation in this period.</p><p>-  Strand 1- is focussed on large institutional settings at high risk of not meeting HIQA Standards; </p><p>-  Strand 2- is focussed on moving people into suitable social housing in the community through the Department of Environment schemes; and </p><p>-  Strand 3- is focussed on remaining service users in congregated settings who could move to suitable accommodation.</p><p>As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on &quot;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion&quot;, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, the Deputy can contact my private office and they will follow the matter up with the HSE.</p></reply>

Supporting infrastructure, procured through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of  multi-disciplinary primary health care. However, while the Government's objective is to deliver a high quality, integrated and cost effective health care service the mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care centres is dependent on a number of factors.  Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care infrastructure is subject to suitable locations being offered / provided / available, to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff.  In addition the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to adequate financing.  Some of these factors are outside the control of the Health Service Executive.  Delivery of primary care infrastructure is a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementation.  The current status of the projects is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th colspan="3">Primary Care Centres</th><th>July 2012 - 35 locations</th><th>PQ 23312/16<br /><br />answer 20/07/2016</th><th>Project Status</th></tr><tr><td>County</td><td>HSE Region</td><td>County</td><td>Location/PCT Name</td><td>Delivery Mechanism</td><td>Q2 2016 -30 June 2016</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Rowlagh/North Clondalkin</td><td>Direct build</td><td>Stage 2a design team report now complete.  HSE finalising purchase agreement of site at Collinstown Park School.

These twin imperatives informed Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the negotiations in 2012 and 2013, and they continue to inform the process by which the various elements of CAP reform are now being delivered. Indeed, the protection of farm incomes and the support of the next generation of farm families are also central elements of the new Programme for a Partnership Government.</p>  <p>  Taking the direct payments system as an example, the Deputy may recall that Ireland proposed an alternative approach to the redistribution of direct payments than that originally advocated by the European Commission, precisely because we wanted to ensure that the direct payments system could be made fairer and more equitable while at the same time ensuring that the level of transfer of payments between farmers was not of a scale that might jeopardise our objectives for the development of the sector.  We now have a system which satisfies these two requirements.  Last year&rsquo;s payments under the Basic Payment and other schemes represented the start of a process that, by 2019, will see a considerable shift in the balance of payments from those previously receiving very high rates per hectare to those previously receiving much lower rates of payment.  I believe that this not only makes the direct payments system fairer, but also ensures that it continues to provide support and income stability that will allow farmers to respond to the demands of the market.  As such, it also provides a vital tool to help us achieve the objectives outlined in the Food Wise 2025 strategy.   </p>  <p>  Significant steps have also been taken to encourage the participation of young farmers in agriculture, which is vital in terms of securing the critical role that farm families play in the development of the sector.  In addition to providing for a top-up of direct payments, young farmers are prioritised in the allocation of payment entitlements from the national reserve.  These direct payments measures are further complemented by supports under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme where, for example, enhanced support for capital investment by young farmers has been made available under the TAMS schemes.</p>  <p>  More generally under Pillar 2 of the CAP, I am focussed on the socio-economic development of our farms and of our rural areas so that all farm families have an opportunity to realise their potential.  Schemes for improving sustainability (such as GLAS and the Beef Data and Genomics Programme) and competitiveness (such as TAMS) are complemented by continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now known as Areas of Natural Constraint).  I believe this combination provides a vital range of supports that will allow farm families to continue to benefit from the CAP in an equitable manner while supporting their development over the coming years.</p></reply>

The total amount paid to date is &euro;1,185m.  Processing of the outstanding cases is continuing with payment runs being carried out on a weekly basis.  In excess of 130,000 applications were received under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2016.  Processing of these applications is currently underway.  Under European Union legislation governing the implementation of the BPS, the earliest date on which advance payments may be made, in respect of fully processed and clear applications, is 16 October of this year.  </p>  <p>Just under 104,000 applications were received under the 2015 Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) and Areas of Specific Constraints (Islands) Scheme, of which 96,280 applications have been paid in excess of &euro;204m to date.  Of those applications outstanding, many are currently not meeting the eligibility requirements and therefore will not become eligible for payment.  Processing of remaining eligible cases is continuing with payment runs being carried out on a weekly basis.  Payments under the 2016 Areas of Natural Constraints and Areas of Specific Constraints (Island) Scheme can only commence once the rigorous set of checks and controls required by EU regulation are completed.  As with previous years, payments for the 2016 scheme are scheduled to begin issuing in the third week of September.</p>  <p>  Approximately 22,000 GLAS 1 applications due an outstanding 2015 payment, which in the majority of cases (20,500) represents the 2015 balancing payment, are currently being processed with a view to having the outstanding amounts issue as soon as possible.  Approximately, 700 outstanding AEOS cases are currently being processed and any payments due will be made in all cases on an ongoing basis as issues are resolved.  In relation to 2016 payments AEOS and GLAS payments are issued on a yearly basis following a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System.  These checks take place in the last quarter of each year, and the 2016 scheme payment will be processed once these checks are finalised.</p>  <p>  Of the almost 25,000 herds that continue to participate in the BDGP full or part payments amounting to &euro;40m have issued to in excess of 22,000 herds in respect of the 2015 scheme year.  Part payments were made where not all of the required data and genotyping samples had been submitted.  Payments continue to be made on an ongoing basis as compliance is verified.  My Department has recently written to those herds who have outstanding data and/or genotyping samples reminding them to submit these by 29 July.  Supplementary payments will be made to those herds who have submitted the additional data and genotyping in the coming weeks.  Payments in respect of the 2016 scheme year will commence in December following the completion of the required administrative checks.</p>  <p>  Payments under the 2015 Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP) have issued to approximately 3,500 applicants.  In order to qualify for payment participants were required to both attend five meetings and satisfactorily complete two tasks.  Processing of appeals cases is reaching completion with a payment run this week for outstanding cases.</p></reply>

It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper.  Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectorial recommendations.   </p>  <p>  If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee which drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy believes that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025: increasing the value of agrifood exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increasing value added in the sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion; and increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion.  With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agrifood sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development.</p>  <p>  Last week I launched the first annual progress report of Food Wise 2025: Steps to Success 2016.  Food Wise Steps to Success showed that, of the 330 detailed actions which were due to commence in 2015 or 2016, 28% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken; and a further 67% have commenced and are progressing well.  I believe that this is a good start and I will press on to get as many actions as possible completed within the next year.</p></reply>

According to Bord Bia, overall exports of beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat and poultry increased by &euro;140 million to more than &euro;3.5 billion.  The target in Food Wise 2025 is to increase the overall value of agrifood exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion by 2025.  My Department works very closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Bord Bia, the industry and the European Commission on a wide range of market access issues<i>. </i>The Department continually monitors trade statistics produced by Bord Bia and the CSO, in order to analyse the destination of exports and, together with industry, to identify new market opportunities.  Third Country markets are an increasingly important alternative outlet for the industry.  The development of new and alternative markets, given the changing global demographics and emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere, is a crucial component of the Food Wise 2025 Strategy.  As an exporting country, accessing new markets is crucial to the long-term sustainability of our agri sector.</p><p>In the medium and long term global demographics will result in strong global demand for meat products and my role as Minister is to facilitate market access so that Irish exporters can take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.  Taken together these factors provide a great opportunity for increasing the exports of high quality, safe and sustainably produced Irish meat, production.</p><p>In recent weeks a notable success included the decision of the US authorities to extend their approval for Irish beef to include manufacturing beef/beef intended for grinding (BIFG)<i>. </i>This marks the culmination of over a year of intensive work between my Department and its US counterparts on a range of technical matters.  I was also very pleased that the US is now proposing to change the regulations which restricted the importation of sheepmeat from the European Union due to TSE.  This announcement is a critical first step and my Department is already working to complete specific veterinary technical documentation demanded by the US so that Irish sheepmeat will be well placed to take advantage of this latest development.</p><p>I am acutely aware of the need to develop as many market outlets as possible for Irish beef, lamb, pig meat and poultry products.  I will continue to work with stakeholders to raise the profile of the Irish agri-food sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa, the Gulf States and elsewhere.  In this context I intend to lead a Trade Mission to China, Vietnam and Singapore in September to further promote Irish food and drink in the region.  My Department has also re-configured its network of agricultural attach&eacute;s abroad, with an enhanced role in relation in agrifood trade and Bord Bia is also presently expanding its network of offices abroad, with a focus on new and emerging markets.  This will also enhance our identification of new markets abroad.</p></reply>

Agri food exports account for 7% of GDP and continue to grow year on year.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation and new EU food information regulations which were adopted by the Council of Health Ministers in December 2011.  However, my Department plays a vital role in the enforcement of this legislation under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  Currently my Department is assisting our colleagues in the Department of Health on the drafting of a new Statutory Instrument to bring the labelling of loose pigmeat and poultry into line with the origin labelling rules for packaged meat brought in on April the first 2015.  This requires businesses who sell meat loose in their premises to clearly identify the country of rearing and slaughter of the animal from which the meat is derived.  Once the SI has been finalised my Department will arrange for it to be placed on the Technical Regulation Information System for notification to all EU Member States and following on from the obligatory three month standstill period I would be confident that the Minister for Health will be in a position to sign the SI, bringing it into force.</p><p>Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators.  The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement.  This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b></b>Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have systems to identify any person who supplies the business with a food, and a system to identify other businesses to which their product has been supplied.  This is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.  There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail. </p><p>My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants.  Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment.  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating in EU Member States and third countries.  Labelling and documentary checks are routinely conducted by the Department.</p><p>The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.  The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States.  Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department.  Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance.  Inspection finding reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

The number of BPS entitlements allocated was determined by the number of eligible hectares declared by a farmer in 2013 or 2015, whichever was the lesser, and the value of entitlements allocated was based on a fixed percentage of the value of Single Payment Scheme entitlements owned by the farmer in 2014 and any payment received under the 2014 Grassland Sheep Scheme.</p>  <p>  The person named held 11.60 entitlements valued at &euro;183.02 each in 2014 giving him a payment of &euro;2,123 in 2014.  These entitlements expired on 31st December 2014 and he was then allocated 11.60 Basic Payment Scheme entitlements based on the eligible land declared in 2015.  These entitlements are valued at &euro;120.41 each in 2015.  The value of the payment received by the person named in 2015, including his Greening Payment, which totals &euro;2,061.69, shows a marginal reduction on the value of his payment in 2014.  This is consistent with the marginal reduction to all farmers&rsquo; payments in 2015 based on the reduced national ceiling allocated to Ireland under CAP 2015-2019.  The value of the entitlements held by the person named will increase under convergence each year from 2015-2019 as set out in the Definitive Statement of Entitlements issued to the person named in early June 2016.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie, </i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area, which is the subject of procurement.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered.  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention.  The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county.  The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to  <i>broadband@dcenr.gov.ie.</i></p><p>The county breakdown for the National Broadband Plan Intervention in Kildare is set out in the following table, with the percentage of premises to be covered by the Intervention and through commercial investment also listed:</p><p><table><tr><th>County Name</th><th>Total Number of County Townlands</th><th>Number of Premises Covered by National Broadband Plan Intervention</th><th>% Premises within the NBP Intervention Area</th><th>% Premises within Commercial Operator's Area</th></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>1210</td><td>20,536</td><td>23%</td><td>77%</td></tr></table></p><p>The Government&rsquo;s NBP intervention will ensure the delivery of high quality, high speed broadband of at least 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.</p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus for the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ( 'PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum.  On 5<sup></sup>July 2016, I announced that my Department has also identified a further 170,000 premises which are currently marked BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map and which are unlikely to get access to services.  My Department is currently in the process of identifying these additional premises with a view to including them in the formal procurement process.</p><p>The Department has now moved to the next stage in the procurement process.  In this Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase, the Department will  commence the formal dialogue process with three qualifying bidders this week.  The qualifying bidders will shortly be furnished with a draft contract, with detailed specifications for a quality and affordable high speed broadband network. </p><p>Following the ITPD stage, which will take a number of months, the Department will issue final tender documentation to bidders.  When final tenders have been submitted a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s).  The current schedule envisages contract(s) award in June 2017.</p><p>The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of bidders short-listed and the complexities that may be encountered during the dialogue process.  It must be noted that bidders will need several months to prepare their draft bids and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at these stages of the process.</p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and / or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the establishment of a mobile phone and broadband Taskforce which will consider immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.  My Department is engaging with the Department of Arts, Heritage, regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in relation to the terms of reference for the Taskforce to ensure delivery of the Programme for Government commitment.</p><p>The Taskforce will involve a number of Government Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with ComReg and telecommunications operators.  My Department has already conducted a number of meetings with vendors and mobile operators to help inform the process and identify what tangible measures can be taken.  I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the Taskforce's report.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the rollout of the broadband network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>I am confident that through the combination of existing commercial investment and the State intervention, that all our citizens will have the same, if not better, access to high speed broadband services available in other comparable jurisdictions.</p></reply>

The Government has adopted a range of support measures designed to meet our binding target, and although good progress towards our target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging.  Provisional data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) indicates we had reached 9.2% of the overall 16% target at the end of 2015.</p>  <p>  In the electricity sector the primary support mechanisms introduced for renewable electricity are the Alternative Energy Requirement (AER) schemes and the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) schemes.  These schemes have proved successful at incentivising the development of the renewable electricity generation capacity necessary to meet our 40% renewable electricity target, and the SEAI estimate for 2015 is that 25.3% of electricity demand was met by renewable sources.</p>  <p>  In the heating sector, my Department is working on the introduction of a new Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) to support the deployment of renewable energy in the sector.  The primary aim of the RHI is to build on the progress already made in heating and to help reach our 12% target by 2020.  In 2015, it is estimated that 6.8% of heat was derived from renewable sources.</p>  <p>  In the transport sector, Ireland aims to meet our renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.  In 2015, 5.7% of our energy needs in the transport sector were met from renewable sources. </p>  <p>  The Energy White Paper, Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future, published in December last, sets out a vision for transforming Ireland's fossil-fuel based energy sector into a clean, low carbon system by 2050, while the Programme for Government also sets out important objectives in the energy sector that build on this vision.  The clear focus of my Department is on implementing the range of actions that are aimed at meeting our energy and climate change targets.</p></reply>

The PSO levy consists of a set of support schemes designed to facilitate the achievement of national electricity policy objectives for renewables, indigenous fuels and security of supply.  It also supports employment in the renewables industry and in the peat industry.  The proceeds of the PSO levy are used to contribute to the additional relevant costs incurred by PSO-supported electricity generators which are not recovered in the electricity market.  Recent international studies have shown that Ireland has had one of the lowest per unit supports for renewable energy in the European Union.</p><p>The overarching objective of the Government&rsquo;s energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers.  The PSO has supported the connection of more than 2,000 MW of renewable energy to the electricity grid and will continue to support the development of renewable energy so that the target for 40% renewable electricity penetration by 2020 is met.</p><p>My Department is currently working on the development of a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and a consultation will issue later this year.</p><p>The PSO Levy is a charge on all electricity customers without exception and is determined by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation by the CER are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002).  The total amounts spent, and details by category, such as the amounts for peat, renewables and security of supply plant, for each of the past five years, as calculated by the CER, are already available in the public domain.  The CER publishes these details in annual PSO Levy Decision papers at <i>www.cer.ie. </i>The latest proposed decision paper for the 2016/2017 period can be found here<i>: http://www.cer.ie/docs/001074/CER16152%20PSO%20Levy%202016-17%20Proposed%20Decision%20Paper.pdf </i></p><p>The following table shows the total amount for the PSO levy for each of the last five years.  The second table shows a breakdown of the PSO levy for each of the last five years.

The Garda Commissioner has statutory responsibility for threat assessment in Ireland including the assessment of threats to civil aviation.  Currently the threat level in Ireland related to international terrorism is assessed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as moderate; that an attack is possible but is not likely.</p>  <p>  Considerations with regard to security in the public areas of an airport, such as the check-in area, are similar to the consideration for any public space where people congregate.  Protection of these public spaces is also a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in consultation with the Airport Operator.</p>  <p>  In terms of any threat to civil aviation, it is the responsibility of the Airport Operator to ensure that aviation security standards are maintained and, with regard to the landside areas of the airport, that any additional aviation security measures are considered based on a local risk assessment.  Aviation security arrangements, including for  Irish airports, are also kept under continuous review by the National Civil Aviation Security Committee, which is chaired by a senior official from my Department.  The Committee comprises representatives of, among others, Government Departments, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, Airport Operators and Air Carriers.</p>  <p>  For security reasons it is not possible for me to elaborate or comment on any specific security measures at airports in the State.</p></reply>

Following consideration of the expressions of interest it was decided to include the proposal from South Dublin County Council (SDCC) for a new swimming pool in Lucan in the LASPP.</p>  <p>  The Department wrote to SDCC in April 2016 advising the Council to undertake the first stage in the four principal stages in a swimming pool project i.e.  Preliminary Report (including Feasibility Study).</p></reply>

In light of the financial crisis, it was decided that the Railway Order application should be withdrawn in September 2011.  The total spend on the project was &euro;18.7m.  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for the planning and development of public transport infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA).  As I previously confirmed to the Deputy, the NTA'S recently adopted <i>Transport Strategy 2016-2035 </i>does not include the original Metro West proposal but instead proposes the future development of an east-west Luas line, commencing in the residential areas of Lucan and connecting into Dublin City Centre.  This would provide a high capacity radial service from this area to the City Centre, sufficient to cater for the high transport demand along this corridor, and would serve Lucan, Liffey Valley and Ballyfermot along its route.  The Strategy also envisages the development of a Core Bus Network, which would include a range of radial and orbital routes serving Dublin West, and a Bus Rapid Transit scheme linking Blanchardstown with UCD.</p><p>The Capital Plan does not include funding for the east-west Luas line so it will not be advanced during the period of the current Plan.  The timeline for the project will be determined in the context of Integrated Implementation Plans brought forward by the NTA for implementation of its Transport Strategy and the availability of funding under future funding reviews.</p></reply>

In this regard, Exchequer support under the Regional Airports Programme 2015-2019 for safety and security projects and activities at these airports will be continued where appropriate.  As the Deputy will be aware, an additional &euro;10 million is provided in the Programme for Government for the regional airports.

With regard to revenue, the most recent CSO Quarterly Tourism and Travel publication shows that spending in Ireland by overseas visitors (excluding carrier receipts) in the first three months of 2016 amounted to over &euro;693 million, an increase of 17.5% compared to the same period in 2015.  Research carried out on behalf of the tourism agencies and tourism industry has found that certain market segments have a higher likelihood to select Ireland as a destination.  Tourism Ireland's overseas marketing activity is weighted towards these segments in order to provide the best return on marketing investment.</p>  <p>  In addition, the tourism brand experiences that have been developed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, like the "Wild Atlantic Way", "Ireland's Ancient East", and  "Dublin &ndash; A Breath of Fresh Air" &ndash; are all designed to meet the needs of the most promising consumer segments in overseas source markets.</p>  <p>  The Government's Tourism Policy Statement "People, Place and Policy &ndash; Growing Tourism to 2025" was launched in March 2015.  The main targets contained in the Tourism Policy Statement, to be achieved by 2025, are as follows:</p>  <p>  - Overseas tourism revenue to increase to &euro;5 billion net of inflation, compared to &euro;3.5 billion in 2014;</p>  <p>  - Overseas visits to Ireland to increase to ten million, compared to 7.6 million in 2014; and</p>  <p>  - 250,000 people to be employed in the tourism sector, compared to around 205,000 at present.</p>  <p>  In 2015, a Tourism Leadership Group was appointed to put in place a Tourism Action Plan containing key actions required in the period to 2018 in order to achieve the overall objectives in the Policy Statement.  The Tourism Action Plan was published in January and contains actions across a range of key issues including skills in the tourism industry; supply of visitor accommodation; overseas tourism marketing; and the contribution of Local Authorities to tourism development.  My Department is now working closely with the tourism agencies on the implementation of all of the 23 actions contained in the Plan.</p></reply>

It will end limitations in access to public contracts, open-up services market, and offer predictable conditions for investors.  </p>  <p>  The agreement covers virtually every aspect of economic activity, and it is extremely important for Ireland.  It offers significant opportunities for growth in trade for with Canada.  The agreement opens up public procurement markets in the Canadian provinces giving Irish firms increased access to Canadian public sector purchasing.  Ireland also gains unlimited tariff free access for most of our important food exports. Irish firms will also benefit from the recognition of product standards.  In addition, Ireland successfully campaigned for a low beef import quota from Canada to the EU thereby safeguarding our important EU market in this area.  </p>  <p>  At the EU Council of Trade Ministers on 13 May 2016, the Council had an exchange of views on CETA and the process towards signature and provisional application of the agreement.  The European Commission and Member States highlighted the high quality of the agreement reached with Canada and expressed the desire to work towards signature of the agreement at the October EU-Canada Summit.  At the meeting, I made Ireland&rsquo;s approach clear, that based on our assessment of its provisions, we viewed CETA as a mixed Agreement, in terms of EU and Member State competency.</p>  <p>  The Commission published its proposals for signature, conclusion and provisional application of the agreement on 5 July 2016.  The Commission has now decided to submit CETA to the Council for decision as a mixed agreement.  </p>  <p>  It will be a matter for the Council and the European Parliament to decide on the signature and provisional application of CETA.  Following a decision by the Council with the consent of the Parliament, it will be possible to provisionally apply CETA.  Its full entering into force will be subject to the conclusion by the EU, through a Council decision with the consent of the Parliament, and by all Member States through the relevant national ratification procedures.  This means that the Oireachtas will be part of the final decision to ratify the agreement.</p>  <p>  The provisional application of Free Trade Agreements is standard practice.  What is at issue is what should be within scope in such application. We&rsquo;ve argued that only those areas directly within exclusive Commission competence should be covered by provisional application.  The Commission has already accepted that the CETA is a mixed agreement.</p>  <p>  The provisions of the CETA on investment dispute resolution relate solely to the CETA as a multinational trade agreement.  International trade agreements are not part of domestic law.  This is why separate adjudication arrangements are required in the event of disputes under the agreement. </p>  <p>  The issue of mixity and the extent of EU competence in a Free Trade Agreement is before the European Court of Justice.  I understand that a decision is expected in 2017.</p></reply>

The LEOs provide advice and direction, covering all government supports and requirements, to anyone who wishes to start or expand a business.  This information is easily accessed through the &lsquo;Supporting SMEs&rsquo; online search tool at:  <i>www.actionplanforjobs.ie. </i></p><p>The LEOs can also provide funding for projects that meet certain criteria, generally with regard to export potential, and other non-financial supports such as training and mentoring.  Businesses should contact their local LEO by telephone or by email &ndash; contact details for all LEOs are available at: </p><p>A new online tool which sets out the variety of supports available to all enterprises across all sectors is embedded or linked to over 30 Government websites including my Department&rsquo;s website and the websites of the Local Enterprise Offices and Enterprise Ireland. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland (EI) works in partnership with Irish enterprises to help them start, grow, innovate and win export sales in global markets.  They provide funding and supports for companies - from entrepreneurs with business propositions for a high potential start-up through to large companies expanding their activities, improving efficiency and growing international sales. Availability of all EI supports are communicated via and also through EI&rsquo;s Development Advisors, EI Regional Offices and through public calls for applications. </p><p>In September 2015 a new guide was launched setting out the range of State supports available for the manufacturing sector.  As part of the Government&rsquo;s plans to support employment growth in the manufacturing sector, a key step is to ensure that businesses in the sector become more aware of the Government supports that are available to support them in their expansion.  This new brochure which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website brings together all these services in a single publication to assist the sector to tap into these supports and clarify the details of what is available from the various Government Organisations and Agencies.  Details are at: </p><p>In the area of access to finance, a range of initiatives has been introduced - from Microfinance Ireland to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, and from the Credit Guarantee Scheme to the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund - and continued investment in seed and venture capital through Enterprise Ireland.  These initiatives remain available and accessible to business and continue to provide increased access to credit and finance for Irish enterprise.</p></reply>

One-in-five private sector jobs in the economy result from IDA Ireland-supported FDI, both directly and indirectly, and represent a vital economic contribution by the multinational sector.  2015 saw the highest level of employment in the Agency&rsquo;s history, with 187,056 people employed in IDA Ireland client companies.</p><p>Our efforts to continue to attract international investment in Ireland will be guided by both my Department&rsquo;s Policy Statement on Foreign Direct Investment and IDA Ireland&rsquo;s own five-year strategy <i>&ldquo;Winning - Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019&rdquo;. </i>The strategy details both how the Agency will broaden its target sectors further and seek new markets over the next five years.  Its ambitious targets include boosting FDI in Ireland by over 40% and creating 80,000 new jobs in the economy. </p><p>When considering investing in Ireland FDI companies consider a range of factors, including: regions of scale with appropriate urban centres, supply of skilled people, international connectivity, energy infrastructure, telecommunications, R&amp;amp;D capabilities, sub-supplier and services infrastructure.</p><p>Ireland has many factors that make it an attractive location for FDI including a stable macroeconomic environment, pro-enterprise policies, high-quality education and skills development, a proven track record and a competitive and transparent corporate tax regime.  </p><p>Property availability is of particular importance when a FDI company is considering locating in a regional area.  In this regard, in February 2015 the Government unveiled a five-year strategy that included the delivery of a &euro;150 million IDA Ireland property investment programme to attract foreign direct investment into different parts of Ireland.  The programme will ensure the ready availability of an adequate supply of marketable serviced land, office and industrial/manufacturing buildings in advance of demand by both existing and potential client companies.</p><p>As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I, along with IDA Ireland and other governmental and regional stakeholders continue to work to ensure that we create the right environment for investors to enhance our reputation as an excellent location for overseas talent to work and live.</p></reply>

We are working closely to achieve an unemployment rate to 6% by 2020 as set in the Programme for a Partnership Government, sustaining the progress in reducing the unemployment rate from 15.1% in 2012 to 7.8% in June of this year. </p><p>Under Pathways to Work 2013, a Protocol on cooperation between the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the enterprise agencies was agreed.  The aim of the Protocol is to maximise the recruitment of suitably skilled personnel from the Live Register by the enterprise agencies client companies.  </p><p>The parties to the Protocol are my own Department, the Department of Social Protection, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices (formerly County Enterprise Boards) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</p><p>The Protocol has been maintained under both the new Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy and the Action Plan for Jobs strategy 2016.  The Protocol is in place to ensure that there are good working arrangements at local level to share information, cooperate on awareness and promotion activities, match enterprise needs for existing and new projects, engage on conversion and training needs and ensure companies can avail of Intreo placement services. </p><p>The practical outcomes of the Protocol are primarily at local level - closer working relationships, exchange of key information on jobs opportunities, attending each other&rsquo;s events, sharing promotional literature, etc. is now commonplace.  On 17 May last, some 160 representatives of the Protocol groups attended a Dublin Castle event to share best practices, network and discuss the impact of new strategies such as the Regional Action Plan for Jobs and the Regional Skills Fora.</p><p>In addition, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) reports to me and to the Minister for Education and Skills provides information on employment trends, job opportunities and demand for skills.  It produces an annual &ldquo;<i>National Skills Bulletin&rdquo; </i>and &ldquo;<i>Vacancy Overview&rdquo; </i>reports.  It also provides information on the supply of skills from the Irish education system through the &ldquo;<i>Monitoring Ireland&rsquo;s Skills Supply&rdquo; </i>publication.  The EGFSN publishes reports on specific sectoral, or cross-sectoral skills needs.  In addition, it produces &ldquo;<i>Regional Labour Markets Bulletins&rdquo;. </i></p><p>Recent EGFSN reports have anticipated future job opportunities arising from both expansion and replacement demand for a range of occupational roles.  These include ICT, data analytics, manufacturing, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages.  Further opportunities are also anticipated in international sales and marketing, project management, freight transport, distribution and logistics, and in the hospitality sector. </p><p>Co-operation between employers and the education and training system is crucial in developing effective responses to skills needs.  This co-operation is being strengthened through the new Regional Skills Fora to connect employers, enterprise development agencies and education and training providers. </p></reply>

We have 155,000 extra people at work since 2012 and employment is growing in every region.  With 45,000 jobs created last year, this leaves 200,000 to be achieved by end 2020, as per the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  My focus is on ensuring we support new job creation in every region.  The Regional Action Plans for Jobs are the mechanisms for delivery.  Their objective is to increase employment by 10% to 15% in each region, resulting in the generation of a total of 246,000 jobs by 2020, even higher than the Programme for Government target.  This goal is underpinned by key targets for each of the regions, including increasing the number of entrepreneurs/start-ups in each region by minimum 25%, improving the survival rate and scaling performance of companies; increasing FDI investment into each region by 30% to 40%; and increasing the flow of critical skills to the Region&rsquo;s enterprises.</p>  <p>  Achieving these ambitious targets at regional level requires a renewed focus on building on regional strengths and areas of competitive advantage to develop the environment for business to start, grow and succeed and to attract inward investment.</p>  <p>  All 8 Plans have been published and implementation is underway.  Each Plan is overseen by a Regional Implementation Committee, with members drawn from the private and public sector.  We are working closely with county councils to encourage them to play a significant role in implementing the Plans.  Twice yearly updates will be published for each plan.  The first Progress Reports will be published in Q3 2016. </p>  <p>The enterprise agencies are delivering on their elements of the action plans to stimulate employment growth in every region.  Net jobs created through IDA companies amounted to 11,833 in 2015, with 53% of new IDA jobs located outside Dublin.  Of the 21,118 new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland client companies, almost two thirds of these (64%) were created outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  My Department is also providing funding of up to &euro;250 million to support the Regional Action Plan process, to be provided over the next five years to Enterprise Ireland and IDA. This comprises a &euro;150m Regional Property Programme delivered by IDA and up to &euro;100 million available through three Enterprise Ireland competitive calls.  These competitive calls are being targeted at innovative and collaborative approaches to support jobs creation across the regions. In June this year, I announced an initial allocation of &euro;5million in competitive funding for 48 local and regional initiatives under two competitive regional funding calls administered by Enterprise Ireland; the LEO Competitive Fund and the Community Enterprise Initiative.  Further competitive regional funding calls will be rolled out on a phased basis.</p></reply>

For example, the participation rate for women in the prime working-age group &ndash; aged 25-54 &ndash; rose from 67% in 2003 to 73% in 2015.</p><p>The upward trend was halted for a period by the sharp recession Ireland experienced between 2008 and 2012, but has resumed in years 2012-2015. </p><p>Ireland has also successfully secured ESF funding support for a programme, entitled &quot;Gender Equality: Women Returning to the Workforce and Women's Entrepreneurship&quot;.<b><i></i></b>The objective of the measure is to offer women the opportunity to acquire a range of skills through training which will enable them to return to the labour market or to  support their entrepreneurial capabilities  - which in turn will support job creation.</p><p>The government expects women&rsquo;s participation to go on rising, and converging towards the EU average.</p><p>Addressing the under representation of female-led businesses that start a business and achieve considerable scale, requires a tailored, focussed approach in terms of support, personal development and networking opportunities.  Enterprise Ireland Female Entrepreneurship Unit was established to support ambitious women grow scalable businesses and to address the key challenges impacting on the growth of female led business opportunities.  The strategy focuses on a number of initiatives which include:</p><p>Enterprise Ireland co-funding a number of key specific tailored development programmes to support ambitious women optimise their business success.  These include:</p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>- Sponsorship of women in business awards to identify and promote role  models:</p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>The signing into law of an Employment Regulation Order (ERO) for the Contract Cleaning Sector which covers about 30,000 workers, the majority of which are women, provided for a new single wage rate of &euro;9.75 per hour from October 1, 2015.  This was &euro;1.15 per hour higher than the national minimum wage at that time.  Since January 1<sup>st</sup>last, when the national minimum wage increased to &euro;9.15 per hour, the minimum rate applicable to workers in the Contract Cleaning Sector is still 60 cents higher.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Low Pay Commission presented its first report in July 2015 in which it recommended an increase of 50 cents per hour to the minimum hourly rate bringing it to &euro;9.15.  That increase came into effect on 1st January last.  The Commission presented its second report before the statutory deadline of 19th July 2016, which, in line with the practice established last year, was presented to Cabinet yesterday and published immediately thereafter.  The recommendation that the minimum hourly rate for an experienced adult worker be increased by 10 cents to &euro;9.25 will be considered by Government in the context of Budget 2017.</p><p>Given the preponderance of women on the national minimum wage and in order to obtain a better understanding of the composition and profile of this group and the underlying causality, the Commission has been asked to examine this issue and report its views as to the underlying reasons for this position and make any recommendations it considers appropriate.  The Commission is due to report on this by end of October this year. </p><p>There is also a range of employment rights and equality legislation that greatly assist women in the workforce and ensure they are protected and treated equally whether they are <font color="#4F4F4F">full-time, part-time or temporary employees.</font></p></reply>

A summary of the key actions that will be taken to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision has been published.</p><p>As outlined previously, my own Department has been, and will continue to be, fully engaged in the risk analysis and contingency planning work that is being undertaken at cross-Government level, led by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p><p>Since the announcement of the UK referendum result on 24 June, as part of my contingency plans, I have established a Coordination Group within my Department consisting of relevant enterprise, single market, and trade officials, together with the Chief Executive Officers of IDA and Enterprise Ireland, to oversee the management of our immediate response, including the messaging to businesses both at home and overseas.  I chair this Group, and I will continue to do so as part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing response as developments unfold at EU level and bilaterally with the UK.</p><p>Also on that day, I met with representative business organisations, including IBEC, ISME, the SFA, and the Irish Exporters Association, to provide an update on immediate responses to reassure business in the aftermath of the result. </p><p>Since then, I have had meetings with a range of other representative organisations, including American Chamber of Commerce Ireland (AmCham), Dublin Chamber of Commerce, and the Irish Farmers Association.</p><p>I have also written to my newly-appointed counterparts in the new UK Government &ndash; Liam Fox, the Secretary of State for International Trade, and Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy &ndash; to confirm my intention to work together with them as the upcoming negotiations develop, and to request an early opportunity to discuss our priorities.</p><p>In addition, the enterprise agencies under my remit will continue to deliver on their commitment to supporting business and jobs in this period of heightened uncertainty.</p><p>In this regard, on the day after the referendum result, the CEO of IDA Ireland, wrote to the 1,200 Foreign Direct Investment companies who have operations in this country.  That contact was designed to reassure those companies regarding Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to the EU and on our commitment to FDI.  He reassured those companies that the IDA will work with them to help sustain their existing business in Ireland and to grow additional business opportunities here. </p><p>Engagements by the IDA both with their existing client companies and with new prospective investors, on issues arising as a result of the UK Referendum will, of course, continue on an ongoing basis. Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to our membership of the European Union, which provides for full access to that market for businesses located in this country, and our specific advantages for inward investment, will be highlighted by my Department and by the IDA at every opportunity. </p><p>Earlier this month, Enterprise Ireland reported that its client companies saw an increase of 10% in exports in 2015 amounting to an all-time high of &euro;20.6bn.  The export figure is now almost double what it was 10 years ago (&euro;10.73bn in 2005). </p><p>As regards the UK vote to leave the European Union, and the importance of the UK market, EI client exports to the UK increased by 12% last year to reach &euro;7.5bn.  Significantly however, in the context of Brexit, UK exports, as a share of total exports, have reduced from 45% to 37% over the period 2005 to 2015 as EI clients have diversified their export base.  High Growth Markets (e.g. China, Brazil, etc.) have continued to increase in importance over the past 10 years and now account for 12% of total exports compared to 7% in 2005. </p><p>Despite the continued diversification of the Enterprise Ireland client export base, the UK&rsquo;s vote to leave the EU will present significant new challenges for Irish companies exporting to the UK.  In response, Enterprise Ireland has begun its plans to support clients exporting to the UK, including:</p><p><b>1.

Since the Action Plan for Jobs process was first introduced in 2012, the unemployment rate has reduced from 15.1% to 7.8% in June 2016, with 155,000 extra at work.  The Programme for a Partnership Government places the retention and growth of employment at the centre of our economic strategy.  It sets out a target to create an additional 200,000 jobs over the period 2016 to 2020, with 135,000 jobs to be created outside Dublin. Ireland&rsquo;s return to economic growth has demonstrated our ability, through concerted efforts across Government, to focus actions on those areas that help to retain and create jobs in all parts of the country.  The Programme commits to sustaining the cross government focus on addressing the challenges set out in Enterprise 2025 strategy, the Government&rsquo;s long-term enterprise policy.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 sets the objective of delivering growth over the next decade that is sustainable, led by strong export performance, builds on our sectoral strengths, and that is underpinned by innovation, productivity, cost effectiveness and competitiveness.  We aim to build resilience into our economy so that we do not suffer again as we have done in the past number of years. Enterprise 2025 is a strategy that aims to build an economy that will not just achieve full employment but will sustain it in the long term. </p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 is a whole of enterprise strategy, aimed at delivering opportunities across all regions and across all sectors, including both manufacturing and services activities.  Through a partnership approach with enterprise, representative bodies, the enterprise development agencies, Local Enterprise Offices and others, delivering a step change in enterprise performance and resilience will see a significant increase in Irish owned companies of scale, contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation for innovation in international markets.  We are targeting a doubling of Irish owned companies with sales in excess of &euro;100 million.</p>  <p>  It is also about establishing a vibrant and stimulating ecosystem for entrepreneurship, in particular female entrepreneurship, to deliver an increase the number of start-ups by 25 percent per annum &ndash; start-ups that have better survival rates.  We also need to ensure that individual enterprises, and the economy more generally, gain from impactful inter-firm relationships throughout the country, through stimulating the establishment of clusters of scale and international visibility in areas of strength.  Ireland is, and will continue to be, the best place to succeed in business, delivering sustainable employment and higher standards of living for all.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-20a.1191.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1247" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000094#WRBB03900"><p>Ireland&rsquo;s improving cost competiveness performance has been central to securing the recovery in economic growth and employment.  The improved competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s exporting sector has been one of Ireland&rsquo;s greatest strengths in recent years and has been key to economic growth and job creation.  Improved cost competitiveness has made Irish firms more competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location in which firms can locate and expand their operations.</p>  <p>  As a result of our concerted efforts to improve national competitiveness, Ireland&rsquo;s relative international competitiveness as measured by a range of international indices has improved since 2012.  Ireland moved from 16th to 7th in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook, from 29th to 24th in the WEF Global Competitiveness Report and 17th out of 189 countries, up two places on last year as assessed by the World Bank.  The Bank&rsquo;s latest report shows Ireland is now ranked 4th in the euro area in terms of ease of doing business.</p>  <p>  Cost competitiveness is an important aspect of Ireland's overall competitiveness and we continue to monitor Ireland's cost competitiveness on a regular basis.  The National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s Costs of Doing Business in Ireland report published in April 2016 benchmarks key business costs and focuses on areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors, and on costs that are largely domestically determined.</p>  <p>  The report points out that recent external factors have been in our favour in terms of cost competitiveness such as a weak euro, historically low interest rates low oil prices and positive global growth.  However, as we know these are factors which are beyond our control and can change quickly and the recent UK Referendum result on leaving the UK increases the uncertainty in the external environment.  The report concludes that Ireland&rsquo;s industrial cost base remains competitive but pressure points are emerging in labour, property and business service costs. We must therefore focus intensely on reducing costs that are out of line with those in competitor countries.  There is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage their cost base and drive efficiency, thus creating a virtuous circle between the costs of living, wage expectations and cost competitiveness.  Measures that ensure open and competitive markets are essential. Improving productivity performance is also key. </p>  <p>  I share the Council&rsquo;s view that high costs have the potential to undermine recent economic progress and it remains our goal to continue to develop a competitive and productive economy. The immediate challenge is to sustain the strong recovery underway by remaining competitive.  Therefore a general policy of vigilance and a willingness to take action on costs is essential.  To protect the gains achieved to date, to further embed and sustain employment growth, and to ultimately spread the benefits of economic growth to all, we must continue to enhance all aspects of our competitiveness, including costs.</p>  <p>  Addressing Ireland&rsquo;s international cost competitiveness remains a key economic priority for Government.  While growth prospects for the Irish economy are strong, we must continue to deliver aggressively the structural reforms required to support cost competitiveness, productivity and growth.  We will continue to progress actions that improve Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness position, by implementing Action Plan for Jobs 2016 and in the development of the Action Plan for Jobs 2017.</p></reply>

Their objective is to increase employment by 10% to 15% in each region, and to ensure their unemployment rate is within one per cent of the State average.  This goal is underpinned by key targets for all regions, including increasing the number of entrepreneurs/start-ups in each region by minimum 25%, improving the survival rate and scaling performance of companies; increasing FDI investment into each region by 30% to 40%; and increasing the flow of critical skills to each region&rsquo;s enterprises.</p>  <p>  Delivering balanced growth also requires a renewed focus on building regional strengths and areas of competitive advantage to develop the environment for business to start, grow and succeed and to attract inward investment.</p>  <p>  Since 2015, IDA Ireland has been working towards the targets set out in its strategy, &ldquo;Winning: Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019&rdquo;.  Under this strategy, ambitious investment targets have been set on a regional basis for the first time. IDA Ireland aims to increase overall investment by 30% to 40% in each region.  In 2016, Enterprise Ireland is targeting its clients to deliver 12,000 new jobs, &euro;22bn in exports (from 18.6bn in 2014) and &euro;2.4bn in new exports.  EI&rsquo;s new Strategy 2017-2020 will be finalised in 2016 and will contain ambitious new targets for supporting start-ups, exports and jobs across all regions.  Each Local Enterprise Office has a Local Enterprise Development Plan (LEDP), setting out clearly what the LEO intends to deliver over the following 12 months.  The Plans identify and prioritise the key enterprise sectors and entrepreneurial capacity challenges that need to be targeted in each LEO&rsquo;s functional area.</p>  <p>  The enterprise agencies are also delivering on their elements of the Regional Action Plans to stimulate employment growth across the country; Enterprise Ireland and IDA jobs figures for 2015 show that all regions have experienced agency-related jobs growth.  Net jobs created through IDA companies amounted to 11,833 in 2015, with 53% of new IDA jobs located outside Dublin.  Of the 21,118 new jobs created by EI client companies, almost two thirds of these (64%) were created outside Dublin.  The LEOs delivered over 3,500 net new jobs across all regions in 2015.</p>  <p>  My Department is also providing funding of up to &euro;250 million to support all Regional Action Plans, to be provided over the next five years to Enterprise Ireland and IDA.  This comprises a &euro;150m Regional Property Programme delivered by IDA and up to &euro;100 million available through three Enterprise Ireland competitive calls.  These competitive calls are open to all regions, and are targeted at innovative and collaborative approaches to supporting local job creation.  In June this year, I announced an initial allocation of &euro;5million in competitive funding for 48 local and regional initiatives across the country under two competitive regional funding calls administered by Enterprise Ireland; the LEO Competitive Fund and the Community Enterprise Initiative.  Further competitive regional funding calls will be rolled out on a phased basis.</p></reply>

As recognised in the strategy, innovation plays a central role in driving productivity growth and fostering competitiveness in a global world where knowledge and innovation are critical factors for advanced economies.  Innovation contributes significantly to employment, export and investment growth; the competitiveness of indigenous enterprise; embedding the Foreign Direct Investment base in Ireland; and the creation and application of new knowledge and technology spillovers.  Key to achieving the vision in Innovation 2020 is ensuring that our enterprise base remains resilient and internationally competitive.  My Department and its agencies are focused on the development and support of internationally trading manufacturing and services firms in Ireland, and have a clear and steady focus on the potential and opportunities that exist and can be created by prioritising innovation and technology as a key driver of success.  Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland provide a spectrum of innovation and science/ technology development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support to help companies become more innovative, encourage and support competitiveness, and help them grow their sales and exports in order to create a climate in which sustainable employment will grow and expand.</p>  <p>  Achieving the vision outlined in Innovation 2020 will mean that there will be:</p>  <p>  - More enterprises engaged in RDI, including enterprises in the locally traded sectors, to drive productivity performance;</p>  <p>  - More enterprises progressing from early engagement with RDI to embedding innovation as a key part of their business model in a self-sustaining way;</p>  <p>  - Businesses across the enterprise base embracing new technologies to build successful business models;</p>  <p>  - Achieving innovation leadership in key sectors where we can sustain a competitive edge;</p>  <p>  - Greater utilisation by enterprises of the research assets of our Higher Education Institutes, by engaging with Research Centres and Technology Centres;</p>  <p>  - Greater success in translating intellectual property or new thinking into commercial products and services &ndash; by providing better supports for knowledge transfer and entrepreneurship, infrastructure for test-bedding, and access to funding.</p></reply>

We are working closely to achieve an unemployment rate to 6% by 2020 as set in the Programme for a Partnership Government, sustaining the progress in reducing the unemployment rate from 15.1% in 2012 to 7.8% in June of this year.  Under Pathways to Work 2013, a Protocol on cooperation between the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the enterprise agencies was agreed.  The aim of the Protocol is to maximise the recruitment of suitably skilled personnel from the Live Register by the enterprise agencies client companies.  </p>  <p>  The parties to the Protocol are my own Department, the Department of Social Protection, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices (formerly County Enterprise Boards) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta</p>  <p>  The Protocol has been maintained under both the new Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy and the Action Plan for Jobs strategy 2016.  The Protocol is in place to ensure that there are good working arrangements at local level to share information, cooperate on awareness and promotion activities, match enterprise needs for existing and new projects, engage on conversion and training needs and ensure companies can avail of Intreo placement services. </p>  <p>  The practical outcomes of the Protocol are primarily at local level - closer working relationships, exchange of key information on jobs opportunities, attending each other&rsquo;s events, sharing promotional literature, etc. is now commonplace.  On 17 May last, some 160 representatives of the Protocol groups attended a Dublin Castle event to share best practices, network and discuss the impact of new strategies such as the Regional Action Plan for Jobs and the Regional Skills Fora.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) reports to me and to the Minister for Education and Skills provides information on employment trends, job opportunities and demand for skills.  It produces an annual &ldquo;National Skills Bulletin&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vacancy Overview&rdquo; reports.  It also provides information on the supply of skills from the Irish education system through the &ldquo;Monitoring Ireland&rsquo;s Skills Supply&rdquo; publication.  The EGFSN publishes reports on specific sectorial, or cross-sectoral skills needs. In addition, it produces &ldquo;Regional Labour Markets Bulletins&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  Recent EGFSN reports have anticipated future job opportunities arising from both expansion and replacement demand for a range of occupational roles.  These include ICT, data analytics, manufacturing, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages.  Further opportunities are also anticipated in international sales and marketing, project management, freight transport, distribution and logistics, and in the hospitality sector. </p>  <p>  Co-operation between employers and the education and training system is crucial in developing effective responses to skills needs.  This co-operation is being strengthened through the new Regional Skills Fora to connect employers, enterprise development agencies and education and training providers.</p></reply>

Since the launch of the first Plan in 2012, 155,000 more people are in employment.  This surpasses the original target to have an extra 100,000 at work by the end of 2016.  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting 200,000 additional at work by 2020, with 135,000 of these new jobs outside Dublin.  Unemployment has declined significantly from its peak of 15.1% in 2012 to 7.8% in June 2016.  Youth unemployment is also declining.  In June 2016, the rate of youth unemployment was 15%, down from 20.8% in 2015. My Department is leading on the securing the effective implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs to ensure that job opportunities and for all cohorts, including youth unemployed, are available.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs complements Pathways to Work, developed by the Department of Social Protection, which sets out specific measures for young people, under the Youth Guarantee and Youth Activation Charter, to help them access the labour market and new job opportunities. </p>  <p>  We will provide a diverse range of choices on leaving secondary education, which is regarded as a key success factor in countries with low levels of youth unemployment. In particular I see the expansion of apprenticeships and traineeships as an effective route to sustainable and rewarding employment for many. </p>  <p>  In 2015 the Minister for Education and Skills, announced the development of 25 new Apprenticeships.  These cover a wide range of sectors such as manufacturing and engineering, tourism and sport, financial services, information technology, transport distribution and logistics, and business administration and management.  A number of these will be enrolling by the end of the 2016 and the remainder in 2017.  Overall the Programme for a partnership Government commits to double the number of apprenticeships to 31,000 places by 2020 and significantly increasing the number of traineeship places. </p>  <p>  We will continue to work with colleagues across Government to develop initiatives to help our young people to meet their full potential in a fast-changing world.</p></reply>

This translates into a net increase of 10,169 jobs (taking account of job losses) in EI supported businesses and brings total employment in these companies to 192,223 for 2015, a record high for the agency.  Almost two-thirds of the new jobs created were outside Dublin and all of the regions recorded increases in full-time employment over the period.  Enterprise Ireland attributes this strong mainly export-led job creation by Irish businesses to an improving entrepreneurial climate for start-ups, dynamic Irish companies innovating and scaling up in key sectors such as food, fintech, business process outsourcing and improving international economic conditions. </p><p>2015 saw the highest level of employment in IDA client companies in the organisation&rsquo;s 67 year history reaching 187,056.  A total of 18,983 new jobs were created by their clients during 2015; when job losses are taken into account, there was net job creation of 11,833. Overall, 53% of all jobs created by IDA clients in 2015 were based outside of Dublin, which is an improvement over the 49% share in 2014.  Please note that IDA employment figures for 2016 will be included in the Annual Employment Survey when it is completed in early 2017. </p><p>The methodology used to compile statistical data for the County Enterprise Boards (CEBs)/Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) changed in 2010 and therefore comparable data is not available for the years 2008 and 2009. The Table below sets out the job gains, job losses and net jobs change overall for Co. Kildare, in client companies of the former CEB and the LEO, for the years 2010&ndash;2015 inclusive.  It should be noted that following dissolution of the CEBs in 2014 and the subsequent establishment of the LEOs, an extensive cleansing of the former CEB client portfolio was undertaken by Enterprise Ireland.  This means that comparison between the period prior to 2014 with 2014 onwards can only be indicative.  The data in the following table refers to full-time plus other/part-time jobs. Figures for 2016 will only be available in early 2017. </p><p>I am pleased to say that employment in Agency clients has been growing over recent years and I expect, with the continuous focus by EI, IDA and the LEOs, together with implementation of the Mid-East Regional Action Plan for Jobs, we will continue to see job creation in the years ahead.</p><p>Figures for the three Agencies for County Kildare are set out in the following tables:</p><p><b>IDA Ireland</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Category</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>Gross Gains</td><td>161</td><td>32</td><td>1,451</td><td>355</td><td>546</td><td>339</td><td>463</td><td>679</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>Gross Losses</td><td>-742</td><td>-1,638</td><td>-352</td><td>-628</td><td>-575</td><td>-480</td><td>-516</td><td>-588</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>Total Jobs</td><td>11,225</td><td>9,619</td><td>10,718</td><td>10,445</td><td>10,416</td><td>10,275</td><td>10,222</td><td>10,313</td></tr></table>Jobs are full-time and other/part-time.

Ninety-four per cent of children in care who turned 18 years during 2014 and assessed as needing an aftercare service were offered a service.  At the end of March 2016, 121 young adults were discharged from care due to reaching 18 years; 90% of those availing of an aftercare service had an allocated aftercare worker.</p>  <p>  Currently, Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 provides that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, may assist a child leaving its care if it is satisfied that the person has a need for assistance. Currently, Tusla is operating under the 'Leaving and Aftercare Services - National Policy &amp;amp; Procedure" document from 2011.  The policy specifies that the core eligible age range for aftercare is 18 years and up to the age of 21 years of age.  This may be extended for those in full-time education to complete their course of education. </p>  <p>  The policy also includes parameters for the provision of services, including the following:</p>  <p>  - A young person should have been in care for a minimum of 12 consecutive months after their 16th birthday, prior to their 18th birthday, </p>  <p>  or,</p>  <p>  - A young person should have been in care for a minimum of 12 consecutive months on their 16th birthday.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that young adults leaving care at 18 years are not obliged to avail of an aftercare service, and those that choose not to engage are encouraged and supported to avail of the services at any stage up to the age of 21 years.   </p>  <p>  The Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 was signed into law in December of last year and is awaiting commencement.  The Act is primarily concerned with aftercare - the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him or her in making the transition to independent living.  The Act obliges Tusla, following an assessment of need, to prepare an aftercare plan identifying relevant aftercare supports for an eligible child or eligible young person.</p>  <p>  An eligible child means a child aged 16 years or over who has spent at least 12 months in the care of the State between the ages of 13 and (up to) 18 years old.  An eligible adult means a young person aged 18, 19 or 20 who has spent at least 12 months in the care of the State between the ages of 13 and 18 years old. </p></reply>

Of the 1,858 young adults, 1,754 (94%) were aged 18-22 years (inclusive).  During the first three months of 2016, 121 young adults were discharged from care due to reaching 18 years. 97% of these were eligible for an aftercare service and 91% were availing of a service. Of those availing of a service, 90% had an allocated aftercare worker.  </p>  <p>  The data on the current accommodation of young persons involved with after care supports is not available of the format referred to by the Deputy.  Tusla details in their report for the first quarter of 2016, that the vast majority of 18-22 years olds in receipt of an aftercare service were residing in some form of stable accommodation.  48% of those care leavers remained living with their foster carers, 26% were living independently, 10% returned home, 3% were living in supported lodgings and 5% were living in residential centres. 8% were living in other types of less stable accommodation.  </p>  <p>  Findings from research show that homelessness amongst care leavers is most likely to occur some years following discharge from care.  The Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 allows for an eligible adult (those aged 18, 19 or 20 years who have spent 12 consecutive months in care between the ages of 13 and 18) to apply for an aftercare plan. </p></reply>

The gross funding allocation for Tusla in 2016 is &euro;676 million.  This  represents an increase of &euro;38 million over the 2015 allocation and includes extra provision of  &euro;36.9 in revenue funding and &euro;1.1m in capital funding.  </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Agency's establishing legislation, a detailed Performance Statement was issued to Tusla to inform the preparation of its Business Plan for 2016.  The Performance Statement includes policy guidance, direction, prioritisation and resource parameters for 2016. </p>  <p>  Tusla has committed in its Business Plan to a series of actions in 2016.  This includes in particular a targeted reduction of 60% in the number of cases awaiting allocation to a social worker. </p>  <p>  The level of financial provision available in 2016 allows Tusla to significantly increase its manpower levels.  Tusla is currently engaged in an extensive recruitment programme, which includes the recruitment of 168 extra social workers and 33 support staff to address the issue of unallocated cases.  It will be important to recruit other grades also, to ensure an efficient service with the right mix of staffing including family support staff and administrative support.  </p>  <p>  There are currently 1,511 whole time equivalent social workers employed by Tusla representing a net increase of 110 whole time equivalent social workers since end December, 2015.</p></reply>

It is a time bound co-funding arrangement with resources of &euro;29.7m from 2013 to 2017.  The aim of the ABC Programme is to test and evaluate prevention and early intervention approaches to improve outcomes for children and families living in poverty in 13 areas of disadvantage.</p><p>The ABC Programme was preceded by the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) (2007-2013) in which three sites participated: Preparing for Life Programme, Darndale, Youngballymun  and the Childhood Development Initiative Tallaght.  Preparing for Life received &euro;6m as a participant in the Prevention and Early Intervention programme.  The total funding for Preparing for Life under the ABC programme is &euro;3.34m bringing the total funding received by Preparing for Life under both programmes to &euro;9.34m.</p><p>I want to acknowledge the excellent research undertaken by Preparing for Life in recent years including in respect of its home visiting programme which is showing promising results.  I should emphasise that many of the ABC sites are engaged in research and evaluation of their programmes, approaches and interventions.  A number of sites who were previously funded under PEIP, or other philanthropic-funded programmes have produced detailed high quality evaluations with many promising results being identified across the sites and individual programmes.  My Department is working to ensure that we take full account of the learning from <i>all</i>the interventions across the 13 ABC sites including Preparing for Life.  This will offer a clear illustration of the interventions that work best, and will inform our plans to embed prevention and early intervention in services for children.  </p><p>The current contract for Preparing for Life was due to conclude in August 2016. My Department worked with Preparing for Life in April to agree the extension of this contract together with that of the two other PEIP sites to end July 2017.  This will bring them in line with the other 10 ABC sites.  To ensure continued provision, my Department and The Atlantic Philanthropies have sanctioned an additional &euro;400k to Preparing for Life.  Preparing for Life welcomed the additional funding and have indicated that it allows them to embed their work in mainstream services and contribute to the learning and evaluation of the ABC Programme.</p><p>I look forward to the continued engagement of the 13 ABC sites with my Department as we work towards the implementation of quality prevention and early intervention initiatives in order to achieve our shared goal of improving the lives of children and families throughout the country.</p></reply>
