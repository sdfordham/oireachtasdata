The <i>Review</i>has concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured NHA network. This will entail the phasing out of turf-cutting on certain NHA by 1 January 2017, and the partial or complete de-designation of certain NHAs.</p><p>To compensate for the loss of habitat within sites where it is proposed that turf cutting can continue, 25 currently undesignated raised bogs, which are either in public ownership, or where there is reduced turf cutting pressure, will be designated as NHAs. Compensation schemes will be made available to affected turf cutters.</p><p>These sites will be proposed for designation later this year when all the necessary preparatory work, which is underway at present, is complete. This includes, among other things, the delineation of proposed boundaries, the preparation of site maps and the compilation of the details of landowners and others who may be affected by the proposed designations. </p><p>As with all designations, my Department will, in due course, directly contact individual landowners in the relevant areas and advertisements will be placed in local newspapers, explaining why the site is being proposed for designation and the process through which individuals can appeal against the designation of their lands, up to having their case considered formally by the independent Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-17a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041700046#WRA00637"><p>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has developed two airstrips at Cleggan and on Inishbofin in Co Galway. These airstrips are not open at present or licensed for use by the Irish Aviation Authority and the landing of aircraft on the airstrips is strictly prohibited.</p><p>  My Department took a decision recently to dispose of both airstrips. This decision was made in view of the economic downturn, the ongoing cost of maintaining the airstrips and the unlikelihood that my Department will, at any time in the near future, have the resources to provide financial support to an air service between the island and the mainland. My Department is currently assessing the disposal options that are available to it and a decision in this regard will be announced in due course. It is anticipated that the disposal of these assets will be on the basis of a public procurement process.</p><p>  I can confirm that my Department has received enquiries from various parties regarding the future use of the facilities, including from the Irish Coast Guard. It is my understanding that the Irish Coast Guard has made use of the island airstrip for daytime emergency medical evacuations. Night-time evacuations are not possible as there are no landing lights on either airstrip. My Department has indicated to the Irish Coast Guard that it will examine any proposals that it may have in this regard. However, considering all the circumstances, I do not foresee any possibility of my Department coordinating the use of the airstrips for multiple uses, including the landing of private aeroplanes.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Wildlife Acts licences are required by the Irish Coursing Club on behalf of their affiliated clubs to facilitate the tagging and the capture of hares. Such licences are issued on an annual basis by my Department.  Coursing meetings can only take place during the Open Season, between 26 September and 28 February of the following year.</p><p>  Regional staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department attend coursing meetings, as resources allow, to monitor compliance with the conditions of the licences.  These staff have a wide variety of functions relating to management of National Parks, the conservation of habitats, the protection of protected species and the enforcement of legislation under National laws and EU Regulations. Notwithstanding current staffing constraints, my Department will continue to monitor coursing meetings on an ongoing basis, as well as collating the monitoring reports. </p><p>  Reports from staff are generally available for consideration within good time of the subsequent coursing season and delays have not been a problem in my Department's consideration of licensing. In these circumstances, I do not see a need to introduce specific time limits at this stage.</p></reply>

As I outlined on that occasion, whilst my Department provides funding to the National Cultural Institutions, the board of each institution is responsible for all operational matters, including recruitment and internship programmes. </p><p>I have no direct function in these matters but am given to understand that a number of the National Cultural Institutions offer internship opportunities, which are provided mainly to third-level students and/or new graduates who wish to gain practical experience and develop work place skills relevant to their area of study.  </p><p>I am advised that such programmes operate in a mutually supportive and complementary manner, which assists the institutions in achieving their goals and objectives whilst ensuring a rewarding and beneficial experience for interns in terms of enhancing their career opportunities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-17a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041700046#WRA01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 17 and 21 together.</p><p>Consideration of proposals is ongoing at Government level on the development of projects relating to the centenary of the Easter Rising. Through consultation with the Oireachtas All-party Working Group on Commemorations and the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations, I have sought to prioritise projects that are of educational and historical value, that provide a lasting legacy and that are appropriate in tone and scale to the events being commemorated. </p><p>To date, a number of capital projects have been identified as priorities in this regard for completion by Easter 2016. These include the development of a suitable permanent facility for the Military Service Pensions Archive, the renovation of Kilmainham Courthouse to enhance the visitor experience at Kilmainham Gaol, the development of a permanent exhibition space and interpretive centre at the GPO, and the development of visitor facilities at Teach an Phiarsaigh, Ros Muc. Among the further projects under active consideration are developments at the National Archives and the National Concert Hall, as well as the renovation of Richmond Barracks and the development of a Tenement Museum.  The progress of these and other initiatives will be contingent, inter alia, on the availability of resources. </p><p>In relation to the national monument at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street, in July 2013 I made a determination under the National Monuments Acts on the consent application and related Environmental Impact Statement submitted by the owners in relation to their proposals for the national monument.  My decision provided, inter alia, for the full repair and restoration of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street and the creation of a commemorative centre to honour the leaders of the 1916 Rising. The completed designs for the approved works have now been submitted to my Department to verify that they are in compliance with the decision I made on the consent application in July 2013. The National Asset Management Agency has recently confirmed to my Department that it will make the necessary funding available for the works covered by my consent.  This adds considerably to the prospects of a fitting tribute to the 1916 leaders being in place in Moore Street in time for the centenary of the Rising.</p><p>Complementing the many special presentations, reports and discussions prepared by the national cultural institutions, colleges and community groups, the centenaries this year of the founding of Cumann na mBan and the import of arms by the Irish Volunteers are being marked by official ceremonies.  The arrangements for Cumann na mBan included a commemoration led by the President at Glasnevin and an academic conference hosted by the National Museum of Ireland at Collins Barracks.  The import of arms in July 1914 will be marked by special presentations in the Asgard Gallery at Collins Barracks and a special programme at Howth harbour.  A second online release of historic records from the Military Service Pensions Archive will support research and enhance our understanding of the republican movement.  The continuous reporting and analysis of centenary news by <i>Century Ireland</i>will offer a sense of the period to interested readers.</p><p>The programme to commemorate the First World War is developing. In partnership with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Teresa Villiers, I laid the foundation stone for a memorial cross at Glasnevin Cemetery on 31 March last.  This 'Cross of Sacrifice' was arranged in partnership between Glasnevin Trust and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The dedication of the Cross will take place in late July in remembrance of all the soldiers from Ireland who died in the Great War.  A special Cathedral Service of Remembrance on 3 August will mark the entry into the war and be followed closely by further events in Britain and Europe in early August.  The First World War centenary programme will continue on the historic timeline until 2018, marking the salient anniversaries of particular significance for Ireland.</p><p>Information on the developing commemorative programme will be available on my Department's website and individual announcements will issue for specific events. I remain, as always, grateful to hear from Deputies with any views on commemorative arrangements.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-17a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041700046#WRA01600"><p>I published three major documents relating to Ireland's peatlands in January. These were the draft National Peatlands Strategy, the draft National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) Management Plan and the Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs). Copies of these documents are available for consultation on my Department&rsquo;s website at . Written submissions may be submitted until tomorrow 18 April.</p><p>The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management plan sets out the position in relation to SAC raised bogs. In general, turf-cutting on raised bog SACs is incompatible with their conservation and will not be possible in future. There are some exceptions which are dealt with in the draft Plan. </p><p>Cutting cannot continue on SAC raised bogs outside the legal framework laid down by the Habitats Directive, as transposed into Irish law, and legal action has been initiated in relation to a number of breaches in recent years. These issues are now before the Courts. It is important to note that the majority of turf cutters are engaging with my Department in relation to the compensation schemes which I introduced.</p><p>The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan explores the possibility of using the limited flexibility, within the terms of the Habitats Directive, for continued turf-cutting on a small number of raised bog SACs where relocation possibilities are shown not to exist. In such a scenario, a robust case would need to be submitted to the EU Commission under Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive and compensatory measures provided to make up for any damage to the SAC network.</p><p>However, it has not been possible at this point to determine whether this Plan could form the basis of a case to the EU Commission that an exception should be made for continued turf-cutting on any particular site, notwithstanding the damage it would cause. The issue is dealt with in more detail in Chapter 6 of the draft plan. </p><p>I hope that the publication of the draft Plan and the consultation process now underway will encourage further consideration by turf-cutters and their representatives in regard to this issue and their engagement with me and my Department to finalise the Plan.</p></reply>

Of these, 806 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.  </p><p>  Progress in relocating turf cutters is being achieved in a number of cases.  Arrangements for the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs have been made as regards a group from Clara Bog special area of conservation in County Offaly and a group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog special areas of conservation in County Galway. The group from Clara Bog commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June 2012, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have now been accommodated. Arrangements have been made to enable 23 qualifying turf cutters from the group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog to commence turf cutting at the Islands Bog and Killasolan Bog, County Galway during the 2014 turf cutting season.</p><p>  Progress has been made with a view to the relocation of 7 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation in County Kildare to Timahoe North, County Kildare, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na. My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season, provided that an agreement is reached with them.</p><p>  The Department has provided 7 turf cutters from Monivea Bog special area of conservation with the possibility of relocating to a number of sites which have been assessed as suitable for relocation:</p><p>  Killaclogher Bog, Abbert Demense, County Galway which could accommodate 11 turf cutters;</p><p>  Clogh, Cloonkeen Bog, Attymon, County Galway which could accommodate 14 turf cutters; and  </p><p>  Gortnalone South, Cloonkeen Bog, Attymon, County Galway which could accommodate 10 turf cutters.</p><p>  The responses received from the turf cutters are being assessed. Due to the number of turf plots available, the Department is also endeavouring to determine whether other turf cutters may be interested in relocating to one of these sites.</p><p>  I am advised that of the remaining 48 raised bog special areas of conservation, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 32 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites.  Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation due, for example, to the small number that had been cutting turf on these sites during the relevant five year period and would qualify for the relocation option available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.</p></reply>

These sites are known collectively as Natura 2000 and are selected subject to certain criteria laid out in the Directives. Areas may also be designated as Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs) under the Wildlife Act.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s network of Natura 2000 sites is largely complete at this stage and I have no intention to propose further areas for designation at the location referred to by the Deputy, which already has a number of such sites, including Baldoyle Bay and Howth Head Coast SPAs, as well as Baldoyle Bay and Howth Head Coast SACs. While the designated areas do not cover the entirety of the Velvet Strand area referred to in the Deputy's Question, a portion of that area is within the Baldoyle Bay SAC.</p><p>  While designation under the Birds and Habitats Directives, or under the Wildlife Act, focuses on the nature protection issues, there are also additional mechanisms available to local authorities under the planning code to protect areas. For example, local authorities, in drawing up their development plans under the Planning Acts, have a broader responsibility for protecting high amenity areas from inappropriate development. In this regard, I understand that a portion of Howth Head is subject to a Special Amenity Area Order under the planning code.</p></reply>

Under the Irish Wildlife Acts it is an offence, except under licence, to capture or kill a pine marten, or to destroy or disturb its resting places. Once rare, the species has spread widely in Ireland in the past 30 years.    Only one licence has been granted in recent years to allow the killing of one pine marten. In this particular instance, the licensee demonstrated that there was an on-going persistent problem that had not been solved by live capture and removal. There was also a public health concern as the affected premises housed a food wholesaler. </p><p>  I recognise the need for practical advice and guidelines for dealing with pine marten in a manner that is consistent with conservation goals. As they have become more widespread, they can take up residence in places where they are not welcome to humans.</p><p>  Last autumn, the Vincent Wildlife Trust and my Department collaborated on the development and publication of a leaflet which provides advice on how to keep pine martens out of game and poultry pens. Both organisations are again working together, this time to develop an information leaflet that will provide practical guidance for individuals to help them to prevent pine martens from taking up residence in their houses. This leaflet will be published in the coming months.</p></reply>

This is a difficult reality that every publicly funded body has had to deal with during the economic crisis. I can assure the House that I have done my utmost to minimize budget cuts to the cultural institutions, in so far as was possible, while being cognisant of competing demands on the public finances. The stark reality is that, in the current funding environment, institutions have had to make difficult choices when prioritising the spending of their allocations.</p><p>In relation to the National Archives, the Bishop Street headquarters are at capacity and off-site storage has been required for a number of years to house the statutory annual transfer of Departmental records to the National Archives.  Cognisant of these matters, my Department had requested that the OPW prepare a development plan for the Bishop Street premises. A plan was prepared accordingly for the phased delivery of the necessary works in the National Archives headquarters warehouse. The plan concluded that the construction of a two storey facility <i>within</i>the existing building will provide an efficient and economically viable solution to the storage needs of the National Archives.  A formal Cost Benefit Analysis in respect of the proposed development was completed in October 2013.  My Department is continuing to progress this project with OPW and other stakeholders in the context of the Decade of Commemorations.</p><p>With regard to the current capacity of the various storage locations used by the National Archives and the facilities/equipment available, the position is set out in the following Table, which will be included in the Official Report.</p><p><b>TABLE:</b><table><tr><th>Location</th><th>Capacity</th><th>Facilities/Equipment</th></tr><tr><td>Four Courts</td><td>90,000 boxes</td><td>-refurbished, good facilities and equipment</td></tr><tr><td>Bishop St front block</td><td>125,000 boxes</td><td>-good facilities and equipment</td></tr><tr><td>Bishop St warehouse</td><td>114,000 boxes (including 70,000 boxes uncatalogued)</td><td>-substandard facilities and equipment and being addressed as part of development plan</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial storage</td><td>1,800 boxes</td><td>-good facilities and equipment</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>As the Deputy will be aware, the key obstacles to working on the National Archives backlog are lack of skilled and qualified staff who could carry out the cataloguing and preservation work and a lack of space in which to store the documents when this work is complete. In relation to staffing, I am pleased that my Department recently secured sanction for the filling of 2 Keeper posts, 2 Senior Archivist posts and 1 Senior Conservator post at the national Archives, as well as the recruitment of 2 additional Archivists.</p></reply>

The Bank of Ireland at College Green is one of the most iconic buildings in Dublin City. It was the first purpose-built Parliament in Europe, completed in 1739, and served as Ireland&rsquo;s Parliament until the Act of Union in 1801.   The space for the Centre will be made available to the State for a ten year period, to run alongside the Decade of Centenaries. It is envisaged that exhibitions at the Centre will include a significant focus on key events in Irish history &ndash; up to the centenary of the Civil War &ndash; which led to the creation of modern Ireland, whilst also including a strong cultural component.</p><p>  Bank of Ireland will cover the costs of refurbishing the space and operating the Centre. My Department, in partnership with the Bank, will manage, operate and animate the Centre. I very much welcome Bank of Ireland's decision to make the space available and would like to thank the Bank for strongly supporting this initiative.</p><p>   As the matter is at an early stage of development, it is not possible yet to offer specifics about the programme of events or the operation of the centre. However, I believe the work to be carried out in the centre will have a significant impact on enriching the cultural programme during the Decade of Centenaries and over the next 10 years.</p></reply>

Ireland is committed to defending the universality of human rights, and one of our key priorities is the promotion and protection of space for civil society to operate, free from harassment and intimidation.  Civil society actors have come under increasing pressure in many parts of the world in recent years. In some countries, dialogue with civil society remains limited, and the space for civil society engagement is narrow or shrinking. Restrictive legislation and repressive practices in some countries have led to stigmatisation, harassment, and even criminalisation of civil society actors. As part of our commitment to the protection of civil society space, Ireland took the lead, with the support of a cross-regional group of member states consisting of Chile, Japan, Sierra Leone, and Tunisia, on a new draft resolution entitled &lsquo;Civil society space; creating and maintaining, in law and in practice a safe and enabling environment&rsquo; at the 24th session of the Human Rights Council which took place in September 2013.</p><p>  The creation and maintenance of space for civil society is inextricably linked to the ability of individuals to exercise their fundamental right to the freedoms of peaceful assembly, association, opinion and expression.  This resolution addresses, for the first time at the Human Rights Council, the issue of civil society space as a human rights concern, underlining the importance of the contribution of civil society in so many aspects of our lives, and calling on States to create and maintain, in law and practice, a safe and enabling environment in which civil society can operate effectively.  The draft resolution was the subject of difficult and politically sensitive negotiations.  Ireland successfully defended the draft resolution against several hostile amendments, paving the way for it to be adopted by the Council without a vote.</p><p>  On foot of the resolution, a panel discussion was held on 11 March 2014 during the 25th  session of the Human Rights Council, on the challenges facing states in their efforts to ensure space for civil society, and lessons learnt and good practices in this regard.  The Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations in Geneva worked closely with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on the preparations for this event.</p><p>  The panel discussion was addressed via video message by the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon.  Ms Flavia Pansieri, UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, also delivered opening remarks, which was followed by an interactive discussion moderated by Ms. Hina Jilani, a prominent human rights lawyer and pro-democracy campaigner. The panellists were: Ms. Safak Pavey, member of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; Mr. Frank La Rue, Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression; Ms. Deeyah Khan, film, music and arts producer; and Mr. Mokhtar Trifi, Honorary President, Tunisian League for Human Rights.</p><p>  In addition to the panellists, many states, national human rights institutions, non-governmental organisations, and UN agencies intervened during the discussion to highlight their diverse experiences in the promotion and protection of civil society space.</p><p>  Ireland delivered a national statement during the interactive debate which emphasised that protecting civil society space entails the fulfilment of the rights of peaceful assembly, association, opinion and expression, online and offline, which in turn facilitate the enjoyment of other human rights.  It is the primary responsibility of states to promote and protect these rights and to be accountable to their citizens.  The statement also noted that governments should see civil society as an asset, not a threat.  It expressed deep concern that in some countries, certain provisions, such as those relating to national security, public morals, defamation, funding and regulation of the internet, have led to the harassment, stigmatisation and criminalisation of civil society actors.   </p><p>  The statement also emphasised that ethical, religious or cultural values should not be used as a justification for putting in place national legislation which undermines the universality of human rights, and that national legislation should be consistent with international human rights law and should facilitate civil society to operate in a safe and enabling environment.  Ireland also highlighted that the engagement and inclusive participation of civil society can cultivate democracy, enhance the promotion and protection of human rights, prevent violations and abuses, and foster social and economic development.</p><p>  As mandated by the resolution on civil society space, OHCHR will now prepare a summary report of the panel discussion which will be presented to the Human Rights Council at its 27th  session in September 2014.  Building on this report, Ireland intends to work with its partners to lead a further resolution on civil society space at the Human Rights Council.   We will also continue, through our development cooperation programme, to use our voice, influence and partnerships to protect and promote the ability of civil society organisations to operate.</p></reply>

In my ongoing contacts with the British government, and with the Northern Ireland Executive, I continue to stress the importance of progressing implementation of all outstanding aspects of the Agreements.</p><p>I welcome the report agreed at the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly plenary in Dublin on 31 March 2014<b></b>on the implementation of the Good Friday and St Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement and which calls on all parties to the Agreements &lsquo;<i>to maintain momentum to ensure that all outstanding provisions are implemented in their totality</i>&rsquo;.  </p><p>I continue to urge all the parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly to engage in constructive discussion with a view to reaching agreement on the substance of a Bill of Rights.   A Bill of Rights drawn up by agreement between the main parties of the Assembly could set out precisely and formally the rights underpinning a reconciled society  in Northern Ireland can be based. </p><p>I support the establishment of a Civic Forum which would provide for a broad range of voices on community relations and stimulate informed public debate in relation to key societal challenges.</p><p>On my regular visits to Northern Ireland, I continue the practice of engaging with civil society representatives.  </p><p>In the context of the North South Ministerial Council, most recently at our Plenary Meeting on 8 November 2013, the Government expressed support for the re-establishment of the Civic Forum as a valuable and, as yet, unimplemented provision of the Good Friday Agreement.    </p><p>I am firmly of the view that an Irish Language Act should be introduced in Northern Ireland.  All parties to the Good Friday Agreement recognised the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity in Northern Ireland.  </p><p>In the St Andrews Agreement, the British government committed to introducing an Irish Language Act and to working with the Northern Ireland Executive to enhance and protect the development of the Irish Language.  </p><p>Since the restoration of the devolved Institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland has been a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive and in particular the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Ms. Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA.</p><p>Officials in my Department maintain regular and ongoing contact with the Irish language community in Northern Ireland including those involved in cross-community Irish language activity.    </p><p>I will continue to press in my discussions with the Northern Ireland Executive the urgent need to address this issue and to legislate for an Irish Language Act.  Officials in my Department will continue to monitor this matter in their ongoing contacts with the Northern Ireland Office. </p></reply>

At that meeting, the European Union expressed its deep concern about the ongoing conflict in South Sudan and the grave human suffering it is causing for ordinary civilians caught up in the violence.</p><p>  Since the outbreak of the conflict in mid-December 2013, more than one million people have been forced from their homes and around 3.7 million people are severely food insecure. At the Foreign Affairs Council, the EU welcomed the role of the UN in coordinating the humanitarian response and urged all partners to contribute both generously and swiftly to the South Sudan Crisis Response Plan. In particular, the EU urged the international community to align efforts in addressing the growing food security problem while at the same time strengthening the resilience of the population. EU Foreign Ministers also condemned continued restrictions on humanitarian activities and called on all parties to allow rapid, full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access to all populations in need, in accordance with international humanitarian law and principles.</p><p>  Total EU (Commission and Member State) humanitarian support currently stands at &euro;127 million. This funding is supporting immediate life-saving activities such as distributing essential food and non-food items, providing shelter, healthcare, protection, water, hygiene and sanitation. Funding is targeted at people in need within South Sudan, as well as South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries. </p><p>  Ireland has committed more than &euro;3.6 million to date in 2014 in response to the current outbreak of conflict and resulting displacement.  In January, I authorised two airlifts totalling 45 tonnes of emergency supplies to South Sudan from our pre-positioned stocks in Accra, Ghana, valued at &euro;400,000. A further airlift of 36 tonnes of emergency supplies, valued at &euro;370,000 was dispatched to Uganda in March to assist the South Sudanese refugees in the country. I also approved &euro;1.5 million in funding to the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF) for 2014 to ensure that UN agencies and NGOs on the ground can respond to urgent humanitarian needs. Finally, under Irish Aid NGO humanitarian funding schemes, I have so far in 2014 also approved a total of &euro;1,360,000 in funding to Concern, MSF, World Vision and Plan, for a range of emergency response activities in Unity, Jonglei, Upper Nile and Warrap States. </p><p>  Ireland will continue to advocate at all relevant international fora for increased support to the humanitarian relief effort both within South Sudan and for South Sudanese refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries. We will continue to provide assistance, within our means and as the situation evolves.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-17a.95.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041700048#WRC01200"><p>As the Deputy is aware, I attended the most recent meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) in Luxembourg on 14 April.It will come as no surprise, that &ndash; given the crisis in Ukraine &ndash; discussions at the Council meeting were largely dominated by recent developments in that region. Before addressing this in detail however, I would like to briefly outline the discussions that took place on other key issues.</p><p>  Opening the Council meeting with short introductory remarks, High Representative Ashton updated Ministers on: the latest developments in the Middle East Peace Process; her recent visit to Egypt; the latest round of nuclear talks with Iran; preparations for the elections in Iraq as well as the recent first round of Presidential elections in Afghanistan. She also noted the outcome of several high-level exchanges that had taken place in Brussels in recent weeks, notably the EU-US energy Council, the EU-US Summit, the EU-Africa Summit and the visit of the Chinese President. </p><p>  In the lunchtime discussions, Ministers had an exchange of views on Syria and Bosnia-Herzegovina; Council Conclusions were adopted in both areas. </p><p>  On Syria, the EU&rsquo;s emphasis remains on the importance of supporting Special Envoy Brahimi and the so-called &lsquo;Geneva II&rsquo; political talks process and on addressing the humanitarian crisis in Syria and neighbouring countries. The scale of the humanitarian challenge was underlined by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's recent report on the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2139, which noted little evidence of meaningful progress on the ground in delivering humanitarian assistance since the adoption of UN Resolution 2139. </p><p>  The discussion on Bosnia-Herzegovina was wide-ranging. The EU&rsquo;s efforts are firmly focussed on supporting Bosnia in its efforts to meet the accession criteria; Ireland remains a strong supporter of Bosnia&rsquo;s EU perspective. </p><p>  In the afternoon, we moved on to a detailed discussion of the crisis in Ukraine and for the latter part of the exchange, we were joined by Commissioner Oettinger who briefed the Council on exchanges that day with Energy Ministers, on the critically important energy dossier.  </p><p>  Ministers decided to expand the list of those to whom visa bans and asset freezes will apply. Preparatory work continues on so-called Phase Three measures so that further steps can be taken should they be required. Ministers also agreed to send an expert mission to Ukraine to prepare possible EU assistance in support of reform and capacity-building in the areas of policing and rule-of-law.</p><p>  The FAC also adopted a Decision on macro-financial assistance for Ukraine, which brings the total amount of funding being made available by the EU to &euro;1.6 billion.  The support is part of a broader package of international support put together by the IMF and conditioned on Ukraine's implementation of wide-ranging reforms.</p><p>  The EU will also continue its engagement in international facilitation initiatives involving the UN, the OSCE and others.  Ireland is participating fully in these efforts: we contributed officers to two interim OSCE observer missions pending the deployment of the main OSCE Monitoring Mission which is being put in place and in which Irish personnel will also take part. </p><p>  The FAC expressed strong support for the holding of free and fair presidential elections on 25 May.  Ireland is sending a number of observers to Ukraine to help achieve that objective, one which will allow the Ukrainian people to determine their own future and help build trust across the country.  It is in the interest of the entire region that a sovereign, prosperous, stable, democratic and inclusive Ukraine emerges from the current crisis.</p></reply>

It is regrettable also that the UUP is not participating currently in these discussions which are focussed on issues of genuine concern to so many people.   </p><p>  I met with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland last Thursday to discuss the talks and the support which both Governments are giving to the process.  We are both firmly of the view that Northern Ireland urgently requires a new way forward on dealing with the past that can command public confidence.  We agreed also that the early successful conclusion of the political talks represents the best opportunity to make progress across all three important areas of parades, flag and identity issues and dealing with the past.  Maintaining the status quo in relation to these issues is not a feasible or satisfactory option for anyone.  The Secretary of State made clear her Government&rsquo;s support for the talks in a speech in Belfast yesterday and also confirmed that the British government would play their part in working with any new institutions that may arise in the implementation of the architecture proposed by Richard Haass and Meghan O&rsquo;Sullivan.</p><p>  I spoke recently with the First and deputy First Ministers and with the leaders of the SDLP and the Alliance Party.  All have confirmed to me their commitment to reaching a deal.  I encourage all leaders to aim for an early agreement, not in the coming months but in the coming weeks.   The groundwork has largely been laid by the party leaders over the past few months.  I applaud that &ndash; and urge them to recognise the opportunity that is now in sight and to take it.</p><p>  We witnessed last year how some are only too willing to decry and reject politics altogether or take politics into their own hands and out onto the streets.  Those individuals and groups must be given the clearest message that progress is made only through dialogue and negotiation by those elected to lead.  Those political leaders can count on the full support of this government as they work through the talks process to reach a comprehensive agreement. </p><p>  The Government wants to see an early agreement as we believe it is in the best interests of Northern Ireland and I will continue to engage closely with the British Government and the NI parties over the coming weeks towards that end.</p></reply>

As the number of fatalities surpasses an estimated 140,000 people, there are now over 9 million people within Syria who are in need of immediate life-saving support, with a further 2.6 million Syrian refugees requiring assistance in neighbouring countries.  Ireland has been to the fore in the international efforts to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis. In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees, I announced Ireland&rsquo;s pledge of a further &euro;12 million in humanitarian assistance at the Second International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria and region in Kuwait on January 15th 2014. This additional pledge in Kuwait brings Ireland&rsquo;s overall funding commitment over the period 2011 to 2014 to &euro;26.011 million, of which over &euro;20 million has been disbursed to date. Funds have been provided to a range of established UN partners as well as to Irish NGOs.  We will continue to provide assistance, within our means and as the situation evolves.</p><p>  Ireland has also been consistent in its efforts to ensure that the necessary attention is given by the international community to this crisis, including at the most recent meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg. At this meeting discussions were focussed on the need for a political solution to the conflict which has had dire humanitarian consequences, both within Syria and in its neighbouring countries. Ministers considered the latest developments on the ground, in particular the state of play in diplomatic efforts to bring an end to the crisis and the implementation of the UN Security Resolution 2139, on humanitarian access.</p><p>  The revised UN response plan for Syria and the refugee populations has requested US$6.5 billion dollars in total for operations in 2014, of which approximately 23% has been provided by the international community to date. This represents the largest humanitarian appeal in the history of the UN. The international community has pledged US$2.5 billion in assistance in response. Ireland strongly supports the continuation of the EU&rsquo;s role as the largest donor to this prolonged crisis and has used every opportunity to encourage donors to honour their pledges towards the humanitarian response.</p></reply>

In addition to substantive discussion of the issues with President Obama and Vice President Biden, the Taoiseach also discussed the prospects for progress with a range of other members of Congress including Speaker John Boehner; Congressman Bob Goodlatte, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee which has responsibility for immigration legislation in the House; Congressman Paul Ryan;  the Congressional Friends of Ireland; and Senator Patrick Leahy,  the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that oversaw the passage of the Senate&rsquo;s comprehensive immigration reform bill last June.  Without in any way under-estimating the political complexities that persist around the immigration reform discussion in the United States, we were encouraged to hear views from both Democrats and Republicans that there is now a growing consensus in favour of reform. The Government has instructed Ambassador Anderson and her team, working with the Irish American lobby groups who have already put in such a great effort, to continue their efforts to persuade members of Congress to seize every opportunity to make immigration reform a reality.  The Embassy has actively pursued this since the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day period and this will continue in the period ahead.</p></reply>

As regards the action being taken by the EU, I believe that throughout this crisis the Union&rsquo;s messages have been strong and they have been consistent and clear.  All Member States have been, and are, united in their views that what has happened in Ukraine is completely unacceptable and that it will have consequences for our relations with Russia.  From the outset, the EU has played an active role in trying to facilitate a resolution to the crisis in Ukraine.  In addition to its scheduled meetings, the Foreign Affairs Council has met twice in extraordinary session to discuss the situation in Ukraine and the Heads of State and Government also have discussed Ukraine in extraordinary session as well as during the regular meetings of the European Council.</p><p>  The Heads of State and Government on 6 March set out a three-phase roadmap in relation to targeted measures against the Russian Federation in the absence of steps to de-escalate the situation.  They also endorsed the decision of Foreign Ministers to suspend talks with Russia on visa matters and on a New Agreement, both stated priorities of the Russian Government.  Following the holding of the referendum in Crimea, the Foreign Affairs Council implemented the second phase of measures involving the imposition of travel restrictions and an asset freeze against 21 Russian and Ukrainian officials involved in undermining Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p><p>  On Monday of this week, I participated in the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg, where there was a detailed discussion of the crisis in Ukraine.  Ministers decided to expand the list of those to whom visa bans and asset freezes will apply.

One Irish person has been seconded to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission agreed upon on 21 March and others are available should the mission be expanded as planned.</p><p>  The Foreign Affairs Council on Monday expressed strong support for the holding of free and fair presidential elections on 25 May.  Ireland is sending a team of observers to Ukraine to help achieve that objective, one which will allow the Ukrainian people to determine their own future and help build trust across the country.  It is in the interest of the entire region that a sovereign, prosperous, stable, democratic and inclusive Ukraine emerges from the current crisis.</p></reply>

The Living City Initiative, announced in Finance Bill 2013, is a pilot project which provides certain tax incentives to make it more attractive for people to live in historic and culturally significant city centre houses.  The initiative also offers incentives for retailers and small businesses in those areas.  Budget 2014 extended the Living City Initiative to include residential properties constructed up to the end of 1914 in designated areas, and extended it to other cities Cork, Galway, Kilkenny and Dublin.  This Initiative is subject to EU State Aid approval and a commencement order.</p><p>  Finance Act 2013 introduced new provisions to ensure that Film Relief tax reliefs will accrue to the producers rather than investors and result in tax savings for the Exchequer.  Budget 2014 extended the definition of 'eligible individual' to include non-EU talent, in conjunction with the introduction of a withholding tax.  It is intended to commence this provision once EU State Aid approval has been given.</p><p>  A capital gains tax relief for entrepreneurs who reinvest the proceeds from the disposal of assets made on or after 1 January 2010 in certain chargeable business assets was announced in Budget 2014 and provided for in Section 45 of Finance (No 2) Act of 2013.  The section requires a Commencement Order, which has not been made.</p><p>  Commencement of the legislative provisions is subject to EU state-aid approval.  My Department is liaising with the European Commission to obtain this approval.  It is not clear how long this process will take.  However, my Department is endeavouring to obtain this approval in as timely a manner as possible.</p><p>  Budget 2014 - The exemption from stamp duty on any conveyance or transfer of stocks or marketable securities admitted to the Enterprise Securities Market operated by the Irish Stock Exchange plc (S86A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 as inserted by s70 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013) is subject to a commencement order pending EU approval.</p><p>  The tax scheme for the construction or refurbishment of certain aviation services facilities as provided for in Finance Act 2013 is subject to EU approval.  We are in discussions with the Commission regarding same.</p></reply>

If there is a particular Excise or Customs service which the Deputy has in mind, it may be possible for Revenue to give a more helpful reply.  Customs work, i.e. declarations relating to the movement of goods in and out of the State are made online, supported by helpdesks based in Customs Division in Nenagh.  Large elements of Excise customer service have been centralised for many years.  For example disabled drivers excise refunds in Monaghan, excise licences in the National Excise Licence Office in Waterford.</p><p>  If the Deputy is concerned about non-compliance, I am further advised that Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to target and confront non-compliance.  These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.  Enforcement strength at particular locations is regularly augmented with additional personnel on a risk-assessment basis, or when particular operations are taking place.  The Deputy will appreciate that, for reasons of operational sensitivity, the Revenue Commissioners are not in a position to give precise details of enforcement deployment in specific locations.</p><p>  While 10 Revenue staff are currently based in County Offaly (at Tullamore), that county is managed as part of Revenue s Westmeath/Offaly District where the bulk of the staff (81 in total) are based in Athlone.</p></reply>

In addition the Deputy will be aware that current and former staff at ptsb have incurred the closure of their defined benefit pension scheme while at AIB the defined benefit pension scheme was closed to future accrual and staff agreed to various other measures including increased working hours. </p><p>Finally I have been advised by the Special Liquidators that there were a total of 978 employees in IBRC on the date of the Special Liquidation, 07 February 2013. Of these, 468 people remain employed and 10 of these are currently serving out their notice periods. The remaining 458 employees are currently scheduled to exit at various dates as the liquidation is completed. I am advised that the average salary of staff in IBRC (in Special Liquidation) has fallen to &euro;72,000.</p><p>Since the Mercer report was published there have been no general salary increases at the Government supported banks while the payment of bonuses remains prohibited.</p></reply>

Enforcement is an important tool to effect deterrence, achieve compliance and promote positive behaviour. The Central Bank will take enforcement action against regulated entities under its Probability Risk Impact Supervisory System (PRISM) supervisory model. PRISM represents a challenging and proportionate risk-based system of supervision for all financial institutions operating in Ireland.</p><p>  In 2013, the Central Bank concluded 16 Administrative Sanctions Procedure (ASP) cases, imposing fines totalling &euro;6.35 million. The cases involved firms across most of the Central Bank's areas of responsibility such as banking, insurance, investment firms, retail financial intermediaries and moneylenders. The breaches that arose related to issues such as breaches of prudential requirements (e.g. failure to maintain adequate solvency margins; failure to ensure accuracy of regulatory reporting to the Central Bank; failures in relation to systems and controls dealing with technical reserves), breaches of the Consumer Protection Code, failure to comply with the Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders and the failure by a listed company to comply with the requirements relating to the proper maintenance of an insiders' list.</p><p>  The total fines of &euro;6.35 million for 2013 includes a &euro;5 million fine imposed on Quinn Insurance Limited (Under Administration) that was waived due to the exceptional circumstances of the case, namely that the firm is under administration and is wholly reliant on funding from the Insurance Compensation Fund, which is ultimately funded by the public. The Central Bank has a policy of issuing detailed publicity statements following the conclusion of each ASP settlement. Further details of each of the above cases is available on the Central Bank's website. </p><p>  In 2014 to date, I have been informed that the Central Bank has concluded 4 ASP cases, imposing fines totalling &euro;575,640. The cases dealt with issues including breaches of large exposure requirements, capital adequacy requirements, the Insurance Mediation Regulations and MiFID Regulations. Detailed publicity statements in relation to 3 of these cases are available on the Central Bank's website. With regard to the fourth, relating to a breach of professional indemnity insurance requirements, I have been informed by the Central Bank that this is one of a number of cases relating to a particular enforcement theme and a publicity statement relating to this case along with other cases dealing with the same enforcement theme will issue as a batch later in the year. This approach seeks to maximise the public impact of the enforcement work.</p><p>  I have been further informed by the Central Bank that its Enforcement Division currently has 29 open ASP cases. These open cases cover the range of areas of the Central Bank's supervisory responsibility. The issues under investigation also broadly align with the Central Bank's public statement of its enforcement priorities, which was published on its website on 25 February 2014.</p><p>  The issues under investigation in the open ASP cases include compliance with prudential requirements by banks and insurance companies; compliance with the MiFID conduct of business rules by investment firms; compliance with the Consumer Protection Code and compliance with requirements to have adequate systems and controls in place. The open ASP cases also include investigations into historical lending practices at Irish Nationwide Building Society, financial irregularities at the former Bloxham Stockbrokers and issues related to Quinn Insurance Limited. </p><p>  The open cases also include a case relating to a possible breach of the Market Abuse Directive Regulations, which has been referred to a panel of Assessors under Regulation 35 of those Regulations. </p><p>  The open cases further include the Central Bank's investigations into Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (formerly Anglo Irish Bank) and Custom House Capital, both of which are currently suspended, following consultation with the Garda&iacute;, to avoid the risk of prejudicing any current or future criminal prosecutions.</p><p>  In addition, as set out in the Central Bank's Annual Performance Statement for 2012, 841 Regulatory Actions were taken in 2012. The 2013 Annual Performance Statement will be published in due course by the Central Bank. It is expected that the final number of Regulatory Actions for 2013 will be even higher than 2012.</p></reply>

I have not sought access to these recordings as under statute the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are the body responsible for criminal investigations in the State. I understand that the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation have requested access to various documents/materials in the banks, including audio recordings, and that the banks have fully complied with these investigations to date. It would be completely inappropriate for the Department of Finance to act outside of its legal powers and interfere with any investigation that could compromise potential future criminal or civil investigations by the bodies responsible under statute.</p><p>  Any phone calls that are relevant around this period may feature as part of the forthcoming banking inquiry. Last year I wrote to the State supported banks except IBRC (in Special Liquidation) and requested that they retain any recordings which may be required as part of the banking inquiry. All of the institutions have responded to confirm that steps have been taken to ensure that any information has been retained and will be available to the inquiry. I was aware at the time of writing to the institutions that IBRC (in Special Liquidation) had already taken steps to protect any recordings. Under the proposed legislation responsibility is assigned exclusively to the Houses of the Oireachtas to determine the requirement for a formal inquiry, the terms of reference of that inquiry and the procedural and organisational aspects of the inquiry.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware the transaction was unanimously noted by the ECB Governing Council, as indicated by President Draghi on 7 February 2013. Furthermore on 18 February President Draghi also stated that the promissory note deal was a positive step for Ireland.</p><p>  The Irish Government fully understands the need for the ECB to ensure it is operating within its mandate as described in the recent Annual Report. As outlined by the Central Bank of Ireland on 7 of February 2013, the bonds will be placed in the Central Bank of Ireland's trading portfolio and sold as soon as possible, provided that conditions of financial stability permit. The disposal strategy will of course maintain full compliance with the Treaty prohibition on monetary financing.  The promissory note exchange was a key transaction and can be seen as a major milestone on Ireland's road to recovery.</p></reply>

The Office of Public Works is committed to alleviating the impact of flooding through the provision of defences as well as a comprehensive assessment of flood risk throughout the country and development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme. Because of cost and scale of these types of flood defence works, this approach will see benefits over the medium and long term.</p><p>  This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which will see up to &euro;225 million being spent on flood relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016. Works are completed on a prioritised basis. Because of the cost and scale of these types of flood defence works, this approach will see benefits over the medium and long term.  Once these works are completed the availability of flood insurance in affected areas would be expected to increase.</p><p>  On 24 March 2014 the OPW and Insurance Ireland agreed on a sustainable system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes. The outcome of this arrangement, set out in a Memorandum of Understanding, is that the insurance industry will have a much greater understanding of the extent of the protection provided by flood defence works and will therefore be able to reflect this in the provision of flood insurance to householders in areas where works have been completed. </p><p>  The underwriting of a particular risk, is a commercial decision to be taken by the individual insurance company, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting and the need to make adequate provisioning to meet these risks. The Central Bank of Ireland has no role in relation to issues of pricing or the scope of cover provided by insurance companies, nor any oversight role in relation to their assessment of flood risk.</p></reply>

Such individuals may apply to the Department/VEC as appropriate for a derogation from the general position within 3 months of the date of receipt of the award&quot;.</p><p>  As the person concerned was not a teacher in employment on 5 December 2011 and not eligible for receipt of a qualification allowance in respect of any teaching post on that date, they do not qualify for payment of an allowance in respect of the qualification related to the course being undertaken at that time.</p></reply>

Within schools, the deployment of teachers is a matter for school management. Management authorities of individual schools and Education and Training Boards (ETBs) are responsible for the appointment and deployment of teachers so as to maximise the effective teaching of the curriculum offered by the school. Schools are also responsible for deciding what subjects and programmes to offer and this can vary in accordance with local need. This, in turn, determines the type of teacher competencies/specialisms required at that time.</p><p>  Data supplied to my Department by the Teaching Council show that there are over 6,600 teachers registered on the basis of qualifications in history. It should be noted that this number would include teachers who are not currently teaching history, such as those who are retired, on career breaks, travelling, unemployed, deployed to teach other subjects and so on.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>  The previous Government capped the number of SNA posts at 10,575 in December 2010. That cap remained in place until December 2013. In December 2013, this Government agreed to increase the cap on the number of SNA posts by 390 posts to 10,965 at the end of 2014.</p><p>  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support. The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  The NCSE invited schools to make applications for SNA support for children who have assessed care needs for the coming 2014/15 school year by 26th March 2014, for their consideration. The NCSE will advise schools of the outcome of their applications ahead of the new school year.</p></reply>

This policy is in line with the provisions of the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.</p><p>Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services. In mainstream schools, pupils may be supported with access to additional teaching and/or care supports. Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Other children may have such complex needs that they require specialist supports in a special school.</p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p><p>SENOs engage with schools annually in order to plan for, and to open, new special classes each year, in order to ensure there are sufficient special class placements available at primary and post primary school level to meet demand in a given area.</p><p>Since 2010, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased from approximately 500 to over 740 Special Classes, including 118 new special classes opened for the 2013/14 school year.</p><p>SENOs have again been working with schools, in recent months, in order to plan for the establishment of special classes for the forthcoming 2014/2015 school year. Although this work is ongoing, at this point, the NCSE has advised that they expect to open up to 100 new special classes for the coming school year. SENOs are continuing to liaise with and work with schools in order to meet demand for special school placements.</p><p>The NCSE has advised that for the most part the response from schools to requests to establish new special classes has been positive. There are, however, difficulties in opening new special classes in a small number of areas. The NCSE will continue to engage with schools in relation to this matter and officials at my Department will also work closely with the NCSE to address any such difficulties in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

Where ICT is embedded in the curriculum it can serve to engage and motivate children in the learning process. It has proven to increase students' self-esteem and creates a more positive disposition towards learning as well as providing teachers with more up to date, exciting and relevant ways of presenting and engaging with the curriculum. ICT can act as a catalyst for peer teaching and learning and is hugely powerful in the development of team-work, higher order thinking skills and a collaborative learning and teaching environment. The use of tablet devices is one of the many ways to integrate technology into teaching and learning.</p><p>  I am aware of the fact that in many schools, parents are being asked to fund the cost of tablet devices for use in the classrooms. This is an operational matter for the Board of Management of each school and the Department has no role at individual school level in approving such initiatives. I believe it is important that where new technology is being considered by schools, parents should be consulted prior to the decision being made and that the costs and other implications for students and children seeking to be enrolled in the school are fully considered by the Boards of Managements.</p><p>  The Department is not in a position to make new grant funding available for purchase of ebooks and associated services and devices. However, I would like to clarify that schools may choose to allocate the existing book grant provided by the Department towards purchase of electronic books if they wish.</p></reply>

These measures, including the PRD, have been vital in securing the financial survival of the country, and they continue to provide critical support to the national budgetary position and to the attainment of our fiscal targets. The PRD is particularly important in this regard, raising in the region of &euro;900 million annually for the public finances at current rates.</p><p>  Under section 12 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, I must review the PRD and other financial emergency measures annually and cause a written report of my findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. As part of that review I am required to consider whether the measures continue to be necessary having regard to the purposes of the legislation, the revenues of the State and State commitments in respect of public service pay and pensions. My next such report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas by 30 June 2014. </p><p>  I should also point out that I have already acted to reduce the burden of PRD on individual public servants, albeit in a limited way. As committed to under the Haddington Road Agreement, and as legislated for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, the rate of PRD on the &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 band of a public servant's annual pay was cut from 5% to 2.5% with effect from 1 January 2014. This rate cut is worth &euro;125 annually in gross terms to most public servants, with persons taxed at the standard rate enjoying the greater gain in terms of take-home pay.</p></reply>

Instead, and where required, the amount of pension before application of the PAO is made public.

The main responsibility for protection of worker health and safety lies with employers. Each employer has a legal duty to ensure the safety, health and welfare at work of their staff. This applies to the betting industry no less than any other sector.</p><p>  The principles of prevention and of risk-based assessment are fundamental to all legislation dealing with health and safety at work in Ireland. Section 19 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 requires an employer to produce a written risk assessment and safety statement that must be communicated, in an understandable form, to relevant employees.</p><p>  In assessing risk, a lone worker, particularly in a workplace where there is exposure to large amounts of cash, could be considered to be potentially at greater risk with regard to their personal safety.  A risk assessment related to such workplaces would be expected to identify any potential hazards in that regard, and recommend appropriate controls to mitigate the risk.</p><p>  I should also point to the overall regulatory environment covering the betting industry &ndash; notably the licensing provisions of the Betting Act 1931, which comes under the responsibility of the Minister for Finance &ndash; as well as the comprehensive new licensing and regulatory framework which will henceforth cover gambling, along with land-based betting, that is being addressed by the Minister for Justice and Equality in the preparation of the Gambling Control Bill.</p></reply>

Some companies, depending on their requirements and their sector would have visited Dublin and Cork on the same itinerary or at different stages and over a number of itineraries whilst their due diligence in respect of site location was on-going.  Some would have visited Dublin only or Cork only.  At present, IDA Ireland does not have a tool which could manipulate a data base into providing an instant cross reference of site visits for companies that have visited both Dublin and Cork. </p><p>It must be acknowledged that some regional locations outside of Dublin and the main urban centres already facilitate the presence of a large number of multinational companies who have invested over the years, span multiple sectors and employ significant amounts of people.  A significant opportunity for regional locations is in respect of the existing client base and potential further investment opportunities from same.  Approximately 70% of all FDI investments won by IDA Ireland is from the existing client base.  I should also point out that 72,500 people, roughly 44% of the total employment in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s base of companies including those that were former clients of Shannon Development, are located outside of Dublin and Cork. </p><p>Under the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are working with my Department to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of enterprise agencies and the other regional stakeholders in building enterprise based on sustainable competitive advantage of the region.  This exercise will complement the in-depth analysis of our FDI strategy which is currently being undertaken by Forf&aacute;s and which will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI and any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid Rules, which will come into effect on 1 July 2014.  The results of these two exercises will form the basis of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy from 2015 onwards.</p><p><b>Table showing the number of IDA Ireland sponsored site visits on a county by county

The advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland. A county by county panel with over 2000 participating accountants is in place and their details are available on . Borrowers are free to choose their own advisor from this panel and the lender will pay &euro;250 to the accountant of the borrower&rsquo;s choice for the provision of this independent financial advice. </p><p>The Central Bank collates the information relating to the number of borrowers who have availed of the independent financial advice service on a quarterly basis commencing in Quarter 1 2013. The data supplied does not relate exactly to the reporting period as there will be delays between the time the lender makes the long-term resolution offer to the borrower, the meeting with the accountant and the receipt by the lender of the invoice. </p><p>A review of the independent financial advice element of the Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service was undertaken in 2013 to ensure that the service is meeting its objectives. A group comprising representatives from the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Protection was established to oversee the review. The review report has been considered by the Mortgage Arrears Implementation Steering Group and the Cabinet Committee on Mortgage Arrears and Credit Availability.</p><p>The key recommendations in the review report relate to increasing awareness among borrowers through the provision of clear and unambiguous information about the service and to increase the scope of the advice to include advice on the other mortgage debt resolution options that are now available for borrowers, so that they can fully assess their options. In that context the report recommends that consideration be given to increasing the funding for the financial advice from &euro;250 to &euro;500.</p><p>A stakeholder seminar was held in January 2014 to which all stakeholders were invited to discuss the recommendations of the review. An implementation plan has been prepared and discussions have commenced with the relevant stakeholders to progress the recommendations.  </p><p>It is envisaged that the service will continue to be funded by the lenders and that the recommended changes to the service will be in place by the end of Quarter 2 2014.</p><p>Usage details of the services are set out in the table below.</p><p><b>Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Helpline Calls</th><th><div>Visits to Keepingyourhome.ie<br /><br />website </div></th><th><div>Financial Advice Service ( invoices received by lenders from accountants)</div></th></tr><tr><td>August 2012</td><td><div>295</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>September 2012</td><td><div>397</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>October 2012</td><td><div>459</div></td><td><div>*34,157</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>November 2012</td><td><div>410</div></td><td><div>6,434</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>December 2012</td><td><div>259</div></td><td><div>8,150</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>January 2013</td><td><div>577</div></td><td><div>9,955</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>February 2013</td><td><div>529</div></td><td><div>10,073</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>March 2013</td><td><div>737</div></td><td><div>12,243</div></td><td><div>54</div></td></tr><tr><td>April 2013</td><td><div>973</div></td><td><div>17,813</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>May 2013</td><td><div>610</div></td><td><div>9,463</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>June 2013</td><td><div>504</div></td><td><div>10,194</div></td><td><div>52</div></td></tr><tr><td>July 2013</td><td><div>473</div></td><td><div>9,632</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>August 2013</td><td><div>590</div></td><td><div>12,621</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>September 2013</td><td><div>521</div></td><td><div>8,438</div></td><td><div>72</div></td></tr><tr><td>October 2013</td><td><div>641</div></td><td><div>12,815</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>November 2013  </td><td><div>440</div></td><td><div>10,029</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>December 2013</td><td><div>385</div></td><td><div>10,063</div></td><td><div>119</div></td></tr><tr><td>January 2014</td><td><div>665</div></td><td><div>10,387</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>February 2014</td><td><div>749</div></td><td><div>12,239</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>March 2014</td><td><div>608</div></td><td><div>11,817</div></td><td><div>**</div></td></tr><tr><td>April 2014 (to end April 4th)</td><td><div>123</div></td><td><div>3,074</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td><div>10,945</div></td><td><div>222,267</div></td><td><div>297 </div></td></tr></table></p><p>*Covers the period June 2012 to October 2012</p><p>** Not yet available from the Central Bank</p></reply>

It provides a direct monthly financial incentive to employers who recruit employees from those who are long-term unemployed.  The incentive is payable, on a monthly basis, over a two year period if the employee is retained in full-time employment for two years.  The value of the aggregate monthly payments is &euro;7,500 for employing a jobseeker 12 to 24 months on the live register and &euro;10,000 if the jobseeker was on the live register for over 24 months.  At the end of March 2014, payments under the JobsPlus scheme had been made in respect of 1,874 new jobs with expenditure totalling &euro;2.83 million to date.  Some 60% of beneficiaries to date were previously over 24 months on the live register.  </p><p>  Pathways to Work sets out the Government&rsquo;s policy direction on labour market activation and is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to get Ireland working again.  The strategy outlined in Pathways is devised to ensure new job opportunities are made available to people on the live register with particular focus  on the longer term unemployed.  JobsPlus is exclusively targeted at this cohort.  While consideration will be given to expanding the scheme and possibly broadening the range of qualifying payments, I do not consider that it would be justified to open the scheme to farmers who are working and in receipt of a farm assist payment.  Given the pressure on resources, I believe it is justified to continue to maintain priority on longer term jobseekers, in line with the commitments in Pathways to Work.</p></reply>

Article 192 of SI 142 of 2007 provides a number of options for payment, including through a post office, by cheque or by direct credit transfer to a financial institution. </p><p>The vast majority of jobseeker payments are made through the post office, although people working on a casual or part-time basis are paid by cheque for administrative reasons.  There are other exceptions, including for instance those undertaking a course of study under the back to education allowance (BTEA) or partaking of an internship under the work placement programme (WPP) or national internship programme (JobBridge), where they may have difficulty accessing the post office during normal working hours and who may, if they wish, opt for their payment to be paid directly into a financial institution.</p><p>In January 2014, new provisions were introduced for older people who have left work before reaching the State Pension age of 66 and who wish to claim a jobseeker's payment.  As a result, those aged 62 or over are no longer subject to the penalty rate provisions if they do not wish to engage in the Department&rsquo;s activation process for jobseekers.  They also have a more relaxed signing regime and may, if they so wish, have their payments made by EFT into an account in a financial institution. </p><p>This measure recognises the abolition of the State Pension Transition (SPT) for new entrants from January 2014 and has been introduced to ease the transition until they become eligible for a State Pension on their 66<sup>th</sup>birthday.  The introduction of these new arrangements for older jobseekers has been necessary in order to prioritise scarce resources.  </p><p>Those under age 62 continue to be subject to the full conditionality of the jobseeker schemes, including mandatory engagement in the activation process, and consequently no letters in relation to the above have issued to people under 30 years of age, as there has been no change to their signing and payment arrangements.</p></reply>

The Strategy sets out a roadmap for payment developments over the coming years.  The Strategy aims to facilitate greater use of electronic payments and to remove the limits that cash payments impose on our clients in terms of making onward financial transactions and availing of discounted prices online while also continuing to serve those who are more vulnerable in our society.    </p><p>  The Department is very conscious of the need to ensure that fraud controls are not diminished when implementing change. In achieving an electronic payments environment, the Department will ensure its payment delivery approaches complement and enhance its scheme and payment control functions.  In this regard, the Department proposes to adopt a risk-based approach to all payments, including those made to jobseekers,  in progressively converting to electronic payments.  The rollout and migration of electronic payments will be based on appropriate assessment of risk for the client cohorts involved. It will build on existing control attributes and security. The Department will seek to reassess and evaluate the associated risks and ensure that both preventative point of entry controls and detection systems are modified to securely accommodate the Payment Strategy.  This approach will also be used to identify and combat any trends that are emerging in the financial services sector generally and in instances of fraudulent applications or unusual trends in payments.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the Department does not intend migrating higher risk clients to an electronic payment until appropriate and robust measures are defined and fully implemented to mitigate any potential for increased risk of fraud within an electronic payments environment.  The Department is actively considering possibilities in this regard.</p><p>  Given the above considerations, the figure requested by the Deputy is not available.</p></reply>

The Arts Council is the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts.  Under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is a statutorily independent body, funded by my Department and independent in its day-to-day operations, and I have no role to play in relation to its funding decisions. Funding decisions for local festivals, musical and dramatic productions, are a matter for the Arts Council and full information on those decisions is made available on its website .</p><p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to expanding private support of the arts. To achieve this, my Department introduced a philanthropy scheme in 2012 and 2013, both of which have helped to encourage arts organisations to build partnerships with potential sponsors. In addition, the Arts Council introduced the RAISE programme, which is working to significantly enhance fund-raising skills in ten arts organisations with a view to reducing the sector&rsquo;s dependency on funding from the taxpayer and moving it more towards the business sector. </p><p>A small capital grants scheme to encourage philanthropy has been introduced by my Department for 2014 with an overall allocation of &euro;300,000. The maximum allocation per project will be &euro;10,000, with up to 70% of the cost of the project to be funded by my Department and the balance of 30% to be funded from the project's own resources, or philanthropic sources, or a mixture of both.  The 2014 scheme is a further indication of the ongoing work being done to support the development of a culture of philanthropy in the arts sector.</p><p>Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta has also put in place a seed fund <font color="#2F2F2F">aimed at developing strategic arts initiatives in the Gaeltacht.

My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season, provided that an agreement is reached with them.   </p><p>Lattins Bog, also known as Mouds North Bog, in County Kildare has been identified as a potential relocation site for turf cutters from Mouds Bog special area of conservation.  Bord na M&oacute;na has undertaken a full suitability assessment for the site and my Department has provided a copy of the assessment report to the Secretary of the Committee of the Kildare Turf Cutters Association. This report illustrates that 19 turf cutters could be accommodated on the site. Bord na M&oacute;na, in consultation with the Department, is investigating the potential for the accommodation of additional turf cutters on the site.</p><p>Relocation is a very complex process in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, the infrastructure and drainage works required, establishing the number of turf cutters who can be accommodated on the site, the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements. </p><p>A payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum is available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to applicants while awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs. </p><p>The <i>Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Areas,</i>which is available to download from my Department&rsquo;s website at <b><i><font color="#0082BF"></font></i></b>, provides detail on future arrangements regarding turf cutting on each of the 75 raised bog natural heritage areas. My Department has written to all property holders who could be identified in relation to the natural heritage area raised bogs to inform them of the results of the review including arrangements for obtaining permits to continue cutting and or compensation. The Department has also written to all contractors that have been identified as being affected by the review explaining future arrangements for turf cutting on these sites In addition, notices outlining the outcome of the review were placed in local papers.</p><p>Carbury Bog natural heritage area in County Kildare is one of the natural heritage areas which is to be conserved. In the case of this bog, the review envisages the cessation of turf cutting on the site by 1 January 2017 to preserve its conservation value. Turf cutting may continue on the bog until that date, on plots that have been cut in the five year period prior to the Government decision of the 14<sup>th</sup>January, 2014 on the<i></i>review.  <i></i></p><p>To ensure that cutting does not intensify over the next 3 years, owners of plots or of turbary rights who have cut over the past 5 years must obtain a permit to cut from my Department. Contractors will also be obliged to obtain permits.  </p><p>The review also envisages the complete or partial de-designation of 46 existing natural heritage areas where turf cutting may continue into the future. In these de-designation cases, it will not be necessary for individuals to seek consent to cut turf. Hodgestown Bog natural heritage area in County Kildare is one of these de-designation cases.</p><p>Any turf cutter required to cease turf cutting on a natural heritage area is being offered compensatory measures similar to those available to turf cutters from raised bog special areas of conservation. Such compensation will be available to qualifying persons with effect from 2014.</p></reply>

Details can be accessed at .</p><p>A key priority for the Government in the <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2014</i>is the conservation, development and presentation of the arts, heritage and Gaeltacht sectors so as to help make a significant contribution to supporting economic recovery and in sustaining enterprise and job creation across the country. This is achieved through direct support from my Department and the bodies funded from my Department's Vote Group and, in particular, through promoting cultural tourism.</p><p>In 2014, there are a number of specific initiatives underway in my Department in relation to the built heritage which will have positive employment benefits. I recently approved funding of almost &euro;5 million from the Government&rsquo;s Capital Stimulus Programme under the Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme for the repair and conservation of 618 structures protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012. It is anticipated that these projects, with a combined value of &euro;21 million, will unlock &euro;16 million in private funds and support significant employment in the conservation and construction industries and in specialist trades. In tandem with this, my Department is also operating a pilot Traditional Skills Training Programme, in conjunction with four local authorities, to enhance skillsets in built heritage conservation, thus improving employment prospects for trainees. The creation of approximately 270 high-end construction jobs, many of which are specialist positions, will be provided for through the major renovation project of the historic wings of the National Gallery of Ireland.</p><p>With particular reference to historic sites, the protection and promotion of our national heritage assets has a significant role in generating employment through cultural and heritage tourism, through direct employment in built heritage conservation, repair and maintenance, as well as through related employment opportunities in the retail, catering, accommodation and construction sectors. </p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, has also recently awarded funding of &euro;0.652m to 144 heritage projects across the country this year under its Heritage Management Grants Programme. </p><p>In addition, my Department is concluding the pilot of a heritage-led urban regeneration scheme, the <i>Historic Towns Initiative</i>, in Youghal, Westport and Listowel, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Heritage Council and the relevant local authorities.  This initiative aims both to conserve heritage assets and to enhance the visitor experience. </p><p>I have also allocated over &euro;56 million in funding for 2014 to the Arts Council, which in turn will provide funding to over 500 individual artists and 870 organisations across a range of arts venues, festivals, arts organisations and touring initiatives. This supports tens of thousands of direct and indirect jobs in Ireland and recognises the important role the arts play in innovation and expression, as well as job creation and economic recovery in 2014.</p><p>My Department is also committed in its continuing support of the Irish Film and Audiovisual Industry. This sector has contributed over &euro;168 million to the Irish economy and has witnessed an increase of 42% since 2011.  2014 will see this support continue, with over &euro;13 million earmarked for investment in over 40 significant projects, creating up to 800 jobs in the audiovisual production sector alone.</p><p>My Department continues to advance the 1916 Commemoration and Decade of Centenaries programmes, including a range of capital projects, which will directly and indirectly support job creation, as well as cultural tourism. The national programme marking the anniversary of Brian Bor&uacute; and the Battle of Clontarf is also being supported.</p><p>In addition, as part of the Action Plan for Jobs, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, which is funded from my Department's Vote Group, aims to create 520 new jobs and retain 7,000 existing jobs in the Gaeltacht area by supporting developments in the Life Sciences, Food and Business Support Services and Creative Enterprises sectors and providing ongoing support for community development initiatives. My Department also supports a range of Irish language arts, publishing, creative writing, training and other schemes, as well as festivals and drama companies through Foras na Gaeilge.</p><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department is determined to support and increase employment across the arts, heritage and Gaeltacht sectors. My Department is actively working to maintain existing jobs and explore new opportunities that arise so as to contribute to the next phase of our economic development.</p></reply>

In that regard, I recently approved in principle funding of almost &euro;5 million under the Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme for the repair and conservation of 618 structures protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000-2012. These structures were assessed by the local authorities based on criteria set out by my Department, including the significance of the structure, the employment benefits of the project, and the medium to long-term effectiveness of the proposed works in eliminating risks and preventing further deterioration of the structures.   In addition, my Department often receives information relating to existing or potential risks to protected structures, sites and monuments from local authorities, the Heritage Council, heritage-based NGOs and members of the public. </p><p>  Part IV of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012 provides for the protection of the architectural heritage. The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures. Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p></reply>

In 2014, &euro;46,000 has been allocated towards these projects to progress them towards report and/or publication stage. The information and knowledge gleaned from such activities makes a significant contribution to our understanding of some of our most important monuments and provides a valuable resource for the professional and educational sectors.  In that regard, my Department and the Office of Public Works, which operates visitor services at certain national monuments around the country, are in ongoing contact with a view to keeping visitor service guides informed of the results of the latest research relevant to their particular site.</p><p>  My Department also provides funding towards grant support for archaeological excavations, which contributes to the generation of knowledge relating to our national heritage that can then be utilised for tourism-related purposes. The Irish National Strategic Archaeological Research Programme is an archaeological research grant, administered by the Heritage Council which was established in 2008 to address a bottleneck in the collation, refinement and dissemination of the vast archaeological resource which had emerged over the previous 5-10 years. A subvention is also made annually to the Royal Irish Academy for excavation research and post excavation research projects, mainly by archaeologists and academics. It produces some very important results for prime tourism locations with Knowth and Newgrange among the excavations funded in past years.</p></reply>

The market has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in each County including Counties Kerry and Westmeath can be found on a number of websites, including the websites of individual commercial operators.</p><p>  I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in 33 locations in County Kerry, and in 19 locations in County Westmeath, before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss this further with the Deputies.  I would point out that the Local Authority has a strong role to play in facilitating the roll-out of the necessary infrastructure to help enable service availability throughout the Country. In the case of County Kerry, I note that the County Development Plan recommends against siting a mast within 1km of dwellings. I understand that this is contributing to difficulties in providing broadband and telecommunications services generally in the county.</p><p>  During the preparation of the Next Generation Broadband Task force report, which concluded its deliberations in 2012, service providers noted the importance of planning and consent processes in facilitating the roll out of infrastructure to support the provision of telecommunications services. The Government's National Broadband Plan which I subsequently published, commits to addressing barriers to deployment in order to maximise investment by the commercial sector and assist in enhancing the quality of services. Local Authorities have an important role to play in this regard, particularly in facilitating the provision of infrastructure that supports wireless and fixed line services. </p><p>  The National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p> - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p> - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. </p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA). Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing. The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines. When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country. I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country.  This map will outline exactly the type of broadband available in Counties Kerry and Westmeath. </p><p>  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

Also, as is the case with all energy developments currently, each offshore renewable energy project must complete an Environmental Impact Assessment.</p><p>  As Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I am charged with developing an energy policy that allows Ireland to realise the potential of our abundant, indigenous, clean energy resources and ensures that Ireland reaps the economic benefits of any such development. I am also very aware of the overarching importance of protecting our marine environment. Realising the economic potential of offshore renewable energy can only be achieved if offshore developments do not adversely impact on our rich marine environment.  The Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), which I published in February, provides the mechanism through which action across Government Departments and Agencies to support the development of offshore renewable electricity generation can be fully coordinated in areas such as environmental monitoring and protection, research and development, consenting procedures, infrastructure requirements and enterprise development.</p><p>  The OREDP identifies export as the route to market for offshore wind. I recently stated, with regret, that it has not been possible at this time to conclude an Inter-Governmental Agreement as envisaged in the Memorandum of Understanding I signed with the the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change in January 2013. Economic analysis undertaken by my officials clearly indicates that under agreed policy and regulatory conditions, renewable energy trading would deliver significant economic benefits to Ireland and the UK, and would also be attractive to developers. However, renewable energy trading has to be designed to work. Based on further discussions between my officials and the Department of Energy and Climate Change in the UK since the Summit in early March, I am confirmed in the view that given the complexities involved, and key decisions yet to be taken by the UK, delivery by 2020 is not now a realistic proposition. However I believe that in the context of a European Internal Market and greater integration, greater trade in energy between Britain and Ireland is inevitable in the post 2020 scenario.</p></reply>

The Act provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. It also assigns responsibility for the independent economic regulation of Irish Water to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) .     </p><p>  Domestic water charges will commence with effect from 1 October 2014 and Irish Water will issue the first bills to domestic customers from January 2015. The approach to charging will be outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan to be submitted by it to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act.  The CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plan which will set the approaches to charging domestic and non-domestic customers.   </p><p>  It is understood that t he CER is commencing its public consultation on the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs for both metered and unmetered properties and the approach it is proposing for non-domestic tariffs. The CER will announce its decision on the approved water  charges plan, which will include details of the levels of metered, assessed and standing charges, in August 2014. </p><p>  In making its decision on the approval or otherwise of the first water charges plan, the CER will take into account the decisions made by Government on the funding model for Irish Water, including the funding available for any proposed affordability measures. The Government has committed to the provision of a free allowance, above which charging based on usage would apply. The free allowance and the level of funding to be provided by the Government to Irish Water will have a strong bearing on the net charges to be met by households. Consequently, decisions on these matters will provide greater visibility on the expected level of charges in advance of the final determination of all aspects of the water charges plan by the CER.   </p><p>  The Government has given initial consideration to approaches proposed by me, as Minister, and will further consider these matters over the coming weeks.     </p><p>  Under the European Union (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied is wholesome and clean. Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health, and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with these regulations. In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in these Regulations, the water supplier will investigate the cause and, in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health may exist, the Health Service Executive, ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken. </p><p>  The 2013 Act requires the CER to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of the customers of Irish Water. This is similar to the CER&rsquo;s statutory role in respect of the gas and electricity sectors. I fully expect that the CER will consider compliance with statutory standards by Irish Water in the discharge of its functions.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-17a.454.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041700061#WRQ01200"><p>Under Section 10 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 a waiver from liability can arise for properties located in developments prescribed on a list made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government where the Minister is satisfied that the developments on the list are incomplete to a substantial extent, having regard to the condition of public infrastructure and amenities, including access, water services, public lighting and amenity areas. An exemption from the Local Property Tax applies to developments listed in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013. The list of unfinished housing developments eligible for the exemption was compiled by local authorities utilising the categorisation employed for the purposes of the National Housing Survey 2012. The survey was carried out over the course of summer 2012 by my Department in conjunction with local authorities and the Housing Agency. </p><p>Only developments that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013.  </p><p>The objective is to eliminate , to the greatest extent possible, the need for Local Property Tax waivers in respect of Unfinished Housing Developments as soon as possible and a number of approaches, as outlined below, have been adopted towards achieving this objective.   </p><p>The development of Site Resolution Plans (SRPs), agreed between residents, developers, funders and local authority personnel for the finalisation of works on site to render estates as habitable as possible, have been pivotal in resolving a large number of estates. In the 2013 National Housing Survey, of the 1,811 estates inspected, there were 607 in some stage of SRPs. Specifically, 281 were agreed and ready for implementation, 213 had commenced while 113 had been completed. I believe that a continuation of this collaborative approach serves the best interests of all concerned and is an effective tool in the resolution process.   </p><p>The Public Safety Initiative (PSI), which was launched in March 2011, also provided funding to address immediate public safety issues in unfinished housing developments.  The types of works that have been approved to date under the PSI include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites. <font color="#FF0000"> </font>Under the PSI, my Department has made allocations totalling &euro;4.5m to local authorities from the funding made available. To date, &euro;3.26m has been drawn down. </p><p>To assist further in addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments, Budget 2014 contained a special provision, in the form of a targeted &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund (SRF). The SRF has been proposed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer/owner/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers. It is envisaged that the SRF should be particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax waiver, as in a seriously problematic condition. I expect that my Department will be in a position to finalise its consideration of the SRF applications in the very near future. I anticipate that the SRF will enable very substantial progress to be made in resolving as many of the remaining unfinished developments as possible. </p><p>The Report, Resolving Unfinished Housing Developments: Annual Progress Report on Actions to Address Unfinished Housing Developments, published in November 2013, is available on the Housing Agency website, at, and appends a Summary Report of the 2013 National Housing Development Survey.<i></i>The key findings of the survey include: a 56% decrease in the number of remaining unfinished developments and a 72% decrease in the number of vacant units since 2010. </p><p>Through the above approaches, supported by the findings of the 2013 National Housing Development Survey, the general trend is towards improvement in the conditions of such developments and the situation should improve further over the lifetime of the SRF. There are no plans to revise the list of developments included in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013, either by removing or adding developments to it, at this time.</p></reply>

The SRF is designed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer/owner/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers. It is envisaged that the SRF should be particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax waiver, as in a seriously problematic condition.</p><p>  My Department is currently evaluating SRF applications from local authorities in accordance with the specified criteria. I understand that an application for funding under the SRF was received in respect of the development in question, to which a Local Property Tax waiver applies. I am conscious of the limited time available to complete SRF projects within the current year and, while I am not currently in a position to confirm whether the application in respect of the development in question will be successful, I expect that my Department will be in a position to finalise its consideration of the matter in the very near future.</p><p>  I hope that the SRF will enable very substantial progress to be made in resolving as many of the remaining unfinished developments as possible. </p></reply>

There was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights. The situation has not changed since 2011 and, as I have indicated in my replies to previous Parliamentary Questions on the subject of upward only rent review clauses, there are no plans to re-examine the decision which was taken in 2011.</p></reply>

The person concerned is the subject of a Deportation Order, following a comprehensive and thorough examination of her asylum claim.<blockquote><i>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person referred to is the subject of a Deportation Order and therefore has no entitlement to residency in the State.</i><br /><br /><i>The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside the State.</i><br /><br /><i>The enforcement of the Deportation Order remains an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</i><br /><br /><i>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</i></blockquote></p></reply>

I am informed by the Garda authorities that prior to a zone being used for conducting monitoring sessions, a number of speed surveys are carried out to establish baseline driver behaviour within the zone against which any changes in driver behaviour can be determined. Speed surveys are then carried out at regular intervals within these zones to track any changes in driver behaviour and to monitor compliance with speed limits within these zones.  Each survey session counts the free speed of vehicles under 5 categories; cars; single-decker buses; double-decker buses; rigid vehicles; and articulated vehicles.</p></reply>

The EAG's report was accepted by Government in 1995.  </p><p>In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA).  In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces.  This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct.  Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers.  </p><p>In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994.  A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government's objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.</p><p>  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:-</p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service. </p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.</p><p>- Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.</p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks.  A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter.  In accordance with normal procedures the Association's claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.</p></reply>

National legislation, namely the Disease of Animals (Carriage of Cattle by Sea) Order, 1996 (SI No 17 of 1996), requires that a ship&rsquo;s classification certificate must be issued by a classification society which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS). Certification by a member of IACS provides a higher level of confidence that the certification is reliable. </p><p>  EU Council Regulation (EC) No. 1/2005 on animal transport provides for stricter rules to be applied by member states than those set down at EU level. My Department has availed of this provision and, therefore, the current Irish legislation relating to the approval of ships for livestock transport sets higher standards than those which apply generally in the EU. I believe this approach is justified for animal welfare reasons and because it reflects the nature of the shipping routes from this island and the importance that we attach both to animal welfare and the continuation of the live export trade to all available markets.</p></reply>

The aid substantially covered the cost of transport into the country, thus reducing the cost to farmers of a bale of hay by approximately one third.</p><p>  While I initially allocated a sum of &euro;1 million, it quickly became apparent that a larger allocation would be necessary and I then increased the budget to &euro;2 million. I can confirm that total expenditure is expected to be in the region of &euro;2.8 million. </p><p>  In excess of 18,000 farmers benefited under the Imported Fodder Transport Scheme, under which, to date, payments worth some &euro;2.5 million have issued. </p><p>  While the Scheme operated through the co-operatives, marts and other approved agencies, the actual beneficiaries are the individual farmers and primary producers who needed urgent supplies of feed. Operating the scheme in this manner was the quickest and most effective way of getting the fodder to those who needed it. It will be appreciated that Data Protection precludes the publication of details of individual beneficiaries.</p><p>  Of the 79 different entities which participated in the Scheme, to date, 61 have been fully processed and paid in full, with a further 8 having received a 75% advance payment. The balancing payment will issue to these entities once all outstanding issues are resolved. These have been contacted directly and are working with my Department to resolve the outstanding issues.</p></reply>

The agreement reached on the Multiannual Financial Framework provides for a total allocation of EU funding of &euro;2.19 billion (&euro;313m per annum over 7 years) to Ireland for a new RDP.  &euro;2.037 billion of the EU funding is allocated to measures to be delivered via the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, with the remainder allocated to LEADER funding which is administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  The Government has shown its commitment to a strategic investment in Rural Ireland and the agri-food sector by providing matching National Exchequer funding at the rate of 46% to supplement the &euro;2.037 billion EU allocation.  In addition to this money, there is also an additional allocation from the current RDP 2007-2013 to be spent in 2014 and 2015.  When taken in conjunction with the allocation of funding for LEADER measures, this represents a fund of over &euro;4 billion for investment in rural development measures in the period to 2020.</p><p>  The recently published consultation document on the new RDP sets out a range of proposed measures for inclusion.</p><p>  The main areas proposed for support in the new RDP are:</p><p>- a substantial new agri-environment/climate scheme (GLAS), which will build on the progress made under REPS and AEOS. This will provide for a maximum payment of &euro;5,000 for up to 50,000 farmers, and a further payment of up to &euro;2,000 for a limited number of farmers who take on particularly challenging actions, </p><p>- continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now Areas of Natural Constraint), to the tune of about &euro;195 million per year, </p><p>- incentives for on-farm capital investment (&euro;290 million outlined in the consultation document), </p><p>- knowledge transfer and innovation measures, aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions, including in the beef and sheep sectors (estimated at &euro;20m per annum in the consultation document when fully up and running), </p><p>- a beef data and genomics measure worth up to &euro;52 million per year aimed at improving the genetic quality of the beef herd, and</p><p>-  other supports aimed at collaborative farming, artisan producers, organic farming, etc.</p><p>  The annual expenditure for each proposed measure over the lifetime of the new RDP will be subject to the normal annual budgetary procedure. </p><p>  The findings from the recent consultation process are currently feeding into the ongoing design work in my Department. The final decisions have not yet been made on the measures to be included in the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020, and the precise allocation of funding is being developed as part of the RDP design process.</p></reply>

The work of the voluntary youth work sector, in the provision of these services, has a significant contribution to make to the Government&rsquo;s jobs agenda including the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work and the implementation of the Youth Guarantee in Ireland.  Many youth organisations are working closely with relevant Government Departments and delivering measures to implement the Guarantee for young unemployed people.  My Department, in consultation with the youth sector, has developed a &lsquo;Youth Employability Initiative&rsquo; which involves the expansion of proven youth work initiatives that increase the employability of marginalised young people in the 15 to 24 age group.  It aims to target the hardest to reach young people who are at risk of becoming NEET (i.e. not in employment, education or training) for intensive support to prevent unemployment.  The development and expansion of the Youth Employability Initiative is a priority for me, should additional resources become available to my Department for youth services.  In this regard, my Department continues to make efforts to secure the necessary resources for the initiative including exploring the potential of the initiative for ESF funding and is liaising with the relevant Government Departments in this regard.  My Department will develop a new Youth Strategy in 2014.  This Strategy will have its basis in the Children and Young Person&rsquo;s Policy Framework - Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures which is being launched this week.  The Youth Strategy will focus on ensuring greater coordination in policy and provision across Government for young people aged 10 &ndash; 24 years and will aim to be responsive to current and emerging issues such as youth employment.  My Department continues to work closely with the Departments of Education and Skills, Social Protection and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to identify in what ways, the youth sector can contribute to shared policy objectives to address youth employment and the Youth Guarantee and in the context of the Action Plan for Jobs.</p></reply>

As part of this ongoing work, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population and on the environment is being conducted by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department.  This review will be completed by December 2014.  The Department is also collaborating in a University College Cork-led research project, "Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth" (FACCT).  The study will consider the impact of changes on the oral health of children, following policy decisions relating to toothpaste use by infants and young children made in 2002 and the reduction in the level of fluoridation in drinking water introduced in 2007.  In addition, a study on general and oral health findings in adults linked to the duration of exposure to fluoridated water as part of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA) has commenced its pilot phase.</p></reply>

Under the legislation, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has statutory responsibility for establishing and maintaining a list of interchangeable medical products.  In doing so, the IMB is required to have regard to a comprehensive set of qualifying conditions, all of which must be complied with before a decision is taken to make a medicinal product interchangeable.  In addition, Section 13 of the Act provides that where a branded interchangeable product is prescribed for a patient and the prescriber is satisfied that the medicinal product, should for clinical reasons, be exempted from substitution, the prescriber shall write 'Do not Substitute' on the prescription.  In these cases, the pharmacist must dispense what is written on the prescription, i.e. is not permitted to substitute with any product in the same group of interchangeable products.  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable products.  It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price the Health Service Executive (HSE) will reimburse to pharmacists for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine's prices.</p><p>  Eligible patients using State drug schemes like the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme will not face any additional costs for products prices at or below the reference price.  If a patient would like to receive a particular brand that costs more than the reference price then the patient will have to pay the additional cost of that product.  In cases where substitution is prohibited for clinical reasons, patients will not face any additional costs if the prescribed product costs more than the reference price.  The HSE is responsible for the administration of the primary care schemes, therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

This study is welcome as it provides comprehensive information on the impact of stroke for survivors and their carers.</p><p>  Many developments in cardiac care have been brought about through various means including the National Cardiovascular Health Policy.  This policy named &ldquo;Changing Cardiovascular Health&rdquo; covers from 2010 to 2019.  It provides an integrated and quality assured approach for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiovascular disease including stroke.  Since 2010, significant improvements have been made with regard to access to acute treatments for coronary heart disease as well as the development of stroke units across the country.  As Minister for Health, I was pleased to outline these at the launch of the Irish Heart Foundation Stroke day on 11th April last week.</p><p>  Key elements of Stroke care now available include: New and existing stroke units provided with additional therapy, nursing and consultant posts; The Clinical Programme for Stroke continues its work to develop and disseminate care pathways and clinical protocols; A national 24/7 access to safe stroke thrombolysis through service development, telemedicine and training is already available in many hospitals with access protocols agreed for others; Ambulance access protocols are being developed by the Stroke Programme working in partnership with national ambulance service to agree and implement ambulance access protocols.  Thrombolysis is now available to all acute hospitals admitting stroke patients and 9.5% of patients are being thrombolysed.  This rate compares will with the best European figures and exceeds our target 7.5%.</p><p>  The Stroke Programme estimates that the number of people with enduring disabilities as a result of stroke has decreased as the percentage of patients with stroke discharged from acute hospitals to nursing homes has dropped from 17.3% in 2009 to 14.5% in 2012.  This is a positive outcome.  The rapid increase in access to thrombolysis, from 3.3% in 2008 to 9.5% in 2012, has resulted in better outcomes for patients.  The Stroke Foundation Education programme developed by the Stroke Programme and available to all staff caring for stroke patients is leading to improved patient experience of stroke service provision.  Patients requiring more intensive rehabilitation are referred to the nearest available rehabilitation service, such as the Stroke Rehabilitation Unit, Baggott Street, Dublin Stroke Rehabilitation Unit, Louth County Hospital, Dundalk Hibernian Stroke Rehabilitation Unit, St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital, Phoenix Park Stroke Rehabilitation Unit and St. Finbarr&rsquo;s Hospital, Cork.</p><p>  Stroke rehabilitation can be provided in a number of settings, which range from specialised rehabilitation centres and departments in acute hospitals to outpatient and community settings.  The establishment of managed clinical rehabilitation networks for neurological and prosthetic rehabilitation services in each of the 4 HSE Regions is proposed to facilitate the development of integrated quality rehabilitation services. Currently the only internationally accredited programme of specialist inpatient stroke rehabilitation is delivered at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dublin. However, the Programme&rsquo;s Model of Care outlines that 4 regional hubs, which will have clinical and consultant leadership from a designated specialist in rehabilitation medicine, supporting existing neurologists and specialists in medicine for the elderly, be set up. It will include the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH) as the national hub and will also incorporate the setting up of Specialist Community-Based Rehabilitation Teams.</p><p>  The implementation of the Department of Health&rsquo;s National Policy and Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-rehabilitation Services in Ireland - in collaboration with the National Clinical Programme for Rehabilitation Medicine and its Model of Care - will provide for improved access to and quality of services for all patients requiring rehabilitation and their families.</p><p>  Primary Care also plays an important role in stroke rehabilitation.  The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan 2013 provided for additional funding of &euro;20m to strengthen primary care services (&euro;18.525m for the recruitment of 264.5 primary care team posts and &euro;1.475m to support Community Intervention Team development).  The posts were allocated based on the analysis carried out by the HSE in identifying areas of deprivation and need.  The additional primary care posts includes 72 Public Health Nurses, 40.5 Registered General Nurses, 47.5 Physiotherapists, 52.5 Occupational Therapists and 52 Speech and Language Therapists.</p><p>  As of 6th March 2014, 199.5 posts have been filled or start dates have been agreed.  The HSE is striving to have the remainder of the posts filled as soon as possible in 2014.  Taken together, all these developments show that we have made significant progress in preventing stroke and its complications.</p></reply>

In the interest of probity, the HSE is obliged, irrespective of the age of the person, to ensure that a person's eligibility is correctly recorded in line with the eligibility legislation and the national guidelines.  The HSE aims to ensure that every person who is entitled to the medical card schemes is given the opportunity to avail of their entitlement.</p><p>The current structured processes in operation in PCRS concerning medical and GP visit card applications, reviews and appeals must be supported with a range of documentation, as outlined on the application forms.  Where such supporting documentation is not supplied, or is incomplete, to enable the assessment of an application, in accordance with the National Assessment Guidelines, the HSE will issue correspondence to the applicant, specifying the additional information required to progress the assessment of their application.  Clearly, the processing time for incomplete applications is dependent on the furnishing of the required supporting documentation by the applicant.</p><p>Any medical card holder undergoing a review to renew a medical card, who genuinely engages with the HSE, will not have their entitlement withdrawn before the review is complete, regardless of the expiry date shown on their medical card.  In cases where a decision is made not to grant a medical card, the applicant is informed of the decision and is notified of their right to appeal this decision.  Contact details for the appeals office are provided to them.  Where a person submits an appeal to a decision not to renew a medical card within 21 days of that decision, he/she also retains the medical card or GP visit card until the appeal is decided. </p><p>Towards the end of 2013, the HSE announced a communications campaign designed to raise awareness of the rules governing eligibility for medical cards.  This included providing extra resources to the national Call Centre for public enquiries, a public information campaign through media advertisements, the development of a key new Information Leaflet, improved support on the HSE website, and included wide ranging training for front line staff.  Given, also, that over 40% of the population, or nearly 2 million people, qualify for a medical card or GP visit card, the scale of the administration of the general medical services, GMS, scheme is significant.  Over 700,000 individuals were assessed by the HSE in 2013 and well in excess of 95% of applications were processed within the target of 15 working days. </p><p>The HSE is now completing medical card reviews for approximately 86,000 individuals per month.  It is expected that increased data sharing between Revenue, Department of Social Protection and the HSE has the potential to further reduce the level of documents and information required from families as their eligibility status is reviewed.  In view of the assessment processes involved, I am satisfied that every effort is made to assist, support and facilitate persons undergoing review and in the most timely fashion. </p><p>Each week the HSE publishes the turnaround time for medical card processing and this data is available on the Primary Care Reimbursement Services website: .</p></reply>

Under the Scheme, applicants contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% of the value of any assets per annum towards their cost of care.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual's assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is disregarded from the financial assessment.  Applicants, therefore, retain at least 20% of their income.  However, it should be noted that the Scheme also provides for a minimum retained threshold.  This ensures that applicants retain at least 20% of the maximum amount of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). Applicants are free to spend this retained income as they wish.  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme covers the cost of the standard components of residential care, which are:</p><p>- nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person,</p><p>- bed and board,</p><p>- basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living, and</p><p>- laundry service.</p><p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drugs Payments Scheme, is unaffected by participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or  residence in a nursing home.  Incontinence wear, where required, is provided free of charge by the HSE to all Nursing Homes Support Scheme residents that possess a Medical Card.</p><p>  In determining the services covered by the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, it was considered very important that the resident and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice.  For this reason, goods and services that are already available under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.  Part 8 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract with each resident within one month of their admission.  This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged.  Residents should not be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.</p></reply>

Due to the need to focus the limited funding available on the repair and strengthening of the road network, it has been necessary to curtail the Strategic Roads Grants Scheme for the moment. There is therefore no commitment in place to provide grant funding towards the cost of construction for this project.</p><p>  It is important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement the resources of Councils. It is, therefore, open to Cork County Council to fund this project from its own resources.</p></reply>

The requirements for vehicles to be used in driving tests are set at EU rather than national level, under section 5.2 of Annex II to Directive 2006/126/EC, as amended by Directive 2012/36/EU.  The EU standards are minima.  Member States may choose more stringent criteria, but not less stringent criteria.  In all of the categories mentioned above, the EU legislation explicitly requires that the vehicle used in the test have ABS.  Member States do not therefore have the option to choose otherwise.</p></reply>

Works on roads such as the L3018 are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.</p><p>  The Department has allocated a total of &euro;145 million to local authorities for the Restoration Improvement Grant Programme (RI) in 2014. Of this figure a total of &euro;6.55 million has been allocated to Kerry County Council. The selection and prioritisation of works to be undertaken, taking into account available grant funding, is a matter for the local authority. Local authorities do have flexibility in relation to re-prioritising RI schemes as necessary.</p><p>  It is, therefore, open to Kerry County Council to re-prioritise its RI programme to include these schemes, to fund works from its Discretionary Grant or to progress such projects through its own resources.</p></reply>

The most recent CSO Quarterly National Household Survey, in February, reported that seasonally adjusted employment among accommodation and food providers increased by 17,300 to 137,100 from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the equivalent period in 2013.  That is an increase of 14.4% in the year to  Quarter 4 2013. The CSO does not provide a county breakdown of statistics and these are not compiled separately by my Department or F&aacute;ilte Ireland. I am not, therefore, in a position to provide a breakdown of tourism jobs by county for the South East and Munster as requested. In addition to the 137,100 jobs recorded  in the QNHS, F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimates that total tourism employment when other parts of the sector such as conferencing, attractions and festivals are included is now close to 200,000.</p><p>The CSO Tourism and Travel Statistics record revenue figures from overseas markets. The 2013 figures, released at the end of March, show that spending in Ireland by overseas visitors (excluding fares) for 2013 rose by 11.9% to &euro;3.262 billion compared with 2012. The CSO does not provide a regional breakdown of statistics in their monthly 'Tourism and Travel' publication.</p><p>I am aware that F&aacute;ilte Ireland provides an estimated regional breakdown of overseas and domestic revenue on an annual basis, based on its own  research and available CSO statistics. These and other regional statistics are easily accessible in the research section of the F&aacute;ilte Ireland website under Regional Statistics and Reports.</p></reply>

Report on the Future Ownership and Operation of Cork and Shannon Airports found that Cork Airport performs well under DAA ownership and management and operates to a sustainable business model.   Following on from this report the Government decided in November 2012 that the existing ownership of Cork Airport by the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) would be maintained for the present.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that DAA has statutory responsibility to operate, manage and develop both Dublin and Cork Airports and as such the future development of Cork Airport is a matter for the Company.  Given these responsibilities and conscious of the need to address falling passenger numbers at Cork, DAA is actively engaged with a wide range of airline customers to continue to promote the airport and its hinterland.  It has also established a Development Council for Cork Airport to provide for strong engagement with, and alignment among, key stakeholders in the Cork region.  This Council will serve to foster a common understanding, particularly at local level, of issues of concern, potential opportunities for growth and the operating performance of the airport. I wish the Council success in its endeavours as we all want to see a prosperous Cork Airport.</p></reply>
