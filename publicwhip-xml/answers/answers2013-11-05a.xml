    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-05a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013110500052#WRA00700"><p>I am, of course, aware of concerns in rural communities about the incidence of crime, and of burglary in particular.  These crimes cause deep distress to householders and have a broader impact in terms of fear of crime in the community.</p><p>  It was in the light of these concerns that the Garda Commissioner established Operation Fiacla last year to coordinate a sustained national drive against those involved in this type of criminality.  Operation Fiacla is an intelligence driven national operation and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda Region to target suspected offenders.  As of 30 September, 6,678 persons have been arrested and 3,770 persons have been charged with burglary offences under Operation Fiacla.  </p><p>  I am glad to say that Operation Fiacla has proved to be a robust and effective response to those who seek to prey on law abiding householders and this is borne out by the latest Crime Statistics published by the Central Statistics Office covering the 12 month period up to the second quarter of 2013. These show a welcome reduction of 8.9% in burglary and related offences over the previous 12 months, and continue a trend which has been evident since the introduction of Operation Fiacla. </p><p>  More generally, in relation to policing in rural areas and tackling rural crime, the Garda National Policing Plan for 2013, which I laid before the House last December, sets out the policing priorities and objectives for the current year.  The Plan is designed to meet the policing needs of all communities and includes objectives of particular relevance for rural areas, including active community engagement in the development of policing strategies and concerted efforts to support and protect vulnerable sections of the community. </p><p>  This is illustrated in a range of community based initiatives which are supported by Garda&iacute; throughout the country.  For example, the ongoing work of more than 1300 Community Alert groups which are active in rural communities was underlined by the publication earlier this year of new Garda Community Crime Prevention Guidelines.  More recently the Commissioner has published guidelines for the operation of text alert systems which can provide a further mechanism by which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can distribute crime prevention information to local communities. </p><p>  I am currently in discussions with the Garda Commissioner concerning the Garda National Policing Plan for 2014, which will be presented to the House in due course, and I can assure the Deputy that it will be focused on the policing needs of all of our communities. It is the Government's intention to ensure that frontline services are maintained at the highest level possible through the most efficient use of resources.  The Commissioner continues to enjoy my full support and that of the Government in confronting crime in all its forms.  I have every confidence that he and everyone in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to deliver an effective police service in rural as in all other areas.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-05a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013110500052#WRA00900"><p>As the Deputy may be aware, numerous jurisdictions have introduced new and more customer-focussed legal business models. These &quot;alternative business structures&quot; (ABS) can involve the traditional legal services provided by barristers and/or solicitors or combine them, in what  are known as &quot;multi-disciplinary practices&quot;, with those of accountants, insurance brokers, conveyancers or other professionals to provide seamless solutions for clients on a more cost-effective basis.  The globalisation of legal and other services, along with the ongoing and exponential advances being made in business technologies and outsourcing, are challenging the traditional ways in which legal professionals conduct their business. To ignore these changes would leave legal practitioners in this jurisdiction at a growing competitive disadvantage.  Consequently, in looking to the future, the Legal Services Regulation Bill, in Part 7, provides for the introduction of legal partnerships and of multi-disciplinary practices.</p><p>  Regrettably, the legal profession have been reluctant movers as far as ABS are concerned. As far back as 1994, the same year in which multi-disciplinary practices were permitted in New South Wales Australia, the Solicitors (Amendment) Act was enacted in our jurisdiction. Taking account of the Fair Trade Commission&rsquo;s 1990 <i>Report of Study into Restrictive Practices in the Legal Profession</i>  the Act, alas unsuccessfully, provided for incorporated practices and the sharing of fees arising from a partnership or an agency arrangement by solicitors with non-lawyers.  </p><p>  Now, almost twenty years later, ABS and multi-disciplinary practices have been, or continue to be, rolled out in England and Wales, Scotland, Australia, Germany, Netherlands and parts of Canada, including British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario and there is a wealth of information and analysis now available on them. The Legal Services Act 2007 provided for the introduction of ABS, including multi-disciplinary practices, in England and Wales - over 200 licences for ABS have been issued to date. The Legal Services (Scotland) Act 2010 also allows for ABS that include multi-disciplinary practices. In Canada, the legislation relates more narrowly to multi-disciplinary practices. Along with officials of my Department, I have been actively reviewing and considering in detail how the introduction of ABS is taking place in all of these jurisdictions along with the relevant literature and those submissions received.   I am also considering the various issues of probity and governance that would relate to such new legal business models.   </p><p>  I was previously briefed on the roll-out of ABS by Mr. Steve Mark, the then Legal Services Commissioner for New South Wales, while on official business in Australia in March of 2012. Both he and Mr Chris Kenny, Chief Executive of the Legal Services Board for England &amp;amp; Wales, addressed a conference on the modernisation of legal services hosted by my Department in July 2012. Last Friday, I met, along with officials of my Department, representatives of the UK Legal Services Board and of the Solicitors Regulation Authority in London, where we were updated on the latest developments in relation to multi-disciplinary practises. I also visited one of the new legal business models up and running in the city. The Deputy can, therefore, be assured of the ongoing and substantial consideration I am giving, along with Department officials, to the introduction and proper regulation of multi-disciplinary legal practices. In light of this consideration, I will be bringing forward appropriate amendments to Part 7 of the Legal Services Regulation Bill for its forthcoming resumption of Committee Stage.</p></reply>

The Garda Ombudsman Commission has a hugely important role in ensuring that public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is safeguarded, and has extensive powers under the 2005 Act to enable it to carry out its responsibilities.  </p><p>  Section 108 of the Garda Siochana Act 2005 provides that the Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Commissioner shall, by written protocols, make arrangements concerning matters including the sharing of information between both organisations. These protocols set down issues such as time limits for the provision of information by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Garda Ombudsman Commission, and it is clearly important that any such agreed protocols should be respected by both parties, and that any difficulties in this regard should be addressed.  I have no function in the making of such arrangements or in determining the protocols surrounding those arrangements.</p><p>  In response to concerns raised by the Ombudsman Commission concerning cooperation issues with the Garda Siochana I convened a meeting  with the Garda Commissioner and the Chairperson of the  Ombudsman Commission on 23 July last.  The aim of the meeting was to explore how best to ensure the highest level of practical co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Ombudsman Commission in what can be complex and difficult investigations into alleged Garda misconduct.  I am very pleased that the Garda Commissioner and the Chairperson of the Ombudsman Commission have since signed new protocols providing for enhanced cooperation between the two organisations. The protocols are available on the website of the Ombudsman Commission. </p><p>  These new protocols will support the Ombudsman Commission in carrying out investigations in the most effective and timely manner possible, to the benefit of both complainants and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na alike. They also reflect the commitment of the Garda Commissioner to the full co-operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in these investigations.  The revised protocols also provide that the Ombudsman Commission has access to PULSE through the two Garda Superintendents working on secondment with the Ombudsman Commission.</p><p>  I also informed the House in my earlier replies that I have established a committee chaired by a senior official of my Department, with senior representatives from the Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to act as a forum where any future emerging issues concerning the protocols can be identified and appropriately addressed.   <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p></reply>

I have however been informed by the Garda Commissioner that circumstances of a temporary nature have necessitated augmenting the policing service provided to Ramelton with personnel from nearby stations.  Arrangements have been made to have the station opened to the public periodically and the opening hours are posted at the station for the information of the public.</p><p>  I have been further informed by the Garda Commissioner that the public in Ramelton are advised via signs at the station to contact Milford in the event that a Garda Service is required, and phone callers to the station are automatically diverted to Milford Garda Station. </p><p>  A comprehensive policing service for Ramelton is provided from the nearby District Headquarters in Milford on a 24 hour basis. This service is supplemented by staff from the nearby sub-station in Rathmullen in addition to the resources available from the Divisional Traffic &amp;amp; Detective Units.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p><p>  The Deputy should also be aware that while the Policing plans for 2014 and 2015 have not yet been prepared, I understand, from discussions with the Garda Commissioner, that the current consolidation process will be largely completed by the end of this year and it seems unlikely at this point in time that there will be any further station closures in 2014 and 2015. </p></reply>

The DPP subsequently advised that, on the basis of the papers provided, there be no further prosecution in this matter. </p><p>  I have recently received a detailed report from the Garda Commissioner on the outcome of the review by the Serious Crime Review Team and have studied it carefully.</p><p>  I welcome the fact that this case has been reviewed extensively by the Garda Serious Crime Review Team.  Under our system of law it is a matter for the criminal justice system to investigate crimes and for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide whether persons should be charged.  The Director, of course, has to assess evidence; not rumour, speculation and innuendo.  It is no part of our system to establish special inquiries to investigate such killings and it would be clearly invidious if this mechanism were available to some families, but not to others.  Nor is it the function of inquiries to satisfy public curiosity about particular cases; instead they are meant to address issues of genuine public interest and concern. </p><p>  Wider concerns have, of course, been expressed about the case including claims that it has been subject to some sort of cover up by the State.  Against that background, I am anxious to put as much information into the public domain about this matter as is possible and appropriate so as to address these claims.  However, it is not open to me to publish the report of the Garda Serious Crime Review Team.  First, it is, quite properly, not the practice to publish Garda reports of criminal investigations and, second, the report contains unsubstantiated allegations against named persons.</p><p>  I am conscious that to leave the matter at that would allow baseless assertions to be made that I, or my colleagues in Government, have some interest in suppressing information about this case when, in fact, what is at issue is having due regard to the rule of law and protecting the rights of all.</p><p>  In the circumstances, I am consulting with the Attorney General with a view to the appointment of a Senior Counsel to conduct an independent examination of the Report of the Serious Crime Review Team into this case.  In the light of this examination the Senior Counsel will be asked to do two things.  First, he or she will prepare a report which can be put into the public domain on any issues of public interest which may arise from the report, having regard to the rights of all those involved.  Second, he or she is being asked to identify whether there are matters of significant public concern arising from this examination and, if so , whether any form of further inquiry, aside from the criminal investigation, would have a reasonable prospect of establishing the truth of such matters and would be warranted in the public interest, taking into account the fact that it is the function of the criminal justice system to investigate criminal acts.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will, of course, cooperate fully with this examination.</p><p>  I am taking this step solely in the interests of transparency and of bringing the advice of an independent person into consideration of this matter.  I should emphasise that it does not imply in any way that I am dissatisfied with the work undertaken by the Garda Serious Crime Review Team.</p></reply>

The Deputy will understand that national security is not a devolved matter in Northern Ireland and, in this regard, I also meet regularly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, to address a range of matters of mutual concern, relating particularly to the security situation.</p><p>  I have taken a strong interest in cross-border co-operation in policing and criminal justice on this island since taking office as Minister.  This co-operation is multifaceted, including frequent ministerial contacts and day-to-day operational interaction between the police services and other relevant agencies, all aimed at improving community safety for all communities on this island including, in particular, those close to the border.</p><p>  Combating the paramilitary threat is an absolute priority in both jurisdictions.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work seamlessly with their Northern Ireland counterparts to tackle these criminal terrorists and the organised crime gangs to which they are inextricably linked.  The Garda Commissioner and the PSNI Chief Constable repeatedly emphasise that the close and high quality co-operation between the two police services is central to combating these shared threats.</p><p>  Under the Intergovernmental Agreement on Co-operation on Criminal Justice Matters Minister Ford and I operate a structured framework for co-operation involving the range of criminal justice agencies on this island.  The personnel from those agencies work together in bringing forward an annual work programme of co-operation and our respective officials also meet regularly to assess and report to us on developments.</p><p>  There is, of course, close and ongoing co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI on all aspects of policing.  The two police services operate a joint Cross Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island.    The two police services are jointly engaged in implementing a number of initiatives in all areas of policing in all these areas with, understandably, a focus on areas close to the border, including those in the Deputy's constituency.</p></reply>

It is planned that the Bill will be enacted during the first half of 2014 and that the new Court of Appeal would be up and running in the new law term next Autumn.</p><p>  My Department will be working closely with the Courts Service during this process and I can advise that an Implementation Committee has been established by the Courts Service which includes representation from my Department. The Committee, which has held its first meeting, will examine and make recommendations in relation to all aspects of administrative support for the new Court, such as organisational structure, staffing, accommodation, ICT systems and facilities, and rules of court to regulate court procedures. The aim is to ensure that the required accommodation, structures and systems are in place in time for the establishment of the new Court of Appeal.</p><p>  The current level of delay in the Supreme Court of four and a half years is unsustainable for individuals and businesses seeking to pursue important appeals. The establishment of a Court of Appeal provides a long-needed reform of our courts system. It will have significant benefit for individual citizens, but will also maintain the internationally recognised standing of Ireland as a competitive and efficient economy in which to do business.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-05a.34.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013110500052#WRA02500"><p>Budget 2014 poses no specific job reductions on the Justice Sector.  Indeed, The Deputy will be aware from the allocations made on Budget Day that the gross budget for the Justice Sector in 2014 will be close to &euro;2.16 billion. I am glad to say that  funding for current expenditure of just under &euro;2.1 billion is &euro;137m more than the previous government had allocated under their National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 and brings to more than &euro;400m the additional funding I have secured over and above the amounts allocated by the previous Government.</p><p>  Despite this increase in funding, the Justice sector is not immune from the overarching need to remedy the damage done to our public finances by the mismanagement of the previous administration. The sector must, of course, help reduce public expenditure and correct our public finances by operating within the Employment Control Frameworks which apply across the civil and public service.  For the end of 2014 the ceiling has been set at 21,890 for the Sector, while the current level of staffing in the Sector is approximately 22,400.  But I wish to ensure that we play our part in a strategic and targeted manner.</p><p>  I am particularly pleased that Budget 2014 provides me with the resources to maintain the targeted objective Garda strength at 13,000 members.  I was pleased to announce recently  a recruitment competition for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which will see new student Garda&iacute; entering the Garda College in 2014 - the first Garda recruitment since the previous Government stopped recruitment in 2009.</p><p>  In tandem with the maintenance of Garda strength, it is also important to maintain the management and supervisory capacity of the Force. Since the Government took office, a significant number of derogations from the moratorium on appointments have been secured so that 88 Sergeant; 40 Inspector; 53 Superintendent; 17 Chief Superintendent; 4 Assistant Commissioner; and 1 Deputy Commissioner appointments could be made.</p><p>  Arising from the recent Referendum a Court of Appeal will be established.  Officials of my Department and the Courts Service are working to identify the staffing numbers required  to establish the Court of Appeal and any necessary sanctions will be sought from my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  The Justice Sector has taken its share of reductions in recent years as we work to restore the nation&rsquo;s fiscal sovereignty. I am very proud of what continues to be achieved across the sector, despite the reduced resources. I will continue to fund front-line services to the greatest extent possible and I am very pleased that funding can be maintained for areas such as the Forensic Science Laboratory and the Criminal Assets Bureau, which play a central role in supporting Garda&iacute; in the fight against organised and other serious crime. </p><p>  As I said on Budget Day there are definitely positive signs, including the maintenance of the targeted objective Garda strength at 13,000; substantial investment in the Garda fleet; the commencement of a Garda recruitment campaign; building programmes in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Courts and Prisons, through the PPP model and direct investment are advancing; and reform initiatives continue to deliver across the sector. None of this could have been achieved if, as Minister for Justice and Equality, I had to cope with over &euro;400m of further cuts which would have been imposed under the previous administration's so-called National Recovery Plan 2011-14.</p></reply>

Over 600 applications have been received to date and are being processed.  </p><p>  The Report of the Interdepartmental Group was discussed and agreed at Cabinet this morning and the full details in respect of implementation of the Scheme will published over the next few days.

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill, which  I expect will be published shortly, will create a positive duty on public bodies to do so and provides for the Commission to provide support and advice to public bodies in meeting that obligation.</p><p>  I also refer the Deputy to the Government's position on this matter as set out in Minister of State Kathleen Lynch's statement to the D&aacute;il on 2 July 2013 in the context of the debate on a Private Members Bill on this topic, the Equal Status (Amendment) Bill 2013 as well as to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 33 of 25 September 2013.  In our democratic State, budgetary decisions are for the democratically-elected Government of the day to make and for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to approve. The reality is that resources are limited and additional expenditure demands or costs arising, for whatever reason, will have to be paid for through expenditure reductions elsewhere or through the raising of additional revenue. Nothing in the approach canvassed can change that reality or be of any help to the Government in making the difficult decisions its members have been elected to make on behalf of the people as we work to restore the country's economic sovereignty.</p><p>  In the context of budgetary policy and the preparation of estimates, each Minister is responsible for assessing policy proposals in his or her area. Considerations of equality form an important component of budgetary discussions by Government. When making Government decisions on budget matters, the Government is very much aware of issues such as gender equality, persons experiencing risk of poverty or social exclusion, and people with disabilities.</p></reply>

Furthermore many modern organised criminal groupings are transnational in nature and engage in a wide range of disparate criminal activities. </p><p>  Addressing such criminality remains a key ongoing priority for both the Government and for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and these priorities are clearly reflected in the Garda Policing Plan for 2013 and in the Programme for Government. </p><p>  However, I can say that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to vigorously tackle organised crime through undertaking a range of targeted activities designed to disrupt and dismantle the operations of criminal organisations. </p><p>  This approach involves targeting serious criminals and organised criminal groups on a number of fronts and across all geographical locations, including through the use of focused intelligence led operations by specialist units such as the Organised Crime Unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  </p><p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, the Garda authorities are continually looking at opportunities to employ new technologies to achieve their goals and to contribute to the services they provide.  This is a policy that is designed to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be in a position to take advantage of proven up to date technological developments to meet the needs of an effective police force.</p><p>  Additionally, considerable progress has been made within the Garda force in the field of modern technological support.  In addition to a class-leading computer system,  PULSE, these include the full roll-out of the state of the art National Digital Radio System, the Automated Fingerprint Information System and Automated Number Plate Recognition.  </p><p>  With regard to Garda transport, I am conscious of the continuing pressures on the Garda fleet and I am very pleased to have secured a further &euro;9m for investment in the fleet, made up of &euro;5m between now and the end of the year and a further &euro;4m in 2014.  At this stage, arising from the additional &euro;5m being made available between October and December, the Garda authorities have arranged for the delivery of 305 new vehicles by the end of 2013.  These are in addition to the 133 new Garda vehicles already made available during the year. </p><p>  I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the recently published Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill 2013 which provides for the establishment of a DNA database.  Enactment of this legislation will represent a major step forward in the fight against serious crime. </p></reply>

It is planned that the Bill will be enacted during the first half of 2014 and that the new Court of Appeal would be up and running in the new law term next Autumn.</p><p>  My Department will be working closely with the Courts Service during this process and I can advise that an Implementation Committee has been established by the Courts Service which includes representation from my Department.  The Committee, which has held its first meeting, will examine and make recommendations in relation to all aspects of administrative support for the new Court, such as organisational structure, staffing, accommodation, ICT systems and facilities, and rules of court to regulate court procedures.  The aim is to ensure that the required accommodation, structures and systems are in place in time for the establishment of the new Court of Appeal.</p><p>  The current level of delay in the Supreme Court of four and a half years is unsustainable for individuals and businesses seeking to pursue important appeals.  The establishment of a Court of Appeal provides a long-needed reform of our courts system.  It will have significant benefit for individual citizens, but will also maintain the internationally recognised standing of Ireland as a competitive and efficient economy in which to do business.</p></reply>

Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members.  This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee.  Work on the Bill continues, therefore, on that basis, including in co-operation with the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General while also taking account of any relevant rulings by the Courts.  By necessity work on Trioka-related legislation such as the establishment of the Insolvency Service and reform of the delivery of legal services has been a priority for my Department.  Pending the completion of this legislative workload, I expect that work on the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill will be advanced to enable it to be published as soon as resources allow. </p><p>  Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing in the area of international protection, I will be introducing new arrangements for the processing of subsidiary protection applications.  The legislative provisions to underpin the new system for determining applications for subsidiary protection are currently being finalised in my Department in co-operation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government.  When these legislative provisions are settled, the intention is to bring the new applications processing arrangements into operation as soon as possible.    </p></reply>

Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are prohibited, except in specified circumstances, without the authority of the Commissioner from communicating either directly or indirectly with the media or furnishing to the media any information in connection with the investigation of crime or other official matters. </p><p>  Any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who leaks information to the media is not only contravening clear Garda policy, but is also, as the question notes, contravening the law.  It is an offence under the Official Secrets Act 1963 for a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as for any public official, to disclose official information without lawful authority.

The section sets out a list of instances of harmful effect covered by this offence, which includes for example disclosures which result in the publication of personal information constituting an unwarranted and serious infringement of a person's right to privacy.</p><p>  Any member of the public who believes that he or she has been the subject of unauthorised disclosure of information by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may make a complaint to the independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which has extensive powers of investigation.</p></reply>

The Bill and key responses to it have also been considered at Second Stage and in detail by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality prior to the Bill's Committee Stage which commenced on 17 July.   </p><p>  Alongside those groups representing the legal professions with whom I have had both formal and informal direct meetings and from whom I have received a series of substantial submissions, I have had direct meetings with the Competition Authority, the Consumers' Association, the Honorable Society of King's Inns and the Committee of Heads of Irish University Law Schools and with the legal service regulators of other jurisdictions such as Australia and England and Wales.  In terms of written submissions, I have, as previously disclosed to the House, received just under 50 since publication of the Bill representing nearly 30 interested parties, along with dozens of individual letters from concerned members of the public and practitioners and the formal observations of other Government Departments.  For their part, the Law Society, the Bar Council and the King's Inns have provided substantive views on a number of occasions and on key issues which are among those to which consideration continues to be given.  Submissions have come from a wide range of bodies in addition to the legal professional bodies including from associations, academics, civil liberties and human rights organisations, private businesses and Government agencies or Departments.  They range in their scope from that of the entire Bill to that of particular provisions or issues arising within it. </p><p>  A wide range of stakeholders have therefore provided, and continue to submit, views on the Bill which I am more than happy to consider.  These views continue to inform the development of the Bill and have to be considered against the Bill's modern balance of interests between those of the legal professions and those of business or private citizens who avail of legal services.  The Deputy will appreciate the importance of the Government, in exercising its policy prerogative, maintaining this balance and conducting its consultations, direct or indirect, so as as to avoid any actual or perceived regulatory capture by any particular lobby or interest group.  At this point in time, there are a large number of issues upon which the respective views of stakeholders have been clearly expressed or continue to be aired including in the public domain and in readily accessible formats on the internet.  Direct and indirect contacts with stakeholders continue to take place at official level. </p><p>  Finally, as I have previously stated, amendments to the Bill and a Regulatory Impact Analysis will be made available for consideration prior to its forthcoming resumption of Committee Stage which is to take place as soon as possible in the current session.</p></reply>

Each office has access to the Criminal Case Tracking System (CCTS).  This system records details of all prosecutions initiated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including offences under the Road Traffic Acts.  In relation to road traffic offences, details of the prosecutor and accused, details of alleged offences, details of all court appearances associated with a case and final court outcomes are recorded on the system.  Details of any appeals lodged, set asides etc. are also recorded on the system.</p><p><b>Summary of the Criminal Case Tracking System</b></p><p>  The Criminal Case Tracking System (CCTS), an Oracle Relational Database, is in operation in all District Court Offices.  There are approximately 200 concurrent users of the application which provides for the processing, scheduling, enforcement and reporting of criminal cases.  In addition, it can produce a variety of documents that are required in the course of a criminal case such as summonses, warrants and copy orders.  CCTS also produces a number of key reports to assist in the administration of criminal business such as prison lists and legal aid lists.  </p><p><b>Summary of CCTS functionality relating to penalty points</b></p><p>  Where a fixed charge penalty is not paid or where a prosecution is being initiated in respect of other road traffic offences which attract penalty points, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na make an application to the courts for the issue of a summons against the offender.  In the majority of cases this is an electronic process.  Where the driving licence number for the offender is collected during the detection/investigative process, the licence number is included in the electronic summons application process and is updated to CCTS.</p><p>  Summonses produced from CCTS and issued for service include a requirement for the offender to produce to the court their driving licence or learner permit and a legible copy of same.  Where the offender before the court is convicted and produces their licence or permit, the number is recorded by the Court Registrar and updated to CCTS. </p><p>  Details of all convictions recorded on CCTS in respect of offences which attract penalty points, including the driving licence number where provided, are collated and transferred electronically to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  This occurs approximately 28 days after the date of the convictions as time must be allowed for any possible appeals to be lodged.  The file transferred also includes the outcomes of any appeals, set asides and judicial reviews in respect of penalty point convictions.</p></reply>

There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.</p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses.  Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  Section 2(2)(d) provides that in exercising its jurisdiction under that section, a court shall take into account and may receive evidence or submissions concerning any conviction of the accused person for an offence committed while he or she was on bail.</p><p>  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.  </p><p>  The criminal law takes a serious view of offences committed by persons on bail.  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served.  It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p><p>  I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences continue to be committed by persons on bail.  I share that concern and believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.</p><p>  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.  I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter as soon as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities.</p><p>  In relation to the extent to which crimes are committed by persons who are already on bail, I have asked the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency responsible for the publication of crime statistics, to provide relevant information directly to the Deputy. </p></reply>

The survey covers households usually resident in Ireland and the main topic headings covered in the survey are:</p><p>1. Socio-demographic data (age, gender, education achieved, marital status, household composition etc.).</p><p>2. Real assets and their financing (mortgages and loans, property, cars, jewellery etc.).</p><p>3. Other liabilities/credit constraints (lease payments, credit lines, overdrafts, credit cards etc.).</p><p>4. Private businesses and financial assets (business ownership, interests in business etc.).</p><p>5. Employment (occupation, job status etc.).</p><p>6. Pension and insurance policies.</p><p>7. Income (employee, self-employed, transfer payments etc.).</p><p>8. Intergenerational transfers as gifts.</p><p>9. Consumption (how much spent on food/beverage in the month etc.).</p><p>  The main aim of the HFCS is to provide structural information on households&rsquo; assets and liabilities, based on a representative sample of households.  This will address gaps in knowledge about the economic well-being of households, the distribution and type of wealth (and liabilities) among households and individuals, as well as the factors that affect financial planning by households and individuals. </p><p>  Work began on the survey in 2012 and the main field work was done between March and September 2013.  In total the CSO collected data from approximately 5,250 households across the country.  The HFCS data is currently being processed and first results are due to be released in mid-2014.</p><p>  The total cost of the survey over the period 2012 to 2014 is estimated to be approximately &euro;1,357,000 of which the Central Bank will pay &euro;990,000.  The remaining &euro;367,000 is being covered from the CSO Vote.</p><p>  Under the Statistics Act, 1993 the survey data collected on individuals and households is confidential and may only be used for statistical purposes. </p></reply>

Services exports amounted to a further &euro;90.3 billion, for a combined total of &euro;182 billion.  The trade balance in Ireland&rsquo;s favour was some &euro;45.7 billion, including the highest services trade surplus since records began. </p><p>  Total goods exports to China (including its various territories) in 2012 were &euro;2.3 billion, while services exports were &euro;3.1 billion.  Goods exports to China were thus 2.5% of total goods exports, with services exports to China 3.5% of total exports of services.  Combined goods and services exports to China were &euro;5.4 billion, or 3% of total exports from Ireland.  These figures make China Ireland&rsquo;s 9th biggest export market, and our largest in Asia. </p><p>  China is also a key market for indigenous exports from Ireland.  In 2012, these amounted to &euro;346 million, an increase of 19% from 2011.  Enterprise Ireland has set a target of &euro;600 million of indigenous exports to China by 2016, with a focus on six priority clusters: Financial Services, Clean technologies, Information &amp;amp; Communication Technologies, Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices &amp;amp; Education.  China is also a key market for food and agriculture exports.  These amounted to &euro;323 million in 2012, an increase of 93% since 2010.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s overall relations with China are based on ongoing assessment by Government of Ireland&rsquo;s key strategic, political and economic interests.  The Government recognises that the rapid development of China, along with other countries in Asia, has significant global implications, while providing many opportunities for Ireland.</p><p>  The Government has intensified Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relations with China since the visit of then Vice President Xi Jinping in February 2012.  The Taoiseach made a return visit to China in March of last year, during which a Strategic Partnership for Mutually Beneficial Cooperation was agreed between the two countries.  This Agreement provides a comprehensive framework for the development of further co-operation across a wide range of areas, including trade, investment, culture, and education.</p><p>  I made an official visit to China in July/August of this year, at the invitation of Foreign Minister Wang Yi.  I used the visit to further strengthen relations with a key global actor, as well as supporting Irish companies doing business in China, promoting Ireland as a tourist destination, and promoting Ireland as the best investment location for Chinese businesses looking to expand in Europe.   </p><p>  Last week, the Taoiseach and I met separately with Vice Premier Ma Kai, who visited Ireland at my invitation.  We had substantive exchanges on all aspects of the bilateral relationship.  Vice Premier Ma indicated a firm wish on the part of China to intensify co-operation across a range of areas including trade, investment, education, food and agriculture, and research and development.</p><p>  Since the visit of President Xi to Ireland, 8 members of Government in addition to the Taoiseach and myself have visited China, with a similar number of Chinese Ministers visiting Ireland.  At present, I do not have plans to return to China (for which an invitation would be required).  The Chinese Premier, Li Keqiang, is not currently scheduled to visit Ireland.</p><p>  The Government will continue to seek to develop and expand Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relationship with China in a mutually beneficial way.  </p></reply>

Ireland actively supported this Resolution and was amongst those United Nations member states which co-sponsored it.     </p><p>  Ireland actively engaged in the negotiations at the 64th session of the United Nations General Assembly in July 2010 which led to the adoption of a Resolution on the &lsquo;human right to water and sanitation&rsquo; (Resolution 64/292).  Ireland supported suggestions put forward by the EU that, in our view, would have both resulted in a more balanced text and allowed the General Assembly to reach consensus on this issue.  Unfortunately, on this occasion, many of the EU suggestions were not taken into consideration.  </p><p>  The Bolivian-led resolution bypassed the United Nations Human Rights Council process in Geneva and risked introducing division where consensus should have been sought.  Following careful consideration it was decided that Ireland could not support in its entirety the final Bolivian text presented to the General Assembly.  On 28 July 2010 the Resolution was adopted following a recorded vote of 122 votes in favour, none against and 41 abstentions.  Ireland, along with 17 of our European Union partners, abstained from voting on this Resolution.  </p><p>  Ireland continues to actively engage in discussions within the international community on access to safe drinking water and sanitation, including at the 21st session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in September 2012, which adopted a resolution on &lsquo;the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation&rsquo;.  Ireland co-sponsored this Resolution.</p><p>  Ireland agrees in principle that all persons, wherever located, should have access to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities and remains convinced that the only manner in which to achieve real progress on access to safe drinking water and sanitation is to maintain consensus within the international community.  </p><p>  Ireland remains fully committed to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal of reducing by half, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation.  In 2012, Ireland allocated over &euro;5 million in support to water and sanitation activities to improve availability of services and to address the structural causes of exclusion from access to water and sanitation services.</p></reply>

In this context, official representation refers to work-related events, official functions and networking opportunities held in the homes of officers on posting as part of their official duties.  The scheme covers a small range of items which are necessary to provide a suitable home environment for the purposes of official representation, with particular regard to the representational areas of an officer&rsquo;s residence.  It is governed by detailed internal guidelines, which I would be happy to make available to the Deputy on request. Access to the scheme may also be granted by the parent Department of officers temporarily seconded to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on a case-by-case basis.

As the Deputy will be aware, this was the first formal Council meeting of EU Foreign Ministers since late August.  A wide range of issues were discussed and important Conclusions were agreed across a number of key policy areas; these Conclusions may be accessed on the official EU website  .     </p><p>  In her opening remarks, High Representative (HR) Ashton gave Ministers a brief overview of recent developments in Iran (latest round of nuclear talks), the Western Balkans (update on the Serbia-Kosovo dialogue and on the current situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina) and the Maldives (elections). </p><p>  The first item for substantive discussion was the Eastern Partnership, where Ministers took stock of preparations for the Summit in Vilnius later this month (28-29 November).  This Summit will mark an important step forward in the Union&rsquo;s relationship with its Eastern neighbours.  There was broad support amongst partners for the initialling of Association Agreements with Georgia and Moldova in Vilnius.  In addition there was an exchange of views on the progress achieved to date by Ukraine to enable the signing of the Association Agreement at the Summit; this was also the subject of an informal ministerial level breakfast meeting between members of the Council and Ukraine which I attended immediately before the FAC.  I joined with my EU counterparts in welcoming the advances made to date by Ukraine in implementing key reforms and underlined the importance of further progress towards achieving the benchmarks.  </p><p>  Under the Southern Neighbourhood agenda item, discussions focused on recent developments in Egypt, Syria and Libya; I will address each point separately.</p><p>  On Egypt, HR Ashton updated Ministers on her recent visit to the region.  The situation remains tense and many partners &ndash; myself included &ndash; highlighted concerns related to the security situation generally, the repression of the political opposition, the detention of political prisoners and the treatment of religious minorities.  During my intervention, I specifically raised Ireland&rsquo;s concern for the four Irish nationals who remain in detention in Egypt.  While appreciating Egyptian security concerns in relation to the Sinai, I also expressed concern about the impact on the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza.  Conclusions were adopted on a report of the Court of Auditors concerning EU Cooperation with Egypt in the field of governance. </p><p>  Ministers discussed developments in Libya with a focus on the security situation, related migration issues and the recent horrific drowning of some 500 people off the island of Lampedusa.  Partners expressed sorrow for the tragic loss of life and we also conveyed our support for the rescue workers operating in extremely challenging circumstances.</p><p>  Ministers reviewed developments in relation to Syria with particular reference to the OPCW chemical weapons disarmament process, the prospects for the &lsquo;Geneva II&rsquo; talks and the ever-challenging humanitarian situation.  While welcoming the encouraging progress made in recent weeks on the disarmament issue, the Council underlined the need to maintain the momentum behind the &lsquo;Geneva II&rsquo; process and to prioritise the alleviation of the humanitarian suffering.  I took the opportunity to echo these concerns in my intervention, voicing Ireland&rsquo;s continuing support for Joint Special Representative Brahimi and informing partners of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution of &euro;200,000 to the OPCW disarmament efforts.  The FAC adopted Conclusions which emphasised the need for a political solution to the crisis in Syria and for safe and unhindered humanitarian access to all populations in need of assistance throughout the country.  The EU is the largest international donor of assistance to the Syrian people and Ireland, for its part, has contributed a total of &euro;13.8m to date.    </p><p>  Finally, Ministers also discussed recent developments in Myanmar/Burma.  HR Ashton briefed us on the progress of the EU Taskforce and the preparations for her visit there this month.  Over lunch, the FAC met with Nobel Peace Prize laureate and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.  Discussions focused on how the EU might best support democratic reforms in Myanmar/Burma. For my part, I emphasised in my remarks, Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to step up assistance to Myanmar/Burma in the context of our new programme of support, the details of which I hope to finalise in the weeks ahead. </p></reply>

In addition to their country of residence, many Ambassadors are also accredited to additional countries on a concurrent basis which enhances the cost-effectiveness of our external representation.   </p><p>  Our missions abroad work very closely with the state agencies in the promotion of exports, tourism and inward investment.  They perform also a wide range of functions in support of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy interests.  These include representing and advancing government policies with other states and in international organisations, in particular the EU and the UN; economic, trade and cultural promotion; frontline consular and passport services to citizens overseas; engaging with and supporting Irish communities, and managing Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programmes in Ireland&rsquo;s key partner countries.  </p><p>  The figures provided in the table below for our overseas missions include both Vote 28 - Foreign Affairs and Trade and Vote 27 - International Co-operation.  The effective implementation of the aid programme necessarily entails additional management and oversight costs which are included in the figures provided.  In addition to 25 locally recruited core staff, in the region of 180 locally-employed staff are engaged on the development co-operation side to meet technical requirements in specific programme areas.  The numbers of such staff in each mission at any time varies in accordance with programme requirements. <table><tr><th>Mission</th><th>Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Officers posted from

The programme reflects the values of the Irish people and is a concrete expression of our determination to help those less fortunate than ourselves.  Our new policy on international development - <i>One World, One Future</i>  - maintains the Government&rsquo;s focus on assisting the poorest countries and communities, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, renews the focus of the programme in terms of our trading and economic interest with the developing world, and reconfirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP for Official Development Assistance (ODA) when economic circumstances permit.</p><p>  Over the past three years, despite the very difficult economic circumstances facing the country, the unprecedented demands on the exchequer and the imperative to reduce the fiscal imbalance in the public finances, this Government has managed to largely stabilise our ODA budget.  This must be seen as a very significant achievement, particularly in light of the challenging budgetary constraints we faced in that period.  It represents a clear demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the international aid programme. </p><p>  The most recent data published by the OECD Development Assistance Committee relates to aid flows for 2012 and shows that ODA budgets across many donors are under some pressure as Governments have reduced spending in response to the financial crisis.  However, the data also clearly shows that Ireland continued to be a generous donor by international standards.    </p></reply>

The EU is represented on this working group by the European Commission, the Presidency of the Council and the European External Action Service (EEAS), and the work of the group is ongoing.  A number of meetings have already taken place in Brussels and in Washington. The next meeting is expected to take place on 6 November in Brussels.   Following this work, the Commission and the Presidency are expected to issue a public, factual report which will be followed by an assessment and recommendations before the end of the year.</p><p>  As regards the allegations of spying on EU delegations, High Representative Catherine Ashton raised EU concerns directly with US Secretary of State John Kerry and National Security Advisor Susan Rice on several occasions.  I understand that more contacts at various levels have been established since to further discuss the allegations and obtain clarifications on the surveillance activities undertaken by the US with regard to EU delegations. </p><p>  At their European Council meeting of 24/25 October last, EU Heads of State and Government issued a statement on the more recent developments concerning possible intelligence issues and the deep concerns that these events have raised among European citizens.  They underlined the close relationship between Europe and the United States and the value of that partnership.  They expressed their conviction that the partnership must be based on respect and trust, including as regards the work and co-operation of secret services.</p><p>  For our part, and as I have outlined in a reply to a previous parliamentary question, the Government&rsquo;s concerns have been conveyed bilaterally in contacts with the US Embassy in Dublin.   While the House will appreciate that it is not the practice to comment in detail on surveillance and security issues and that the Minister for Justice and Equality has primary responsibility in this area, we do not have any information that would indicate that surveillance took place here in Ireland.  I wish to reiterate that any such surveillance here would be unacceptable to us.      </p></reply>

Officials at all levels based in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's headquarters and its network of missions abroad are involved in these efforts.  I have repeatedly discussed international concerns over developments in Syria with fellow EU Foreign Ministers at meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council, at the UN General Assembly, as well as in bilateral meetings with other Foreign Ministers.  Ireland's position of strong support for efforts to achieve a political resolution of the crisis and to address its dire humanitarian consequences for Syria and the wider region is very much in line with current international efforts and thinking, including that of the Holy See.  </p><p>  No invitation has been extended to Heads of Mission accredited to the Vatican to attend the meeting planned for 21 November referred to in the Deputy's question.

However, I can assure the Deputy that I am satisfied with the range of the Ambassador's diplomatic contacts, both within the Secretariat of State and the Roman Curia more widely, in particular in the relevant Pontifical Councils and Congregations, including with Irish officials.   Ambassador Cooney has travelled to the Holy See on numerous occasions since the announcement of the Embassy closure in November 2011, the vast majority of which visits have taken place since he presented credentials in May 2012.  In this context, the Ambassador has attended a full range of events, including the inauguration of Pope Francis to which he accompanied the President, and was present at the Pope's subsequent meeting with the Diplomatic Corps.  During our Presidency earlier this year, for example, he hosted a meeting for European Union Heads of Mission at which the Holy See's Undersecretary for Relations with States was the guest of honour.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the current arrangement for Ireland's representation at the Holy See is the most effective possible in light of the resource constraints faced by my Department.</p></reply>

I wish to advise the Deputy that following the 2007 report of the initial investigation by Botswana Police and an inquest held in the Coroners court in Mallow in 2007, the case was reviewed by the Botswana Department of Defence, Justice and Security.  The Report of the Review issued in 2011 took account of the report of the private investigator, to which the Deputy refers.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is not appropriate for this Department to request a further investigation in this case, however, if the family wish to write a letter of complaint to the Botswana authorities, my Department will follow up on this.

Several of the murders mentioned would have been raised with the British side over the years, following representations from politicians and clergy in the area.  We are now examining the text in detail and will consider further action in light of that examination.  Dealing with the legacy of the past is an issue which is essential if we are to make greater progress towards reconciliation and a shared society.  The Government supports the work of the Panel of Parties established by the First Minister and deputy First Minister to look at dealing with the past, with parades and with flags and emblems.  When I met with the Independent Chair of the Panel Dr Haass in Dublin last week we discussed how best to deal with the legacy of the past.

All other reliefs or exemptions in relation to such termination payments continue to apply as appropriate. </p><p>  Interpretation of tax law is a function of the Revenue Commissioners and I am informed by them that the payments to local authority councillors on retirement are taxable under section 123 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 with the exemptions and reliefs provided for by way of section 201 and Schedule 3 to that Act.  This is the same relief provided to all other employees in receipt of an ex-gratia payment on redundancy or termination of an office or employment.</p><p>  Under section 201 an individual claimant is entitled to a basic exemption of &euro;10,160 plus an additional &euro;765 for each full year of service.  Where the individual has no pension lump sum entitlement or has waived his or her right to that pension an increased exemption of &euro;10,000 is also available under Schedule 3 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Otherwise the &euro;10,000 figure is reduced by the actuarial (current use value) amount of that lump sum entitlement. </p><p>  In addition, Schedule 3 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for the Standard Capital Superannuation Benefit (SCSB) which be claimed where the SCSB as determined exceeds the basic and increased exemption.  This relief is determined by reference to the average earnings of the claimant over the previous 36 months of employment, the SCSB is calculated as the average pay for the last three years multiplied by the number of complete years of service, and then divided by 15, less any pension lump sum entitlement.</p><p>  Top Slicing relief, which continues to be available in respect of ex-gratia payments made up to 31 December 2013, is determined by reference to the average effective rate of tax charged over the 3 previous years of assessment on the taxable element of the ex-gratia payment, as compared to the tax payable on the same payment at the marginal rates of tax in the current year.</p><p>  Top Slicing Relief will not be available where the payments to local authority councillors on retirement are made on after 1 January 2014.</p></reply>

On that basis, the position is that the PAYE allowance, as it was then, was introduced in 1980 to improve the tax progression of PAYE taxpayers and to take account of the fact that the self-employed generally then had the advantage of paying tax on a preceding year basis.  The argument was also made at the time that the general scheme of allowances for expenses discriminated against employees and in favour of other taxpayers.  There have been some changes since 1980. For example, the self-employed now pay tax on a current year basis. In addition, the PAYE allowance has become a tax credit.  However, significant timing benefits remain, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer. In addition, the expenses regime remains somewhat more liberal than that afforded to employees and therefore the self-employed can actually pay less tax when compared to a PAYE worker on the same income. </p><p>  Not withstanding the above, to extend the PAYE tax credit to the self-employed would also be extremely costly to achieve.  However, as the Deputy is aware, I did announce in my Budget Speech a package of 25 measures costing over &euro;500m to promote jobs and growth.  I believe that these measures will assist new business and small business and provide support for employers in almost every sector.   </p></reply>

The Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit will be of the same value, i.e. &euro;1,650, as the existing One-Parent Family Tax Credit and will also carry the same entitlement to the extended standard rate tax band of &euro;36,800 per annum.  The new credit will be targeted such that it is available <i>only</i> to the primary carer of the child.  A maximum of one credit will be available per single carer/claimant, regardless of whether he or she cares for more than one child.  This is the same condition that applies to the current One-Parent Family Tax Credit.  Given the difficult fiscal environment it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.  A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child is unsustainable.   </p><p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the One-Parent Family Tax Credit plays a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.  However, in its recommendations it concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer only.  The restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.  </p><p>  Allocation of childcare responsibilities is primarily for parents to agree.  Practical implementation issues, such as that which you have raised, are being considered as part of the Finance Bill process.</p></reply>

With a view to keeping the scheme simple and reducing administration on the part of employers, there is no notification procedure for employers involved.  Accordingly, the Revenue Commissioners do not have statistics on the uptake of the scheme.  The scheme operates on a self-administration basis, and relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of their particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation.</p><p>  The purchase of bicycles and associated safety equipment by employers for employees or directors is subject to the normal Revenue audit procedure with the normal obligations on employers to maintain records (e.g. delivery dockets, invoices, payments details, etc.).  The employer is also obliged to keep all salary sacrifice agreements entered into between the employer and employees/directors, together with all signed statements from employees/directors regarding use of the bicycles and safety equipment.</p><p>  It was estimated at the time of the introduction of the scheme that approximately 7,000 employees would avail of it over the first five-year period of its operation at a cost of &euro;0.4 million in a full year.  However anecdotal evidence would suggest that the scheme has been considerably more successful than this.  The exemption may apply only once in any five year period in respect of any employee. </p></reply>

In the letter, the Commissioners asked these property owners to reply to Revenue indicating their payment preference for 2014.</p><p>  Letters were not sent to property owners who paid their 2013 LPT by deduction at source from salary/occupational pension or from certain Government payments or direct debit, or to those who opted to defer their full LPT liability or those who claimed an exemption, as all of these options will simply roll over and continue to apply for 2014.   No action is required to be taken by these property owners, unless they wish to change to a different payment method for 2014.  </p><p><b>Payment Options</b></p><p>  As I have informed the House on numerous occasions in the past, LPT provides for a range of payment options and property owners can choose the one that best suits their particular circumstances.  I am advised that no matter how the LPT charge for 2013 was paid, property owners can choose any of the available options to pay their 2014 liability and can decide whether to pay the tax in full or to spread payments over the course of 2014.  Property owners can:</p><p>  - Spread their payments evenly throughout 2014 by way of direct debit or deduction from salary, pension or Government payment (direct debits commence on 15 January 2014);</p><p>  - Spread their payments by making regular payments, weekly or monthly, throughout 2014 at service providers listed (An Post, Payzone and Omnivend);</p><p>  - Pay in full by Single Debit Authority (like a cheque) which will be debited by Revenue on 21 March 2014;</p><p>  - Pay in full by 1 January 2014 through service providers listed (An Post, Payzone and Omnivend);</p><p>  - Pay by cheque or postal order by 1 January 2014;</p><p>  - Pay in full now by debit/credit card. </p><p><b>LPT Legislation</b></p><p>  Section 119 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) sets out the dates for payment of the Local Property Tax (LPT).  For the year 2014, the payment due date is 1 January 2014.  The legislation also makes provision for property owners to pay the tax for 2014 in equal instalments over the period 1 January 2014 to end December 2014.</p><p>  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no requirement on any property owner to pay their LPT for 2014 before 1 January 2014.  I can also absolutely state that no penalties apply if a person does not pay before then as the tax is not due until 1 January 2014.  The only action a property owner is required to take now is to decide on their payment method for 2014 and submit the payment instruction to Revenue by the relevant due date (which is 7 November 2013 for paper filers, or 27 November 2013 for on-line filers) and this is clearly stated in the letters recently issued by the Commissioners.  The date of 7 November is provided for in the LPT legislation (the 27 November is a concession on Revenue&rsquo;s part, in accordance with their normal arrangements for online filers).  The legislation requires property owners to advise Revenue of their payment method.  Notice is required to put the necessary arrangements in place to ensure that phased payments by way of deduction at source from employment or occupational pension income or from certain payments from the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine will start in January 2014 and spread payment of the full LPT liability evenly over the course of 2014.    </p><p>  Regarding the comparisons made in Question No. 46999/13 between the payment arrangements for LPT and those for the self-employed, I am advised that the reference to June/July is incorrect.  I am also advised that the range of options available are similar except that LPT provides significantly more flexibility by facilitating monthly direct debit payments or weekly/monthly deduction at source and cash payment options.  </p><p><b>Communications</b></p><p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputies that the process for 2014 is much simpler than 2013 because there is no need for property owners to assess the value of their properties.  Property owners are only required to confirm how they intend to pay the tax for 2014.  This was clearly indicated in the letters that issued recently.  As part of Revenue's public communications campaign, an information advertisement was included in the national and local papers during the last two weeks of October.  In addition, the Revenue website includes a dedicated page outlining what property owners are required to do for 2014.  Revenue spokespeople have also taken part in a large number of national and local media interviews and continue to do so.  The Commissioners have also issued a briefing note to all parliamentary assistants of Oireachtas Members providing clarification on what property owners are required to do now and the range of payment options that are available for paying the tax.</p><p><b>Lump sum payments by Debit/Credit Card</b></p><p>  Much of the recent public and political comment has focussed on the fact that one of the payment options available, i.e. payment on-line by debit or credit card results in immediate deduction of the liability on the day the transaction is made.  This has led to assertions that Revenue is requiring payment to be made during 2013 for a 2014 liability.  This is emphatically not the case and neither is it the case that payment by debit/credit in 2013 is the only option available to property owners who wish to pay in full in one single payment.  Those who opt to pay the tax by debit or credit card have up to 27 November 2013 to choose this payment option online.  Revenue have informed me that they are getting queries from the public as to why they do not retain credit/debit card details for a number of weeks.  The answer is that in line with data protection requirements and more specifically best practice in relation to data retention, Revenue does not and should not retain debit/credit card details for longer than is necessary to process and validate the payment and therefore cannot postpone the deduction of LPT until 2014 for this payment method.</p><p>  Given the immediacy of payment using a debit/credit card, Revenue decided to make this information point explicitly in the letters that issued recently and also to highlight the relative attractiveness from a cashflow point of view of the other 2014 payment options.</p><p><b>Other lump sum payment options &ndash; Single Debit Authority</b></p><p>  All property owners with a debit card and most with a credit card also have a bank account.  If a property owner wishes to pay in full in one payment in 2014 they have the option to make a single payment from their bank account on 21 of March 2014.  For homeowners who wish to pay by lump sum, this is the most advantageous option.  To do this property owners should select the option entitled &quot;Single Debit Authority&quot;, which is the second option, when filling out their property tax return online or fill in the form included in their paper return with their bank account details and sort code and return to the Revenue Commissioners.  The Commissioners advise that the single debit authority payment option is drawn on a person's current account in the same way as a debit card payment is and is available to all current account holders.  Property owners who opt for this method have an extended payment date to 21 March 2014.  </p><p>  Of course, property owners who opted to pay by lump sum in 2013 have the option of changing to payment by instalments for 2014.</p><p><b>Payment by Cheque/Postal Order</b></p><p>Issues have also been raised with regard to paying the tax by cheque/postal order.  The Commissioners have confirmed that property owners may send their cheque/postal order with their LPT1A Payment Instruction form to Revenue by 7 November 2013, or alternatively, they may send their cheque/postal order separately to Revenue on or before the 1 January 2014.  The taxpayer should enter the Property ID on the back of the cheque to ensure that the cheque is matched to the property.<font color="#0000FF"> </font> I am advised that a detailed &quot;Frequently Asked Question&quot; covering this point is available on the Commissioners' website at <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>.</p><p><b>Revenue Administration</b></p><p>  All matters related to the administration of LPT, and all other taxes and duties, are for the Revenue Commissioners to determine.  In relation to the concerns expressed by some Deputies regarding Revenue's administration of LPT, Revenue resourcing is subject to the same constraints as all other Government Departments and Offices but I am assured that Revenue has the same resources available for administering LPT now as when the first payment of LPT was due.  A key component of its strategy to manage the customer contact element of the project will continue to be the operation of a dedicated LPT Helpline at 1890-200-255.  This service, which is operated by a private sector call handling company on behalf of Revenue is the primary point of contact for customers and is supported by a team of internal Revenue experts for more complex queries.  </p><p>  Revenue has confirmed to me that the volume of callers to the Helpline has been heavy since the issue of the 2014 LPT notifications and the volumes are being constantly monitored by Revenue.  I am informed that extra resources have already been deployed today to the service to ensure waiting times are kept to the minimum. Revenue has also confirmed that it has deployed extra resources to its internal support service to cater for the more complex queries.  At this point there are 180 agents fully deployed to telephone call handling with a further 80 staff dealing with correspondence.  In addition, where callers leave a message with their contact details for a callback, significant numbers of these are being handled out of hours by LPT staff.  I am assured by the Commissioners that the telephone situation is already showing signs of settling down but that they have made contingency plans to further increase the capacity of the helpline, if required, as the weeks progress.</p><p>  The introduction of Local Property Tax, amounting, as it does, to the largest extension of the self-assessment system in the history of the State, represents a very great administrative challenge for Revenue.  Revenue has handled this challenge very well to date and has successfully answered in excess of 560,000 telephone calls and replied to in excess of 200,000 letters or emails since March 2013.  I want to again commend Revenue for the excellent work it has done in taking LPT from concept to a fully functioning tax in such a short period of time, including the enacting of legislation, the building of a brand new property Register, the provision of customer service to such a large volume of taxpayers and critically the lodgement of in excess of &euro;215m to date to the Exchequer.</p><p>  I do not need to remind Deputies that the Revenue Commissioners are independent in the application of the taxes and customs Acts.  Their primary role is to administer the tax and customs systems in accordance with laws passed by this House, and to secure the taxes and duties for the Exchequer which are necessary to run the country.  In that context, I regularly meet the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and I am fully satisfied that consideration has been and continues to be given by Revenue to the matters raised in all of these Questions.  In particular, I am satisfied that Revenue highlighted in all their communication that there are easy ways to pay LPT in 2014, especially phased payments but they need to be set up in advance to work smoothly for the property owners concerned.  Furthermore, I understand the Chairman will be meeting the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on Thursday next in relation to the administration of LPT, as she has done in the past. </p><p>  Finally, I am very pleased to note that in excess of 50,000 property owners have already filed and selected their payment option for LPT 2014, with some 56% using the online facility.  I am also informed that the full range of payment options are being selected by property owners and it is clear that they are making their own decisions on the payment option that best suits themselves.</p></reply>

In that respect, I have stated previously that I am satisfied with NAMA's progress to date. The Deputy may wish to note that, in the four years since its inception, NAMA has overseen the sale of loans and property with a value of close to &euro;10bn.  This includes the sale of over 7,000 individual properties.  The generation of &euro;10bn in assets sales and a further &euro;4bn in non-disposal income, mainly rental income, means that NAMA is firmly on course to meet its first major debt repayment target, that is, the repayment of &euro;7.5bn of Senior Bonds by the end of 2013.  </p></reply>

As these techniques involve the estimation of unobserved phenomena they can be prone to large revisions.  Whilst the estimates below provide an intuitive picture, the standard 'one size fits all' methodology employed by the European Commission has in the past produced counterintuitive results when applied to a small open economy characterized by nominal wage rigidities such as Ireland. </p><p>  Specifically, decomposing the headline deficit into its cyclical (portion owing to the position of the economic cycle) and structural (underlying) components is done in line with standard European Commission-approved methodology.  This approach relies on approximating the 'output gap' - the difference between observed real output levels and those (unobserved) levels that would prevail in the absence of price or wage pressures in the economy.  Applying a measure of the link between the economic cycle and the budget (a semi-elasticity budgetary parameter) to the output gap produces the cyclical-component of the budget balance.</p><p>  The structural balance is calculated as the headline general government deficit less the cyclical component, less the impact of one-off temporary measures impacting the deficit. </p><p>  On the basis of <i>Budget 2014</i>   arithmetic, the table sets out the profile of the headline balance decomposed into its cyclical and structural components over the 2012-2016 period.  Future data revisions or statistical changes render these estimates subject to change.</p><p><b>Decomposition of General Government Balance (% GDP) 2012-2016</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th></tr><tr><td>1.

The structural deficit is the focus for policy and EU fiscal rules.  The impact of discretionary fiscal policy can be proxied by the change in the cyclically-adjusted primary budget balance [change in item 5 in Table above].  This change reveals policy&rsquo;s contribution to resolving the structural component of the deficit. </p><p>  Given relatively good growth potential, it is important to highlight improvements in the structural budgetary position can be achieved without necessarily involving additional taxation increases or expenditure reductions.  This can be achieved by maintaining expenditure growth below the nominal growth rate of the economy.</p></reply>

I said that tax relief on pension contributions would continue at the marginal rate of tax.  In addition, I gave an undertaking that the 0.6% pension fund levy would not be renewed after 2014.</p><p>  I considered that I was in a position to make these significant commitments on foot, among other things, of proposals in late 2012 from the pensions sector for changes to the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) regime, as an alternative to standard rating of pension tax relief, which it was claimed would yield savings and tax revenues in the region of &euro;400 million.  Pending further analysis of this claim, I included a much lower figure of &euro;250 million in the Budget 2013 arithmetic.  That analysis has since revealed significant downside risks to the achievement of even this lower level of yield or savings.  The estimate of the yield from the changes to the SFT regime which I announced in last week&rsquo;s Budget is &euro;120 million.  These changes differ in some respects from those proposed by the pensions sector and reflect, on legal advice, the requirement to protect pension rights at the date of change.  In addition, valuation factors to place a value on Defined Benefit pensions for SFT purposes will vary with the age at which the pensions are drawn down thereby improving equity within the regime</p><p>  I would not categorise my engagement with the pensions sector on this matter as an "agreement" or "bargain", in the manner suggested by the Deputies.  However, the assessment that the changes to the SFT regime required to deliver on the Budget 2013 commitment to cap taxpayer subsidies to higher value pensions would have a considerably lower yield than originally put forward, meant that the achievement of the overall budgetary objectives (including the continuation of the reduced VAT rate for the tourism sector) necessitated the imposition of the additional 0.15% pension fund levy for 2014 and 2015.  </p></reply>

Thereafter, however, we will be subject to the preventive arm of the SGP, which requires that we converge towards our country-specific medium-term objective (MTO). Article 3(1)b of the <i>Treaty on Stability Coordination and Governance</i> in EMU (TSCG or Fiscal Compact), stipulates we must 'ensure rapid convergence towards our MTO'.  In line with Article 3(2) of the <i>Treaty on Stability Coordination and Governance</i>  in EMU (TSCG or Fiscal Compact), the European Commission has prepared a 'calendar of convergence' towards Member States&rsquo; MTOs.  On this basis, the Commission foresees that Ireland will reach its MTO of a balanced structural budgetary position (net of impact of the economic cycle and temporary one-off factors) by 2018. </p><p>  Under the preventive arm, we are required to make structural correction of at least 0.5% of GDP per annum from 2016 onwards.  On the basis of <i>Budget 2014</i>   arithmetic, Ireland is projected to comply with this, despite no further consolidation assumed in the fiscal arithmetic. </p><p>  The European Commission will judge progress towards our MTO on the basis of making 'sufficient progress' in structural terms, including with an assessment of compliance with the so-called 'expenditure benchmark' as outlined in the 'Six Pack'.  By constraining net expenditure growth below the medium-term reference rate of potential output, this can deliver an improvement in the structural balance without the need for recourse to further expenditure cuts or revenue increases. </p></reply>

I also indicated, however, that I would be introducing an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15%.  I am doing this to continue to help fund the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>  , including the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate for the tourism sector which was due to end this year and to make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties.  The additional levy, within the existing legal framework, will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015. </p><p>  In Budget 2013, I made a number of commitments in relation to the tax provisions affecting supplementary pension provision.  I said that tax relief on pension contributions would continue at the marginal rate of tax.  In addition, I gave an undertaking that the 0.6% pension fund levy would not be renewed after 2014 (and this remains the case).</p><p>  I considered that I was in a position to make these significant commitments, on foot of, among other things, proposals in late 2012 from the pensions sector for changes to the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) regime, as an alternative to standard rating of pension tax relief, which it was claimed would yield savings and tax revenues in the region of &euro;400 million.  Pending further analysis of this claim, I included a much lower figure of &euro;250 million in the Budget 2013 arithmetic.  That analysis has since revealed significant downside risks to the achievement of even this lower level of yield or savings.  The estimate of the yield from the changes to the SFT regime which I announced in the recent Budget is &euro;120 million.  These changes differ in some respects from those proposed by the pensions sector and reflect, on legal advice, the requirement to protect pension rights at the date of change.  In addition, valuation factors to place a value on Defined Benefit pensions for SFT purposes will vary with the age at which the pensions are drawn down thereby improving equity within the regime.</p><p>  The assessment that the changes to the SFT regime required to deliver on the Budget 2013 commitment to cap taxpayer subsidies to higher value pensions would have a considerably lower yield than originally put forward, meant that the achievement of the overall budgetary objectives (including the continuation of the reduced VAT rate for the tourism sector) necessitated the imposition of the additional 0.15% pension fund levy for 2014 and 2015.  </p><p>  As regards the pension fund levy itself, it applies to the market value, on the valuation date (generally 30 June each year), of assets under management in pension funds and pension plans approved under Irish tax legislation.  It is not a charge on all supplementary private sector pensions in payment.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the person responsible for payment of the levy is the &quot;chargeable person&quot;, as defined in the legislation, rather than the pension scheme itself.  The chargeable person, as respects pension scheme assets held under contracts of assurance, is the insurer, and as respects other pension scheme assets is the administrator of the pension scheme.  The administrator is defined in the relevant legislation as meaning the trustees or other persons having the management of the assets of the scheme. </p><p>  In light of the fact that it is the chargeable person that is liable for payment of the pension fund levy in respect of the pension schemes for which they are responsible, I am further advised by the Commissioners that it is not possible to state the exact number of pension arrangements that have been subjected to the levy in each of the years 2011, 2012 and 2013. </p><p>  The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.  It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.</p><p>  Finally, the Deputy makes reference to a levy on public service pensions.  I assume the Deputy is referring to the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR). The PSPR was introduced on 1 January 2011 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010.  The PSPR is not a levy.  It is a pension cut affecting certain public service pensions. </p><p>  At the time of its introduction, the PSPR was designed to cut all public service pensions above &euro;12,000 in payment or awarded up to the end of a &quot;grace period&quot;, which ultimately expired at the end of February 2012.  The PSPR did not originally apply to any pensions of post-grace period retirees, on the basis that their pension awards had otherwise been reduced by being based on actual reduced pay rates reflective of the 2010 pay cuts, not &quot;pre-cut&quot; pay rates as applied to retirees during the grace period.  On introduction, the PSPR was estimated as reducing public service pensions by 4% on average, with more severe effects experienced at higher pension levels due to the progressive multi-band structure of the reduction.</p><p>  A change to PSPR was made on 1 January 2012, when a 20% reduction rate (previously 12%) was imposed on pension amounts above &euro;100,000.

However, the Budget was agreed by the Government before its announcement on Budget day.  As I stated in my Budget day speech, from 16 October 2013, tax relief for medical insurance premiums will be restricted to the first &euro;1,000 per adult and the first &euro;500 per child insured.  Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings will no longer qualify for tax relief. </p><p>  The new ceilings will ensure some continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase medical insurance policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.   </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that based on 2012 data, the most up to date data available, it is estimated that up to 577,000 policy holders, which equates to just under 53% of all policies, may be affected by this measure.  The Revenue estimate is based on an analysis carried out on the annual returns and the gross premium prices (i.e. before tax relief at source is applied) submitted by the Health Insurers in respect of the 2012 tax year.  The basis for the industry estimate is not known.</p><p>  I should point out that many will only be affected marginally, depending on the cost of the policies that individuals purchase.  In addition, individuals can of course opt for less expensive policies and therefore avoid the impact of this measure entirely. </p><p>  The legislation underpinning the new ceilings has been included in Section 8 of Finance (No.2) Bill 2013.</p></reply>

I would also like to make clear that this measure will have no impact on retirement lump sums paid under Revenue approved occupational pension arrangements and under statutory schemes.</p><p>  Ex-gratia payments can be given in addition to statutory redundancy payments on the termination of the holding of an office or employment, or alternatively on death or disablement grounds.</p><p>  Statutory redundancy payments are exempt from income tax.  Furthermore, there are additional exemption limits for ex-gratia redundancy payments or retirement gratuities in excess of the statutory redundancy amount, which apply to all employees and office holders in receipt of such ex-gratia payments. These are;</p><p>  - a basic exemption of &euro;10,160 plus &euro;765 per complete year of actual service in excess of the statutory redundancy payment;</p><p><b>Or</b></p><p>- Standard Capital Superannuation Benefit i.e. 1/15th of the person&rsquo;s annual income (average of the last three years) for each year of employment <i>less</i>   any tax-free lump sum which is received or receivable under any approved or statutory pension scheme.</p><p>  It is open to the taxpayer to choose whichever relief is of most benefit.</p><p>  The basic exemption from income tax as outlined above can be further increased by up to &euro;10,000 if the person is not a member of an occupational pension scheme.  (This can only be claimed if the person has not made any claims in respect of a lump sum retirement gratuity received in the previous 10 tax years.)</p><p>  Any balance of the ex-gratia payment after the calculation of the exemptions and reliefs is liable to income tax.  An additional relief called Top Slicing Relief, which ensures that an individual&rsquo;s average tax rate for the previous three years applies to such lump sums rather than the marginal rate of tax, is available in relation to this taxable amount.  Given the budgetary constraints, the Government has decided to abolish Top Slicing Relief in respect of all ex-gratia payments made on or after 1 January 2014.</p></reply>

The Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit will be of the same value, i.e. &euro;1,650, as the existing One-Parent Family Tax Credit and will also carry the same entitlement to the extended standard rate tax band of &euro;36,800 per annum.  The new credit will be targeted such that it is available <i>only</i> to the primary carer of the child. A maximum of one credit will be available per single carer/claimant, regardless of whether he or she cares for more than one child. This is the same condition that applies to the current One-Parent Family Tax Credit.  Given the difficult fiscal environment it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.  A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child is unsustainable.</p><p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the One-Parent Family Tax Credit plays a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.  However, in its recommendations it concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer only. The restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.</p><p>  Allocation of childcare responsibilities is primarily for parents to agree. Practical implementation issues are being considered as part of the Finance Bill process.</p></reply>

The impact of these decisions on tax revenue and employment is also modelled.  In relation to the specific example, when discussing the merits of such a measure it is important not to lose sight of the current fiscal position. Despite the considerable progress made in recent years, Ireland&rsquo;s budget deficit remains one of the highest in Europe. In this context the opportunity cost of any large-scale revenue stimulus would be considerable. Moreover, any revenue shortfalls would have to be made up from alternative measures in order to continue to meet our deficit targets.</p><p>  It should be recalled that Ireland is a small, open economy with imports accounting for over three quarters of GDP. It is therefore likely that a considerable amount of additional household expenditure would leak out through an increase in imports.</p><p>  Finally I would say that while there is a clear need to address the fiscal imbalances of the State, this Government is cognizant of the pitfalls of excessively taxing labour. Reflecting this, the Programme for Government contained commitments to not increase the income tax rate and Budget 2014 included no increases in income tax or the Universal Social Charge. This, I feel, further demonstrates our commitment to encouraging labour supply and supporting employment growth into the future.</p></reply>

The position is that in September 2011, as part of a Revenue Audit, income tax assessments of &euro;27,633.46 and &euro;28,295.28 were raised for years 2008 and 2009 respectively. These assessments were made in the absence of returns and following failure by the taxpayer to cooperate with the auditor or provide satisfactory explanations to queries raised. There was no response to these assessments or to the subsequent demands for payment nor was there any appeal made against these assessments.  In the circumstances Notices of Attachment issued in January 2012 which resulted in the payment of &euro;41,771.50. This amount was credited against Income Tax for the years under audit.</p><p>  The Revenue audit was eventually concluded and a settlement formally agreed on 30th April 2013. The overall liabilities amounted to &euro;16,199.08. Having regard to the &quot;attachment&quot; payment, this left a net overpayment of &euro;25,572.42 which was repaid on 19th June 2013.</p><p>  Under the provisions of section 865A(2), Taxes Consolidated Act 1997 (as amended) interest on repayment of tax arises only after 93 days from the day on which the claim to repayment of tax becomes a valid claim. This claim did not become a valid claim until 30th April 2013, the date on which the audit settlement was formally agreed with Revenue. As the repayment was made on 19th June 2013, which was less than 93 days after the claim became a valid claim, there is no entitlement to an interest payment under the legislation.</p><p>  Revenue&rsquo;s Complaint and Review Procedures provide customers with an open and transparent mechanism for making a complaint and seeking a review of Revenue&rsquo;s handling of a case.

I said that tax relief on pension contributions would continue at the marginal rate of tax. In addition, I gave an undertaking that the 0.6% pension fund levy would not be renewed after 2014.   I considered that I was in a position to make these significant commitments on foot, among other things, of proposals in late 2012 from the pensions sector for changes to the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) regime, as an alternative to standard rating of pension tax relief, which it was claimed would yield savings and tax revenues in the region of &euro;400 million. Pending further analysis of this claim, I included a much lower figure of &euro;250 million in the Budget 2013 arithmetic. That analysis has since revealed significant downside risks to the achievement of even this lower level of yield or savings. The estimate of the yield from the changes to the SFT regime which I announced in last week&rsquo;s Budget is &euro;120 million. These changes differ in some respects from those proposed by the pensions sector and reflect, on legal advice, the requirement to protect pension rights at the date of change. In addition, valuation factors to place a value on Defined Benefit pensions for SFT purposes will vary with the age at which the pensions are drawn down thereby improving equity within the regime.</p><p>  I would not categorise my engagement with the pensions sector on this matter as a &ldquo;bargain&rdquo;, in the manner suggested by the details supplied with the Deputy&rsquo;s question. However, the assessment that the changes to the SFT regime required to deliver on the Budget 2013 commitment to cap taxpayer subsidies to higher value pensions would have a considerably lower yield than originally put forward, meant that the achievement of the overall budgetary objectives (including the continuation of the reduced VAT rate for the tourism sector as part of the continued commitment to the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>  ) necessitated the imposition of the additional 0.15% pension fund levy for 2014 and 2015.</p><p>  As regards the restriction of tax relief on health contributions, the position is as I stated in my Budget day speech, that from 16 October 2013, tax relief for medical insurance premiums will be restricted to the first &euro;1,000 per adult and the first &euro;500 per child insured. Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings will no longer qualify for tax relief.</p><p>  The cost of Income Tax relief in respect of medical insurance has increased significantly in recent years, at &euro;404 million in 2011, &euro;448 million in 2012 and is estimated to be &euro;500 million in 2013. Despite the increasing cost of the relief, the numbers insured are estimated to have reduced by approximately 170,000 over the same period, while at the same time the level of medical cover has decreased on some policies. Against this background the increase in costs is unsustainable.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners estimate, based on 2012 data, the most up to date data available, that up to 577,000 policy holders, which equates to just under 53% of all policies, may be affected by this measure. However, I should point out that many will only be affected marginally, depending on the cost of the policies that individuals purchase. In addition, individuals can of course opt for less expensive policies and therefore avoid the impact of this measure entirely.</p><p>  The new ceilings will ensure some continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase medical insurance policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.</p><p>  It should be noted that the Commission on Taxation in its 2009 report recommended the retention of medical insurance relief but that it should be limited. The introduction of an upper ceiling on the amount of medical insurance premiums that will qualify for tax relief achieves this recommendation.</p></reply>

I should state at the outset that there is insufficient detail in the questions to allow for anything other than a general response.</p><p>  The primary purpose of the changes I am making to the SFT regime is to further restrict the capacity of higher earners to fund or accrue large pensions through tax-subsidised sources. The SFT regime addresses the problem of pension overfunding and excessive pension accrual by dealing with it at the point of pension drawdown in retirement rather than by applying restrictions to pension savings or accrual upfront. The regime achieves this by imposing a penal tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down. In this way it acts to discourage the building up of large pension funds in the first place or unwinds the tax advantage of such overfunding by clawing back, through the penal tax charge, the tax relief granted.</p><p>  The changes I am making can be summarised as follows;</p><p>  - firstly, the absolute value of the SFT is being reduced, with effect from 1 January 2014, from &euro;2.3m to &euro;2m,</p><p>  - secondly, the valuation factor to be used for establishing the capital value of defined benefit (DB) pension rights at the point of retirement, where this takes place after 1 January 2014, is being changed from the current standard valuation factor of 20 to a range of higher age&ndash;related valuation factors that will vary with the individual&rsquo;s age at the point at which the pension rights are drawn down,</p><p>  - thirdly, in calculating the capital value of a DB pension at the point of retirement, transitional arrangements provide for a &ldquo;split&rdquo; calculation where part of the pension had already been accrued at 1 January 2014 so that the part accrued up to that date will be valued at a factor of 20 and the part accrued after that date valued at the appropriate higher age-related valuation factor,</p><p>  - finally, the reimbursement options, introduced in Finance Act 2012, for public servants affected by chargeable excess tax are being amended and extended.</p><p>  As occurred on the occasion of the introduction of the SFT regime in 2005, and again when the value of the SFT limit was reduced to &euro;2.3m in 2010, the legislation contained in the Finance Bill provides for an individual who has pension rights on 1 January 2014 in excess of the new lower SFT limit of &euro;2m, to claim a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) from Revenue in order to protect or &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; the value of those rights on that date. This is subject to a maximum PFT of &euro;2.3m, and individuals with PFTs from 2005 or 2010 retain those PFTs.</p><p>  As before, the &ldquo;grandfathering&rdquo; provisions contained in the legislation reflect legal advice from the Attorney General. However, unlike previous occasions, the grandfathering arrangements this time around had to take cognisance not just of the reduction in the absolute level of the SFT from 1 January 2014, but also of the increase, from that date, in the factors for converting DB pension rights into capital value equivalents. It is for that reason, lest there be any suggestion that the changes had retrospective application, that DB rights accrued up to 1 January 2014 are to be capitalised at the existing valuation factor of 20, both for the purposes of determining if there is a PFT and for the purposes of placing a capital value on those rights at the time of retirement, where that takes place after 1 January 2014.</p><p>  The changes and grandfathering arrangements outlined above apply, as appropriate, to both DB and defined contribution (DC) pension arrangements in both the private and public sectors. As regards DB pension arrangements, it is irrelevant whether an individual is a higher paid civil servant, a Cabinet Minister or a highly paid member of a private sector DB scheme, the same SFT rules apply to all such arrangements.</p><p>  Specifically, the new lower SFT limit will apply to both DC and DB arrangements. Those in DC pension arrangements can seek a PFT from Revenue if the capital value of their arrangements exceeds &euro;2m on 1 January 2014, subject to a maximum PFT of &euro;2.3m. If the value of their DC pension arrangements is below the SFT on 1 January 2014, their funds can continue to accumulate up to &euro;2m through further tax-relieved pension contributions and fund growth, subject to the various annual contribution and earnings limits that apply, without any risk of a chargeable excess arising. Members of DB pension arrangements can equally aspire to a maximum &ldquo;tax&ndash;relieved&rdquo; fund of &euro;2m. However, in the case of DB pension arrangements, members of such arrangements do not have individual &ldquo;earmarked&rdquo; funds (as is the case in DC arrangements) and this, coupled with the fact that pension benefits in such arrangements reflect a &ldquo;benefit promise&rdquo; based on salary and service, dictates that the capital value of pension rights arising under such arrangements has to be determined in some other way.</p><p>  The SFT regime provides (and has always provided) a simple formula for this purpose. The formula essentially requires the annual amount of pension payable to an individual under the arrangement to be multiplied by a valuation or capitalisation factor in order to establish the capital value, both for PFT purposes and for the purposes of establishing the value of DB pension rights at the point of retirement. Up to now, a single valuation factor of 20 has been used for these purposes. In light, however, of the major criticism levelled at the existing SFT regime, that the fixed rate conversion factor of 20:1 was inequitable relative to DC pension arrangements given the higher market annuity rates that those with DC pension arrangements could face if they were to purchase annuities, I have moved to introduce higher age-related factors. This will substantially improve the equity between DC and DB arrangements and as between those who retire at younger ages and those who retire later in life. These are significant changes.</p><p>  The value of DB pension rights accrued up to 1 January 2014 will, under the grandfathering requirements, be valued for the purposes of the SFT regime at the existing factor of 20. If the capital value so determined exceeds the new lower SFT limit of &euro;2m, such individuals may seek a PFT from Revenue, subject to the overall limit of &euro;2.3m referred to earlier. In such cases, additional pension benefits accrued after 1 January will be valued using the relevant higher age-related factor and will, as for DC arrangements, be fully exposed to chargeable excess tax. Where the capital value of DB rights is less than &euro;2m on 1 January, such individuals may continue to accrue pension rights up to the SFT limit but those additional rights will be valued at the relevant higher age-related factor.</p><p>  Whether DB or DC arrangements are involved, on each occasion that an individual becomes entitled to receive a benefit under a pension arrangement for the first time (called a &ldquo;benefit crystallisation event&rdquo; or BCE) they use up part of their SFT or PFT, as the case may be. At each BCE, a capital value has to be attributed to the benefits that crystallise and the value is then tested against the SFT or the individual&rsquo;s PFT, as appropriate, by the pension scheme administrator. For DC pension arrangements, the capital value of pension rights when they are drawn down after 1 January 2014 is simply the value of the assets in the arrangement that represent the member&rsquo;s accumulated rights on that date, in other words the value of the DC fund at the point of drawdown. In the case of DB pension arrangements, the default position is that the capital value of such rights drawn down after 1 January 2014 is determined by multiplying the gross annual pension that would be payable to the individual by the appropriate age-related valuation factor. If the DB arrangement provides for a separate lump sum entitlement (otherwise than by way of commutation of part of the pension) e.g. most public service schemes, the value of the lump sum is added to the capital value of the DB pension to arrive at the overall capital value.</p><p>  However, reflecting the grandfathering requirements referred to earlier, where part of the DB pension has been accrued at 1 January 2014 and part after that date, the transitional arrangements provide for the part accrued at 1 January to be valued at the factor of 20 and the part accrued after that date at the appropriate higher age-related factor.</p><p>When the capital value of a BCE, either on its own or when aggregated with earlier BCEs, exceeds the SFT, or an individual&rsquo;s PFT, the excess is subject to an immediate tax charge at 41%<b>, </b>which<b></b>has to be paid upfront by the pension fund administrator and recovered from the individual. In addition, when the remainder of the excess is subsequently drawn down as a pension (or, for example, by way of a distribution from an Approved Retirement Fund or vested Personal Retirement Savings Account) it is subject to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate, thus giving rise to an effective income tax rate on a chargeable excess of some 65%, excluding any liability to USC and PRSI.</p><p>  The Finance Bill also amends and extends the reimbursement options, introduced in Finance Act 2012, for public servants affected by chargeable excess tax who are required to reimburse the public sector pension fund administrator for the upfront payment of the tax to Revenue. Unlike affected individuals in the private sector, public servants cannot minimise or prevent the breaching of the SFT or PFT by ceasing contributions or benefit accrual. The focus of the changes is to reduce the amount that can be recovered from the net retirement lump sum payable to the individual to a maximum of 20% of the net lump sum (from 50%) and to include the option of reimbursement of the pension fund administrator solely by way of a reduction in the gross pension payable over a period not exceeding 20 years.</p></reply>

It also has a commercial and statutory independent mandate and strategies applied in accordance with this mandate, including those relating to the sale of property, are a matter for the NAMA Board.  As with the detailed business of other commercial State bodies, it would be inappropriate for members of the Oireachtas to become involved in the detail of individual transactions involving NAMA. It is my view also that the effect of the proposed mechanism would be to place NAMA and, by extension, Irish taxpayers, at a commercial disadvantage relative to banks and other competing deleveraging entities. There is also a risk that such a mechanism would discourage potential buyers from participating in NAMA-related sales.</p></reply>

However, I can put forward a specific example for the information of the Deputy. The calculations presented are based on a single individual who takes up full time employment, 39 hours a week at the minimum hourly rate of &euro;8.65 per hour, which equates to an annual income of &euro;17,542 per annum.  Before taking up the employment, the individual was entitled to the full rate of Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance at &euro;188 per week. No other secondary benefits, which the individual may have been entitled to, have been included for the purpose of these computations.  Furthermore, it is assumed that the individual is not in receipt of a medical card and therefore does not benefit from the concessionary Universal Social Charge (USC) rate.  In addition, the calculations that have been computed below are on the assumption that the 15,000 jobs mentioned by the Deputy would have not been created without the reduction in the VAT rate.  The following tax credits have been included in the computation:<table><tr><th>Tax Credits</th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>PAYE tax credit:</td><td>&euro;1,650</td></tr><tr><td>Personal tax credit:</td><td>&euro;1,650</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Tax Liability 2013  </b><table><tr><th>Tax</th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Earnings</td><td>&euro;17,542</td></tr><tr><td>USC</td><td>(&euro;547)</td></tr><tr><td>Employee PRSI</td><td>Nil</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>Tax</th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Employer PRSI</td><td>(&euro;746)</td></tr><tr><td>Income Tax</td><td>(&euro;208)</td></tr><tr><td>Total Deductions </td><td>&euro;1,501</td></tr></table></p><p>  Additional tax revenues of &euro;22.5 million per annum (&euro;1,501 per annum X 15,000 employments) would be generated over a full tax year in such a case.  In addition, savings of &euro;146.6 million (&euro;9,776 per annum X 15,000 claimants) would be achieved in relation to Jobseekers payments. Therefore, the total annual benefit to the Exchequer would be &euro;169 million in this specific example.</p><p>  However, I would stress again that this is a very specific and simple analysis.  What is not reflected in the calculations is the potential costs which would have arisen had it not been for the cut in the VAT rate, such as increased numbers on the live register.  In this context, one of the explicit goals of the measure was the retention of existing staff whom would otherwise have lost their job, by improving the margins for operators in these labour intensive sectors.  While, it is not possible to readily place a figure on this, I am confident that this is indeed the case.</p></reply>

This was estimated to yield &euro;470 million a year for 4 years. The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that receipts amounted to &euro;463 million in 2011 and &euro;483 million in 2012. This is broadly in line with the amounts anticipated to be collected in those years.  &euro;534 million was collected in 2013 to date, due to an increase in the capital value of pension funds.   The Jobs Initiative announced in 2011 included a range of revenue and expenditure measures to support the protection of existing jobs and the creation of new ones. It provided for the suspension of the Air Travel Tax subject to the airlines increasing passenger numbers by restoring previously cancelled routes and by creating new routes. It also included the reduction of VAT on tourism services to 9% from 13.5% on a temporary basis until the end of 2013. A number of other tax initiatives were also included.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I announced the reduction of the Air Travel Tax to zero with effect from 1st April 2014 and the continuation of the 9% VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality sector. The decision to remove the tax, together with the retention 9% VAT rate for tourism services, will help maintain the momentum created by the success of The Gathering this year.  Since the Budget announcement, airlines have announced the opening up of new routes which will generate a significant increase in passenger numbers with the associated increase in tourism activity and employment.</p><p>  The Jobs Initiative also included a number of current and capital expenditure measures, including a number aimed at retraining the workforce. While the details of the expenditure on these measures are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin T.D., I would ask the Deputy to note that, my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton T.D., with responsibility for JobBridge, the National Internship scheme, recently announced that the number of internships, originally planned at 5,000 has now exceeded 20,000. Indecon Economic Consultants undertook an evaluation of the JobBridge scheme in 2012 (published in April 2013) and their report found that 61.4% of the JobBridge survey respondents were in employment within 5 months of finishing their internships.</p><p>  In terms of measures in the education sector, the Springboard scheme as announced in the Jobs Initiative had initially provided for 5,900 places. During 2011 and 2012, over 10,000 people enrolled on programmes under the Springboard scheme.  The scheme has been extended further with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Ruair&iacute; Quinn T.D. announcing in June this year, another 6,000 places under the third Springboard allocation. Further rollouts of the Springboard scheme will be considered in the context of the findings of an on-going evaluation.</p><p>In Budget 2014, I have introduced an additional levy on pension funds of 0.15% within the existing legal framework. This is estimated to yield &euro;135 million in a full year. I am doing this among other things to continue to help fund measures initially outlined in the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>, including the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate, which is estimated to cost &euro;350 million in a full year. The 0.15% additional levy will remain in place for 2015 while the originally announced 0.6% levy expires at the end of 2014.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-05a.386.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013110500059#WRH02200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 to 199, inclusive, together.</p><p>  I announced in my recent Budget speech that the 0.6% Pension Fund Levy introduced to fund the <i>Jobs Initiative</i> in 2011 will be abolished from the 31st of December 2014. I will however, introduce an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15%. I am doing this to continue to help fund the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>, including the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate detailed below and to make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties. The additional levy within the existing legal framework will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015.</p><p>  The pension fund levy imposes an annual stamp duty on the market value of assets under management in pension schemes approved by the Revenue Commissioners under Irish tax legislation.</p><p>  The chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.</p><p>  Individuals may be affected in different ways by the pension fund levy. I am not in a position to comment on what the precise impact of the levy will be in all cases on individuals or individual funds, schemes, members or retired members as this depends, for example, on whether and to what extent pension fund trustees and Life Offices decide to pass on the levy to individual members, given the particular circumstances of the pension funds or pension plans that they are responsible for.</p><p>  However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, in no case may the reduction in an individual member&rsquo;s or class of member&rsquo;s benefits exceed the member&rsquo;s or class of member&rsquo;s share of the levy.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that receipts to date from the 0.6% stamp duty levy on pension fund assets introduced in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2011 amounted to &euro;463 million in 2011 and &euro;483 million in 2012.</p><p>  The yield so far in 2013 is &euro;534 million. The deadline date for payment of the levy for 2013 was 25 September 2013. It is not clear at this stage if there will be any further payments received in 2013.</p><p>  The yield from the pension fund levy in 2014 is estimated at &euro;675 million. The yield from the pension fund levy at the reduced rate of 0.15% in 2015 is estimated at &euro;135 million.</p><p>The revenues arising to the Exchequer from the levy are, in common with Exchequer revenues generally, not hypothecated to any particular item of expenditure or liability but have been used to help fund the various measures introduced by the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>. One of the very significant and successful measures introduced by the <i>Jobs Initiative</i> &ndash; the reduced VAT rate of 9% on tourism and certain other services &ndash; was due to end this year. In my Budget speech, I announced the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate. I also announced that the Air Travel Tax is being reduced to zero with effect from 1 April 2014.  The combined cost of these initiatives is estimated at close to &euro;400 million in a full year.</p><p>  The <i>Jobs Initiative</i> also included a number of current and capital expenditure measures. While the details of the expenditure on these measures are a matter for my colleagues in Cabinet, I would ask the Deputy to note that the Jobs Initiative originally provided for 5,000 places under Jobbridge, the National Internship scheme and 5,900 places under the Springboard scheme. Numbers who have participated in Jobbridge have now exceeded 20,000 with an evaluation by Indecon Economic Consultants finding that 61.4% of survey respondents were in employment within 5 months of finishing their internships. The Springboard scheme, now in its third iteration, has expanded to over 16,500 places. The expansion of these schemes, reflective of their success, will require further funding from the Exchequer.</p><p>  The extent of the potential State liabilities from the pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties is a matter currently under examination by my colleague the Minister for Social Protection. As I have already indicated, however, the proceeds from the levy that accrue to the Exchequer are not set aside in the manner suggested in the question and expenditure decisions on the use of those and other funds will be made as they arise in the normal way.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that rental income for tax purposes is the gross rental income less allowable expenses incurred in earning that rent, as specified in section 97(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The main deductible expenses are:</p><p>  - any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;</p><p>  - the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;</p><p>  - the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property;</p><p>  - the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest and is subject to compliance with PRTB registration requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year); and</p><p>  - payment of local authority rates.</p><p>  In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation. These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years.</p><p>  The effect of the deduction of allowable expenses from gross rent means that the amount of taxable rental income will often be substantially lower than the gross rent, and could be nil. On that basis, it is not clear that a deduction for taxable rental income, if any, arising on the original property would be of particular benefit to the individual.</p><p>  I am also advised by the Commissioners that the existing scheme of tax relief for rent payable in respect of residential property, which is provided for in section 473 TCA 1997, does not apply to individuals who began renting property after 7/12/2010 and is being withdrawn on a phased basis over the tax years 2011 to 2018.</p><p>  [It would be incongruous if, while phasing out this relief, I was to introduce another type of rent relief in respect of residential accommodation, the benefits of which would be highly uncertain.]</p></reply>

This adjustment package comprises &euro;2.5 billion in expenditure cuts and revenue increases, complemented by additional resources/other savings of some &euro;0.6 billion.  As part of the additional resources/savings identified, the <i>Budget 2014</i> debt service estimate for 2014 is some &euro;0.2 billion lower than the corresponding April 2013 <i>Stability Programme Update</i> estimate. This reduction is largely due to lower than previously planned Government bond issuance and an improvement in the interest rate outlook generally for 2014.

The development of the Property Register required Revenue to extract and consolidate data in relation to approximately 2 million individual property records from across multiple sources including various Government and non-Government agencies.  Some of the properties were difficult to match with absolute certainty because of different variations of addresses and names across the different datasets.  This was particularly prevalent in rural areas which resulted in some duplication of properties on the Property Register or the incorrect association of some individuals with properties that were unconnected to them.   Throughout its communications programme, Revenue clearly stated that it was inevitable that some of the data matching would be incorrect given the scale of the project and advised all property owners who received incorrect details in regard to their properties to make immediate contact to correct the record.  Revenue also advised that, if taxpayers did not make contact, they ran the risk of being incorrectly assessed for LPT against a property they did not own or that possibly did not exist (i.e., a duplicate entry on the register).</p><p>  In regard to the specific case mentioned by the Deputy, Revenue has informed me that the person in question was categorised as a &lsquo;multiple owner&rsquo; of two properties on the Property Register.  Revenue subsequently assessed the person in respect of both properties for 2013, which was repeated for 2014.  This gave rise to the &euro;810 charge, which was &euro;405 in respect of each property.</p><p>  The person was assessed for the two properties for 2014 because, while he paid his 2013 liability on one property, he did not make contact with Revenue about the other property.  As a consequence Revenue issued an estimated notification for the &lsquo;second property&rsquo; in addition to the correct notification in regard to the &lsquo;first property&rsquo;.</p><p>  I am advised that Revenue has now contacted the person in question and has established that there is only one property involved and that the &lsquo;second property&rsquo; is in fact a duplicate.  The Property Register has been updated to reflect the correct situation and the taxpayer has been advised that his LPT liability for 2014 is &euro;405.</p></reply>

The Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit will be of the same value, i.e. &euro;1,650, as the existing One-Parent Family Tax Credit and will also carry the same entitlement to the extended standard rate tax band of &euro;36,800 per annum.  The new credit will be targeted such that it is available <i>only</i> to the primary carer of the child. A maximum of one credit will be available per single carer/claimant, regardless of whether he or she cares for more than one child. This is the same condition that applies to the current One-Parent Family Tax Credit.  Given the difficult fiscal environment it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.  A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child is unsustainable.</p><p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the One-Parent Family Tax Credit plays a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.  However, in its recommendations it concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer only. The restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.</p><p>  Allocation of childcare responsibilities is primarily for parents to agree.

Revenue also acknowledged and apologised for the error at that time.  In summary, the property in question was not included on Revenue&rsquo;s Property Register due to conflicting address information held on the various IT systems from which Revenue electronically extracted the data.  The issue was manually investigated and the properly was then included on the Register.  Unfortunately, during the upload process the person&rsquo;s payment option did not correctly transfer across to the Register.</p><p>  Revenue again apologises for the error and also accepts that it was not aware of the issue at the time the Deputy made his original representation.  However, as soon as Revenue became aware of the issue, a member of the LPT team made contact with the person concerned, to firstly offer an apology, and to explain the alternative payment options available.  A revised payment arrangement was agreed with the person and direct contact details were left with her in case she required any further assistance or clarifications.  I am assured that this contact arrangement is still in place should the person or her daughter wish to discuss the issue further.</p><p>  I note the Deputy&rsquo;s concern that the issue was only resolved because of his intervention.  However, Revenue assures me that the issue would have been identified through the various validation processes and compliance programmes that are in place to ensure the accuracy of the information stored on the Register.</p><p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that Revenue clearly indicated in all of its communications that some errors were inevitable given the scale of the requirement to build a Property Register in such a short period of time. Revenue assures me that this process is for the most part complete and it is anticipated that errors of this nature are unlikely to arise into the future.</p></reply>

The Guidance Note is published on NAMA&rsquo;s website, www.nama.ie.   If any tenant considers that his or her landlord is not engaging with them as specified in the Guidance Note, he or she can contact NAMA directly through the email address, info@nama.ie, and NAMA will seek to ensure that appropriate engagement takes place in those cases where the property concerned acts as security for NAMA loans. Clearly, in cases where the property does not secure NAMA loans, NAMA has no role to play and will make that clean to the tenant.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-05a.435.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013110500060#WRJ01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 218 to 220, inclusive, together.</p><p>  It is difficult to be definitive about the number of individuals that may be affected by the changes to the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) regime. Among other reasons, this is because the changes are likely to have both direct impacts and indirect behavioural impacts. The direct impacts will be on individuals whose pension savings or entitlements will be in excess of the reduced SFT on 1 January 2014 (and who may seek a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT)) and those whose pension savings or entitlements may be below the threshold on that date but, with future contributions or accruals, may exceed the threshold in time. For both of these groups where the SFT or PFT is exceeded at the point of retirement, chargeable excess tax will arise. However, the changes are also likely to mean that individuals (generally in the private sector) who may otherwise be affected by the amendments to the SFT, and who have the flexibility to do so, may change behaviour and opt out of additional pension saving or pension accrual, in circumstances where they can obtain compensatory payments from their employer, in order to avoid breaching the SFT or their PFT. Overall, the changes could potentially impact, both directly and indirectly, on up to 10,000 individuals in the short to medium term.</p><p>  The estimated yield from the changes to the SFT regime is &euro;120 million and is expected to arise in two main ways. Firstly, from the cessation of tax-relieved contributions to pension saving from those employees and individuals in the private sector affected in the short to medium term by the changes and secondly by the conversion, to some degree, of employer pension contributions and pension promises in respect of those employed individuals into compensatory current taxable remuneration. In addition, some of the yield will also arise from affected individuals who remain in pension arrangements and continue to contribute to them or accrue benefits under them, and will take the form of chargeable excess tax payable at retirement where their SFT or Personal Fund Threshold (PFT), as appropriate, is exceeded. This increased tax will effectively claw back any tax subsidy which helped fund the excess over the SFT or PFT.</p><p>  An individual who has pension savings or pension rights on 1 January 2014 in excess of the new lower SFT limit of &euro;2 million may claim a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) from Revenue in order to protect or &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; the value of those rights on that date. This is subject to a maximum PFT of &euro;2.3m (i.e. the value of the current SFT). For such an individual, any further pension contributions or pension accrual will give rise to a chargeable excess in due course. If the value of an individual&rsquo;s pension arrangements is below the SFT on 1 January 2014, they can continue to accumulate up to &euro;2 million through further tax-relieved pension contributions and/or pension accrual (subject to the various annual pension contribution and earnings limits that apply) without any risk of a chargeable excess arising. </p><p>  On each occasion that an individual becomes entitled to receive a benefit under a pension arrangement for the first time (called a &ldquo;benefit crystallisation event&rdquo; or BCE) they use up part of their SFT or PFT, as the case may be. When the capital value of a BCE, either on its own or when aggregated with earlier BCEs, exceeds the SFT, or an individual&rsquo;s PFT, the excess is subject to an immediate tax charge of 41%<b>, </b>which<b></b>  has to be paid upfront by the pension fund administrator and recovered from the individual. In addition, when the remainder of the excess is subsequently drawn down as a pension (or, for example, by way of a distribution from an Approved Retirement Fund or vested Personal Retirement Savings Account) it is also subject to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate, thus giving rise to an effective income tax rate on a chargeable excess of some 65%, excluding any liability to USC and PRSI. In this way,  the SFT regime addresses the problem of pension overfunding and excessive pension accrual by imposing a penal effective tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down, thus discouraging the building up of large pension funds in the first place or unwinding  the tax advantage of such overfunding.</p></reply>

This new Bill supersedes the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2012 hence the motion to withdraw that Bill.</p><p>  The new licensing system for remote operators will serve the important public interest in preventing crime and protecting consumers against fraud and will ensure that all businesses offering betting services from Ireland or to persons in Ireland are regulated appropriately.  The Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 amends, for that purpose, the Betting Act of 1931 which contains the existing provision governing licensing of bookmakers.</p><p>  Under the Technical Standards Directive, the EU Commission had to be consulted about the Bill following its publication and this led to a standstill period of a minimum of 3 months.  Scheduling of the Bill through the D&aacute;il is a matter for the Whips.  Subject to this, it is my intention to progress the Bill in the current session.</p><p>  Provision was made in the Finance Act 2011 for the taxation of remote bookmakers and betting exchanges, subject to a Ministerial Commencement Order.  This order cannot be commenced until the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 has been enacted.  Changes contained in Finance Bill (No. 2) 2013 are technical changes required to bring definitions and licensing periods in line with those contained in the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013.</p></reply>

This is subject to a maximum PFT of &euro;2.3m, and individuals with PFTs from 2005 or 2010 retain those PFTs. </p><p>  As before, the pension fund protection or &ldquo;grandfathering&rdquo; provisions contained in the legislation reflect legal advice from the Attorney General. However, unlike previous occasions, the grandfathering arrangements this time around had to take cognisance not just of the reduction in the absolute level of the SFT from 1 January 2014, but also of the increase, from that date, in the factors for converting DB pension rights into capital value equivalents. It is for that reason, lest there be any suggestion that the changes had retrospective application, that DB rights accrued up to 1 January 2014 are to be capitalised at the existing valuation factor of 20, both for the purposes of determining if there is a PFT and for the purposes of placing a capital value on those rights at the time of retirement, where that takes place after 1 January 2014. </p><p>  The changes and grandfathering arrangements outlined above apply, as appropriate, to both DB and defined contribution (DC) pension arrangements in both the private and public sectors. As regards DB pension arrangements, it is irrelevant whether an individual is a higher paid civil servant, a Minister or a highly paid member of a private sector DB scheme; the same SFT rules apply to all such arrangements. </p><p>  Specifically, the new lower SFT limit will apply to both DC and DB arrangements. Those in DC pension arrangements can seek a PFT from Revenue if the capital value of their arrangements exceeds &euro;2m on 1 January 2014, subject to a maximum PFT of &euro;2.3m. If the value of their DC pension arrangements is below the SFT on 1 January 2014, their funds can continue to accumulate up to &euro;2m through further tax-relieved pension contributions and fund growth, subject to the various annual contribution and earnings limits that apply, without any risk of a chargeable excess arising. Members of DB pension arrangements can equally aspire to a maximum &ldquo;tax&ndash;relieved&rdquo; fund of &euro;2m. However, in the case of DB pension arrangements, members of such arrangements do not have individual &ldquo;earmarked&rdquo; funds (as is the case in DC arrangements) and this, coupled with the fact that pension benefits in such arrangements reflect a &ldquo;benefit promise&rdquo; based on salary and service, dictates that the capital value of pension rights arising under such arrangements has to be determined in some other way. </p><p>  The SFT regime provides (and has always provided) a simple formula for this purpose. The formula essentially requires the annual amount of pension payable to an individual under the arrangement to be multiplied by a valuation or capitalisation factor in order to establish the capital value, both for PFT purposes and for the purposes of establishing the value of DB pension rights at the point of retirement. Up to now, a single valuation factor of 20 has been used for these purposes. In light, however, of the major criticism levelled at the existing SFT regime, that the fixed rate conversion factor of 20:1 was inequitable relative to DC pension arrangements given the higher market annuity rates that those with DC pension arrangements could face if they were to purchase annuities, I have moved to introduce higher age-related factors. This will substantially improve the equity between DC and DB arrangements and as between those who retire at younger ages and those who retire later in life. These are significant changes. </p><p>  The value of DB pension rights accrued up to 1 January 2014 will, under the grandfathering requirements, be valued for the purposes of the SFT regime at the existing factor of 20. If the capital value so determined exceeds the new lower SFT limit of &euro;2m, such individuals may seek a PFT from Revenue, subject to the overall limit of &euro;2.3m referred to earlier. In such cases, additional pension benefits accrued after 1 January will be valued using the relevant higher age-related factor and will, as for DC arrangements, be fully exposed to chargeable excess tax. Where the capital value of DB rights is less than &euro;2m on 1 January, such individuals may continue to accrue pension rights up to the SFT limit but those additional rights will be valued at the relevant higher age-related factor.  </p><p>  I am not clear on the relevance of the reference to 2054 in the Deputy&rsquo;s questions. The revised SFT regime applies across the board with effect from 1 January 2014. As outlined above, however, whether, and the extent to which the new SFT regime will have tax consequences for an individual in a DC or DB pension arrangement will depend, among other things, on the value of his/her pension savings or entitlements on 1 January 2014, having regard to the grandfathering requirements and on the extent to which such individuals continue to contribute to their pension arrangements or to accrue additional pension benefits after that date. In any situation where the SFT or an individual&rsquo;s PFT is exceeded, tax consequences will ensue. </p><p>  On each occasion that an individual becomes entitled to receive a benefit under a pension arrangement for the first time (called a &ldquo;benefit crystallisation event&rdquo; or BCE) they use up part of their SFT or PFT, as the case may be. When the capital value of a BCE, either on its own or when aggregated with earlier BCEs, exceeds the SFT, or an individual&rsquo;s PFT, the excess is subject to an immediate tax charge of 41%<b>, </b>which<b></b>  has to be paid upfront by the pension fund administrator and recovered from the individual. In addition, when the remainder of the excess is subsequently drawn down as a pension (or, for example, by way of a distribution from an Approved Retirement Fund or vested Personal Retirement Savings Account) it is also subject to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate, thus giving rise to an effective income tax rate on a chargeable excess of some 65%, excluding any liability to USC and PRSI. In this way,  the SFT regime addresses the problem of pension overfunding and excessive pension accrual by imposing a penal effective tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down, thus discouraging the building up of large pension funds in the first place or unwinding  the tax advantage of such overfunding.</p><p>  Finally, as regards pension tax reliefs for public sector and private sector employees, the position is that income tax relief is provided on pension contributions made by such employees at their marginal tax rate, subject to an annual earnings cap which operates in conjunction with age-related percentage limits. The maximum amount of annual tax-relieved pension contributions that an employee can make to pension arrangements is restricted on a graduated basis rising from 15% of their annual earnings up to age 30 to 40% of annual earnings at age 60 and over. This is subject to an overall earnings cap of &euro;115,000 per annum above which no relief on pension contributions as a percentage of earnings is given. The relief and the annual tax-relieved contribution limits apply across-the-board to all employees, regardless of whether they work in the public or private sectors.</p></reply>

I refer the Deputy to my previous answer to Parliamentary Question number 44746/13, as outlined below.</p><p>  The Department of Finance&rsquo;s budget and staffing allocation reflects ongoing ambitious objectives and goals, across a broad spectrum of economic, fiscal, financial and international policies, set out in its Statement of Strategy. This is particularly important as we target an exit from the EU/IMF programme of support and the Government has recognised this in the ECF numbers and resources allocated to the Department.</p><p>  Notwithstanding this, my Department has achieved considerable economies in a number of areas through, for example, the abolition of payable orders, efficiencies in accommodation footprint, and process improvement efficiencies. The full extent of these efficiencies is not immediately obvious because the Department has taken-on additional clients in the shared services area (these services are not recharged to the clients) and premises lease savings will accrue to the Office of Public Works vote.</p><p>  During the course of 2014 my Department will incur once-off funding costs in relation to a number of policy areas, including the Government approved National Payments Plan project. We have also included an estimate for legal fees related to actions linked to the banking sector.

The Revenue estimate is based on an analysis carried out on the annual returns and the gross premium prices (i.e. before tax relief at source is applied) submitted by the Health Insurers in respect of the 2012 tax year. However, it should be noted that many will only be affected marginally, depending on the cost of the policies that individuals purchase.</p><p>  The issue of pricing of insurance premiums is a matter for insurers. However, Revenue has further advised that if a 10% increase in health insurance premiums was applied to these figures it would result in some 653,000 policy holders, which equates to just fewer than 60% of all policies, and just under 1.3 million individuals, being affected by the measure.   </p><p>  However, this estimate assumes no behavioural changes on the part of claimants, and a 10% increase in health insurance premiums may have a significant behavioural impact and may not produce the nominal impact indicated. For example, individuals can opt for less expensive policies and therefore reduce the impact of the Budget measure or avoid it entirely. </p></reply>

The Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 put the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the performance of their functions on a fully statutory basis.</p><p>  I am advised by Revenue that there has been ongoing correspondence with the solicitor representing the persons concerned relating to an outstanding Stamp Duty issue.  The most recent Revenue letter in this regard was dated 18 October 2013, and set out in detail the issues relating to the purchase of the property in question. </p><p>  The persons concerned are the accountable persons for Stamp Duty purposes.  The late payment of Stamp Duty in the case has incurred penalties, which comprise daily interest, a statutory fine and a late payment surcharge.  These statutory charges are imposed in respect of late Stamp Duty payments.  They are designed to compensate the Exchequer for loss of revenue, to encourage timely payments and to ensure equity for the majority of taxpayers who pay their taxes and duties on time.  </p><p>  The evidence in this case is that a claim was made for a Stamp Duty relief to which the purchasers had no entitlement.  I understand Revenue has, however, noted the background to the case relating to a former legal practice.</p><p>  I am advised that the Revenue Commissioners are prepared to consider a review of the imposition of penalties in the case, if additional evidence is produced to warrant such a review.  Should the persons concerned wish to pursue this, they may contact Ms. Michelle Murphy, Revenue National Stamp Duty Office, Dublin Castle, Dublin 2 (Tel. 01.8689306).</p></reply>

Revenue is satisfied, based on a 2012 survey of smokers carried out by IPSOS MRBI on behalf of Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office of the HSE, that 13% of all cigarettes consumed are illicit, and that a further 6% are legally brought into the country.  </p><p>  I am advised that a similar survey is under way for the current year and that it is anticipated that the results will be available in the first quarter of next year. </p><p>  I am aware that there are other estimates of the incidence of illicit tobacco products in the Irish market. However, Revenue considers the figures from the IPSOS MRBI survey to be the most reliable, on the basis of the methodologies used, the consistent manner in which the surveys have been undertaken over a number of years and because the survey distinguishes between legal personal imports and illicit cigarettes. The surveys are geographically representative and also take social class, age, gender and nationality into account. </p><p>  For the information of the Deputy, the illicit cigarette market comprises not only counterfeit cigarettes, but also illicit whites which are brands primarily manufactured for the illicit market and also regular brand cigarettes purchased in lower tax jurisdictions and illegally imported to Ireland.  In the 2012 IPSOS MRBI survey approximately  2% of the 13% classified as illicit product were counterfeit.</p><p>  I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of Tobacco Products Tax and for tackling the smuggling and sale of illicit tobacco products, that they view this criminal activity as a very serious matter.  Accordingly, combating the illegal tobacco trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for them.  Revenue&rsquo;s  &ldquo;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013)&rdquo; includes a wide range of measures that are designed to identify and target those engaged in the supply or sale of illicit tobacco products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible. This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and third country basis, ongoing review of operational policies, the use of analytics and detection technologies, and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and within the country.	</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-05a.504.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013110500061#WRK03900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 248 to 250, inclusive, together.</p><p>  It is difficult to be definitive about the number of individuals that may be affected by the changes to the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) regime. Among other reasons, this is because the changes are likely to have both direct impacts and indirect behavioural impacts. The direct impacts will be on individuals whose pension savings or entitlements will be in excess of the reduced SFT on 1 January 2014 (and who may seek a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT)) and those whose pension savings or entitlements may be below the threshold on that date but, with future contributions or accruals, may exceed the threshold in time. For both of these groups where the SFT or PFT is exceeded at the point of retirement, chargeable excess tax will arise. However, the changes are also likely to mean that individuals (generally in the private sector) who may otherwise be affected by the amendments to the SFT, and who have the flexibility to do so, may change behaviour and opt out of additional pension saving or pension accrual, in circumstances where they can obtain compensatory payments from their employer, in order to avoid breaching the SFT or their PFT. Overall, the changes could potentially impact, both directly and indirectly, on up to 10,000 individuals in the short to medium term.</p><p>  The estimated yield from the changes to the SFT regime is expected to arise in two main ways. Firstly, from the cessation of tax-relieved contributions to pension saving from those employees and individuals in the private sector affected in the short to medium term by the changes and secondly by the conversion, to some degree, of employer pension contributions and pension promises in respect of those employed individuals into compensatory current taxable remuneration. In addition, some of the yield will also arise from affected individuals who remain in pension arrangements and continue to contribute to them or accrue benefits under them, and will take the form of chargeable excess tax payable at retirement where their SFT or Personal Fund Threshold (PFT), as appropriate, is exceeded. This increased tax will effectively claw back any tax subsidy which helped fund the excess over the SFT or PFT.</p><p>  An individual who has pension savings or pension rights on 1 January 2014 in excess of the new lower SFT limit of &euro;2 million may claim a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) from Revenue in order to protect or &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; the value of those rights on that date. This is subject to a maximum PFT of &euro;2.3m (i.e. the value of the current SFT). For such an individual, any further pension contributions or pension accrual will give rise to a chargeable excess in due course. If the value of an individual&rsquo;s pension arrangements is below the SFT on 1 January 2014, they can continue to accumulate up to &euro;2 million through further tax-relieved pension contributions and/or pension accrual (subject to the various annual pension contribution and earnings limits that apply) without any risk of a chargeable excess arising. </p><p>  On each occasion that an individual becomes entitled to receive a benefit under a pension arrangement for the first time (called a &ldquo;benefit crystallisation event&rdquo; or BCE) they use up part of their SFT or PFT, as the case may be. When the capital value of a BCE, either on its own or when aggregated with earlier BCEs, exceeds the SFT, or an individual&rsquo;s PFT, the excess is subject to an immediate tax charge of 41%<b>, </b>which<b></b>  has to be paid upfront by the pension fund administrator and recovered from the individual. In addition, when the remainder of the excess is subsequently drawn down as a pension (or, for example, by way of a distribution from an Approved Retirement Fund or vested Personal Retirement Savings Account) it is also subject to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate, thus giving rise to an effective income tax rate on a chargeable excess of some 65%, excluding any liability to USC and PRSI. In this way,  the SFT regime addresses the problem of pension overfunding and excessive pension accrual by imposing a penal effective tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down, thus discouraging the building up of large pension funds in the first place or unwinding  the tax advantage of such overfunding.</p><p>  The changes and pension fund protection arrangements outlined above apply, as appropriate, to both defined benefit (DB) and defined contribution (DC) pension arrangements in both the private and public sectors. In that regard, I reject the intimation in one of the questions that the approach of changing the SFT regime was chosen because it discriminated in favour of high earning public servants. Various alternative options for restricting taxpayer subsidies to large pensions, including input controls on contributions, were considered and rejected. While not perfect, output controls such as the existing maximum allowable pension fund at retirement for tax purposes (the SFT) are arguably just as effective at capping taxpayer subsidies and curbing excessive tax relieved pension savings. Moreover, the SFT approach has the added advantage of amending a system that is already in place and familiar to pension and tax practitioners alike and while the changes I am making will unavoidably add complexity to the existing system, it is in my view much less complicated than what a further separate input control approach would have involved. </p></reply>

In doing this I will not stray into the area of issues that were raised before the Court and which were appropriately dealt with in that forum.  Nor will I comment on matters which may be the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court.</p><p>  Student Transport Scheme Ltd is a company first incorporated in June 2011; it initiated the legal action against my Department in October 2011.  Bus &Eacute;ireann was joined as a Notice Party in the proceedings at the direction of the High Court. The records with the Companies Registration Office show that the sole shareholders of Student Transport Scheme Ltd are Mr Tim Doyle and Mr Brian Lynch who hold 101 and 99 shares of &euro;1 each respectively, or a paid-up share capital of &euro;200.  The company was represented in the legal action by Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates, Solicitors. </p><p>  Given the fact that the company had effectively no assets, my Department judged it prudent to seek an Order from the High Court for security for costs.  This process preceded the actual hearing of the court case.  In January 2012, the High Court gave the Department an order for security of costs.  The effect of this was to provide the tax payer with security in the event, as actually occurred, that the Department won the court case and received an order in its favour in respect of its costs.  In the absence of such security the taxpayer was at risk in relation to the costs of the action.</p><p>  The essential thrust of the legal action was to seek an Order from the High Court setting aside the existing arrangements for the provision of national school transport services.  The case was heard over a six day period in the Commercial High Court spanning the period from 10th July to 18th July 2012. During this period Counsel, on behalf of all parties (the company, the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann) advanced the detail of their respective cases and the legal arguments to the Court.  The High Court Judgement was given in October 2012.  The detail of this Judgement is available on the Courts Service website and other than to make the point that the Court found decisively in favour of the Department, I do not propose to comment further on the detail of the case. It is worthy of note that the court case was litigated in an unusually belligerent manner by the applicant. The Department is in receipt of very extensive correspondence accusing the Department of illegality, obstruction of a solicitor, tampering with evidence, perverting the course of justice and drawing purported parallels between my Department and a fiefdom of thugs in Limerick City. At trial, Senior Counsel for the company apologised for the excessive zeal of this correspondence.   Subsequent to the Court Judgement in favour of the Department the company, through their solicitor, Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates initiated an appeal to the Supreme Court.  In addition the company, again through their solicitor Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates commenced an action against two named officials of the Department, the Chief State Solicitor and a named official of the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  This action alleged contempt and sought committal of the public servants in question.  </p><p>  The Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann also sought security for the legal costs in relation to the appeal to the Supreme Court.  The underlying purpose of seeking this security was to safeguard the taxpayer against the costs to be incurred in defending this appeal.  In the event the issues of contempt/committal and security for costs came before the Supreme Court in February 2013.  The Supreme Court dismissed the contempt/committal issue.  The Supreme Court also awarded the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann security for their costs in an amount to be decided by the Master of the High Court in the event of the appeal against the High Court judgement proceeding.</p><p>  The litigation in this case continues to be conducted in a most unusual, threatening and aggressive manner.  Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates on behalf of the company, and Mr. Tim Doyle, as managing director of the company between them have written many hundreds of letters to Ministers, Deputies, the Department, Bus &Eacute;ireann, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and to individual officials and retired officials of the Department.  Elements of this correspondence allege corruption, refer to an ongoing investigation of corruption by Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates, and repeatedly raise issues and contentions which were either the subject of the failed High Court challenge and/or are proper to any appeal to the Supreme Court.  </p><p>  It should also be pointed out that earlier correspondence to Bus &Eacute;ireann contained references to bias, bribery and bullying and these allegations are now the subject of separate defamation proceedings initiated by Bus &Eacute;ireann against Mr Tim Doyle.</p><p>  I consider it necessary to bring the foregoing information to the attention of Deputies.  It is important that litigation be conducted in the appropriate objective forum, namely the Courts, and that Ministers refrain from comment on matters which are the subject of further legal proceedings. Myself and my officials have sought to respect this principle in our approach to the litigation.    The Office of the Chief State Solicitor has corresponded repeatedly with Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates pointing out that issues in relation to the proceedings should be dealt with in the appropriate process and will not be debated in the course of correspondence by either my Department or that Office.  </p><p>  Subject to provision of the appropriate security for costs as directed by the Supreme Court and as determined by the Master of the High Court, my Department will deal fully with the relevant issues and contentions raised by Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates in the context of the Supreme Court appeal.</p></reply>

The Collective Agreement provides that public servants who accept an ex-gratia redundancy payment will not be eligible for re-employment in the Public Service for a period of two years from termination of the employment. The Agreeement also explicitly states the rates at which redundancy is to be paid (see attached copy provided for information). The Agreement comprehends permanent staff, those on contracts of indefinite duration and fixed-term staff in continuous employment for more than two years, including research staff. Employers are required to notify my Department and obtain sanction before the Collective Agreement is offered to any staff member affected by a redundancy event.</p><p><b>Collective Agreement: Enhanced Redundancy Payments to Public Servants</b>Under the Public Service Agreement 2010 &ndash; 2014 the parties have agreed that Public Service numbers will be reduced in accordance with Government policy on public service numbers, as implemented through Employment Control Frameworks.  To that end, the Agreement states (paragraph 1.5) that, where the circumstances require it, the Government may offer voluntary mechanisms to exit the public service, whether generally or in specific sectors, bodies, locations or services. <blockquote></blockquote>The Agreement includes a commitment (paragraph 1.6) by public service management that compulsory redundancy will not apply within the Public Service; however this is subject to some key qualifications, namely that it is subject to compliance with the terms of the Agreement, in particular on flexibility on redeployment.  There is a saver for circumstances &ldquo;where existing exit mechanisms apply&rdquo;.  There are established practices for making public servants redundant in appropriate circumstances, on the expiry of employment contracts or where redundancy terms have been agreed or generally applied The Implementation Body established under the Agreement has noted [17 February 2012] that it was not intended that these practices would be superseded by the Agreement..  <blockquote></blockquote>It has been agreed on behalf of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Services Committee of ICTU that the following will apply, with effect from 1 June 2012, on the redundancy of a public servant as defined under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009 &ndash; 2011 Including public servants employed for a fixed term, meeting the criteria for redundancy under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2007 and to whom a redundancy payment is required to be paid in accordance with the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Work) Act 2003.   or group or class of public servants A public service employer may seek the sanction of its parent Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to make a collective agreement with a body representing relevant employees that varies some or all of the terms of this agreement. The redundancy arrangements specified under DES Circular 0058/2006 are unaffected by this collective agreement.:<blockquote>oAny <i>ex gratia</i> payment will amount to no more than 3 weeks pay per year of service, subject to the total statutory redundancy and <i>ex gratia</i> payment not exceeding either 2 years&rsquo; pay or one half of the salary payable to preserved pension age, whichever is less;<br /><br /><br />oIn accordance with the provisions in the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 - 2007, public servants in employment for less than 2 years [104 weeks] are not eligible for a severance payment (statutory or <i>exgratia</i>); </blockquote><blockquote>oA Public Servant will be advised in writing prior to acceptance of the <i>ex gratia</i> payment that s/he will not be eligible for re-employment in the public service by any public service body (as defined by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009 &ndash; 2011) for a period of two years from termination of the employment.  Thereafter the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be required prior to re-employment. This declaration will also include an authorisation that their information (PPS number and details) can be used by their employer or any other public service body for the purposes of monitoring compliance with this provision.</blockquote></p><p>This collective agreement will be reviewed from time to time in light of the prevailing economic and fiscal conditions.</p><p>_____________________</p><p> The Implementation Body established under the Agreement has noted [17 February 2012] that it was not intended that these practices would be superseded by the Agreement.</p><p> Including public servants employed for a fixed term, meeting the criteria for redundancy under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2007 and to whom a redundancy payment is required to be paid in accordance with the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Work) Act 2003.  </p><p> A public service employer may seek the sanction of its parent Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to make a collective agreement with a body representing relevant employees that varies some or all of the terms of this agreement.

The redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers is key to the Department's ability to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers. Thereafter, schools are required under the panel arrangements to fill permanent vacancies from supplementary panels comprised of eligible fixed-term (temporary/substitute) and part-time teachers. In any given year there will be a number of teachers on these panels that do not secure a permanent post. The redeployment arrangements are published annually in the staffing circular which is placed on the Department website. The redeployment arrangements for the 2013/14 school year are set out in Circular 0013/2013 which is available on the website. The arrangements for access to the supplementary panel were published in Circualar 0038/2012 which is also available on the website.</p><p>  Preparation for the staffing and redeployment process for the 2014/15 school year is currently underway in my Department. The arrangements for access to the supplementary panel will be published in the relevant circular which is expected to be placed on the Department website in the coming weeks.   </p><p>  Redeployment panels are drawn up on a diocesan basis for Catholic panels, diocesan/united diocesan basis for Church of Ireland panels and on a national basis for other patron bodies. The detail relating to numbers on individual redeployment panels is placed on the Department website when the panels are published each year. </p><p>  Outside of this process the administration of transfer requests from teachers placed on redeployment panels  is at the discretion of individual panel operators (patron bodies).</p></reply>

The provision of other supports, for example, therapeutic, speech and language support, occupational therapy, etc. is a matter for the Health Services Executive.</p><p>  It would be important from the outset to highlight that my Department's policy is focused on ensuring that all children, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary network.  This facilitates access to individual education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible, of fully/partial integration and integration with other pupils.  As each child with autism is unique, it is important that they have access to a range of interventions so that their broader needs can be met.</p><p>  In terms of the education provision for children who have autism, my Department has always recognised the importance of early intervention.  Children with autism can be enrolled in an early intervention class from the age of 3 and there are now some 76 early intervention classes in recognised primary and special schools.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will continue to establish further classes where such need has been identified.   </p><p>  My Department's home tuition scheme provides funding for children with autism are unable to access school placements and for children from age 2.5 who are too young to enrol in an early intervention class.  Children from the age of 2.5 up to 3 years receive a grant from my Department to provide for 10 hours home tuition per week.  Upon reaching the age of 3, and where the child has no school placement, my Department will increase those hours to 20 per week.  </p><p>  Children in early intervention classes benefit from a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1.  Class teachers are fully qualified and have access, through the Special Education Support Service, to training in a range of autism-specific interventions.  Each class will have a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants.  For children enrolled in early intervention classes, my Department also provides for assistive technology, specialist equipment and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place.</p><p>  My Department is ever conscious of the need to adapt existing policies and to develop new policies.  I have recently requested the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to prepare Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.  The NCSE has commissioned research which will not be finalised until mid to late 2014 and I expect that this will inform much of the work in preparing the policy advice.  Accordingly, it is not expected that the policy advice will be finalised until early 2015.  My Department will be paying particular attention to the provision of early intervention services for children with an autism spectrum disorder.</p></reply>

The remaining 55 posts are available for allocation throughout the school year, for new assessments of disability, new entrants, or emergency or late applications, in accordance with the terms of the SNA scheme. </p><p>  Of these posts allocated, there are currently 8,407 whole time equivalent SNAs employed in Primary schools, including Special schools which are designated as Primary schools. </p><p>Based on discussions with the NCSE, it may be the case that additional SNA posts above the figure of 10,575, may be required to respond to need for the current school year. This issue will be dealt with if and when it arises. The NCSE is still processing SNA applications for the current school year.</p><p>  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support each year. The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>  It is important to note that the level of SNAs required to support children with special educational needs changes from year to year in line with the enrolment of different children with different care needs. The care needs of individual children can also change from year to year. The NCSE takes these factors into account when allocating SNAs to schools.</p><p>  My Department has published a Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Analysis Review of the Special Needs Assistant scheme. This review is available on my Departments website: www.education.gov.ie.</p><p>  The Review has shown that the SNA Scheme has been successful in supporting schools in meeting the needs of students with disabilities who also have significant care needs. However, the review also found that the allocation process and the purpose of the scheme is not always fully understood. </p><p>  The review recommended that the SNA scheme should be restated to ensure an efficient allocation of SNA resources and to clarify the 'care' nature of the SNA role for parents, schools and professionals. The National Council for Special Education recently published its report on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools, which also recommended that my Department should clarify the role of the SNA, as recommended in the VFM report. It is my intention that a new Circular will be issued to schools in the near future which will provide further clarification for schools and parents with regard to the role of the SNA and the purpose of the SNA scheme.</p></reply>

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.</p><p>  Home Tuition is for educational teaching intervention only. The provision of therapeutic services such as Speech and Language Therapy, Occupational Therapy, psychological services are a matter for the HSE.</p><p>  My Department currently provides funding through the Home Tuition scheme for children with autism who are unable to access school placements and for children from age 2.5 who are too young to enrol in an early intervention class.</p><p>  Children, who have been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, can access early intervention classes from the age of 3.  Children attending such classes have access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism specific interventions, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  </p><p>  It is appropriate therefore that the qualification standard required by the Home Tuition scheme reflects that required in a school environment. Class teachers in all schools are required to be fully qualified with a qualification relevant to the sector in which they are teaching.  All primary teachers are qualified to teach in any primary or special school classroom.  Teachers have access, through the Special Education Support Service, to continuing professional development in a range of autism specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).</p><p>  I have requested the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to prepare Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.  The NCSE has commissioned research which will not be finalised until mid to late 2014 and I expect that this research will inform much of the work in preparing the policy advice.  Accordingly, it is not expected that the report will be finalised until early 2015.  </p>right">7</reply>

In relation to curricular reform the new junior cycle in post-primary schools outlines eight key skills required for successful learning by students across the curriculum and for learning beyond school. Among the key skills, one is literacy and numeracy, which includes digital literacy. In addition, the other 6 key skills in the Framework for Junior Cycle all include as elements the use of digital technology. As new specifications for the Junior Cycle are being prepared the use of ICT will become integrated across learning areas. In addition, a new short course in Digital Media literacy will be available to schools from September 2014. A draft of it will be available shortly from the NCCA for consultation. </p><p>The first step in developing a new strategy for the use of ICT in teaching and learning is the completion of an ICT census in schools. The census results are currently being analysed and the results will provide a sound research base which will in turn inform key policy decisions relating to integrating ICT in teaching and learning over the next three to five years. In the past the ICT census of schools focussed on the level of infrastructure in schools. The current census addresses a broad range of themes including:</p><p>- The impact of ICT in teaching and learning and assessment-School-wide planning for integration of ICT in teaching and learning-Continuing ICT related Professional Development (CPD) for teachers-Curriculum-relevant digital content and software resources-exploring views on the opportunities presented by integration of ICT in teaching, learning and assessment, -Obstacles to ICT integration and how they could be overcome.</p><p>In addition there will be an extensive consultation process with stakeholders and the wider public.  As part of this process, the ICT industry will be consulted in relation to technological developments.  Feedback from this process and the results of the school census will provide a sound research base to inform policy decisions on the further integration of ICT in teaching and learning over the next five years.</p><p>There are structures in place that facilitate engagement with the private sector on policy development generally and in particular, the use of ICT for teaching and learning.  The use of education applications will also be considered in the context of the strategy development.  However, it is not appropriate for my Department to engage with individual private sector companies in the development of e-learning tools or applications. </p></reply>

I have referred the draft General Scheme and draft regulations to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, to allow a full public discussion of the proposed legislative framework, including inputs from parents and the education partners. </p><p>The draft General Scheme includes proposals in relation to the provisions contained in section 10 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004. </p><p>The Joint Committee issued an invitation to interested individuals and groups for submissions on the Draft General Scheme of an Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2013. The Joint Committee's closing date for receipt of same was Wednesday 31st October. Full details of this request are available on the Oireachtas website.</p><p>In the interim, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Educational Training Board or to the Secretary General of my Department. </p><p>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.

The study looked at the achievement of children in second and sixth classes.   The study asked a series of questions about reading for fun and reading at home as well as borrowing books from the library.  Overall the study found that pupils' value and enjoyment of reading were positively linked with test scores.  Full details of the results are available on the Educational Research Centre's website (www.erc.ie).  </p><p>In 2011, Ireland participated in PIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Survey). This is an international study of reading achievement.  In Ireland it involved fourth class pupils.  It was conducted in 45 countries, including 24 EU Member States. The results were published last December. </p><p>PIRLS found that 12.3% of Irish pupils spent more than two hours a day reading outside of school on a normal school day compared to the international average of 11.0%. Nearly 45% of Irish students read for fun outside of school every day or almost every day, compared to a study average of 41.5%.  11.3% of Irish pupils never or hardly ever read for fun compared to an international average of 14%.  Irish pupils are close to or a little above the international average on reading for fun, and children who regularly do so score higher on reading tests than those who rarely read for fun.   Again, full details are available at www.erc.ie.</p><p>The results from these tests and other supporting evidence inform the development of policy within my Department.  In relation to literacy, the key policy initiative is the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy which I launched in 2011.  The Strategy acknowledges the important role of the family and community in children's literacy development and it sets out a number of objectives to support this.</p></reply>

While most of that demand will be catered for by using current capacity in the existing schools in the area and also through the proposed expansion of some of those schools, the Department forecasts indicate that a new school building may be required to meet future demand that is projected to arise in the coming years. </p><p>With the closure of the F&Aacute;S training centre in Cabra, my Department was approached to establish whether there would be an educational use for training centre property. A planning application for a 16 classroom primary school was prepared and recently submitted by my Department in relation to part of the former training centre site.  Securing the former training centre property from F&Aacute;S to meet future demand that may arise in the coming years is an effective way of using land currently in State ownership but no longer required for its original use.  </p><p>Assuming that planning for a school building is secured, my Department will have the ability to deliver 16 primary school classrooms in anticipation of meeting future needs. A decision in relation to the development timeframe and use of the property will be made at the appropriate time.  </p></reply>

The numbers in apprenticeship are currently entirely demand driven and are determined by the numbers taken on as apprentices by employers.  Apprentices are paid a training allowances by SOLAS for phases of their training spent off the job.  This allowance is equivalent to the wages they receive from their employers for on the job phases and is unaffected by the budgetary changes.</p><p>  There is no inequality of treatment between apprentices and other students in Institutes of Technology.  The Annual Student Contribution is levied on students attending Institutes of Technology. The amount due by apprentices is calculated on a pro rata basis of the time which they spend in Institutes of Technology during the academic year.  This is typically one third of the Annual Student Contribution paid by students attending for the full academic year but it can be greater for certain trades where longer periods are spent in Institutes of Technology.

Allocation of pension may be made only by a Civil Servant retiring on pension and may be made in favour of one beneficiary only.  The beneficiary may be a spouse, or a specified dependent relative nominated by the scheme member.</p><p>  Notice of allocation must be given more than six calendar months before the date of retirement.  Having lodged a valid notice of allocation, the member is required not earlier than four months before the date of retirement to undergo a medical examination by a doctor nominated by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (previously the Minister for Finance).  If the notice of allocation is in order and the Minister decides that the member is of sound health, the member will be notified accordingly and the allocation will be valid and will become effective at midnight on the date of retirement, provided the beneficiary is then alive.</p><p>  The provision for allocation of pension was introduced at a time when there was no specific provision in the Civil Service Superannuation Code to award survivors&rsquo; benefits on the death of a serving or retired officer.  A scheme to provide for such benefits was, however, subsequently introduced with effect from 23 July 1968 called the Widows&rsquo; and Children&rsquo;s Contributory Pension Scheme (now the Spouses&rsquo; and Children&rsquo;s Contributory Pension Scheme).</p><p>  With regard to the specific case in question, it has been confirmed that the scheme member did not make an application for Allocation of Pension.  The scheme member was a member of the relevant Spouses' and Children's Superannuation Scheme.  In the circumstances of this case this meant that, upon the subsequent death of the scheme member, survivor pensions became, upon application, payable to the scheme member's spouse and his dependant.  Any queries relating to the latter's entitlements under the Social Welfare code, such as &lsquo;free travel&rsquo;, would be a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

In July 2013, the rates of PSPR for some pensioners were increased and PSPR was extended to certain pensions not previously impacted.</p><p>  The effect of the PSPR and of these changes in 2013 has been to leave more funds available for other public expenditure including employment support measures.</p></reply>

In such cases of dispute in relation to the  responsibilities of private landowners, if it is not possible for the parties to resolve the matter amicably, it would be open to the aggrieved landowner to take  appropriate legal action against the offending landowner.</p><p>  Under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 Sections 48 and 49 grant powers to the Commissioners Of Public Works in certain circumstances with regard to requiring landowners or occupiers of land to repair and restore to proper condition watercourses on the land in question.</p><p>  Where the watercourse discharges into an existing Drainage District or Arterial Drainage Scheme, Section 48 allows OPW to issue a notice to a landowner to put it into proper repair and condition. If the landowner gives an undertaking to allow an affected occupier upstream to enter on their lands to maintain the channel at said affected occupier's own expense, then the notice to repair must be withdrawn. If the OPW undertakes the work, it is entitled to recoup the cost of work from the landowner.</p><p>  Under Section 49, a Minister of State or a county council may make a representation to the Commissioners, where the Council or Minister is unreasonably being denied access to execute works to improve drainage of land. The Commissioners may make a compulsory drainage order, allowing such works to be undertaken, where funds are available to the Council or Minister to carry out such drainage works.</p><p>  Under the two Sections, failure to comply with the notices or orders is deemed an offence and on summary conviction is liable to fines and/or imprisonment. The enforcement of the law in this regard is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and/or the Courts.</p></reply>

Officers appointed prior to 6 April 1995 do not pay an explicit employee contribution in respect of their &ldquo;Main Scheme&rdquo; pension (i.e. their own personal pension).</p><p>  Officers appointed on or after that date pay the following contributions:</p><p>- 1.5% of gross remuneration (i.e. basic salary plus any pensionable allowances), <i>plus</i></p><p>- 3.5% of net remuneration [i.e. gross remuneration (as defined above) less twice the maximum annual rate of the State Pension (Contributory) payable by the Department of Social Protection to a single person without dependants].</p><p>  In addition, all officers who are members of the Spouses&rsquo; and Children&rsquo;s Contributory Pension Scheme (which was compulsory for all <i>male</i> officers appointed on or after 1 January 1969 and before 1st September 1984, and is compulsory for <i>all</i>   officers appointed on or after 1st September 1984) pay contributions in respect of the benefits provided by that Scheme. The contribution rate is 1.5% of salary in respect of periods of pensionable service (e.g. they are not paid during periods of unpaid special leave, unpaid sick leave, etc.).</p><p>  Contributions for members appointed before 6 April 1995 are levied on basic salary and acting up allowances only.  Additional contributions have to be made at retirement if other pensionable allowances are taken into account when determining pension benefits at retirement. For members appointed on or after 6 April 1995, contributions are levied on basic salary and any pensionable emoluments in the nature of pay held from time to time during their career (irrespective of whether or not such emoluments are taken into account when determining the pension benefits at retirement).</p><p>  The change of PRSI status in 1995 did not affect the position of non-Established State employees in the Civil Service.  Such employees do not pay an explicit employee contribution in respect of their &ldquo;Main Scheme&rdquo; pension (i.e. their own personal pension).  The contribution rate in respect of membership of the Spouses' and Children's Scheme is 1.5% of net salary [i.e. salary less twice the maximum annual rate of the State Pension (Contributory) payable to a single person without dependants].</p><p>  Generally, the position in relation to Main Scheme and Spouses' and Children's Scheme contributions for pre and post 1995 Established Civil Servants also applies in the wider Public Service.</p><p>  Income tax relief is provided on pension contributions made by both public sector and private sector employees at their marginal tax rate, subject to an annual earnings cap which operates in conjunction with age-related percentage limits. The maximum amount of annual tax-relieved pension contributions that an employee can make to pension arrangements is restricted on a graduated basis, rising from 15% of their annual earnings up to age 30 to 40% of annual earnings at age 60 and over. This is subject to an overall earnings cap of &euro;115,000 per annum above which no relief on pension contributions as a percentage of earnings is given. The relief and the annual tax-relieved contribution limits apply across-the-board to all employees, regardless of whether they work in the public or private sectors.</p></reply>

I understand that these works will be of considerable benefit in reducing flood risk.</p><p>  However, a dispute arose between the Town Council and the contractor in relation to the latter's design proposals for the principal remaining elements of the works, which differed fundamentally from those contained in the contract.

The parties subsequently agreed to extend the ambit of the conciliation to encompass other outstanding issues on the contract. The conciliation process, which is conducted on a confidential and without prejudice basis, has been ongoing for some time and in this period the contractor has been making very little progress on the scheme. The outcome of the conciliation, which is expected to conclude shortly, will determine how the remainder of the scheme will be progressed.</p><p>  While the delay in the project is regrettable, the works completed to date have reduced the flood risk considerably and Bray Town Council and the Office of Public Works remain committed to completing the Bray flood relief scheme as quickly as possible, having regard to seasonal constraints on works in the channel due to environmental factors.</p></reply>

While savings have accrued due to the transfer of certain functions and pay reductions across the group, these are offset due to the significant start-up costs of the shared services and the transfer of maintenance service costs to OPW.</p><p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, together with the Shared Services and Office of Government Procurement functions, continues to deliver key outputs set out in the Public Service Reform Plan which was published in November 2011. This investment in the Government&rsquo;s reform agenda will yield longer term cost savings and facilitate service continuity in a smaller and leaner Public Service. When these centres are fully operational, annual savings targets are estimated as follows:</p><p>- Office of Government Procurement - <font color="#2F2F2F">The procurement reform programme is targeting up to &euro;500m of much needed savings for tax payers over the next 3 years.</font></p><p>- Peoplepoint (transactional HR) - &euro;12.5m</p><p>- Payroll Shared Services (transactional payroll and pension services) - &euro;5.6m.</p><p>  My Department has also collaborated with the Department of Finance to achieve administrative efficiencies within our shared facilities, particularly in the accommodation footprint.</p><p>  My Department is targeted with driving a very ambitious Public Service Reform Plan, which requires initial investment in order to achieve longer term efficiencies and cost savings.  Notwithstanding this, my Department continues to seek savings and, in 2014, we will fund a number of new projects while achieving a 4% reduction in Gross Expenditure. The details on the funding reductions by Programme and Administrative Budget subhead are set out in tabular format in the Budget publication which is at the following link, Appendix 1.</p><p>  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-05a.862.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013110500067#WRQ03900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 378 and 379 together.</p><p>  The competence for trade negotiations lies with the European Union.  The trade agreement between the European Union and its Member States and Colombia and Peru, was signed in June, 2012.  The agreement with Peru was provisionally applied from 1 March, 2013, and following Colombia&rsquo;s internal procedures for ratification, the agreement with Colombia was provisionally applied from 1 August 2013.</p><p>  Provisional application means that businesses have been able to benefit from all of the agreed trade preferences set out in the Agreement with Peru and Colombia as of 1 March 2013 and 1 August 2013 respectively.  Once all EU Member States have ratified the Agreement, it can fully enter into force.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s trade with Colombia is relatively small. In 2012 trade in goods and services with Colombia amounted to &euro;216 million, compared with &euro;175 million in 2011. In 2012 Colombia was ranked in 71st place in terms of our goods exports and in 42nd place in terms of our services exports. Our main exports to Colombia are medical devices, ICT equipment, food and drink products. Total trade with Peru is considerably smaller at less than &euro;50 million in 2012.</p><p>  While trade with both countries is small, Irish exporters are increasingly globalising their sales. Consequently, free trade agreements such as these are important in helping our ambitious and innovative exporters build new markets and especially where there is longer term potential for higher economic and product sector growth.</p><p>  The Agreement will open up markets for products traded between the EU, Colombia and Peru. At the end of the transition period, (ranging from 3 to 15 years depending on the sensitivity of the products to Colombian producers), there will be no customs duties at all on industrial and fisheries products and trade in agricultural products will become considerably more open. As a result, EU exporters could save as much as &euro;500 million annually in tariffs alone.</p><p>  The main benefit of the new trade regime will come from a more transparent, predictable and enforceable business environment. Better conditions for creating business links should lead to more integrated value chains and make it easier to transfer technology.</p><p>  The EU-Colombia deal includes far-reaching provisions on the respect of human rights, the rule of law and effective implementation of international conventions on labour rights and environmental protection. Civil society organisations will be systematically involved to monitor the implementation of these commitments.</p><p>  The EU is Colombia&rsquo;s third largest source of imports. Imports from the EU are mostly machinery and transport equipment. At the same time, the EU is Colombia's the second biggest export market. EU demand for Colombian products is mostly in the agricultural, fuel and mining sectors.  The Agreement should allow Colombia to diversify its exports to the EU, not only for agriculture and fisheries, but also for Colombian industrial products.

The Tribunal hears claims under 18 separate pieces of legislation, some of which are lodged as direct claims to the Tribunal and others which come to the Tribunal by way of appeal or implementation of a Rights Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation/decision.</p><p>  In relation to complaints made under the Redundancy Payment Acts, I am informed that the Average waiting period for a hearing, as at the end of October last, was 80 weeks across the 26 counties. However, in considering this figure the Deputy should bear in mind that the Tribunal conducts hearings in about 31 locations. Where the number of cases on hand in a particular location is relatively small, the Tribunal may decide to wait until a sufficient number of cases is on hands in order to make the holding of hearings in that location cost effective. In such locations, 5 days of hearings may reduce the &ldquo;waiting time&rdquo; by 30 to 40 weeks. I understand that the Tribunal targets areas with the longest waiting period and highest level of claims outstanding, within the resources it has currently available. </p><p>  The Tribunal is pro-active in driving efficiencies. Divisions of the Tribunal are sitting longer than heretofore, scheduling more cases per hearing and managing the caseload to maximise efficiency. As part of the drive for efficiencies the Tribunal streams cases that are envisaged to be more straight-forward.  These efforts have resulted in a significant increase in the number of claims disposed of over the past few years: + 30 per cent in 2010 compared with 2009, + 11 per cent in 2011 compared with 2010 and similarly + 13 per cent in 2012 over the previous year.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the efforts of the Tribunal, I believe that the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable.  This is one of the reasons why I am undertaking a root and branch reform of all five Workplace Relations Bodies. I believe it is essential that we have efficient and effective mechanisms to develop harmonious and productive workplaces and to assist employers and employees to avoid and resolve disputes. This Reform Programme of the 5 bodies, that I have commenced, will deliver a World-Class Workplace Relations structure. I propose to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure. This means that from next year two statutorily independent bodies will replace the current five.  We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure. All complaints will be dealt with by a single body of first instance where the aim will be to have a hearing within three months from the time the case is lodged.</p></reply>

On the other hand, the remit of Invest Northern Ireland, an agency sponsored by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland, is to support new and existing businesses in that region to grow and compete internationally, and to attract new inward investment to Northern Ireland.  It should be appreciated that both IDA Ireland and INI are confined in their grant giving powers to funding investments within their own jurisdictions and, in the pursuit of internationally mobile Foreign Direct Investment (FDI,) each agency must operate on an individual basis for their core marketing work. </p><p>  However, IDA Ireland, recognising the opportunity to pursue mutually beneficial cross border co-operation on aspects of economic policy and infrastructure/spatial planning, does cooperate with Invest Northern Ireland on a number of initiatives in the context of regional and all-island economic development.  Both agencies also share a strategic focus on attracting companies from the targeted sectors of ICT, Financial Services and Clean technologies.</p><p>  One of the success stories of this co-operation between the two agencies is the jointly developed the North West Business and Technology Zone (NWBTZ).  The fundamental aim has been to capitalise on the combined strengths of Letterkenny and Derry City as an economic corridor.  The focus has been on developing compatible infrastructure and property solutions, which are now in place, and make the Region more attractive for investment.</p><p>  The North West NOW project involved a total investment of &euro;35.25 million in Letterkenny, of which IDA committed to a direct investment of &euro;15.2 towards Advanced Technology and Office Buildings, construction of Letterkenny Outer Relief Road and improvements in telecommunications infrastructure including the installation of the Letterkenny Metropolitan Area Network (MAN).  Overall the joint project has drawn down &euro;10 million in EU Interreg IIIA funding (IDA &euro;4M and Invest NI &euro;6M) toward the required development of property solutions and research facilities.</p><p>  The North West NOW initiative provided the catalyst for Eircom, Bytel and BT to invest independently in the telecoms infrastructure between Letterkenny and Derry.  Consequently the telecoms infrastructure and capacity has been improved significantly.  </p><p>  Also arising out of the work of IDA and INI was the development of Project Kelvin, which is the first direct International Communications link of its kind into the North West of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It has been a cross-border venture, costing &euro;43m, between the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (DCENR) for Ireland and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment for Northern Ireland (DETI NI) and co-financed by the European Union (&euro;32.25m) to construct a direct international telecommunications link between North America, Europe and the North West of Ireland.  The North West of Ireland, including Letterkenny now has access to the same international services as found in major cities including Dublin, London, Amsterdam and New York.</p><p>  The economies of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland both have a highly educated workforce and IDA Ireland highlights this competitive advantage to prospective investors.  The skills available on both sides of the Border are presented to potential investors as a key competitive advantage of investing in the Border region of the island of Ireland.  Up to 15% of IDA Ireland client companies in the Border region employ staff living in Northern Ireland.  One of the factors which influenced Paypal in deciding to make such a major investment in Dundalk in early 2012 was the availability of a pool of skilled staff, in the large catchment area incorporating both sides of the border from which it could recruit. </p></reply>

The programme is 75% funded by the EU, through the European Regional Development Fund, and the remaining 25% is provided by the participating Member States, and has potential funding availability of &euro;256 million (&euro;70M for enterprise theme).  InterTradeIreland, the North South trade and business development body, does not fund projects approved under the Interreg Programme.  Its role is to promote cross-border trade and the development of business networks to the benefit of both jurisdictions.</p><p>  The aim of the <i>enterprise theme</i> is to help develop a more diverse and dynamic economy by addressing areas such as business support, investment in business infrastructure and networking. The individual projects cover a very wide span of extensive support measures, some tailored to assisting a wide spread of SMEs, others being more legacy infrastructural type projects.  All of the activities of the projects supported by my Department under this theme fall within these areas, and are located in the border region with a corresponding project partner located in one of the counties of Northern Ireland (excluding Belfast), which is another key funding criteria that must be met by project promoters.</p><p>  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (DJEI) co-funds 16 projects under the <i>Enterprise Development</i> theme of the Interreg IVA Programme (2007-2013) with its counterpart Department in Northern Ireland, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI).</p><p>  The first jointly approved group of projects under this theme were funded on an agreed 40% (DJEI) : 60% (DETI) basis generally.  More recently approved enterprise projects have been funded on a revised ratio of 23-27% (DJEI) : 73-77% (relevant Northern Ireland Department).  In addition, my Department also contributes to the funding of a small number of projects that have an enterprise development focus under the <i>Collaboration</i>   theme of the Interreg Programme.</p><p>  While the period of the current Programme is 2007-2013, funding for the enterprise theme did not commence until 2009.  The amount of funding provided for approved projects in the first few years was relatively small due to the lack of good quality projects.  However, as the quality improved more projects were approved, particularly in 2011/2012. </p><p>  In total, by the end of the current Interreg programme, my Department expects to have contributed &euro;16M approximately towards projects under the Programme. </p></reply>

This figure represented an increase of &euro;5.711bn or 6.9% over the figure of &euro;83.371bn for 2011, despite the slow-down in the growth of the main economies that buy our exports. </p><p>  Details of exports to France, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, Northern Ireland and United States over the period 2008 to 2012 are set out in the table accompanying this reply.  Exports of Goods and Services to &ldquo;All Countries&rdquo; are also included in this Table.  Separate data on Services exports to Northern Ireland is not published by the CSO.</p><p>  In 2012, Enterprise Ireland had a record year for exports by their client companies of &euro;16.2bn, which were up by &euro;1bn, or 6%. IDA supported companies also saw an increase in exports to &euro;122bn in 2011, (the latest figures available) which were up by 8%, from &euro;110bn in 2010.  2012, was also a particularly good year for job creation in companies supported by these Agencies, with IDA client companies creating a total of 12,722 gross new jobs. Clients of Enterprise Ireland created 12,861 gross new jobs. The export intensity of indigenous agency assisted firms has risen from 36% to 51% in the past decade. In total, agency assisted companies accounted for direct employment of 285,000 in 2011 and 294,000 in 2012, and are indirectly responsible for a similar number of jobs in ancillary and support services.</p><p>  The latest Central Statistics Office release shows that employment increased by 33,800 in the year to Quarter 2 2013, net of a reduction of 5,400 in public sector numbers.

The Action Plan has introduced a wide range of additional measures to support job creation in 2012 and 2013.  For example, arising from a commitment in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs, the Government launched JobsPlus last July.  This is a new incentive that offers employers a grant of &euro;7,500 for recruiting a jobseeker between 12 and 24 months unemployed, and &euro;10,000 for recruiting a jobseeker over two years unemployed  .</p><p>  The latest CSO employment figures show that there were 33,800 more people in employment in Quarter 2 of this year than there were in the same period last year.  Unemployment fell by 22,200 in the same period.  We have now moved from a situation where the private sector was losing over 7,000 jobs per month before this Government came to office, to the present situation where it is creating close to 3,000 jobs per month.  </p><p>  There is further evidence of the success of the Government&rsquo;s policies as the latest CSO figures last week showed that there are now 396,512 people on the Live Register, 23,000 fewer than this time last year and almost 34,000 fewer than in October 2011.  This is a very welcome turnaround considering that the Register was firmly on an upward trajectory towards 500,000 when this Government took office, and it is the first time since May 2009 that the Live Register has been below 400,000.  </p><p>  The Government will continue to build on this progress through the Action Plan for Jobs in 2014, as we transform the economy from one based on unsustainable debt to one based on enterprise, innovation and exports. </p></reply>

Sections 319 and 321 of the Companies Act 1963 provide that a Receiver must send to the Registrar of Companies an abstract detailing the assets of the company of which he has taken possession, their estimated value, the proceeds of sale of any such assets and of his receipts and payments for each six month period following his appointment. </p><p>  The onus is on the person completing a statutory filing to ensure that it complies with the requirements of the Companies Acts 1963-2012. It is a criminal offence knowingly or recklessly to file a document with the CRO which is factually incorrect. Where a statutory filing is in order on its face, and is signed and dated, the CRO accepts the filing in good faith for registration.  As a registration authority, the CRO is not in a position to check whether the numerical values entered in filings are correct or not. Where the CRO is notified of an issue relating to a filing on the public register, it will follow the matter up immediately with the presenter/receiver in order to ensure that it is satisfied, as far as practicable, that the information being filed and put into the public domain is correct. Abstracts which do not provide a breakdown of all receipts and payments are returned to the presenter for completion. The abstracts are filed under the company name and number on the register and can be accessed by the public. The data in the abstract is not stored or indexed separately and is not capable of statistical analysis. </p><p>  There is an obligation on receivers to comply with the legislative provisions applicable to them.  If a receiver does not comply with Section 319, or if applicable Section 321, the receiver is guilty of an offence. The offence may be prosecuted summarily or on indictment and the penalties are set out in Section 145 of the Companies Act 1990, as amended. </p><p>  The CRO prioritises its limited enforcement resources towards the key compliance measure of securing the filing of Section 125 of the Companies Act 1963 annual returns and financial statements by companies. No prosecutions have been instituted by the CRO in respect of filing of receivers&rsquo; abstracts. </p><p>  Section 322 (1) (a) and (2) of the Companies Act 1963 provide that if a receiver fails to file returns, accounts or other documents which he is required to do by law, and fails within 14 days of the serving of a notice requiring him to do so, a creditor or member or the Registrar of Companies may apply to the court for an order directing the receiver to make good the default within such period as may be specified in the order.</p><p>  It is a criminal offence pursuant to section 242 of the Companies Act 1990 knowingly or recklessly to notify false information to the CRO on statutory forms.

Social finance is about the availability of loan finance at affordable interest rates primarily to community-based projects. These projects, which generate a social benefit, often experience difficulties in accessing loans from mainstream lending institutions. SFF, as a wholesale lender in the social finance arena, operates through Social Lending Organisations (SLOs) that it funds, to work with, and ultimately lend to, the borrowers.</p><p>  On foot of the Programme for Government my Department developed the Microfinance proposal, in close consultation with relevant stakeholders, including the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the European Investment Bank, and more detailed discussions with practitioners already in the area of Microfinancing.

The CEBs support the indigenous micro-enterprise sector in the start-up and expansion phases and stimulate enterprise potential at local level.  They are the first port of call in terms of advice, direction, training and, in certain circumstances, grant support for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business. Contact details for the CEBs are available on .</p><p>  Work is well underway to transform the support infrastructure for small and micro businesses, which will see the CEBs as presently constituted, dissolved and re-formed as Local Enterprise Offices within Local Authorities, working under the direction and guidance of the new Enterprise Ireland Centre of Excellence.  This will ensure that Ireland has an enhanced, seamless and benchmarked support and progression pathway for small and micro business.  I am confident that this reform will bring about a new level of engagement and interaction at both national and local level in relation to enterprise support and economic recovery and growth, and will result in an enhanced, more consistent and coherent set of enterprise supports with positive effects in terms of start-up numbers and increased employment.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) offers a range of financial and non-financial supports to assist clients through all stages of the business development cycle.  These include supports for job creation and where appropriate, capital investment.  The main EI Grant offers available to client companies that are seeking to expand include the following:</p><p>  - Going Global Grant - A grant for market research costs to assist companies that have successfully established businesses in Ireland who wish to explore opportunities to internationalise as a route to growth;</p><p>  - Internationalisation Grant &ndash; A grant to support the costs of researching and exploring new international business opportunities;</p><p>  - Job Expansion Fund - Funding towards the recruitment of new employees;</p><p>  - Tailored Company Expansion Packages - support for companies who are planning   to undertake an ambitious expansion that will create employment and grow sales in international markets.  The nature of the package will be determined through discussions with Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>  The specific nature and level of support offered to EI client companies depends on the individual company&rsquo;s development needs and is assessed in consultation with their EI Development Adviser.  Development Advisers work with companies to:</p><p>  - discuss business development needs;</p><p>  - provide impartial confidential advice on business plans;</p><p>  - provide information on the wide range of financial and business development supports available from Enterprise Ireland;</p><p>  - guide client companies through the application process for relevant supports;</p><p>  - make companies aware of sectoral events and networks of relevance to their business.</p><p>  Funding decisions are broadly determined by the need for financial support for the project; potential employment and sales growth; previous funding provided to the company and, the regional location of the company.</p><p>  Companies who are not currently Enterprise Ireland clients, but who wish to contact the Agency, can do so via the &ldquo;Get Export Ready&rdquo; Helpdesk at: 01 7272829 or visit the website at:   .</p></reply>

There will now be further technical discussions based on this political agreement, which are necessary to finalise the legal text of the agreement. </p><p>  As regards agricultural products, there were concessions on both sides &ndash; that is part and parcel of negotiation.  Both the EU and Canada have sensitivities in agricultural products. These sensitivities were among the last key issues to be finally agreed, after very long and tough negotiations. Technical discussions will now take place to agree how to phase in the new agriculture concessions that have been granted by both sides. I will seek to ensure that these are as advantageous as possible to our national interests.</p><p>  I would like to point out that Irish agri business exporters also stand to gain from the hard won concessions provided by Canada. For example Canada will open for the EU a new bilateral quota of 18,500 tonnes of cheese, eliminate its tariffs on imports of milk protein concentrate, eliminate virtually all tariffs on processed agricultural products and wipe away import taxes on over 92% of agriculture tariff lines, from the first day the agreement takes effect. These are very<b></b>  significant concessions to the EU made by Canada and especially in its sensitive dairy sector.  </p><p>  The final market access agreement in agriculture contributed to both sides concluding a trade agreement that covers virtually every aspect of economic activity, and is an extremely important one for Ireland. It is the first comprehensive trade agreement with an historically close trade and economic partner and is a landmark deal between our two transatlantic economies. </p><p>  It is especially important given the close ties of family, history and culture that connect Ireland with Canada, which will help Irish entrepreneurs and innovators use the opportunities that the agreement offers, to the fullest possible extent.    </p><p>  The opportunities presented by the Agreement could add over &euro;200 million to Ireland&rsquo;s current &euro;2.7 billion bilateral trade with Canada, thus creating more jobs and contributing to our economic recovery.</p></reply>

Balbriggan is part of county Dublin and, in the period from January 2012 to date, there have been a total of 372 site visits by potential investors to the Dublin area &ndash; City and County.As Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.   Dublin is recognized as one of Europe&rsquo;s leading business locations and has been a spectacular success in terms of Foreign Direct Investment as it hosts many of the world&rsquo;s leading companies such as Google, eBay, PayPal, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Oracle, Pfizer, Amgen, IBM, Citi and Accenture.  </p><p>  There are 511 IDA client companies employing 60,793 people in permanent employment and a further 5,449 in part-time and contract positions in Dublin City and County.  Dublin traditionally has been a centre for manufacturing industry for FDI but in recent years there has been a shift away from manufacturing (due to cost competitiveness) to a more knowledge base higher value added projects in fund management, e-Commerce, Software and high-end back office.  To support this development IDA is working closely with educational authorities.</p><p>  As is evidenced with IDA Ireland investment announcements over the past number of years, a significant number of investments locate in Dublin each year.  A typical example of the type of investment being announced for Dublin is the announcement on 18th   February 2013 that Facebook, Inc. is to create more than 100 new jobs at its international HQ, Facebook Ireland, updating its status to 500 jobs in Dublin as it continues its current phase of expansion.

In the case of individuals who more than one income source, PRSI is generally paid on all forms of income.  For example in the case of an employee who also has earned income from self-employment e.g. taxi driver, he pays PRSI as a self-employed contributor on the profits from the taxi driving plus on any other unearned income he might have e.g. rental income. </p><p>   Up to 2013 certain exemptions applied to specific groups.  The removal of the exemption in relation to modified rate contributors with income from a trade or profession was introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 and the removal of the exemption in respect of employed contributors and occupational pensioners under age 66 years whose only additional income is unearned income is being provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2013.  </p><p>  This means that, with effect from 1 January 2014, unearned income such as rental income, investment income, dividends and interest on deposits and savings of the individuals who were previously exempt, will be liable to PRSI at 4%, provided the person is a chargeable person in accordance with the Revenue definition.  </p><p>  A chargeable person does not include a PAYE taxpayer (i) who does not have other income or (ii) who has an element of other insignificant income that is fully taxed through the Office of the Revenue Commissioners PAYE system (Revenue regard amounts not exceeding &euro;3,174 as insignificant).  Individuals with income exceeding &euro;3,174 must pay and file under Revenue&rsquo;s self-assessing system. </p><p>  This income will be chargeable at the Class K PRSI rate of 4%.  This new PRSI charge will not give rise to any additional social insurance benefits.  Individuals may however qualify separately for social insurance entitlements based on PRSI paid on other sources of income i.e. PRSI paid on income from their employment.</p><p>  In general the rules which apply to income for taxation purposes also apply to income for the purposes of charging PRSI.  Therefore the income on which PRSI is applied will, in general, be the same as that for charging of tax.</p><p>PRSI is payable by any person over the age of 16 years and under pensionable age who is in employment or self-employment. Generally at pension age a person is no longer liable to PRSI on any<b></b>  income regardless of its source.  Accordingly those over pension age who have rental income will not be affected. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-05a.967.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013110500069#WRS03600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 416 and 417 together.</p><p>  Family income supplement (FIS) is an in-work cash support for employees with families on low earnings. It tackles in-work poverty and provides an incentive to employment as opposed to welfare dependency.  The estimated expenditure on FIS for 2013 is expected to be about &euro;229 million in respect of some 42,000 families. An increased budget of &euro;282 million has been provided for FIS in Budget 2014.</p><p>  To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week. A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria. For low income workers with less than the minimum hours of employment for FIS and working on a casual basis up to and including 3 days per week, jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes provide in-work income support through daily disregards and tapered withdrawal of payments.</p><p>  Current Social Welfare legislation provides that FIS and jobseekers benefit/allowance cannot be paid to a person in respect of the same period.  However, a person in receipt of FIS<b></b>  whose work pattern changes can collect jobseekers benefit/allowance instead of their FIS for weeks where they are out of work, if this is financially more beneficial to them.  In this situation payment of FIS is suspended for the weeks the person is claiming jobseekers benefit/allowance.  The FIS payment resumes again for the weeks that the person is working.  The person must continue to satisfy the condition of working at least 19 hours per week or 38 hours per fortnight to avail of this arrangement.</p><p>  A P60 is one of a number of documents required in order to determine average assessable earnings. It is normal practice to look at an applicant&rsquo;s and a spouse/civil partner/cohabitant&rsquo;s earnings over a long period of time from their P60. However, if the applicant/spouse/civil partner/cohabitant have only recently commenced or changed employment or had a change to the conditions of their employment, such as reduced hours,  average assessable earnings would normally be calculated on the earnings since the relevant conditions changed.</p><p>  An integral part of the FIS scheme is that once the level of payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full time employment. An advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants can be certain that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period. This certainty is important to the success of the scheme in providing an incentive to low-paid workers with families to avail of employment opportunities.</p><p>  Persons who cannot work by reason of disability or invalidity are not eligible for this scheme as they are not engaged in full-time remunerative employment as an employee. However, once FIS has been granted, a claimant can claim illness benefit for up to 6 weeks, and it does not affect their entitlement. If a person is absent from work through illness for more than 6 weeks, payment of FIS is suspended until they return to work or until their FIS award period expires.  Similarly persons in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance are not eligible for FIS as they do not fulfil the employment condition but instead   provide full time care and attention for another person or persons. I have no plans to provide for the overlapping of these payments with FIS. </p><p>  I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, to recommend cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes can be achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Group is currently considering in-work supports and the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems, and I look forward to receiving the final report and subsequent public discussion of its recommendations.</p></reply>

These changes are expected to deliver estimated savings of approximately &euro;32 million in 2014 or &euro;72m in a full year. It is my intention to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities and to minimise the risk of them becoming welfare dependent from a young age. Such rates in respect of younger jobseekers were first introduced in 2009.</p><p>  By extending the &euro;100 jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate to ages 22, 23 and 24 the changes provide that claimants in this age bracket will be &euro;60 better off if they engage in education or training such as the back to education programme as they will then receive &euro;160 per week. Persons aged 25, had previously been subject to no financial incentive measure, will now receive &euro;144 per week. These individuals will generally be &euro;16 better off if they engage in education or training as they will now receive &euro;160 per week.</p><p>  The decision to reduce the amount of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payable to young jobseekers was made on foot of on-going consideration of unemployment and activation policy by Government. The changes are targeted measures aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.</p><p>  I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment. If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.  </p><p>  Under the new economic governance rules each Member State must submit the following year's budget to the EU Commission in October. The EU Commission will then publish an opinion no later than 30th November. The Department of Finance would have submitted a report to the Commission and to date the European Commission has not published their opinion in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s Budget 2014 package.  </p><p>  However, it should be noted that jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is a special non-contributory benefit for the purposes of EU Regulations. This status allows jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to be paid exclusively under domestic legislation and only in the country of residence.    </p><p>  In preparation for the forthcoming implementation of the Youth Guarantee, Budget 2014 contained an additional &euro;46 million to support a number of initiatives aimed at young people. These include;</p><p>  - reducing the threshold (in terms of duration of unemployment) for JobsPlus eligibility from 12 months &ndash; to 6 months or less &ndash; in the case of young people;</p><p>  - an additional intake of 1,500 young people on to the very successful JobBridge scheme;</p><p>  - ensuring that 1,000 places on the  T&uacute;s scheme are targeted at young people;</p><p>  - developing a pilot programme to support young unemployed people to take up opportunities under schemes such as Your First EURES Job; and</p><p>  - ring-fencing a minimum of 2,000 training places for under-25s by the Department of Education and Skills, under a follow-up to the successful Momentum programme that operated in 2013, with income support for participants being provided by my Department; and</p><p>  - Furthermore the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will invest in the region of &euro;2.5m next year in making funds available to young entrepreneurs via Micro finance Ireland and other business start-up schemes.</p><p>  These measures are in addition to the significant existing spend of approximately &euro;170 million per annum on employment, training and further education programmes for young people.</p><p>  The changes to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme are due to take effect from 15 January 2014.  It is not possible to determine, on a county by county basis, the numbers of claimants who will be affected. However, the table below illustrates the estimated number of recipients affected by the change to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme in 2014, 2015, 2016 and in a full year;<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Estimated recipients affected</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>13,767</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>22,756</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>28,193</td></tr><tr><td>Full year</td><td>31,577</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The cost of the telephone allowance scheme has risen each year and the number of eligible customers has increased very significantly.  In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the Telephone Allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September this year, an increase of 25%.  Each year almost 10,000 extra customers become eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients.   My overall concern in recent Budgets has been to protect the primary social welfare rates in the face of increasing numbers of recipients.  This is particularly relevant in the context of older people. As a consequence, difficult choices had to be made in relation to the continuation of some secondary benefits. The nature of the telephone market has been transformed since the introduction of the allowance in 1978 with several companies now providing a range of good value rates and bundled services including television, broadband and telephone and pay-as-you-go mobiles.   </p><p>  There are currently 17,171 customers in Co.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-05a.985.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013110500069#WRS05100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 421, 499, 504 and 519 together.</p><p>  The overall concern of the Government in this and previous budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in relation to protecting people from poverty.  To allow us to protect these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments.   The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen each year with the number of eligible customers also increasing significantly.  In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the Telephone Allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September this year, an increase of 25%.  Each year almost 10,000 extra customers become eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients.</p><p>  I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department&rsquo;s customers and particularly those who are living alone.  While we are ending the telephone allowance we have been able to keep at the same rates the other elements of the household benefits package, including the free electricity/gas allowance and the free television licence.  We have also retained the fuel allowance, free travel and the living alone increase.  I am not in a position at this time to make any commitments in relation to future budgets.</p><p>  Of course it is important to be aware that Ireland&rsquo;s pensioners as a group have the lowest consistent poverty rate and, as a group compared to the rest of the population, are least likely to be at risk of poverty - pointing to the adequacy and importance of the State pension.  Between 2004 and 2011, consistent poverty for older people (those over 65) fell from 3.3% to 1.9%.  The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate for people in that age group also reduced from 27.1% to 9.7% over the same period.</p><p>  The monthly allowances under the household benefits package are a contribution towards the cost of services; they are not intended to meet those costs in full.  The ending of the telephone allowance of &euro;9.50 per month (or about &euro;2.20 per week) will not result in the automatic removal of any landline service linked to a personal alarm.  Indeed, since the Budget announcement, I am aware that one telephone company has advertised that they will cover the value of the allowance.  I would hope that other telephone companies will consider this.</p><p>  The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephones were expensive and uncommon and a landline service was the only option available to the customer.  The market has changed enormously since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates with bundled services including television, telephone and broadband and pay-as-you-go mobiles. There are also personal security services that use mobile technology rather than land lines.</p><p>  The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government operates the seniors alert scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes. The budget allocation for 2013 was &euro;2.35 million.  There has been no reduction in this funding in Budget 2014.</p><p>  As regards the process to give effect to the changes, the household benefits package is an administrative scheme under the authority of the Minister for Social Protection.  It is administered by officials in my Department on the basis of publically available operational guidelines.  Following the Government decision as announced in the Budget, my Department amended the operational guidelines for the household benefit package. All information regarding the scheme has been updated on the Department&rsquo;s website and the Citizens Information website and a frequently asked questions section has been provided. The Department&rsquo;s information booklets have also been updated.  The telecommunications companies were advised of the changes and community and social partners were briefed on the evening of the Budget.  My officials are currently working on the information technology changes   which will be required to effect the changes.</p></reply>

The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department.  The second is the school meals local projects schemes through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects. The Government has allocated an additional &euro;2 million for the school meals programme in 2013, providing a total allocation of &euro;37 million.</p><p>  Under the school meals local projects scheme, funding is provided towards breakfast/snack, lunch and/or dinner clubs. In the academic year 2012/13 there were approximately 550 breakfast/snack clubs funded under the school meals local projects scheme out of a total of over 2,000 food clubs.  Priority for funding under the school meals locals projects scheme is given to schools which are part of the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills&rsquo; initiative for disadvantaged schools, &lsquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rsquo; (DEIS).  Schools can apply to the Department to participate in the scheme.</p><p>  In addition to the schools meals programme, the Department, through its child and social inclusion policy division, provided funding of &euro;22,500 in the form of a social inclusion grant to Healthy Food for All (HFfA) in 2013. The purpose of this funding is to support programme activities aimed at improving access to a healthy and affordable diet.  The HFfA's breakfast club initiative is one of a number of programme activities co-ordinated nationally by HFfA to address food poverty in local schools and communities. This food poverty initiative adds value to the Government&rsquo;s investment in the school meals programme. </p><p>  In Budget 2014, I announced the provision of additional breakfast clubs to support school going children in disadvantaged areas.  Officials in the Department are examining how best this can be progressed in 2014.</p></reply>

Individuals do not need to be available for work to be in receipt of Farm Assist. Jobbridge participants must be available to undertake at least thirty hours work per week.</p><p>  As at 30<sup>th</sup> October, 2013, 6,384 individuals aged under 25 years have voluntarily participated in JobBridge, of whom 4,745 have finished their internship and 1,637 are currently on JobBridge internships.  This is in line with my commitment to giving youth unemployed the opportunity to gain new skills and experiences to bridge the gap to the rest of their working lives.</p><p>  The following tables give the breakdown of JobBridge participants, and participants in the local authorities.  21% of all placements to-date have been in public sector bodies. This equates to 4,847 internships.  Of the 4,847 placements in the public sector, 1,341 jobseekers are currently on the scheme and 3,506 jobseekers have finished their placements in the public sector.</p><p>  The Indecon evaluation of JobBridge found that there is a higher rate of employment among participants who completed their internships in private sector organisations.  However, encouragingly 41.2% of all participants who undertook their internship in a public sector organisation progressed into paid employment. The high rates of progression into employment among public sector interns also show that the experience that interns gain in public sector host organisations facilitates them in gaining employment.</p><p>  Internships are advertised on the JobBridge website for eight weeks.  The scheme is voluntary and the decision to interview or how to interview candidates is a matter for the host organisation.  </p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; Total JobBridge Participants 2011 (by County/Dublin Postcode)</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Grand Total</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW               </td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN              </td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE         </td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>CORK CITY                   </td><td>306</td></tr><tr><td>CORK COUNTY                 </td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL              </td><td>105</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 1                    </td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 10                   </td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 11                   </td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 12                   </td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 13                   </td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 14                   </td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 15                   </td><td>86</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 16                   </td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 17                   </td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 18                   </td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 2                    </td><td>429</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 20                   </td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 22                   </td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 24                   </td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 3                    </td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 4                    </td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 5                    </td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 6 / 6W</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 7                    </td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 8                    </td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN 9                    </td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN NORTH COUNTY - FINGAL</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN WEST COUNTY          </td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>DUN LAOGHAIRE - RATHDOWN   </td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY CITY                 </td><td>134</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY COUNTY               </td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY                </td><td>87</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE           </td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY             </td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS               </td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM  </td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK CITY</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK COUNTY             </td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD             </td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH              </td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO               </td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH                </td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN           </td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY        </td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON            </td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO  </td><td>85</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY  (NORTH)    </td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY (SOUTH)    </td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD CITY              </td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD COUNTY           </td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH          </td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD             </td><td>102</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW           </td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>3773</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2 &ndash;

Persons who do not satisfy these criteria are not eligible to participate in the scheme.  </p><p>  A jobseeker participating on a JobBridge internship will receive a weekly top-up payment of &euro;50 in addition to their existing social welfare payment. </p><p>  If an individual on a JobBridge internship was in receipt of the fuel allowance at the time of taking up the JobBridge internship the person would retain the fuel allowance.  A person in a household participating on a JobBridge internship would not debar an eligible applicant from the fuel allowance.  One fuel allowance only may be paid per household.</p><p>  It is anticipated that the changes relating to the number and maximum cumulative duration of internships will take effect within the coming weeks.  Full details of these changes will be published on the home page of the JobBridge website .</p></reply>

The terms of reference for this group are to review the current range of youth employment services in Ireland, to assess what measures are appropriate to deliver the Youth Guarantee in Ireland and to develop an implementation plan for approval of Government and transmission to the EU before the end of the year. </p><p>  As an initial step towards preparing for implementation of the guarantee, provision has already been made in Budget 2014 for:</p><p>- increasing provision under the JobsPlus scheme for persons aged less than 25 years. </p><p>- an additional intake of 1,500 young people on to the very successful JobBridge scheme</p><p>- ensuring that 1,000 places on the  T&uacute;s scheme are targeted at young people</p><p>- developing a pilot programme to support young unemployed people to take up opportunities under schemes such as Your First EURES Job</p><p>- ring-fencing a minimum of 2,000 training places for under-25s by the Department of Education and Skills, under a follow-up to the successful     Momentum programme that operated in 2013, with income support for participants being provided by my department</p><p>- the Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation making funds available to young entrepreneurs via Micro finance Ireland and other business start-up    schemes.</p><p>  In aggregate this involves an expenditure of c &euro;46m on the initiatives announced in Budget 2014.  </p><p>  With regard to the funding of this expenditure, Deputies will be aware that the Department of Social Protection is reducing its expenditure by a total of &euro;290m in 2014. This saving is being achieved across a range of subheads and facilitates the increased provision of places for young people within the overall Government spending limits.</p><p>  In addition to these provisions in Budget 2014, young people will continue to benefit  from places already available under schemes such as the Back to Education Allowance scheme, JobBridge, VTOS and Youthreach, as well as the provision of training programmes for unemployed people funded by Solas.  </p><p>  In total it is expected that these programmes will provide over 91,000 opportunities for new participants in 2014.  Of these places just over 20,200 are specifically earmarked for young people.  This represents an increase of 4,000 places earmarked for young people over 2013, by additional provision on JobBridge, T&uacute;s and JobsPlus.  In addition young people will continue to have access to other full time schemes totalling c. 58,000 places. </p><p>  No decisions have been taken as yet with respect to provision for 2015 and later years.</p></reply>

The grant is paid automatically to all recipients of carer's allowance and half rate carer's allowance who are in payment on the first Thursday of June each year.  Every claim which is in payment on this date automatically gets the respite care grant payment.  The only exception to this is a small number of cases where a domiciliary care allowance has been stopped the previous month which automatically places a stop on the respite care grant. If this is not noticed within the short timeframe between the end of May and the first Thursday of June the respite care grant will not issue automatically.  In 2013 approximately 70 such cases occurred out of a total of approximately 45,000 carer&rsquo;s allowance recipients entitled to the respite care grant.

This new rate did not apply to certain categories of claimant including:</p><p>-  all claimants with a qualified child;</p><p>-  all claimants aged 18 and 19 who were already in receipt of or entitled to a maximum weekly rate of &euro;196 per week prior to the introduction of the measure;</p><p>-  those making a claim for jobseeker's allowance where that claim is linked to a jobseeker's allowance claim made within the previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied;</p><p>-  those transferring directly to jobseeker's allowance from disability allowance; </p><p>-  those transferring to jobseeker's allowance immediately after exhausting their entitlement to jobseeker's benefit, and</p><p>-  certain people who were in the care of the Health Service Executive during the period of 12 months before he or she reached the age of 18.</p><p>  The application of the &euro;100 per week rate was extended to those aged 20 and 21 in Budget 2010 along with the introduction of a new rate of &euro;150 per week for jobseekers aged 22, 23 and 24.  Provisions exempting certain categories of claimants from the application of the Budget 2010 measure were also introduced along the lines of those introduced in 2009 for persons aged 18 and 19. </p><p>  While an analysis of the distributive and poverty impact of the main welfare and taxation changes in Budgets 2010, including the cumulative impact of those changes in Budgets 2009 and 2010 was completed subsequent to Budget 2010, it did not include a standalone analysis of the jobseeker&rsquo;s measures detailed above. </p><p>  Budget 2014 included measures whereby the application of the &euro;100 weekly rate of jobseeker's allowance was extended to certain persons aged up to and including 24 years of age and the extension of the &euro;144 weekly rate to certain persons aged 25.  The Social Welfare and Pensions, Bill, 2013 currently before the Seanad includes provisions whereby a range of jobseekers aged 22 to 25 inclusive will not be affected by the new measure. These include all jobseekers with children and existing jobseekers aged 22 to 25 inclusive who already are in receipt of higher rates of payment.   </p><p>  My Department is now preparing an analysis of the main Budget 2014 tax and welfare measures.  This Social Impact Assessment will include an analysis of the distributive and poverty impacts of these changes on different family types as well as the impact on at risk of poverty levels.  The analysis will include the impact of the introduction of new rates for jobseekers aged under 25.  Social impact assessment is an evidence-based methodology which uses a tax/welfare simulation model developed by the Economic and Social Research Institute to estimate the likely distributive effects of budgetary measures on income and social inequalities.  I will be examining the analysis when it is finalised and I will publish it in due course.</p></reply>

The incentive is payable, on a monthly basis, over a two year period while the employee is retained in full time employment.  JobsPlus replaced the Employer Job (PRSI) Exemption and Revenue Job Assist schemes in July this year.  It is more targeted at channelling full time job opportunities to the longer term unemployed.  JobsPlus is biased in favour of those who are more long term unemployed by setting the value of the incentive at two levels: &euro;10,000 over two years to employers who employ a person 24 months or more on the live registered, and a reduced rate of &euro;7,500 over two years for those recruited who were 12 to 24 months on the live register.</p><p>  In view of the introduction of an EU-wide Youth Guarantee, which is due for implementation in 2014, my Department will offer younger jobseekers an enhanced range of opportunities in the form of internships, participation on employment schemes, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.  The full range of youth employment initiatives will be set out in the Government's plan for the implementation of the Guarantee, which is to be transmitted to the EU by the end of the year.  My Department is currently working on a range of measures, including the measures to incentivise employers to offer more job opportunities to young people by reducing the threshold for JobsPlus eligibility from the current 12 months to 6 month.  Insofar as it is possible, I intend to achieve consistency of approach across the various measures that will be introduced for 2014.</p></reply>

The support provided includes financial assistance to both the employee and the employer.  The support includes a contribution to the employee towards the cost of travelling to another EU/EEA country to attend interviews and to meet accommodation costs in the first few weeks.  The employer may receive funding towards cost of integrating the employee and for language training.  Under this EU funded programme the combined maximum amount payable is &euro;3,000.  Plans for implementation of the Youth Guarantee are being developed for submission to Government.  As part of this process, the Department is considering how Ireland can make best use of &ldquo;Your First EURES job&rdquo;.

In line with Pathways to Work, Gateway will help to bridge the gap between unemployment and re-entering the workforce.  The process of identifying work opportunities has been underway in each county and city council, including the necessary consultation with stakeholders, for some months.  Participants are being selected by a random process conducted by the Department of Social Protection from those persons in receipt of a jobseekers allowance payment for 24 month or more.  The selected jobseekers are informed that they have been selected and, if they agree, have their contact details passed to the relevant county and city council.  The council is responsible for the recruitment of the persons referred by the Department having regard to general suitability and skill set and the objectives of Gateway in providing opportunities to those will benefit most from such an intervention.</p><p>  Progress on the roll-out has been slower than anticipated with delays in the main related to the on-going staff restructuring processes of county and city councils, the need to engage with stakeholders, particularly staff representative bodies and trade unions, and operational matters relating to securing resources, identifying work and supervisory cover.  The Deputy will appreciate that my Department has no role in determining the positions that might be made available or of internal operational matters within each council area.</p><p>  Recruitment processes are at varying degrees of roll-out in 22 county and city council areas and I am hopeful that the first participants will be on the payroll shortly once Garda Vetting procedures have been completed.</p></reply>

As part of this process and to support the Department&rsquo;s activation commitments under the Pathways to Work Programme and the development of Intreo services nationally, it has been necessary to review the administration of all its services across its remit including the community welfare service (CWS)</p><p>  Overall, this is resulting in a rebalancing of resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities including the relocation of some staff to main centres, primarily Intreo offices, which will provide a full range of services, including the CWS and these will, in general, be available in one location.  Each Intreo office will have dedicated space provided for private discussion including a privacy booth and/or interview room.  </p><p>  Where the CWS has been re-structured, alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the community welfare service.  In general, this means that the frequency of available public clinics has increased, an improved phone service is available and alternative arrangements are in place for those who cannot travel, for example due to illness, including arranging a visit to the client&rsquo;s home if necessary. </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s services are continually monitored and kept under review by management taking account of the views of staff, public representatives and users of the service to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service and that these services provided are reconstituted, where necessary, to meet the changing needs of Irish society.</p></reply>

The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  There are currently approximately 10,500 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement.  The Government has provided &euro;41.8 million for the scheme in 2013.  The Government wants to provide an environment where mortgage holders can pay for and stay in their home but, where people have a genuine difficulty in meeting their financial commitments, they will have a framework to address and resolve that difficulty in an appropriate and fair way having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.  The Government&rsquo;s strategy to assist those in mortgage difficulty is built around the following measures, as recommended in the 2011 Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (Keane Group), in four main distinct areas:- Lenders providing sustainable and durable resolution options to their borrowers;- A social housing response (Mortgage to Rent);- Comprehensive advice to borrowers;- Personal Insolvency Reform.</p><p>  In the context of the overall strategy, the continued payment of mortgage interest supplement does little to assist recipients in improving the long term difficulty in addressing their mortgage problem and provides little incentive for the lender to provide sustainable solutions.  The Keane Group&rsquo;s over-arching theme was that the mortgage interest supplement scheme is not an appropriate long term support and should become a time bound payment with an appropriate exit strategy to be formulated for the recipient.</p><p>  As part of the fiscal adjustment required for Budget 2014, provision was made for the discontinuation of entitlement to mortgage interest supplement for all new applicants from 1 January 2014.  Existing customers are not affected by this measure and may retain entitlement to the scheme over the next four year period.  However, it would be expected that during this four year period, existing customers would no longer require this support through sustainable solutions being put in place, securing employment or exit strategies sponsored by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, namely the Mortgage to Rent scheme.</p><p>  Under the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, lenders are obliged to put in place Arrears Support Units to deal with borrowers under the MARP.  The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing short term mortgage difficulties can be supported is through engagement with their lender under this process.  Lenders must explore all options for repayment arrangements in order to determine which options are viable for each particular case.  These options include interest only arrangements and deferring payment of all or part of the instalment repayment for a period. </p><p>  Budget 2012 provided an amendment to the scheme that from mid June 2012 mortgage interest supplement is not payable until applicants have agreed with their lender and complied with an alternative payment arrangement for a cumulative period of not less than 12 months.  The numbers on the scheme has continued to reduce since the introduction of this condition which indicates that the MARP process has succeeded in addressing customers&rsquo; short term financial difficulties. </p><p>  I am satisfied that the range of supports implemented by this Government, including the range of information and guidance resources available, are appropriate in assisting those facing mortgage difficulties following the discontinuance of the mortgage interest supplement scheme. Further data along the lines requested by the Deputy are not available.</p></reply>

The one-parent family tax credit and the change to the single person child carer tax credit are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan T.D. and will be provided for in the Finance Bill (No. 2), 2013.  This new tax credit will be to the same value as the current tax credit and will be available to the principal carer of a child.  It will continue to act as an incentive for that parent to avail of employment opportunities. </p><p>  It is not possible to quantify the impact that the introduction of the single person child carer tax credit may have on payments made to recipients of the One Parent Family payment (OFP) who are the principal carer of their child or children.  However, as is normal practice my Department will continue to review cases where a change in circumstances is brought to its attention.</p><p>  Child care policy, including the delivery and/or expansion of child care services, is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Frances Fitzgerald, T.D.  The after-school child care scheme announced in Budget 2013 will continue to provide subsidised after-school child care places into 2014.  In addition, I have secured the agreement of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on a new strand of child care support for customers of my Department who are participating in the community employment scheme.  This new childcare support will be provided via the existing child care education and training supports scheme that is currently administered by the Department for Children and Youth Affairs.</p></reply>

If they do not improve their skills, they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.  Therefore, it is considered necessary to provide young people with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment. </p><p>  In order to incentivise young people to avail of education and training opportunities and try to avoid them becoming welfare dependent from a young age, the age related changes made to Jobseekers Allowance and Supplementary Welfare Allowance rates in 2009 are being extended. </p><p>  This decision was made on foot of on-going consideration of unemployment and incentives policy by Government.  This is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.  This measure seeks to incentivise young people towards the skills required for the labour market.  We are creating jobs and we want to ensure that our young people are well placed to take up these jobs. </p><p>  The measure encourages young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis.  Where a person is in receipt of a rate of reduced jobseeker's allowance and he or she participates in a course of education or training a higher rate of &euro;160 per week applies.  </p><p>  In preparation for the forthcoming implementation of the Youth Guarantee, Budget 2014 contained an additional &euro;46 million to support a number of initiatives aimed at young people.</p><p>  Focus Ireland have raised issues in relation to reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for younger persons.  Having regard to these issues it is intended to roll-out a pilot community employment programme specifically targeted at affected young persons in emergency accommodation.  The aim of this pilot programme will be to provide a pathway for participants out of emergency accommodation and provide them with the necessary skills and services to assist them to live independently. It is hoped that results from this pilot programme will inform wider policy development with regard to young persons in emergency accommodation.</p><p>  While the primary issue in this regard is a housing issue rather than one of income support, the Department of Social Protection has an important role in the delivery of solutions to homelessness.  Generally, this role relates to income maintenance where homeless people have entitlements to the full range of social welfare schemes subject to the normal qualifying conditions, but the Department also engages in inter-agency responses to homelessness and through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit provides assistance to people in sourcing the most appropriate accommodation available.  This ensures that where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports. In this context, the Department will continue to engage with Focus Ireland, and other stakeholders, in relation to issues relating to rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for persons under the age of 26.</p></reply>

This formal learning programme will lead to a FETAC Level 5 Major Award in Early Childhood Care and Education.  This is the minimum entry requirement for a Childcare Practitioner.  The duration of this programme will comprise of 2 years in which the Major Award will be completed and one year work practice leading to a maximum 3 year programme overall.  </p><p>  This programme involves defined standards of achievement, a career progression path, and a structure for CE participants in Early Years Services.  These changes are designed to provide a more tailored and valuable support to the provision of community childcare and to achieve greater coherence between participation on CE and the job market. </p><p>  The objectives of this policy are: </p><p>- to ensure that all Community Employment schemes with childcare places will, in the future, operate under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) framework and use the S&iacute;olta standards (the quality standards in childcare) as a developmental tool; </p><p>- to provide CE participants on childcare places who work directly with children with quality work experience, training, a clear progression path and qualifications in the childcare sector; and</p><p>- to re-align the allocation of CE childcare places under dedicated childcare schemes with the standards outlined by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>  There will be no reduction in the number of childcare places supported under CE. The locations where CE participants currently work will not change, only their employer will now be the dedicated childcare scheme for the area instead of their original CE Sponsor. Where a sponsor loses childcare places to the dedicated childcare scheme, these places can be back-filled with non-childcare related CE places.</p><p>  All CE childcare places will be co-ordinated and managed by a dedicated CE Sponsored Childcare Scheme.  The above improvements have been informed by consultation with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, County Childcare Committees and representatives of Scheme Sponsors and Supervisors.</p></reply>

In 2012 my Department spent some &euro;737m on the scheme and at the end of 2012 there were some 85,000 persons in receipt of a JB payment.</p><p>  Budget 2013 provided that the duration for which JB is paid was, with effect from April 2013, reduced from 12 months to 9 months for recipients with 260 or more contributions paid and from 9 months to 6 months for recipients with less than 260 contributions paid. </p><p>  The reduction in duration from 12 months to 9 months applied to new claimants from April 2013, and existing recipients who, in April, 2013, had been getting JB for less than 6 months. The reduction in duration from 9 months to 6 months applied to new claimants from April, 2013 and existing recipients who, in April, 2013, have been getting JB for less than 3 months. </p><p>  Individuals affected by this measure are able to apply for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, which is subject to a means test.  The rates of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance are the same as the basic rates of JB.  </p><p>  Legislation provides that, subject to the person having paid 156 or more qualifying contributions and satisfying the general scheme conditions, a person whose JB expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66.  On this basis, workers who suffer a substantial loss of employment at age 65 will not be subject to the reductions in duration provided they have paid at least 156 qualifying contributions. </p><p>  The reduction in the duration of JB was introduced given the significant pressure on the public finances and the Social Insurance Fund in particular.  The significant shortfall in the Social Insurance Fund, which is being met by the Exchequer and the prospect of acceleration of this deficit in the future, represented a daunting challenge, which needed to be addressed. The introduction of this measure will contribute towards placing the Social Insurance Fund on a more sustainable footing in the future.</p></reply>

Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office. </p><p>  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 15,981 at 1 November, 2013.</p><p>  The average waiting time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 these times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks while the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to October 2013 reducing to 34.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 26.3 weeks for a summary decision.   </p><p>  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.</p><p>  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p></reply>

Under Social Welfare legislation, the decision of an Appeals Officer is final and conclusive and may only be reviewed in the light of additional evidence or new facts.</p><p>  I understand that, following the submission of additional evidence by the person concerned, the Appeals Officer decided to set his decision aside and to re-open the appeal by way of oral hearing. In line with normal practice in the appeals office, the appeal was assigned to a different Appeals Officer on 15th October 2013. I am advised that an oral hearing has been scheduled for the week-commencing the 18th  November 2013 and that the person concerned will be notified of the arrangements for the hearing when these are finalised.</p><p>  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office. </p><p>  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 15,981 at 1 November 2013.</p><p>  The average processing time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 processing times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks while the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to October 2013 reducing to 34.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 26.3 weeks for a summary decision.   </p><p>  A similar trend is reflected in processing times for carer's allowance appeals.  In 2010 the average processing time for a carer's allowance oral hearing was 47.3 weeks while a decision requiring a summary decision took an average of 26.9 weeks.  In 2012 the average processing time for a carer's allowance oral hearing improved to 42.5 weeks and the time for a summary decision increased to 33.5 weeks. In 2013 (up to October) processing times have improved to 33.6 weeks and 27.7 weeks respectively. </p><p>  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.</p><p>  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p></reply>

In addition to this, spending on social protection accounts for nearly 40% of current Government expenditure and in the context of the current fiscal crisis savings have to be found in the social welfare system. Because the State pension is a very valuable benefit it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the social insurance fund over their working lives.  </p><p>  People who leave the workplace for homemaking/caring purposes can, if eligible, avail of the homemakers scheme which helps to provide a higher rate of pension for those who meet the qualifying conditions.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme was introduced in, and took effect from, 1994 and allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.   The scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.  </p><p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that the fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  It further confirms that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women, have and will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund due to the distributive nature of the fund.</p><p>  Women may, if they don&rsquo;t qualify for a SPC in their own right, receive either a qualified adult payment or a State pension (non-contributory) if they satisfy a means test.  The means test for the qualified adult payment takes account of the means of the qualified adult and not those of their spouse or partner.  </p><p>  A range of additional supports such as the rent supplement scheme, fuel allowance and electricity/gas allowance may also be available if the qualifying conditions are satisfied.</p></reply>

This compares to employees in respect of whom a combined 14.75% rate, under full-rate PRSI Class A, is paid giving entitlement to the full range of social insurance benefits.</p><p>  In general, where persons do not qualify for social insurance benefits they may claim means tested social assistance payments. For example, any person of working age who does not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit may claim means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. Subject to means and other qualifying conditions, self-employed persons may claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or there is reduced demand for their services. Where a person or their spouse engages in self-employment, income from that employment is assessable as means, which will typically reduce the amount of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payable.  </p><p>  Typically over 80% of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claims from self-employed persons have been awarded over recent years. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-05a.1263.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013110500075#WRY03100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 542 to 546, inclusive, and 548 together.</p><p>  The report referred to by the Deputy has its origins in discussions between Member States and the EU Commission on the relationship between the EU regulations coordinating social security systems and the Residence Directive, which sets out conditions governing the rights of residence migrants in the host country and the impact accessing social welfare benefits has on these rights. </p><p>  Some Member States, including Ireland, have raised concerns generally about access to welfare from non-active residents of other Member States and were asking for legislative change to clarify the rights of non-active people moving around the EU.  Given the nature of the issue, Member States were unable to quantify the extent of welfare tourism and, in the absence of such data, the EU Commission has resisted requests for any legislative change to date.  </p><p>  The report was undertaken by consultants on behalf of the Commission to determine the impact on the Member States' social security systems of the entitlements of non-active intra-EU migrants to special non-contributory cash benefits and healthcare, granted on the basis of residence.  Ireland was contacted by the consultants to provide information for the study but, in common with many other Member States, most of the data requested was not available as it is not collected.  The Department did provide what limited information is available on claiming by EU migrants and this has been used by consultants in conjunction with other EU data sets to draw the conclusions reached.</p><p>  Overall, the consultants concluded that the share of non-active intra-EU migrants is very small, they account for a similarly limited share of recipients of special non-contributory benefits and the budgetary impact of such claims on national welfare budgets is very low.  Member States were not consulted on the content or conclusions prior to publication and, while a detailed analysis of the report is required, some Member States, including Ireland, have already expressed concerns in relation to the methodology, data and conclusions reached. </p><p>  This is a very large and complex report which deals with a wide range of migrants including pensioners, people with disabilities, students and the unemployed and will require in-depth analysis of the statistics used and the conclusions reached before it can be commented on in detail.  However, a number of points can be made at this stage.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, there was very significant migration to this country in the years preceding the current crisis by people seeking employment.  These migrants paid social insurance contributions and income taxes while they were in employment here. Many subsequently lost jobs, and while some have returned home to their native countries, significant numbers had put down roots here and, as a result, were entitled to claim benefits when they became unemployed.  As social insurance payments became exhausted this group will have graduated to the social assistance type payments which are the subject of this report.  As the report points out 78% of the non-active migrants have been resident here for 5 to 10 years. </p><p>  The report is focusing on what are termed special non-contributory benefits which is a classification under EU regulations determined by the contingency covered by the benefit, the qualifying conditions and the manner in which it is financed.  The report suggests that such benefits form a relatively small part of a country&rsquo;s wider social welfare system. That is certainly the case with many Member States, with benefits provided on the basis of contributions made or through a general social assistance scheme, the latter not being a focus of this report. This does not apply to Ireland, as the structure of our social welfare system means that most of what we regard as social assistance (job-seekers allowance, disability allowance etc.) is classed as special non-contributory benefits and encompassed by the report.  Indeed, Ireland is one of only 5 countries providing non-contributory cash benefits to unemployed job-seekers. Arrangements differ across countries but many make payments where necessary through their general social assistance scheme.  This may explain to some extent the higher level of benefit claiming attributed to Ireland as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is classed for EU purposes as a special non-contributory benefit.   It should be remembered that all such payments are subject to the habitual residence condition so those claiming will have established strong links with this country.</p><p>  The majority of special non-contributory benefits paid by Member States are related to old age, death/disability. In most countries migrants tend to be in the lower age groups with significantly more non-active nationals than migrants aged 65 and over.  However, in Ireland the report points out EU migrants receive state pension non-contributory to a greater extent than nationals, although they represent a lower share of those aged 65 and over.  This is probably related to those resident here topping up smaller pensions received from other Member States.  Those claiming non-contributory pensions are, of course, subject to the habitual residence test and, as already indicated, most inactive migrants have been resident here for quite a number of years.</p><p>  The EU coordination system is a benefit to all EU citizens, including Irish citizens, who exercise their right to live and work in other EU States. Apart from the cost that any such abuse of the system entails for Member States, there is also the reputation of the EU Coordination system to consider. Whether the problem is big or small, unjustifiable claiming of benefits by migrants engenders resentment amongst local populations and damages the credibility and acceptance of the coordination system amongst citizens. Accordingly, Ireland will continue to work with other Member States in asking for changes to limit the opportunities for unfair access to our social security system.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 81,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013.In the first instance, an applicant for rent supplement must satisfy the habitual residence condition (HRC) and satisfy the SWA means test. A European Economic Area (EEA) national who is engaged in genuine and effective employment in Ireland is regarded as a migrant worker under EC law and does not need to satisfy the HRC for the purpose of any claim to SWA, including rent supplement. A jobseeker who moves from one EEA country to another in order to seek employment cannot claim the advantages for migrant workers under EC law and is subject to the HRC in the normal manner.</p><p>  In addition to satisfying the HRC and means test requirement, in order to qualify for a rent supplement a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation or accommodation for homeless persons or an institution (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement. A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by a housing authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support. </p><p>  In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by a housing authority. Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement. Policy in relation to eligibility for social housing support is a matter for the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  I do not consider that the conditions in place for the receipt of rent supplement are promoting benefit tourism.</p></reply>

This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people. In this context, the major elements of the Government&rsquo;s response are set out in the Pathways to Work policy which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the re-training programmes are filled by people who have been on the Live Register who are either unemployed or at high risk of long-term unemployment.  The Government must also take account of the fact that many people who sign on to the Live Register will exit it again within a short-time frame, without any recourse to employment schemes or intensive activation measures. For example, in 2012, of those who signed on to the Live Register, 43% had left the Register within 3 months of first signing on. Given these high exit rates, it is appropriate to apply a qualifying duration on the Live Register as a criterion to allocate scarce resources, including places on employment and training/educational schemes, to those most in need of support. </p><p>  Of course, some services (for example assistance with job-search activities, use of online job search tools, participation in part-time/evening and on-line training courses) are available to all unemployed persons, regardless of their duration of unemployment, if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices.  </p><p>  Without knowing the specific reason why a person is not eligible for Back to Education Allowance it is not possible to say what other re-training options, if any, are available over and above those available to all unemployed persons.</p></reply>

Equally, the EURES service is used to fill positions in Ireland from the wider European labour market where the necessary skills cannot be found in Ireland e.g. native language skills. </p><p>  In the year to date, EURES has issued some 6,000 letters to jobseekers for positions in the wider EU/EEA. The letters were issued to people on the live register and to people who have registered with the Department&rsquo;s employment service as seeking a change of job.</p><p>  In addition to notifying EU area vacancies, the Department, from time to time, will notify vacancies advised by Government authorities in other states.  This notification of vacancies operates on a reciprocal, goodwill basis.</p><p>  The criteria used to select people is based entirely on the details provided by jobseekers  registering for the Department&rsquo;s employment services and a careful match is made against their skills, education, training and experience and the requirements of the positions on offer.</p><p>  Availing of such job opportunities in the wider EU/EEA labour market and in other states is entirely at the discretion of the person receiving such communications from the Department and where a person does not wish to take up such opportunities his/her social welfare payment, where applicable, is not affected.   The letters issued by the Department to jobseekers reflects this position.</p></reply>

Owing to the range of policy changes implemented in the interim, the scheme is now universally available to all persons permanently living in the State aged over 65, as well as carers in receipt of carers allowance, and certain others in receipt of disability type payments.  The effect of this broadening is that there are currently in excess of 770,000 customers eligible for free travel and, when spousal and companion passes are taken into account, there are over 1.2 million customers with some free travel eligibility.  Expenditure on this scheme was frozen at 2010 levels by the previous Government.  The available expenditure for the free travel scheme in 2013 is &euro;77 million.</p><p>  Given the increasing number of recipients and the funding pressures, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I established a working group with representatives from the two Departments, as well as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Transport Authority to review the free travel scheme. The purpose of this review is to examine and report on the current operation and future development of the free travel scheme.  This will include the conditions imposed on the scheme in the National Recovery Plan 2011 &ndash; 2014.  The work of this group is expected to conclude this year.</p></reply>

The procedures governing the registration of deaths are provided for under Part 5 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004. When a death occurs it is registered on foot of a certificate of cause of death supplied by a registered medical practitioner. Where a death is referred to a coroner, the death is registered by a registrar on foot of a coroner&rsquo;s certificate. These are the only circumstances under which a death can be registered. </p><p>  Section 28 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 provides for the registration of stillbirths. A still born child is defined under the Act as &ldquo;a child who, at birth, weighs not less than 500 grammes or has a gestational age of not less than 24 weeks and shows no sign of life and &lsquo;&lsquo;stillbirth&rsquo;&rsquo; shall be construed accordingly&rdquo;. Section 28 (7) of the Act provides that, if a coroner ascertains that a body is that of a stillborn child, he or she shall notify a registrar in the functional area of the authority in which the body is located of the stillbirth and shall give to the registrar, in as far as he or she can ascertain them, the required particulars in relation to the stillbirth, and the registrar shall register the stillbirth in such manner as an tArd-Chlaraitheoir may direct. </p><p>  While acknowledging that the loss of an unborn child is very sad for the family concerned it would not be practical or feasible to establish and maintain a register of deaths in such cases. It is not intended, therefore to amend the Civil Registration Act, 2004 to allow for the registration of deaths without a medical certificate or a coroners certificate stating the cause of death.</p></reply>

It is a matter for each project promoter or commissioning body to maintain details of such expenditure.</p><p>  The Per Cent for Arts Scheme guidelines assist with its implementation.  The scheme is now well-known and embedded in all public infrastructure works.  The public have become familiar with the works of art on our roads, but there are also art works resulting from the scheme in schools, hospitals and all buildings funded by the taxpayer.  Public art is not confined to sculptures; it has also resulted in performances, new writings and compositions.</p><p>  There is no doubt that the impact, particularly the visual impact, of this scheme has been overwhelmingly positive.</p></reply>

The then Government agreed to cover the full capital costs of the project, which were estimated at that time to be of the order of &euro;35m.</p><p>  It was always the intention that the Ulster Canal project would be funded from the Waterways Ireland annual allocations, as agreed through the annual estimates processes in this jurisdiction, as well as the deliberations of NSMC in relation to annual budgets.  It was a key consideration throughout the process that the Ulster Canal project would be supported by a significant level of projected income from the commercialisation of certain Waterways Ireland assets.  However, the economic downturn has had a negative impact on those plans.</p><p>  In the meantime, the Ulster Canal project is progressing on an incremental basis. Planning approvals have now been secured for the project in both jurisdictions.  I welcome these developments, which, I am sure the Deputy will agree, are a significant milestone for the project.</p><p>  I am continuing to explore all possible options to advance this project within the current fiscal constraints.

The levy is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers.The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception. The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002). The scheme sets out that the levy applies to all electricity customers and the levy amount is reviewed annually. VAT at a rate of 13.5% is payable on the PSO levy amount. The annual PSO levy amount for 2013/2014 (exclusive of VAT) is &euro;42.87 for residential customers and &euro;129.83 for small to medium sized business customers. This equates to &euro;3.57 per month for residential customers and &euro;10.82 per month for small to medium sized business customers. Medium and large customers pay &euro;18.47/kVA annually or &euro;1.54/kvA monthly. I understand from the CER that the key drivers for the rise in the annual PSO levy include: (i) a lower market price for electricity than expected; (ii) less running of certain PSO plant than anticipated (resulting in reduced market income and hence an increased requirement for PSO support), (iii) an increase in wind connections supported by the PSO, as well as (iv) a &ldquo;correction factor&rdquo; for under-recoveries of the PSO in previous years. The CER Decision on the PSO levy (CER/13/168) is available at www.cer.ie</p><p>While I fully understand and appreciate concerns about the cost of the PSO levy to customers, the development of renewable energy capacity will allow Ireland to reduce its fossil fuel dependence and vulnerability to rises in international fossil fuel prices. The PSO levy supports that development and provides increased security of supply in electricity generation.</p></reply>

These are matters for the developers and for the forward planning processes through regional and local development plans and at project level through the development management process. In this context, energy infrastructure developers are encouraged to work with the those forward planning processes to set clear contexts for assessment of individual applications for planning consent and to facilitate as wide a degree of consensus as possible as to how and where to meet grid development needs.</p><p>  The Government, as detailed in the July 2012 Policy Statement, expects the companies, including the State energy companies, in making their choices of project specific technologies and routing, to take account of all relevant national and international standards, to follow best practice, to ensure value for money and to be informed by detailed consultation at local level. Using the best available advice and expertise the companies are required to address and mitigate, as necessary, human, environmental and landscape impacts in delivering the projects concerned. </p><p>  I understand that there is no single &lsquo;right&rsquo; solution for any particular development and that technical solutions must be project specific. I also understand that conventional overhead lines are still the most common solution adopted worldwide and still offer significantly lower investment costs than any underground alternative. </p><p>  EirGrid and ESB Networks are mandated to plan developments in a safe efficient and economic manner in accordance with their licences from the Commission for Energy Regulation. </p><p>  The Grid Link Project is a key initiative under EirGrid's Grid25. Without this project, the electricity grid in the south and east of Ireland will not be sufficient to meet the region&rsquo;s future electricity needs. The project will facilitate both conventional generation and renewable energy projects. It will reinforce the grid in Leinster and Munster and support future interconnection with grids outside of Ireland. It is a significant upgrade of the electricity grid and is the largest project under the Grid25 programme. The project will involve an estimated &euro;500 million investment and will enable Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity 2020 target, while also reducing our reliance on imported fossil fuels.</p><p>  EirGrid is committed to public consultation and has been engaging in a comprehensive process with regard to the Grid Link project. EirGrid's consultation process has involved opening five regional information centres, providing a lo-call project information telephone line (1890 422 122), local radio advertising, and national and local print advertising. The company welcomes observations and views in relation to the Grid Link Project which is still at an early stage. The identification of route corridor options is a key opportunity for public input given that the decision regarding the final route of this electricity line is yet to be made. </p></reply>

The Better Energy Programme, which principally provides funding for energy efficiency measures, also provides grants for the installation of solar panels. The Renewable Heat Deployment Programme (ReHeat), Greener Homes Scheme and the CHP Deployment Programme, also provided grants but have since closed and residual payments were made in 2011. Since 2011, SEAI has administered the Electric Vehicles Grant scheme which provides grants of up to &euro;5,000 towards the purchase of new electric vehicles. These grants are in addition to the VRT reliefs of up to &euro;5,000 which apply to electric vehicles.    My Department, through SEAI, also subsidises Renewable Energy Research, Demonstration and Development projects and Ocean Energy Development.

A key objective, from an Irish Government perspective, is to realise the potential for investment, jobs and growth. The amount of energy to be procured by the UK and the mechanisms for sharing the resultant economic benefits, including an appropriate return to the Exchequer, are among the matters to be addressed ahead of signing any Inter-Governmental Agreement.The Renewable Energy Export Policy and Development Framework will be underpinned by a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) which is a formal, systematic evaluation of the likely significant environmental effects of implementing a plan or programme before a decision is made to adopt the plan or programme. This will be accompanied by a Habitats Directive Assessment (i.e. an Appropriate Assessment (AA)) under the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC, which will be carried out by my Department based on the findings of a Natura Impact Statement.   The first of three public consultations on the framework was launched in October, inviting all interested parties, including members of the public, to make written submissions or observations, to assist in the preparation of the policy and development framework.

In order to ensure that Ireland continues to meet its renewable energy targets, while at the same time ensuring that wind energy does not have negative impacts on local communities, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with my own Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, is undertaking a targeted review of certain aspects of the existing Wind Energy Planning Guidelines examining the manner in which the Guidelines address key issues such as noise (including separation distance) and shadow flicker. It is expected that revised guidelines will be published for consultation by the end of November with a view to the finalisation of the new guidelines by mid-2014.

That valuation showed an ongoing valuation deficit of &euro;1.9 billion and a Minimum Funding Standard deficit of &euro;1.8 billion. Consequently, the ESB and the ESB Group of Unions formed a working group to assess how best to address the reported deficit and to protect as far as was feasible the interest of ESB and the current members of the Scheme. ESB reached an agreement with staff in 2010 to resolve the pension deficit. Aside from the on-going actuarial position, the Pensions Board also requires the ESB Scheme to assess whether it could meet the Minimum Funding Standard (MFS). This effectively tests whether the Scheme could meet all its current obligations if it were wound up immediately. While neither the Government nor the ESB envisages the winding up of the Scheme, the Scheme is still required to meet the requirements of the MFS. I am informed that the Trustees of the ESB scheme, with the agreement of ESB, submitted a funding plan to the Pensions Board, which was approved in October 2012. I am advised that the ESB plan aims to eliminate the deficit by 2018 and that this plan remains on track.   Regarding the manner in which ESB accounts for the Scheme in its financial statements, my Department has been advised by the ESB that, having taken expert legal and financial advice, the Company is satisfied that the current accounting treatment for the Scheme is correct and in accordance with applicable laws and international accounting standards.</p></reply>

This will be achieved by providing: </p><p>  - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and </p><p>  - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. ComReg has put in place a new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and for service bundles, both of which are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by service providers. ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction, completed in 2012, is also enabling the rollout of advanced mobile broadband services.</p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years. The results of this mapping exercise will inform the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

In that regard, conscious of the need to meet our 2020 targets, and recognising the need for policy certainty on the part of developers, I implemented a number of changes to support scheme flexibility this year providing developers who are due to build post 2015 with the certainty they require on support scheme access. This has been a contributary factor in over 3,000 megawatts of wind generators accepting their Gate 3 offers to connect. This level of accepted offers and contracts being signed shows the commitment among generators to proceed with their projects, underpinned by the work of my Department. Separately, the Memorandum of Understanding signed with the United Kingdom on energy cooperation sent a strong signal of our shared interest in developing the opportunity to export green electricity from Ireland to Britain. An agreed programme of work to this end is underway with the ambition to settle on an Inter-Governmental Agreement in early 2014. A key objective, from an Irish Government perspective, is to realise the potential for investment, jobs and growth.    The shift towards renewable energy and related technologies presents opportunities to develop new products across the information technology, remote communications and software sectors. A recent survey of IWEA member companies shows that some 3,400 people are in full time employment in the wind energy sector which will grow further as we progress towards our legally binding 2020 targets.</p><p>  With regards to projects of a significant scale and specifically for export, employment creation arising from a 3 Gigawatt project would be expected to be in the order of 3,000 to 6,000 job years in the construction phase, with the actual number dependent on the construction schedule to 2020. There would also be additional jobs created in the on-going maintenance of turbines over a 20-year operating life. </p><p>  However the combination of our potential domestic and export pipeline, provides an important signal to those looking to site a manufacturing or assembly plant. To maximise the employment potential, including the attraction of manufacturing or assembly facilities, all relevant State agencies, particularly in the enterprise area, will have to co-ordinate their activities early in the process to ensure we maximise the employment potential from wind generation development. This opportunity has already been identified by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technology growth strategies.   </p></reply>

These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. Changes to planning and permitting regimes will also facilitate investment by the commercial sector, in line with the commitments in the National Broadband Plan.

The manner in which the ESB accounts for the company's Pensions Scheme is a matter for the company, bearing in mind the company's legal obligations to the scheme and the applicable international accounting standards. </p><p>  The accounting treatment of the Pension Scheme as a defined contribution scheme was set out in the financial statements adopted by ESB in 2010, 2011 and 2012 on which the ESB's auditors have expressed unqualified opinions in each of these years.  In other words, in each of these years the ESB's auditors' opinion is that the financial statements give a true and fair view of ESB's affairs.  ESB's view remains that the defined contribution accounting treatment adopted by the company in 2010 correctly reflects ESB's obligations to the scheme.</p><p>  I am informed by ESB that the nature of the Pension Scheme, and ESB's legal obligations in the event of a deficit arising in the Scheme were unchanged both by the 2010 pensions agreement and by the accounting treatment adopted in 2010.  The change in treatment of the scheme for accounting purposes in 2010 did not change the nature of the scheme itself nor did it change the entitlements of the scheme members or the company's legal obligations to the scheme.  In addition, the accounting treatment of the scheme has no bearing on the registration of the scheme as a defined benefit scheme with the Pensions Board.

The Act provided for a three month transition period from 1 July 2013 to 30 September 2013 to allow owners of vehicles that are not being used in a public place to bring their motor tax status up to date by making both a retrospective and prospective off-road declaration on or before 30 September 2013.  From 1 October 2013, the Act provides that only a prospective declaration may be made.  Any vehicle owner who did not bring his or her motor tax status up to date by the September deadline is liable for arrears from the expiry of the last period for which motor tax was paid, should he or she again wish to use the vehicle in a public place.   </p><p>  There was extensive public notice of the Act's coming into force and widespread awareness of the new arrangements from before the start of the transition period.  Advertisements giving notice of the proposed changes were run in national and local newspapers in the first week in July and again in the second week in September.  Local radio ads were run over the course of a week in July and both national and local radio ads were again run over the course of a week in mid-September.  Information provided by myself and my Department through public notices, Frequently Asked Questions, press releases etc. set out clearly that the retrospective declaration of non-use had to be provided to the motor tax office by 30 September 2013, either submitted in person or by letter postmarked no later than 30 September.  The changes were also highlighted in a number of media articles over the course of that period, including in late September in relation to the queues of vehicle owners at motor tax offices seeking to present their documentation by the end-September deadline.   </p><p>  On transfer of ownership of a vehicle, the liability for motor tax of the new owner will arise from the beginning of the month in which the transfer takes place.</p></reply>

In regard to LEADER, during 2011, the European Commission approved a change in the maximum co-funding rate from 55% to 85% for the LEADER elements of Ireland's Rural Development Programme 2007 &ndash; 2013.  This had the effect of reducing the available funding under the Programme from &euro;427 million to an estimated &euro;370 million.  It was therefore necessary to carry out a comprehensive review of the level of commitments and expenditure across the Programme in order to apportion the remaining funds among the Local Development Companies (LDCs), taking into account the level of commitments already entered into. </p><p>  The redistribution of funding was conducted in as fair and equitable a manner as was possible and in the case of West Cork Development Partnership the revised allocation represents a decrease of 16.3% from their original allocation.  Many of the other LDCs experienced similar reductions.  I am committed to the continued monitoring of this situation and my Department will review all commitments and expenditure levels later this month to ensure, in so far as is possible, that all available Programme funding is committed by end December 2013; allocations will again be revised if there is funding available for re-distribution. </p><p>  I have prioritised the Local and Community Development Programme in allocating resources within my Department notwithstanding the very difficult choices which Government have had to make over a number of years to address our economic crisis and place Ireland firmly on the road to economic recovery.  The 2014 provision of &euro;47.7 million, just &euro;1 million less than this year's allocation, will allow some 14,000 people who are distanced from the labour market to receive direct one-to-one labour market training and supports. </p><p>  I recognise that all cuts imposed present challenges to Local Development Companies (LDCs) in managing costs.  My Department expects LDCs, to the greatest extent possible, to continue to maintain key services and supports through prioritising resources at the front-line.</p></reply>

The public service moratorium was introduced in 2009 and my Department operates a delegated sanction, from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, for implementation of the moratorium in relation to local authorities.  All exceptions to the moratorium require prior sanction from my Department. </p><p>  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each City and County Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.  In this regard, it is a matter for City and County Managers, in the first instance, to ensure that the moratorium is implemented while the appropriate service levels are maintained.  All exceptions to the moratorium, including acting-up arrangements, should only arise in exceptional circumstances, for example to fill a statutory, health and safety or other key service requirement.  Acting-up arrangements of less than 4 months do not attract an acting-up allowance and do not require individual sanction from my Department.  Sanction is required for acting arrangements over 4 months.  Given the significant staffing reductions in the sector some exceptions to the moratorium are required and acting-up arrangements have been utilised to fill vacancies.  It is accepted that long term acting-up arrangements are not desirable a s these should only arise as a short term response to particular business needs.</p><p>  To support the sector in effectively managing the combination of staff reductions and the reform/change programme a Workforce Study was undertaken jointly by local authorities and my Department.  In particular, the study assessed the management requirements of local authorities bearing in mind the potential impacts of shared services and other reform initiatives underway.  Work force planning is an iterative process and each local authority has been engaged in work force planning at local level.  In this context, local authorities have been requested to prepare proposals to deal with any long term acting-up arrangements in the context of local work force plans to be submitted later this year.  In this regard, it is not envisaged that there would be any automatic appointments but rather any posts that local authorities seek to fill would need to be agreed with my Department and would be filled on the normal competitive basis under the usual sanction process.</p></reply>

It is intended, primarily, to act as an economic instrument to encourage more sustainable management of our waste by diverting it away from landfill, as our reliance on landfill as the primary waste treatment method is unsustainable.  While there have been a number of increases to the levy in recent years, overall income from the levy has decreased significantly from &euro;46m in 2011 to a projected &euro;39m in 2013.  The decrease in income from the levy indicates that the instrument continues to be effective in decreasing the amount of residual waste consigned to landfill.  As I outlined in A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland, I will keep the rate of charge of the levy under review to ensure that its dissuasive effect as an economic instrument is maintained. </p><p>  Charges applied by waste management companies are a matter between those companies and their customers, subject to compliance with all applicable environmental and other relevant legislation, particularly the conditions attached to each waste collection permit issued under the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2007, as amended.</p></reply>

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  Section 4(4)(b) and section 4(6) of the Act provide that a waiver from the charge applies in 2012 and 2013 to properties in certain unfinished housing estates specified in a list prescribed by the Minister.</p><p>  As part of the process of preparing the National Housing Development Survey 2011, published by my Department in October 2011, local authorities provided details of all unfinished housing developments in their areas.  Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows: <blockquote>- Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist; <br /><br />- Category two, where a receiver has been appointed; <br /><br />- Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and <br /><br />- Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.   </blockquote>Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge.  The list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 was set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012. </p><p>  Earlier this year my Department became aware of an anomaly under which a small number of estates, which should have been included, were excluded from the waiver.  In order to maintain equity, my Department carried out a comprehensive review of the qualifying estates and a revised list of estates was issued in August 2013.   Coill Rua, Ballymahon Road, Mullingar, Co. Westmeath is included in the revised list and thereby qualifies for an exemption from the Household Charge.</p></reply>

A key aim of my Department&rsquo;s activities is enabling communities themselves to identify and address social and economic needs and problems in their own areas.  There is a particular focus on supporting communities that are vulnerable, disadvantaged or under threat, and an adherence to the values of local participation.  My Department provides a wide range of supports to the Community and Voluntary Sector, through a suite of schemes.  A community organisation may qualify for inclusion under one or more of these schemes, should it meet the terms and conditions of a particular scheme managed by my Department.  Information on the main schemes is set out below.   </p><p>  The Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) is one of my Department&rsquo;s main social inclusion programmes.  There are 50 Local Development Companies (LDCs) contracted, on my Department&rsquo;s behalf to deliver the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP), with 35 of those also delivering the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP) throughout the country.  The LDCs are independent companies with their own board of management and memoranda and articles of association.  Both the LDCP and LEADER programme supports include a contribution towards administration and overhead costs including any employment related overheads.   </p><p>  The funding Scheme to Support National Organisations in the Community and Voluntary sector provides multi-annual funding to national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services.  Priority is given under the Scheme to supporting national organisations which provide coalface services to disadvantaged target groups.  Core funding refers typically to operating costs that will always need to be met, and are fundamental to the organisation's survival.  The funding normally covers basic organisational and administrative costs of an organisation, and may include items such as salaries, facilities, equipment, communications, and the direct expenses of day-to-day work.   </p><p>  My Department also provides annual funding to members of the Community and Voluntary Pillar of the Social Partnership Process.  This funding has been awarded to support costs, not funded from any other sources, directly related to the organisations&rsquo; contribution to policy-making in the Social Partnership Process.</p></reply>

The Committee includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA and the construction sector and real progress is being made with regard to the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates.  The Committee is meeting on a regular basis. </p><p>  Site Resolution Plans (SRPs) are a key tool in resolving issues associated with unfinished housing developments.  Such plans enable developers to work with local authorities, financial institutions, NAMA and residents in determining how best to pursue resolution of problematic sites.  The process also entails working with stakeholders in identifying the best long-term solution for developments in terms of their configuration, use of vacant buildings and ownership in a way that is in the best interests of residents.   </p><p>  Ultimately, the initiation of the SRP process in respect of a particular development is a matter for the local authority concerned.  However, progress by local authorities in ensuring that developers complete and/or resolve unfinished housing developments is continuing, as evidenced by regular reports to the National Co-ordination Committee and the results published in the annual unfinished housing reports which my Department has compiled for 2011 and 2012; further progress will be evidenced with the imminent publication of the 2013 report.   </p><p>  In addition, under the Public Safety Initiative, my Department has made allocations totalling some &euro;4.47 million to 21 local authorities from the funding allocation made available to address immediate safety issues since 2011.  The types of works that have been approved to date include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites.  Also, the Government provided an additional &euro;10 million in Budget 2014 to assist the most problematic unfinished housing estates.  The precise criteria under which the fund will be disbursed will be finalised shortly.  However, I envisage that the fund will operate in a carefully targeted and evidence led fashion to aid the resolution of occupied developments and in a way that will stimulate more significant investment by the owners of these developments, including generating additional employment through the resolution works.</p><p>  Each local authority has a nominated Unfinished Estates contact person who can act as a conduit to resolution of outstanding issues.  It is recommended that the residents of unfinished estates should contact their local authority to access information on the options available.</p></reply>

Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014, the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund.  In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing.   </p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised.  The establishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisational and financial challenges in 2014 and, in this context, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015.  This approach allows maximum flexibility in allocating Local Property Tax in 2014 with the priority to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases.  The 2014 Local Government Fund General Purpose Grants will be announced in due course.   </p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates.  A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.</p></reply>

It is important to distinguish between people who cannot afford to pay and people who refuse to pay.

The on-going implementation of the 2009 Act will result in further reform in areas such as local authority rents and tenancies. </p><p>  Proposals are also being prepared in my Department for the General Scheme of a new Housing Bill that will underpin a new scheme of Housing Assistance Payments, an incremental purchase scheme for existing local authority houses and a revised repossession procedure for local authority housing.   </p><p>  The Government approved in principle the transfer of responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with an established housing need from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) to local authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) in March 2013.  On 18 July 2013, the Government approved the introduction of HAP including the provision of funding to the local authorities to cover the costs of accommodating HAP claimants. My Department and the DSP continue to work closely on the legal, policy and operational issues involved in developing and introducing HAP.   </p><p>  Approved housing bodies (AHBs) are organisations approved by my Department, under Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, to provide social housing support in conjunction with local authorities. The Department is working to create a regulatory framework for such bodies that will provide support and assurance to the sector itself and to its external partners.   </p><p>  As a first step, my Department has developed, in consultation with the AHB sector, a voluntary regulation code as a precursor to a statutory regulatory framework for the sector to support its long-term<i></i>development. <b></b>The voluntary regulation code, <i><i>Building for the Future</i></i>, was published in July 2013 and will assist housing bodies to improve their governance, management and financial capabilities as we move towards statutory regulation which, it is hoped, will be in place by 2016.   </p><p>In addition, the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants in the private rented sector will soon be extended to the AHB sector through the <i>Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012</i> which has been passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, and which is currently before the Seanad.   </p><p>  Finally, the Part V housing supply provisions in Section 93 of the Planning &amp;amp; Development Act 2000 have played a significant role in the delivery of social and affordable housing since its introduction and there are many people in good quality housing today as a direct result of the Part V supply mechanisms.   However, Part V was designed for a housing market radically different to that which we now have, and the Government is undertaking a full review of Part V &ndash; the public consultation phase of the process has recently concluded. Future policy decisions will be informed by the outcomes of this review and consultation process.</p></reply>

These meetings have covered the issue of engagement by local authorities with animal welfare groups.  My Department has also communicated directly with city and county managers on these issues.   I am aware of the new passport requirements now in place, and while these may present new challenges, I am hopeful that local authorities and animal welfare organisations will further develop their relationships and we will continue the notable reduction in the number of dogs put to sleep.</p></reply>

Paragraph 6 (5) of Schedule 10 sets out the circumstances where the meetings administrator shall issue a notification of the meeting, along with the agenda, when a requisition for a special meeting of the local authority is made.

The primary purpose of the Act is to replace the system whereby a vehicle is only declared off the road when the owner next goes to tax it with a system under which the vehicle must be declared off the road in advance.  This is aimed at closing an evasion loophole, costing taxpayers approximately &euro;55m per annum, which was facilitated through the use of retrospective declarations.</p><p>  The Act provided for a three month transition period from 1 July 2013 to 30 September 2013 to allow vehicle owners to bring their motor tax status up to date by making both a retrospective and prospective off-road declaration.  </p><p>  There was extensive public notice of the Act&rsquo;s coming into force and widespread awareness-raising of the new arrangements from before the start of the transition period.  Advertisements giving notice of the proposed changes were run in national and local newspapers in the first week in July and again in the second week in September.  Local radio ads were run over the course of a week in July and both national and local radio ads were again run over the course of a week in mid-September.  The changes have also been highlighted in a number of media articles over the course of that period.</p><p>  A specific procedure was also put in place to allow those who were abroad or incapacitated to put their motor tax affairs in order by nominating a friend or relative to attend at a Garda Station on their behalf to have the required form stamped in respect of a past period of non-use, if the vehicle owner was not in a position to do so.  This arrangement was also publicised at the time.  </p><p>  The new arrangements, only allowing for a future declaration, are fully in force since 1 October 2013 and exemptions are not provided for in individual cases, given that vehicle owners generally who did not avail of the transition arrangements must now pay arrears in motor tax where these arise, and the necessity generally of maintaining a consistent approach in the application of the legislation.  </p></reply>

The two Referendum Commissions effectively operated as one and in accordance with section 14 of the Referendum Act 1998, the Commission will be submitting a report to me in relation to its performance of the functions assigned to it in relation to the referendums.  These functions include the promotion of public awareness of the referendums and encouraging the electorate to vote at the polls.  I will be laying copies of the report before each House of the Oireachtas following its submission to me by the Referendum Commission.  I understand that the report will contain some details of post-referendum research undertaken by the Commission.

The self-assessed charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.   </p><p> I understand that the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge has raised &euro;388.22m to date over the 5 years of its operation, &euro;69.69m of which is in respect of the 2013 liability.  The attached table, based on data provided by the Local Government Management Agency, details Non-Principal Private Residence Charge revenue raised by local authority area by liability date as of 31 October 2013.   </p><p>  The local government funding model will change considerably in 2014. 2013 is the final year of the operation of the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge.  Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014 the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund.  In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing.   </p><p>The 2014 Local Government Fund General Purpose Grants will be announced in due course.   <table><tr><th>County/City Council </th><th><div>2009 <br /><br />&euro;m </div></th><th><div>2010 <br /><br />&euro;m

The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters and the Valuation Act 2001 comes under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.     </p><p>  The property&rsquo;s valuation, together with the annual rate on valuation (ARV) decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget, determines the level of rates to be paid.

Locally elected members adopt the annual rate on valuation they consider necessary in order to provide the required services. </p><p>  The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water and enabled the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) to advise on the regulation of water services. I will shortly be publishing further proposed legislation to give effect to the transfer of water services functions currently with 34 local authorities to Irish Water from 1 January 2014. Part of this transfer will include arrangements for the transfer of assets, including water services infrastructure, to the new public utility from that date. </p><p>  The proposed legislation will also assign responsibility to Irish Water for the provision of water services and will provide for the establishment of an economic regulator for water services within the CER. While the primary function of the CER will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure that a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided to them, it will also be responsible for approving the tariffs to be charged by Irish Water. In fulfilling its functions, the CER will have regard to all of the commercial costs incurred by Irish Water, including the payment of commercial rates. </p><p>  The establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing from 2014.

This includes ministerial consents for borrowing and the entering into capital commitments by the subsidiary, as well as obligations for copies of the accounts of the subsidiary to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.   </p><p>Further proposed legislation will provide for t he transfer of water services functions to Irish Water from local authorities, which will address matters such as the preparation of water services strategic plans to be signed off by the Minister This proposed legislation will also provide for the establishment of an economic regulator for water services within the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). While the primary function of the CER will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure that a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided to them, it will also be responsible for approving the tariffs to be charged by Irish Water. In fulfilling its functions, the CER will have regard, inter alia, to the need to ensure that there is an efficient system for the provision of water services and the need to promote the conservation of water.   </p><p>  Consequently, following passage of this legislation, a new funding model will be in place to meet both capital and operational costs of the new entity. Irish Water&rsquo;s costs in the coming years will be funded through a mix of revenue from the domestic and non-domestic sector, third party finance (such as the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, EIB, bank lending and capital markets facilities) and State support which may be in the form of both equity and subvention. </p><p>  B&oacute;rd G&aacute;is has put in place appropriate programme management arrangements to establish Irish Water, to prepare for the transfer of assets, liabilities and functions from local authorities from 1 January 2014, provide for customer service and billing and implement the domestic water metering programme. Expenditure on this programme, including details of consultancy costs, is a matter for B&oacute;rd G&aacute;is/Irish Water and these costs are not being funded from the Exchequer. The National Pensions Reserve Fund has provided a bridging loan facility to Irish Water to meet the costs arising to the end of 2013. This includes the initial stages of the domestic water metering programme, the full cost of which is &euro;539m excluding VAT. The ministerial consents required under the Water Services Act and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of Irish Water were provided to Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water in relation to this expenditure and borrowing. </p><p>  My Department has committed to funding of almost &euro;0.7m, to Irish Water in 2013 to fund the cost of a pilot study in relation to Phase 2 of the Metering Programme which is targeted at metering those properties that were not meterable in the Phase 1 Programme. Expenditure incurred directly by Irish Water is a matter for that organisation and I have asked them to liaise directly with the Deputy.   </p><p>  The Exchequer proposes a direct equity investment of &euro;240m towards the capital funding of Irish Water in 2014. This will support projects to be included in Irish Water&rsquo;s Capital Investment Plan and will ensure that the entity is in a position to take on the water services investment programmes of the 34 water services authorities, including some 80 projects currently in progress. Irish Water will also finance some of its costs and the liabilities transferred from local authorities through borrowings in 2014.   </p><p>The establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing from 2014. Work is also underway on the funding model for Irish Water&rsquo;s operational costs, to ensure that it can fund the Service Level Agreements being put in place with local authorities for the delivery of water services in 2014. Irish Water is working with local authorities to finalise the 2014 budgets associated with the proposed service level agreements. In parallel with this process, the Department has sought the advice of the Commission for Energy Regulation in relation to anticipated new operational costs associated with new functions for the entity which are likely to arise in 2014. The outcome of these processes will determine the overall funding requirement of Irish Water in 2014 from the Exchequer, borrowing and charges.   </p></reply>

In line with the , the determination of the remuneration of the senior management of commercial State bodies, with the exception of the Chief Executive, is a matter for the Board of the body and not one in which I have a statutory remit.    </p><p>  The Managing Director of Irish Water was appointed by the Board of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, and his remuneration package was approved by me, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and following consultation with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The gross salary payable to the Managing Director of Irish Water is &euro;200,000 per annum. In accordance with his approved Contract of Employment, the Managing Director of Irish Water is afforded the use of a company car on terms determined by the Company.  He is also eligible to participate in any company benefit schemes as may be available to him and in his case the only one applicable is health insurance.   </p><p>  A fundamental underpinning of the water reform programme is to ensure that the skills and experience built up over many years in local authorities are put to best use for the long-term benefit of the customer and that there is no negative impact on service to customers during the transition.  It is intended, therefore, that the legislation to transfer statutory responsibility for water services to Irish Water will provide for local authorities to act as agents for Irish Water with this relationship being expressed through Service Level Agreements.  The majority of the existing staff will remain employees of local authorities working under such arrangements from 1 January 2014.   </p><p>  Irish Water is currently recruiting to build up the internal capabilities required within the organisation.  It was agreed by the Steering Group for the Water Sector Reform programme that, to ensure skills within the sector were fully availed of in building up the new organisation, competitions for positions in asset management, capital delivery and operations would be restricted to staff in the partner organisations i.e. Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, local authorities and my Department in the first instance. Open competitions are held for all other positions and details of these are available on Irish Water&rsquo;s website <i>.</i></p></reply>

The Programme includes contracts under construction and to commence t o the value of some &euro;41 million in County Clare during the period of the Programme. </p><p>  The Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth. A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Clare County Council, in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas. These were subsequently appraised in my Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that were more strategically important at that time. </p><p>  Last month my Department wrote to Clare County Council, in response to the Council&rsquo;s request to have the scheme included in the current Water Services Investment Programme, advising that the Doolin Sewerage Scheme could not be considered for inclusion in the current Programme at this time.  From 1 January 2014 Irish Water will be responsible for the delivery of water services capital infrastructure and is currently preparing a Capital Investment Plan for 2014 - 2015. My Department has advised the Council that it is open to it to make a business case to Irish Water to have particular schemes included in the Capital Investment Plan for 2014 &ndash; 2015.</p></reply>

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has statutory powers of search and entry available to it under various legislative provisions and these apply to aircraft as much as to any other type of private property.  However, these powers may only be exercised in circumstances where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reasonably suspects that an offence has been or is being committed.</p><p>  It is the case that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has previously fully investigated a number of allegations of unlawful activity at Irish airports and files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecution in some of these cases, although no prosecution was directed.

It is planned that the Bill will be enacted during the first half of 2014 and that the new Court of Appeal would be up and running in the new law term next Autumn.</p><p>  My Department will be working closely with the Courts Service during this process and I can advise that an Implementation Committee has been established by the Courts Service which includes representation from my Department. The Committee, which has held its first meeting, will examine and make recommendations in relation to all aspects of administrative support for the new Court, such as organisational structure, staffing, accommodation, ICT systems and facilities, and rules of court to regulate court procedures. The aim is to ensure that the required accommodation, structures and systems are in place in time for the establishment of the new Court of Appeal.</p><p>  The current level of delay in the Supreme Court of four and a half years is unsustainable for individuals and businesses seeking to pursue important appeals. The establishment of a Court of Appeal provides a long-needed reform of our courts system. It will have significant benefit for individual citizens, but will also maintain the internationally recognised standing of Ireland as a competitive and efficient economy in which to do business.</p></reply>

This process has already commenced.  The National Disability Authority (NDA) facilitated consultations with the Deaf Community in Ireland in 2012 at my request in relation to actions that could make improvements in the lives of deaf people and submissions received from them were considered for inclusion where possible and appropriate in the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan (NDSIP) which was published in July 2013 on the Department of Justice and Equality website.</p><p>  As part of the follow-up to that initiative,  I will chair a special themed meeting of the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group (NDSIG) on the question of Irish Sign Language on November 28. This meeting, which will be the first such themed meeting of this Group, will  bring together representatives of relevant Departments, the National Disability Authority, the Deaf community and other relevant stakeholders with a view to further progressing the implementation of the NDSIP in this regard.  The meeting will in particular examine the current situation across Government Departments and their Agencies with regard to promoting recognition of Irish Sign Language including in service provision.  The intention is that any actions which are identified and agreed through this process, will be incorporated into the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan with Key Performance Indicators and timelines and the actors identified for implementing the action.  Progress on the actions will then be monitored as part of the Implementation Plan monitoring process.</p><p>  The National Disability Strategy is part of a whole-of-Government approach to advancing the social inclusion of people with disabilities.  The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy therefore comprehends many of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  In addition, an Inter-Departmental Committee on the Convention monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification. Any further legislative or administrative actions that may be required in relation to Irish Sign Language in advance of ratification of the UNCRPD will be examined in this context.</p></reply>

The remit of the Bureau is to target those persons who seek to derive benefit from criminal activities. In carrying out this role, the Bureau utilises all available legal remedies, primarily those contained in the Proceeds of Crime legislation, Taxes legislation and Social Welfare legislation, to deprive persons of benefits obtained from the proceeds of crime.</p><p>  Since its inception, Bureau processes have been continuously evaluated and, where necessary, strengthened to maximise the number of cases brought and assets targeted.  Furthermore, an Expert Group, established under the auspices of my Department, is currently engaged in a comprehensive review of the Proceeds of Crime legislation with a view to identifying possible improvements which would serve to strengthen the operation of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  The Chief Bureau Office and Bureau Legal Officer of the Criminal Assets Bureau are represented on the Expert Group,  along with representatives from the Crime and Criminal Law Reform Divisions of my Department and a representative from the Office of the Attorney General.</p><p>  A number of matters are being reviewed by the Group including decreasing the amount of time which must elapse before criminal assets which have been frozen become the property of the State; increasing the powers of receivers over properties so as to immediately deprive criminals of the use of those properties; short term seizure of assets believed to be the proceeds of crime pending determination by the courts and further improving measures supporting international cooperation.  However, the work of the Group is not limited to these matters and any further proposals which the Bureau may bring forward which would serve to strengthen its operation can be taken into account during the review.</p></reply>

Having regard to the particular issue raised by the Deputy, I am informed that the Bureau does liaise directly with its Spanish counterparts and explores all available avenues within the European Union legal framework to target criminally acquired assets and criminals operating between both jurisdictions.  I would also like to assure the Deputy of the importance attributed at both national level and European level to continuing close cooperation between asset recovery offices across the Member States.  In this regard, it is worth noting that both Ireland and Spain are currently members of the Steering Group  of the Camden Asset Recovery Interagency Network (CARIN), which is an informal network of experts/practitioners dedicated to improving cooperation in all aspects of tackling the proceeds of crime. Specifically, CARIN aims to increase the effectiveness of members' efforts in depriving criminals of their illicit profits through cooperative inter-agency cooperation and information sharing.</p></reply>

At this stage, arising from the additional &euro;5m being made available between October and December, the Garda authorities have arranged for the delivery of 305 new vehicles by the end of 2013.

The application is currently being processed and once completed will be returned to the registered organisation concerned.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the number of vetting applications received by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) each year has risen from 187,864 in 2007 to 327,903 in 2012 and it is expected that there will be upwards of 350,000 applications this year.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is now approximately 9 weeks from date of receipt. However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion. Nonetheless, this is a significant improvement on the processing time of 14 weeks which existed in July this year. This improvement reflects the fact that I have given this matter particular priority as it is essential that the GCVU has the resources required to perform this most critical of roles effectively and efficiently.</p><p>  In that context, I have been actively engaged on this issue with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. As a result of that engagement, I am pleased to say that the Garda Commissioner has confirmed to me that there are now 136 whole time equivalent staff assigned to the GCVU, some 41 of whom have been redeployed from elsewhere in the public service since the end of March 2013. Some of these redeployed staff have only recently completed their training in the vetting process, and the full impact of their work will be seen in the coming weeks. Furthermore, I have also recently received sanction for the redeployment of 40 additional staff to the GCVU. This brings the total number of staff in that service to over 170, more than double that of the average allocation of 78 staff at the Unit over the past two and a half years.</p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the development of an e-Vetting solution is also underway. This will facilitate the processing of all applications in an e-format, thus removing the time-consuming current process of manually managing all applications received. The initial phase of testing this e-vetting system will take place during late 2013.  When this is achieved, this system will streamline the overall vetting process in this jurisdiction, and further contribute to reductions in processing times for all vetting applications.</p></reply>

To that end, the Government has introduced a comprehensive framework to tackle the mortgage arrears problem.</p><p>  - Lending institutions are working with borrowers in arrears to meet targets set by the Central Bank which will see the majority of them being offered sustainable solutions by the end of next year;</p><p>  - The reform of the personal insolvency legislation, which I piloted through the Oireachtas, will see a range of alternative solutions being availed of by borrowers where their debt situation is not sustainable;</p><p>  - Advice on dealing with mortgage arrears is available, independently of the lending institutions, through the Citizens Information Board help line and website (www.keepingyourhome.ie);</p><p>  - Mortgage-to-rent cases are being finalised and agreed on an increasing basis with over 100 families finding solutions through this scheme.</p><p>  Within the next 12 months, the Government expects that the vast majority of those who are currently in arrears will have been offered and, hopefully, have accepted a sustainable solution. The Central Bank has already set targets for resolving mortgage arrears cases and has made it clear that lending institutions which fail to meet these targets may face financial sanctions. It is essential that the institutions address this challenge as part of the process of repairing our damaged banking system.</p><p>  Co-operating borrowers have nothing to fear from engaging with the lending institutions to find solutions to their difficulties.  Already some 79,000 mortgage holders have had their mortgages restructured. Protections under the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) have been put in place precisely to allow cooperating borrowers the time and space to restructure their mortgage commitments to meet changed financial circumstances.  That being said, it is worrying to see that, in the case of some institutions, up to one-third of borrowers in arrears are not engaging at all. I would urge all those in mortgage difficulties to begin the process of resolving the situation by talking to their lender as a matter of urgency.</p><p>  I should add that, during the passage of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 through the Oireachtas, I took the opportunity to insert two important provisions which will be of benefit to borrowers with arrears. Section 2 of the Act provides that in any future repossession proceedings in respect of a borrower&rsquo;s principal private residence, the court may adjourn proceedings so that a proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may be fully explored as an alternative to repossession.  Section 3 of the Act introduces a requirement that repossession actions in relation to a principal private residence or family home where the mortgage was created prior to 1 December 2009 must be commenced in the Circuit Court.</p></reply>

The Visa Waiver Programme allows persons from seventeen designated countries to travel to Ireland on the basis of a UK visa and it has proved very effective in attracting increased numbers of visitors from emerging tourist markets. The number of participating countries in the programme is kept under review.  Figures from Tourism Ireland indicate that the total number of trips to Ireland by residents of countries covered by the programme increased by approximately 38% in the 18 months after the programme was introduced.  In addition, in relation to China and India alone, Tourism Ireland advises that some 55 new tour operator programmes to Ireland have been developed as a result of the introduction of the waiver programme. These programmes alone have contributed to over 13,000 additional visitors to Ireland from India and China.</p><p>  Building on success of the Programme, work is continuing in partnership with the UK Home Office on the development of short-stay CTA visa arrangements to allow tourists and business visitors to travel to the CTA, with first arrival in either jurisdiction, and thereafter to travel freely throughout the CTA. It is planned for the roll out of such visa arrangements to commence in 2014.  These initiatives have been universally welcomed by tourism bodies and tour operators particularly those operating in emerging markets. Prior to its introduction, the necessary technical and operational arrangements, including the capture of biometric data (fingerprints) in electronic format for visa applicants, need to be put in place between the two jurisdictions.</p><p>  As Ireland does not participate in the border control aspects of Schengen it will not be possible to enter into similar visa arrangements with other EU Member States at this time.  I have set out in response to previous Parliamentary Questions why it is not possible for Ireland to join Schengen while the UK does not.  In effect, it would involve dismantling the Common Travel arrangements that currently allow free movement between ourselves and the UK. It would also mean that Northern Ireland would become the external border of the Schengen area.  The reality is that we cannot operate a common travel area with the UK with all the benefits that brings and unilaterally be part of the Schengen zone at the same time.</p></reply>

To this end, I have strived to attend and actively participate in as many meetings of the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council as possible.  I have partaken in 13 of the 14 formal meetings and all five informal meetings of the Council held in the period since my appointment.  These include the two formal meetings and one informal meeting held during Ireland's recent EU Presidency, each of which I chaired.  To date, the only JHA Council meeting which I have not been able to attend was an extraordinary one-day meeting convened at short notice in May 2011 to discuss immigration and asylum issues arising from political developments in North Africa.  On that occasion, Ireland was represented by Minister of State Kathleen Lynch, T.D.</p><p>  As well as active participation in the Council, I have also taken the opportunity to engage as much as possible with the European Commission and the European Parliament.  These engagements were through bilateral meetings with the relevant EU Commissioners and addressing the relevant Parliamentary Committees.</p><p>  Of course, enhancing Ireland's role in JHA co-operation means much more than simply participating in Council meetings; it also entails participating in relevant EU policy and legislative measures to the greatest extent consistent with other legal and policy imperatives at home.  The Deputy will be aware that most of the proposed measures in the JHA area are subject to the 21st Protocol annexed to the Lisbon Treaty.  This Protocol provides Ireland and the UK with discretion as to whether or not to participate in such measures on a case-by-case basis.  My policy as Minister has consistently been that Ireland should opt into as many of these measures as is practicable while having regard to the necessities of preserving the fundamental character of our criminal justice system and of protecting our Common Travel Area with the UK.</p><p>  The following are some of the key measures or proposed measures which Ireland has opted into since this Government took office:</p><p>  - A Directive establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime;</p><p>  - A Regulation on mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters (which ensures that, for example, a civil barring order obtained by a domestic violence victim is valid throughout the EU);</p><p>  - A Directive on the use of Passenger Name Record data within the EU for tackling terrorism and other serious crime;</p><p>  - A Regulation creating a European Account Preservation Order to facilitate cross-border debt recovery in civil and commercial matters;</p><p>  - A Directive on the freezing and confiscation of proceeds of crime in the EU;</p><p>  - A Regulation to reform the Union's existing legal framework on insolvency proceedings;</p><p>  - A Directive to combat fraud against the Union's financial interests;</p><p>  - A Directive on the protection of the euro and other currencies against counterfeiting;</p><p>  - A Regulation establishing an Asylum and Migration Fund for the period 2014 to 2020;</p><p>  - A Regulation establishing a funding instrument for police co-operation in the fight against serious crime as part of the Internal Security Fund for the period 2014 to 2020.</p><p>  Ireland's recent Presidency of the Council of the European Union provided a valuable opportunity to take centre stage in advancing the JHA agenda and in enhancing Ireland's reputation as an enthusiastic and committed player in this field.  My officials and I were determined to make the most of this opportunity and with this in mind we set ambitious targets, which I am happy to report were achieved and in some cases exceeded.  Ireland's EU Presidency priorities in the JHA area, and the progress made on each, are set out below.  An updated draft of Chapters 1 to 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation was produced and general support secured for certain fundamental concepts and key aspects which will be an excellent basis for future work.  This proposed Regulation provides for the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.</p><p>  Political guidelines were agreed on the draft Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings.  These guidelines will inform the continuing negotiations on the Regulation, which seeks to reform the existing EU insolvency laws to reflect the fact that businesses increasingly have operations in more than one Member State.  Work was also advanced on the European Account Preservation Order, which is a cross-border debt recovery measure in civil and commercial matters.  The Regulation providing for mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters was adopted, which means that civil protection measures (such as barring orders) can still be enforced if a victim moves from one Member State to another.</p><p>  Turning to the criminal justice sphere, the Irish Presidency secured agreement with the European Parliament on the Directive on Access to a Lawyer in Criminal Proceedings, which forms part of the wider criminal justice procedural rights package.  The Presidency also secured Council agreement on a general approach to a draft Directive to strengthen the existing arrangements to protect the Union's financial interests against fraud, corruption and money laundering.</p><p>  The internal security of the Union will always be a priority for each Presidency, and in this regard the Irish Presidency kept the fight against organised crime and terrorism firmly on the agenda.  During the March JHA Council I chaired an extensive debate on the threat to internal security from the Sahel and Maghreb regions of Africa, with a particular focus on terrorism originating in Mali.  As part of the June Council, I chaired a discussion on the issue of EU citizens travelling to third countries as foreign fighters and the associated radicalisation risk posed by these persons on returning home.  The Presidency also secured the agreement of Council to revise the Union's Strategy on combating radicalisation and recruitment to terrorism.</p><p>  In the area of organised crime and drugs, the Irish Presidency obtained Council agreement on the next four-year EU Action Plan on Drugs and on the Europol priorities for the next four-year policy cycle on organised crime.</p><p>  In the field of asylum and migration, the Irish Presidency secured agreement on the two remaining elements of the Common European Asylum System, <i>viz. </i>the Asylum Procedures Directive (which provides minimum standards on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status) and the Eurodac Regulation, which concerns the system for comparing the fingerprints of asylum seekers.  We also reached a provisional agreement with the European Parliament on the Regulation establishing a European Border Surveillance System, known as Eurosur.  New visa facilitation agreements with Moldova, the Ukraine, Armenia and Cape Verde were secured, as were readmission agreements with the latter two countries.  Substantial progress was also made on an EU-Russia visa facilitation agreement.</p><p>  The ongoing Syrian crisis and its wider impacts loomed large throughout Ireland's Presidency.  At the informal JHA meeting which I chaired in Dublin in January, I invited the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to participate in an important debate on the escalating refugee crisis arising from the Syrian conflict and the actions that the EU could take to assist in its alleviation.  As mentioned above, the proceedings of the June Council included a timely discussion on the phenomenon of EU citizens fighting in Syria and in other conflicts.</p><p>  Finally, the Irish Presidency secured a major agreement with the European Parliament on the Schengen Governance Package, which will enhance the security and stability of the border-free arrangements for participating States.  Agreement on this package also enabled progress to resume on five separate files in the Home Affairs area upon which the European Parliament had suspended negotiations since June 2012.  The Irish Presidency also oversaw the successful migration to the second generation Schengen Information System, better known as SIS II.</p></reply>

The work is brought forward by a number of project groups covering such areas as probation, youth justice, victims' issues, forensic science, social diversity and registered offenders.  The officials from our Departments also meet regularly to assess and report to us on developments.  I will be meeting with Minister Ford in the framework of the Agreement in the very near future.</p><p>  I also maintain close co-operation with Minister Ford on matters of common interest relating to policing and criminal justice outside of the formal framework of the Agreement.  For example, Minister Ford and I recently attended a joint North-South forum on Human Trafficking with representatives from State bodies, law enforcement, NGOs and international organisations representing the island of Ireland, along with delegates from other jurisdictions.  The event was organised to mark EU Anti-Trafficking Day on 18 October.  Combating the scourge of human trafficking is one of the important areas in which there is close and productive co-operation between the two jurisdictions on this island.</p><p>  Of course, there is ongoing close co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland on all aspects of policing.  The two police services operate a joint Cross Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island.  The joint Cross Border Policing Strategy includes sections dealing with Operations; Cross Border Investigations; Intelligence-sharing and Security; Information and Communications Technology; Training; Human Resources, and Emergency Planning.  The two police services are jointly engaged in implementing a number of initiatives in all these areas.  North-South co-operation in combating crime is both positive and dynamic.  The challenges that crime presents are shared ones and joint working will continue to support and enhance our efforts to improve community safety for all communities on this island.</p></reply>

In addition, on the same date there are 18 MABS companies representing 47 individuals authorised to act as Approved Intermediaries (AIs). The location and contact details of AIs and PIPs are publicly available on the relevant Registers on the ISI's website, www.isi.gov.ie. It is expected that the number of authorised AIs and PIPs will increase over the coming months.</p><p>  The ISI is currently processing a number of debt relief applications. However, as I have previously advised, the ISI has stated that in the interest of confidentiality, it will not be providing breakdowns of the numbers of applications for the various debt relief solutions received or being processed at this time. The ISI fully intends to provide quarterly statistics once a statistically meaningful number of applications have been processed.</p><p>  It is a welcome development that the Circuit Court recently issued the first Protective Certificate for a Debt Settlement Arrangement. Debt Settlement Arrangements and Personal Insolvency Arrangements are conducted in a two stage process. The Protective Certificate at stage one offers a 70 day window for Practitioners to develop a proposal to the satisfaction of the debtor and creditors. This means that the first Debt Settlement Arrangements and Personal Insolvency Arrangements will issue in the near future - approximately 70 days after a Protective Certificate has issued. It might be noted that as soon as the Protective Certificate issues, debtors are protected from any action that creditors, subject to the Protective Certificate, may be inclined to take.</p><p>  The ISI continues to engage with key stakeholders on a number of issues and is working on the following:</p><p>  - standardising a Personal Insolvency Arrangement template;</p><p>  - establishing a Complaints Panel for complaints of improper conduct by PIPs;</p><p>  - establishing a PIP education oversight committee;</p><p>  - PIP forum facilitation;</p><p>  - Integration of the Office of the Official Assignee and preparation for the anticipated increase in bankruptcy cases.</p></reply>

This represents an increase of 871 staff (or just over 74%) in this period.  The current ratio of civilians to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stands at approximately 1:6. Given the different legal systems and different policing structures in different countries, eg common law or civil law jurisdictions, multiple police forces with different roles etc., and the fact that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a single national police force which is also responsible for security and intelligence services, comparisons with other countries are not always viable.

My Department has always been conscious of the dangers which fireworks can present, and following full consultation with various interested parties, a number of amendments to the legislation were included in the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  These amendments provided for new offences governing the misuse of fireworks and created an offence for the possession of illegally imported fireworks with intent to sell or supply.  The amendments also provided for significantly increased penalties governing the illegal possession and use of fireworks including making it an offence to throw an ignited firework at any person or property or to light unlicensed fireworks in a public place.</p><p>  Unfortunately there will always be some unscrupulous trader who will source such fireworks from outside the State and attempt to sell them on.  I can however assure the Deputy that the Garda authorities take many pro-active steps each year in the area of prevention and enforcement by putting specific provisions in place in the lead up to Halloween.  Attention is paid, in particular, in the border Divisions and in the Dublin Metropolitan Region to prevent and detect the organised importation for sale of illegal<font color="#FF1F35"> </font>fireworks.  Since 2006, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have additional powers to conduct searches of people and vehicles suspected of carrying illegal fireworks with intent to sell or supply.  If the Garda&iacute; suspect that an offence of sale or supply of illegal fireworks has been committed by a person, they may arrest that person without a warrant.  As I have already mentioned, the penalties for such offences have been significantly increased and fines of up to &euro;10,000 or five years imprisonment or both may be imposed.</p><p>  The Deputy may be interested to note that on Friday 25 October 2013, I issued a press release about the dangers of illegal fireworks and the penalties associated with their misuse.  I also drew the public's attention to the fact that each year, as Halloween approaches, my Department runs a public information campaign in the print media highlighting both the public safety aspect as well as the illegality of using fireworks.  Whereas my Department and the Garda Authorities will continue to do everything possible to prevent the misuse of fireworks, it is incumbent on all of us to play our part in ensuring that we can all enjoy the festivities of Halloween in a safe environment.</p></reply>

This is a 46% increase on the staffing level at the end of December last year when 93 staff were assigned to the GCVU. Furthermore, I have also recently received sanction for the redeployment of approximately 40 additional staff to the GCVU.  These re-deployments are due to commence later this month.  This will bring the total number of staff in that service to over 170 which, when compared to December last year, will represent an increase of 83%</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is now approximately 9 weeks from date of receipt. Seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  This is a significant improvement on the processing time of 14 weeks which existed in July this year.  This improvement reflects the priority been given to ensure that the GCVU has the resources required to perform this most critical of roles effectively and efficiently.  The further increase in staffing this year, and the subsequent introduction of an e-vetting system, will work to further reduce processing times.</p><p>The Spent Convictions Bill is currently before the House and subject to the approval of the Government, I expect to be in a position to amend the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 through amendments to this Bill to deal with certain old minor convictions which will no longer be disclosed under the new provisions.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>I expect to be in a position to commence the provisions of the 2012 Act in 2014.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p></reply>

The scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the presiding judge who are under the Constitution independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. The Presidents monitor waiting times across all courts lists and seek to ensure the optimum use of court time. However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the primary objective for the Service is to maintain the delivery of front line court sittings and services.  The Courts Service continuously works to support the judiciary and assist in ensuring that cases are dealt with as effectively and as speedily as possible.  Available resources and operational and organisational structures are under ongoing review to ensure that resources are targeted and focussed on keeping waiting times in the provision of services to a minimum. </p><p>  In relation to the Circuit Court, it should be noted, for example, that in 2011 there were 674 weeks of sittings in venues outside Dublin. This increased to 767 weeks in 2012 and the President of the Circuit Court plans to increase capacity to 888 weeks during 2013, a 30% increase over 2011. The additional weeks will be provided across crime, family law and civil matters.  In addition, six specialist judges of the Circuit Court were appointed in July to deal with the new work arising as a result of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012. Scheduled sittings of the District Court continued this year during the months of August and September and the President continues to target judicial resources at the areas experiencing longest waiting times. </p><p>  In relation to the High Court, the President of the High Court keeps waiting times under continuous review and has introduced a number of initiatives including the reorganisation of sittings of the High Court outside Dublin and arranging for additional court sittings during court recesses.  The delegation to court officials of administrative functions previously dealt with by High Court judges has also increased judicial availability for trial work.  These initiatives continue to be reviewed and expanded.  During September, the President of the High Court scheduled additional sittings with a view to maintaining and reducing waiting times or facilitating urgent hearings.  A total of 32 Judges sat for the additional sittings and 1016 orders were made. The majority of High Court Lists, with the exception of the Asylum list, had prior to September relatively short waiting times and the September sittings have maintained or reduced those times . Twenty cases from the Asylum list were fully disposed of during these additional sittings.  In respect of the Court of Criminal Appeal, I understand that the Chief Justice, in consultation with the President of the High Court, convened 9 additional sittings during September and the first week of October to deal with sentence appeals/undue leniency applications. A total of 55 such cases have been allocated hearing dates comprising 36 sentence appeals and 19 undue leniency applications.</p><p>  During the last three weeks of the Summer Recess the Supreme Court dealt with 10 appeals;  judgment was reserved in five of those cases. In addition, the Court dealt with 4 motions. All judges sat in benches of three throughout the period. Although considerable efforts are being made to manage the waiting times, the issue of capacity in the Supreme Court can only be fully resolved through the introduction of the Court of Appeal, which will now be established following the successful outcome of the referendum on the proposed Thirty-third Amendment of the Constitution (Court of Appeal) Bill.  Following the appointment of two additional Supreme Court Judges on 17 October,  the Supreme Court has begun to sit in two panels and the list for the remainder of the current term sittings has been fixed on that basis. It is anticipated that the Supreme Court will continue to sit in two panels into 2014.  The backlog that has accumulated in the Supreme Court over the past number of years is such that, while there will be some immediate improvement over the coming year, it will take a longer period to reduce the waiting time for the hearing of appeals to a more appropriate level.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-05a.1840.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013110500086#WRKK01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 761 and 770 together.  </p><p>  A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited. </p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  Section 2(2)(d) provides that in exercising its jurisdiction under that section, a court shall take into account and may receive evidence or submissions concerning any conviction of the accused person for an offence committed while he or she was on bail.  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.  </p><p>  I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences continue to be committed by persons on bail. I share that concern and believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.  I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter as soon as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities. </p><p><b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>Insofar as the enforcement of bench warrants is concerned, including those which issue where a person on bail fails to attend in court, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na take all possible action to ensure that such persons are located as quickly as possible, having regard to all of the relevant circumstances.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>In relation to the statistical information sought by the Deputy, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. I have requested the CSO to provide relevant statistics in relation to breaches of bail directly to the Deputy.    I am advised by the Garda authorities that the compilation of the other information sought by the Deputy would require a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources.</p></reply>

This is used mainly for the monitoring of hospital in-patients who have been granted temporary release from prison and allows for a significant reduction in staffing costs for hospital escorts.   Arising from a recently conducted review of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001, I expect to seek Government approval for legislative proposals including a number of amendments to the 2001 Act shortly.  Legislative proposals being considered include measures for the electronic monitoring of sex offenders in specific circumstances.

The existence of such gangs and their membership does not remain static. It is therefore not possible to accurately attribute figures to convictions of gang members or to the number of gang members currently remanded on bail. </p><p>  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to utilise all available legislation, including the additional legislative provisions introduced by the Oireachtas in 2009 which amended the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 relating to organised crime.   In this regard, since the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 on the 23 July 2009 to 30 September, 2013, the legislation has been used on 212 occasions where arrests have been made relating to organised crime. To date, eight individuals have been charged under the legislation, six under Section 72 of the Criminal Justice  Act 2006 as inserted by section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, participating in organised crime and two under Section 71A of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 as inserted by section 5 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, directing the activities of a criminal organisation. </p></reply>

In this regard local Garda management in Kildare, as in all Garda Divisions, closely monitors the allocation of resources in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p><p>  Insofar as the level of burglary is concerned, the Deputy will be aware that Operation Fiacla was established by the Garda Commissioner to target burglary crime. This is an intelligence driven national operation and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda Region to target suspected offenders. Operation Fiacla has proved to be a robust and effective response to those who seek to prey on law abiding householders and this is borne out by the latest Crime Statistics published by the Central Statistics Office covering the 12 month period up to the second quarter of 2013. These show a welcome reduction of 8.9% in burglary and related offences over the previous 12 months, and continue a trend which has been evident since the introduction of Operation Fiacla. </p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  I have requested the CSO to provide the specific relevant statistics sought directly to the Deputy.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

Details in respect of each category are as follows: </p><p><b><i>Criminal Legal Aid</i></b></p><p>  There is no waiting period associated with the granting of criminal legal aid as under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid on the applicant's appearance in Court.</p><p><b><i>Civil Legal Aid</i></b></p><p>  Demand for legal services from the Legal Aid Board (&ldquo;the Board&rdquo;) has increased significantly since the down-turn in the economy. While there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand for general legal services (excluding asylum) in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006. Demand in 2013 is running marginally ahead of what it was in 2012. The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid at the same level for 2013 and for 2014 as it was in 2012 (and 2011). </p><p>  Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in lengthened waiting times for those seeking legal services for matters that are not prioritised.  Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery. The Public Appointments Service concluded a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board earlier this year from which a number of permanent appointments have been made and a number of temporary positions have also been filled.  </p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, on 12 September 2013, I signed into law a new statutory instrument in respect of civil legal aid provided by the Legal Aid Board which, inter alia, provides for an increased contribution from persons availing of the services offered by the Board.  </p><p>  I intend for any funds raised by these measures to be retained by the Board to better fund the provision of services to those in need of them and reduce waiting times for those services. At a time when the State is facing significant demands on its resources an increase in contributions allows the Board to achieve its objectives without money being diverted from other programmes. The increased contributions should result in increased funding of up to &euro;700,000 per annum being available to the Board once the increases have full impact.</p><p>  I believe this additional resource for the Board will assist it in tackling those waiting times. I am conscious that the increase in the minimum contribution as a percentage is significant.  However, I believe the contributions payable still compare favourably with other jurisdictions. Provisions remain in place to allow the contribution to be waived in hardship cases.</p><p>  In response to the changed environment the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services. Those steps include the following:</p><p> - The Board has been piloting a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage. The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times. The aim of the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes). If the applicant requires further services they remain on the &lsquo;waiting list&rsquo;. There is or has been a &lsquo;backlog&rsquo; of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month. A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were satisfied with this particular service initiative. This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved. </p><p> - In August 2012 the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres. This is a &lsquo;start to end&rsquo; system which will in the medium term deliver efficiencies in terms of the administration aspect as well as in relation to the delivery of the legal services. It will take time for the full benefits of this system to materialise;</p><p> - In November 2011 I transferred responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded family mediation service to the Board. A key reason for this transferring was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving these synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common. Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House (where the Dublin District Family Court sits) involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service located there also. Similar initiatives have now been introduced in Cork and Naas and are being evaluated; </p><p> - While the Board&rsquo;s asylum related legal services were previously funded from a separate grant, since 2012 I have funded the Board on the basis of a single &lsquo;grant-in-aid&rsquo;. With the drop in demand for asylum, the Board has taken steps to integrate the delivery of its asylum related services into the general law centre service delivery model thus effectively transferring resources from the asylum area to the general legal service area where the demands have increased; </p><p> - I am aware that the Board has maintained a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court. Cases in the District Court are often those that need the most immediate remedy;</p><p> - I am also aware that the Board continues to engage with other key players in the justice / legal area such as the Courts Service and the Health Service Executive, with a view to trying to ensure that State funded resources that impact on its area of business are used to best effect.</p><p>  In terms of administrative efficiencies I am aware that the Board has streamlined its financial eligibility process, that it has a Handbook of administrative procedures and that the aforementioned case management system is build around those procedures. All of these steps were taken to minimise the administrative aspect. I am also aware that the Board constantly keeps its procedures under review in order to ensure that they are efficient and efffective. </p><p>  I am very conscious of the difficulties that delays in accessing legal aid can give rise to and I am aware that the Board is also keenly aware of those difficulties and is working to ensure the delays are minimised to the greatest extent possible. </p></reply>

The Irish Prison Service provides a wide range of rehabilitative programmes that include education, vocational training, healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, counselling, welfare and spiritual services. These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services. On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison. At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date. Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral. </p><p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled us to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification.  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015. There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning including Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.</p></reply>

The Bill and key responses to it have also been considered in detail at Second Stage and by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality prior to the Bill's Committee Stage which commenced on 17 July.   </p><p>  Alongside those groups representing the legal professions with whom I have had both formal and informal direct meetings and from whom I have received a series of substantial submissions, I have had direct meetings with the Competition Authority, the Consumers' Association, the Honorable Society of King's Inns and the Committee of Heads of Irish University Law Schools and with the legal service regulators of other jurisdictions such as Australia and England and Wales.  In terms of written submissions, I have, as previously disclosed to the House, received just under 50 since publication of the Bill representing nearly 30 interested parties, along with dozens of individual letters from concerned members of the public and practitioners and the formal observations of other Government Departments. For their part, the Law Society, the Bar Council and the King's Inns have provided substantive views on a number of occasions and on key issues which are among those to which consideration continues to be given. Submissions have come from a wide range of bodies in addition to the legal professional bodies including from associations, academics, civil liberties and human rights organisations, private businesses and government agencies or Departments. They range in their scope from that of the entire Bill to that of particular provisions or issues arising within it. </p><p>  A wide range of stake-holders have therefore provided, and continue to submit, views on the Bill which I am more than happy to consider. These views continue to inform the development of the Bill and have to be considered against the Bill's modern balance of interests between those of the legal professions and those of business or private citizens who avail of legal services. The Deputy will appreciate the importance of the Government, in exercising its policy prerogative, maintaining this balance and conducting its consultations, direct or indirect, so as as to avoid any actual or perceived regulatory capture by any particular lobby or interest group.  At this point in time, there are a large number of issues upon which the respective views of stake-holders have been clearly expressed or continue to be aired including in the public domain and in readily accessible formats on the internet. Direct and indirect contacts with stake-holders continue to take place at official level. Finally, as I have previously stated, amendments to the Bill and a Regulatory Impact Analysis will be made available for consideration prior to its forthcoming resumption of Committee Stage which is to take place as soon as possible in the current session.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

The Government intends to proceed to ratification of the Convention as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are being met.  As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary. </p><p>  An Inter-Departmental Committee on the Convention is monitoring the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  The Committee has identified as part of its work programme, issues to be considered by various Government Departments.  It is a matter for those Departments to determine whether any actions are required in relation to these issues in advance of ratification and report back to the Committee.  This work is ongoing in all Departments.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, is also assisting it to assess remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure that all outstanding issues will be comprehensively addressed.</p><p>  As regards my own Department one of the key requirements is the enactment of capacity legislation.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a Bill that is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Assisted Decision - Making (Capacity) Bill, published on 17 July 2013, provides a series of options to support people with impaired capacity to make decisions and to exercise their basic rights, in line with the principles of the UN Convention.  It undertakes a comprehensive reform of existing legislation governing capacity.<b><font color="#000080">   </font></b>  The Bill has been scheduled for second stage in the D&aacute;il in early December.  The enactment of this legislation is just one of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed to enable ratification by the State of the Convention.</p></reply>

Adherence to the ruling was not dependant on the outcome of the referendum.  The legal position in respect of Ireland is essentially as the Deputy outlined it, namely that where an Irish citizen child would be deprived of the useful effect of its EU citizenship by having to leave the EU as a result of the removal/deportation of its parent(s) on whom that child is dependent, the parents should be permitted to remain.  They should also be permitted to work to provide for the citizen child's needs.  Each case obviously has to be looked at on its merits to establish the relevant facts and relationships.  </p></reply>

The Bill, which is currently being drafted, will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence court proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving a dispute before embarking on such proceedings. It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of any such proceedings, on its own initiative invite parties to consider the mediation option and suspend the proceedings to facilitate such a process.<b></b></p><p>  I am at present giving consideration to the possible inclusion of an over-arching governance structure for the mediation sector in the future legislation. The matter was raised by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence in its helpful report on the General Scheme of the Mediation Bill. Such a representative structure could, for example, play an important role in the promotion of mediation as an alternative to court proceedings and in the development of codes of practice for the sector. The Mediators' Institute has recently made a submission on mediation regulation and standards in the context of the future legislation and I shall have regard to the Institute's views when finalising the Bill for publication.</p></reply>

Residence permission had originally been granted to the principal person as a lay volunteer of a religious institution and his family members had been granted permission as a result of his status. On 27th June 2013 a letter issued to the applicants' requesting copies of their passports. These were received on 1st August 2013. </p><p>  An examination of the passports showed that the applicants' were at that time residing outside the State and had been since 28th June 2013. Further correspondence indicated that the spouse of the principal person and their children had re-entered the State on 23rd August 2013. On 10th September 2013 a letter was issued requesting evidence that the principal person had re-entered the State and if he had not, that a date be provided as to when he intended to return. </p><p>  On 19th September 2013 a letter was received from the principal's spouse stating that her spouse was still outside the State and that he would not return until 25th October 2013. The letter also stated that the principal's spouse and his children had re-entered the State in order that their children could continue with their schooling. On 21st October 2013 a letter was issued to the applicants' refusing their application and requesting them to leave the State by 23rd November 2013.   It is open to the applicants to submit to INIS further information or documentation setting out the circumstances that they believe would support a review of the decision in their case. </p></reply>

A vetting disclosure is made by the Unit in response to a written request and with the permission of the person who is the subject of that request. Garda vetting disclosures are issued to specified organisations registered with the GCVU for that purpose in respect of a particular post or employment.  The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012 and is expected to process in the region of 350,000 applications this year. All decisions relating to the employment of individuals rest with the relevant organisations concerned. The Deputy will appreciate that vetting in this context relates to the protection of children and vulnerable adults.</p><p>  Should the Deputy be referring to the matter of private security, he may also wish to note that the Private Security Authority (PSA) is the statutory body responsible for the licensing and regulation of the private security industry.  In the event that the question relates to private security at events, the Deputy may wish to note that the PSA has adopted a phased approach to licensing and that it proposes to commence the licensing of event security contractors in the first instance, with the licensing of employees to follow.  </p><p>  A Statutory Regulation and minimum standards for contractors working in the event security sector are currently being prepared.  I believe these arrangements, when finalised, will be of great benefit to both the industry and the public in general in relation to security at a wide range of events.  The Deputy will appreciate, aside from any issues which may arise in relation to vetting and any requirements in relation to the Private Security Authority,  I have no functions in relation to legislation on general qualifications and recruitment practices in the sectors referred to by the Deputy   <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p></reply>

I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is now approximately 9 weeks from date of receipt. However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion. Nonetheless, this is a significant improvement on the processing time of 14 weeks which existed in July this year. This improvement reflects the fact that I have given this matter particular priority as it is essential that the GCVU has the resources required to perform this most critical of roles effectively and efficiently.</p><p>   In that context,  I have been actively engaged on this issue with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. As a result of that engagement, I am pleased to say that the Garda Commissioner has confirmed to me that there are now 136 whole time equivalent staff assigned to the GCVU, some 41 of whom have been redeployed from elsewhere in the public service since the end of March 2013. Some of these redeployed staff have only recently completed their training in the vetting process, and the full impact of their work will be seen in the coming weeks. Furthermore, I have also recently received sanction for the redeployment of approximately 40 additional staff to the GCVU. This brings the total number of staff in that service to over 170, more than double that of the average allocation of 78 staff at the Unit over the past two and a half years.</p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the development of an e-Vetting solution is also underway. This will facilitate the processing of all applications in an e-format, thus removing the time-consuming current process of manually managing all applications received . The initial phase of testing this e-vetting system will take place during late 2013.  When this is achieved, this system will streamline the overall vetting process in this jurisdiction, and further contribute to reductions in processing times for all vetting applications.   <b><font color="#000080">      </font></b></p></reply>

Such transfers may be facilitated where the other country has ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.  Transfer requests under the Convention are normally made by a prisoner through the governor of the prison in which he or she is detained.  I decide on all such requests following the collation of a number of reports from various agencies setting out the consequences of such a transfer.  The consent of all three parties in the process is required prior to any transfer, i.e. the sentencing state, the receiving state and the sentenced person.</p><p>  Each case is judged on its individual merit and cases are processed as quickly as possible. Cases can take anywhere between 3 months and 2 years to be completed and can take even longer in some extreme cases. Some of the reasons for delays include the following;  incomplete documentation which has to be returned to the requestor or their legal representatives, the relevant requested documentation not submitted with original request which is a common occurrence, for example a  birth certificate or copy of passport not submitted. Delays can also take place in the sending jurisdiction which are out of our control.</p></reply>

Levels of enforcement are high and involve targeted policing and awareness raising measures, including the deployment of safety cameras throughout the country.</p><p>  In so far as detections are concerned, I am informed by the Garda authorities that fixed charge notices are issued for relevant speeding offences.

If no payment is received, a second notice is issued and a further period of 28 days is provided during which payment is accepted at the fixed charge plus 50%.

The section further provides that, if the person pays, the fixed charge proceedings in respect of the alleged offence will be discontinued and the person need not attend the court on the day.

An application fee of &euro;175 is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a fee is payable by applicants on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.  There is no legal provision to waive the applicable statutory fees in any circumstance.<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  Every application, including those made on the basis of marriage to an Irish citizen, must be assessed to establish if the statutory requirements are met.  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  <br /><br />  As the Deputy will be aware I have introduced formal citizenship ceremonies at no extra cost to applicants.

Human rights training is provided to public officials including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, members of the Defence Forces and custodial personnel working in the Irish Prison Service. The Human Rights Commission makes human rights training available on request to the civil and public service. Similar facilities in respect of equality and combating discrimination are available from the Equality Authority. In line with the Programme for Government commitment to &quot;require all public bodies to take due note of equality and human rights in carrying out their functions&quot;, I am providing in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill for creation of a positive duty on public bodies to do so and for the Commission to provide support and advice to public bodies in meeting that obligation.<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>  Ireland's population has become increasingly diverse over the past two decades. I think it is fair to say that, in general, Irish people have been warm and welcoming to the large number of EU and non-EU residents who have now made Ireland their home. Intercommunal conflicts of the kind seen elsewhere have so far been absent from our society.  However, we must not become complacent and we must be alert to the potential danger of the emergence of racial discord. I encourage anyone who has experienced racist abuse or has ever felt discriminated against because of their ethnic or national origin to come forward to the Equality Authority or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and seek their assistance and protection.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></p></reply>

Its concluding observations covered a wide range of areas which impact on the remit of several Government Departments.<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>In relation to the Magdalen Laundries, the Committee recommended that   <i>&quot;the State should institute prompt, independent, and thorough investigations into all allegations of torture, and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that were allegedly committed in the Magdalen Laundries and, in appropriate cases, prosecute and punish the perpetrators with penalties commensurate with the gravity of the offences committed, and ensure that all victims obtain redress and have an enforceable right to compensation including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible&rdquo;.</i><br /><br />  While I had decided before the UNCAT  observations were received to initiate an inquiry into Magdalen laundries, the outcome of that inquiry only became available in January 2013.   The McAleese report provides an independent, comprehensive, factual account of the Magdalen institutions.   Some of these institutions had ceased operations nearly 50 years previously and there was no reliable account available of their operations.  It brought into the public arena a considerable amount of information not previously known.  It also showed that many of the preconceptions about these institutions were not supported by the facts.<br /><br />  In particular nothing was discovered to suggest there was systematic torture or other criminal behaviour that would warrant a comprehensive criminal investigation with a view to multiple criminal prosecutions.  This is not to rule out the possibility of isolated criminal offences or to down play the harsh conditions endured by the women in question.  With regard to prosecutions, the only mechanism to prosecute and punish perpetrators for offences committed in this jurisdiction requires a criminal investigation, a decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute and then a criminal trial.   Irish law does not provide for any other type of inquiry to lead to criminal prosecutions.  Any complaint of criminal behaviour made by any individual to the Garda&iacute; regarding Magdalen laundries are matters that can be investigated by the Garda&iacute;.<br /><br />  The Rapporteur for the follow-up on Concluding Observations of the UN Committee against Torture subsequently wrote seeking clarification and further information on a number of matters including matters relating to Magdalen Laundries.  A detailed response to the queries raised was forwarded to the Rapporteur through the correct channels.  The full  McAleese Report is also available to the Rapporteur.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></p></reply>

Service in the F&oacute;rsa Cosanta &Aacute;iti&uacute;il (FCA) is not generally reckonable as pensionable service.     However, in certain specified situations, service by members of the FCA engaged on full time security duties may be reckoned and aggregated with pensionable service in the PDF.  This applies in the case of former members of the FCA who were assimilated into the PDF under special arrangements made in 1982 and 1988/89 or who enlisted in the PDF outside of those special arrangements and were in service on 1 January, 1990.</p><p>  The person in question, who was a member of the FCA and did not serve in the PDF, does not fall within any of the above categories.

The costs that are recouped are fixed costs of &euro;186,024 per quarter (which includes salaries and related personnel costs) and operating costs of &euro;1,620 per flying hour, as well as any other miscellaneous costs that may be incurred by the Air Corps.</p><p>From the commencement of the pilot EAS service on 4 June 2012 until 31 October 2013 the Air Corps has completed a total of 464 EAS missions.  These included cases of segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), trauma, medical, paediatric and other time-critical cases, as tasked by the HSE&rsquo;s National Aero-Medical Coordination Centre.  To date, STEMI and suspected STEMI related missions have accounted for almost one-third of completed EAS missions. While the focus of the pilot service has been on the West of Ireland, and the majority of missions completed to date have been to counties in the West and Midland regions, patients throughout the country who met the clinical criteria have benefitted from the pilot service.</p><p>  Following a review of the pilot service carried out earlier this year by an inter agency Audit and Evaluation Group established under the MOU, a Report was submitted for consideration by my colleague, the Minister for Health. Following a request from the Minister for Health, I have agreed to extend the Air Corps&rsquo; participation in the pilot in order to allow the Minister an opportunity to give consideration to the Report and to examine the options for the implementation of its recommendations.</p></reply>

In providing material to allow me to reply to Parliamentary Question No. 295 the military authorities omitted to provide information relating to the 5th Engineer non-commissioned officers course. It clearly should have formed part of the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 295. I wish to assure the Deputy that it was not my intention to mislead him in terms of the reply that I gave on that occasion and the omission of the information was due to an oversight. With regard to the 5th Engineer non-commissioned officers course, I have been advised by the military authorities that individuals wishing to complete courses such as this would normally fill out a course application form at unit level in order to apply for a place on the course. In this instance, however, I understand that there were sufficient places available to accommodate all Corps of Engineer personnel who needed to complete the course in order to qualify for promotion.  I understand that all personnel of Corporal rank within the Corps of Engineers are encouraged to complete the course in order to qualify for promotion.</p><p>  Finally, I have been informed that while there were no unexplained withdrawals from the course, one student returned to his Unit at his own request on the 11th of September 2013.</p></reply>

In these circumstances it is vital that the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised. In 1990 the Gleeson Commission commented on the unsatisfactory age and fitness profile of the PDF. Thereafter, an in depth study of the Defence Forces by Price Waterhouse Consultants in 1994, who had been engaged by the Efficiency Audit Group (EAG), expressed severe criticism of the age profile of the Defence Forces. The present terms of enlistment arose from such criticism. One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of PDF personnel.    In 1997 agreement was reached with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA) on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) after 1 January, 1994. A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern defence forces.</p><p>The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.</p><p> - Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service;</p><p> - Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years;</p><p> - Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six. </p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by PDF members in those ranks.  A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter. In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the PDF. The Deputy will appreciate that as deliberations under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.</p></reply>

The provisional agenda for the meeting was circulated last week.  The first session will take place on the 18<sup>th</sup> November with a joint meeting of Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers who will be presented with the opportunity to discuss Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) Council Conclusions in view of the upcoming European Council meeting on defence in December 2013. At this meeting, Heads of States and Governments will discuss defence issues for the first time in five years.On the 19<sup>th</sup> November the European Defence Agency (EDA) Steering Board meeting in Defence Ministers format will take place. This session will primarily focus on the EDA&rsquo;s input to European Council discussions in December.</p><p>The final session will focus on CSDP Missions and Operations. At this session, the Operation and Mission Commanders of the four ongoing EU military missions will brief Defence Ministers on the current state of play regarding their missions. These are Operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina; Operation EUNAVFOR ATALANTA the EU&rsquo;s anti-piracy maritime mission off the coast of Somalia; and the EU Training Missions in Mali and Somalia (EUTM Mali and EUTM Somalia).</p><p>I am of the view that CSDP needs to reinvigorated and that the processes and mechanisms of CSDP need to be made more efficient and effective.  We also need political commitment at the highest level to the development and provision by the Member States of capabilities for CSDP operations and an effective industrial and technology base to deliver those capabilities.  I look forward to the European Council discussions in December, which I expect will provide strong support and political direction to the continuing development and evolution of a credible, effective and operational CSDP.  </p></reply>

While there, I addressed delegates on a wide range of issues. These included the preparation of the new White Paper on Defence; the significant reorganisational reforms over the last twelve months; the participation of PDFORRA in the Haddington Road Agreement negotiations; investment in new equipment and the broader international context in which Ireland&rsquo;s Defence policy sits. The Delegates responded positively to my address and extended to me and my officials every courtesy while in attendance at Conference. I also heard the issues and concerns of PDFORRA, as expressed by their General Secretary in his address to Conference.   I left the PDFORRA Conference greatly heartened by the constructive attitude shown by the Association, its President, Executive and General Officers.

To this end, general service recruitment recommenced in September 2013, from the existing competition panels, from which it is expected there will be an intake of approximately 400 recruits.  In addition 20 Apprentices for the Air Corps and 15 Engine Room Artificers for the Naval Service are due to be recruited from current competitions.  It is my intention that targeted recruitment will continue in 2014, within the resource envelope allocated to Defence, in order to maintain the stabilised strength of the Permanent Defence Force.With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, it is intended to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.<i></i></p></reply>

In designing the new RDP, my Department must take account of a range of requirements set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation and the need to support key policy aims for the agri-food sector.  </p><p>  The draft Rural Development Regulation sets out a menu of possible measures for the new RDP, including a compulsory Agri Environment Climate Scheme, a Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, On Farm Investment Schemes, funding for training and knowledge transfer, and funding for farm and business development.  Co funding rates vary between the different measures.  Article 65 of the draft Regulation sets the maximum European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development Fund (EAFRD) contribution at 53%.  There are a number of derogations to this, including that the maximum EAFRD contribution shall be</p><p>- 80% for measures under the articles dealing with knowledge transfer and information, producer groups, co-operation, business start up for young farmers, and LEADER, and</p><p>- 75% for operations contributing to the objectives of environment and climate change mitigation under the articles dealing with investment in physical assets, afforestation and creation of woodland, the establishment of agroforestry systems, agri-environment and climate, organic farming, Natura 2000 and the water framework directive, areas of natural constraint and forestry environment and climate services and forestry conservation.</p><p>  Final decisions in relation to what measures are to be included in the new RDP have not yet been made.  Work is continuing on designing the new RDP on the basis of the requirements set out in the draft Regulation, and as part of this process my Department is in ongoing contact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the overall financing that will be required. I expect to make decisions in relation to the RDP by the end of this year, and to submit a draft programme to the Commission in early 2014.</p></reply>

For this reason, it has not been possible to finalise the processing of the application.</p><p>  The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht are commencing the development of a Threat Response Plan (TRP) for the conservation of hen harriers.  The plan is expected to take approximately two years to complete and forestry will form a significant element of the Plan.  The Forest Service will be liaising closely with the NPWS in the formulation of the TRP on aspects relating to afforestation, felling and replanting.  It is also understood that the NPWS will engage in a formal public consultation process in relation to the Plan, which it will announce at the appropriate time.</p><p>  As development of the TRP progresses, and in advance of its completion, opportunities may arise &ndash; possibly in late 2014 - to pursue an interim arrangement to allow for the limited issuing of afforestation approvals in some hen harrier SPAs.  Until then, the Forest Service will not be in a position to approve any afforestation projects within these SPAs.</p></reply>

The Department has commenced implementation of a further review of the work in the remaining 16 Regional Offices in order to maximise efficiencies and productivity in the use of resources through revised work practices and processes.  The review, which was completed earlier this year, concluded that, arising from the investment in technology and the substantial reduction in disease levels in recent years, there was significant scope for redeployment of administrative staff from local offices.</p><p>  The review also made several recommendations aimed at improving business processes both within the local offices and in relation to the manner in which it implements various schemes, in particular the disease eradication schemes, with a view to reducing the administrative burden on farmers and the cost to the Department of administering these schemes.  The recommendations included, for example, that passports should no longer be taken up from restricted herds and that the practice of issuing movement permits for &ldquo;clear&rdquo; cattle in reactor herds should be discontinued.  Many of these recommendations have now been implemented and have further significantly reduced the number of the administrative staff needed in the local offices.</p><p>  With regard to Tralee, my Department has taken the opportunity to recently redeploy the equivalent of 7 full time staff to Shared Payroll Services in Killarney.  Arising from the improvements in business processes referred to above and the very substantial reduction in disease levels, the number of administrative and clerical staff in Tralee has been reduced from 20.37 full time equivalents (FTE) in 2008 to 10.6  FTE at present.  This policy fits in both with the Department&rsquo;s objectives in driving efficiency and savings and also with the broad public service reform agenda which facilitates the re-deployment of staff from the local offices to other State agencies and, thereby, enable the Government to provide services through these agencies more efficiently.</p></reply>

Issues relating to control of scrub and rushes must, therefore, be seen in this overall context.</p><p>  Farmers can keep grassland in GAEC by conducting an agricultural activity on it, such as grazing, harvesting forage crops, or by topping.  Grasslands continue to be eligible where it is evident that the stocking rate on the land is sufficient and, for example, keeps scrub and rushes under control and avoids their proliferation.  Where land is deemed ineligible, this, in the main, is a result of the inclusion of ineligible areas/features and where it is not being used for an agricultural purpose.  In cases where land with scrub or rushes is rejected, it will be seen that this is due to the broader issue of insufficient agricultural activity being undertaken on it to keep it in GAEC.  My Department therefore does not maintain records specifically on the presence of scrub and rushes since the issue has to be seen in the broader context.  Where a farmer undertakes remedial work to bring land back into GAEC, this land can be submitted in future years together with a map and supporting documentation detailing the remedial work undertaken.</p></reply>

As I have indicated previously, while it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend in the near future to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed.  My firm intention is that the process will be fully inclusive and that all stakeholders, particularly farmers and their representatives will be central to the process.</p><p>  Commonage lands form an important part of the farming enterprises of many farmers, particularly along the West Coast.  They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism.  However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem.  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission.  It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC.</p><p>  Taking all of these matters into account, it is my stated aim is to ensure that a practical solution is reached, which will ensure that the current farmers actively farming these lands are protected, that the land is maintained or returned to GAEC and that the requirements of the governing EU Regulations are met.  In my view, this can best be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.  With regard to the specific recommendations of the Committee contained in their Report, I can confirm that these will be included among the range of issues to be addressed in the process that will shortly be commenced by my Department.</p></reply>

Farmers who participate in the Basic Payment Scheme must implement the three standard greening measures as follows: Crop diversification; Permanent grassland; Ecological Focus Area (EFA).</p><p>  There is no obligation under &lsquo;crop diversification&rsquo; where the arable land of the holding covers less than ten hectares.  Where the arable land of the holding covers between 10 and 30 hectares, the farmer is obliged to have at least two crops of which the main crop shall not cover more than 75% of the arable land.  Where the arable land of the holding covers more than 30 hectares, the farmer is obliged to have at least three crops of which the main crop shall not cover more than 75% of the arable land and the two main crops shall not cover more than 95% of the arable land.</p><p>  Where there is more than 15 hectares of arable land in a holding, then at least 5% of the arable land must be allocated to Ecological Focus Area.  There are a number of features which are considered Ecological Focus Area including landscape features such as hedges, ditches, trees in line or in group etc.  Insofar as livestock farmers are concerned there is an obligation to ensure that the ratio of permanent grassland to total agricultural area does not decrease by more than 5% compared to a reference ratio to be established by Member States in 2015.  This obligation can be monitored at National level and is therefore unlikely to affect individual livestock farmers.  There is also an obligation on Member States to designate environmentally sensitive permanent grasslands, such as peat and wetlands, situated in areas covered by the Natura Directive and farmers will be prevented from ploughing such areas.  It is most unlikely that such areas in Ireland would be ploughed in any event.</p><p>  There are a number of exemptions whereby farmers will be considered to have fulfilled one or more of their greening obligations in certain circumstances.  Of most relevance to Ireland, and to livestock farmers in particular, is the provision that exempts farms where more than 75% of the total eligible land of the holding is used for the production of grasses or other herbaceous forage or land laying fallow, or a combination of these, provided that any remaining arable area does not exceed 30 hectares.  It is my intention to decide on the final shape of greening and all other issues related to the new Direct Payments system in Ireland later this year.</p></reply>

My Department is bound, under EU Regulations, to maintain the accuracy the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), which underpins the processing of applications under these Schemes as well as REPS and AEOS.</p><p>  At the start of each year, my Department issued colour maps of all land parcels declared by farmers in the previous year together with a covering letter. In that letter, farmers are reminded to examine each map carefully and to identify and exclude from their application all ineligible features such as buildings, farmyards, scrub, roadways, forests, lakes etc. included in the land parcels.   There is, therefore, an onus on all farmers to ensure that the area of land declared by them as eligible for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes is accurate. They are also given the means to do so by making the ortho-photos available to them on an annual basis. These requirements are also made clear in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes, which accompanies the pre-printed application form issued to all farmers at the commencement of the application period each year. </p><p>  In addition to any changes submitted by farmers, in order to insure the integrity of the LPIS, my Department continuously reviews the eligibility of lands claimed by farmers for the Single Payment Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes.  </p><p>As part of the clearance process a bi-lateral meeting was held on 25th July between the EU Commission Clearance auditors and my Department. At that meeting it was agreed that in order to avoid a significant correction, this Department had to (i) review its entire LPIS database and deal with ineligible features &ndash; re-digitise &ndash; (ii) establish any over-payments due to the over-declaration and seek refund from the farmers involved (iii) prepare a report of its findings to the Commission by 15th December. </p><p>  Depending on the level of risk assessed by the EU Commission financial corrections may be applied to a Member State. These corrections can be very substantial and may vary from 2% to 10% or even 100% in certain cases.  It can, therefore, be appreciated that the financial risk is very significant. Other Member States who have been subject to this review process have been levied with very substantial financial corrections, up to &euro;500 million in one instance.</p><p>  This is a mammoth task but my Department is making effort to ensure that it will be completed in a manner that satisfies the Commission.  The Department is currently reviewing all land parcels claimed. This effectively means a review of all 950,000 land parcels. As a result of this phase of this review, any payments made to farmers in respect of claimed areas, which were found to be ineligible, must be reimbursed. The Review of the 950,000 parcels contained on the LPIS database is at an advanced stage and is on target to be finalised in time.  It is not possible, as yet, to give detailed results. </p><p>  I have introduced a robust and comprehensive appeal process. In the first instance, applicants are entitled to have their case reviewed by submitting their appeal on the form provided by my Department. If they are not satisfied with the outcome of the review, they can appeal their case to the independent-chaired Land Eligibility Appeals Committee, details of which I announced recently. This Committee will consist of an independent Chairman and appeals officers from the Agriculture Appeals Office. </p></reply>

As part of this review a number of ineligible features were removed from the parcels declared by the person named. The ineligible features relate to scrub and a number of buildings.</p><p>  As the area over claimed was 29.15% of the eligible area found, the penalty applied resulted in a 100% overpayment for the year 2013 and therefore no payment is due to issue. The person named was notified of this decision and of his right of appeal to my Department. In the event that he is dissatisfied with the outcome of this review he can appeal his case to the independent-chaired Land Eligibility Appeals Committee, details of which I announced recently.

The Request for Tenders (RFT) facilitated a range of business operators to participate in this competition by providing for entities to join together in a consortium to satisfy the requirements of the RFT. </p><p>  The RFT asked applicants to demonstrate that they had an overall turnover of a minimum of &euro;3 million for each of the last three preceding years. The selection of the turnover figure, which was not restricted to the sale of cattle tags, was influenced by the obligation on the Department to ensure that the successful contractor would have the financial standing to undertake all of the deliverables set down in the contract for the duration of this  significant contract including, inter alia, provision of conventional, electronic and tissue tags, processing tag orders, supplying at least 2 million tag sets, replacement tags and registration forms and operating a helpdesk. </p><p>  I should emphasise that the implementation of an effective and reputable identification system plays a key role in underpinning beef and dairy exports in a competitive marketplace. </p></reply>

My Department is bound, under EU Regulations, to maintain the accuracy the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), which underpins the processing of applications under these Schemes as well as REPS and AEOS.</p><p>  At the start of each year, my Department issues colour maps of all land parcels declared by farmers in the previous year together with a covering letter. In that letter, farmers are reminded to examine each map carefully and to identify and exclude from their application all ineligible features such as buildings, farmyards, scrub, roadways, forests, lakes etc. included in the land parcels.   There is, therefore, an onus on all farmers to ensure that the area of land declared by them as eligible for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes is accurate. They are also given the means to do so by making the ortho-photos available to them on an annual basis. These requirements are also made clear in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes, which accompanies the pre-printed application form issued to all farmers at the commencement of the application period each year. </p><p>  In addition to any changes submitted by farmers, in order to insure the integrity of the LPIS, my Department continuously reviews the eligibility of lands claimed by farmers for the Single Payment Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes.  </p><p>As part of the clearance of account process, conducted by the EU Commission, a bi-lateral meeting was held on 25th July between the EU Commission Clearance auditors and my Department. At that meeting it was agreed that in order to avoid a significant correction, this Department had to (i) review its entire LPIS database and deal with ineligible features &ndash; re-digitise &ndash; (ii) establish any over-payments due to the over-declaration and seek refund from the farmers involved and (iii) prepare a report of its findings to the Commission by 15th   December. Depending on the level of risk assessed by the EU Commission financial corrections may be applied to a Member State. These corrections can be very substantial and may vary from 2% to 10% or even 100% in certain cases.  It can, therefore, be appreciated that the financial risk is very significant. Other Member States who have been subject to this review process have been levied with very substantial financial corrections, up to &euro;500 million in one instance.</p><p>  This is a mammoth task but my Department is making effort to ensure that it will be completed in a manner that satisfies the Commission.  The Department is currently reviewing all land parcels claimed. This effectively means a review of all 950,000 land parcels. As a result of this phase of this review, any payments made to farmers in respect of claimed areas, which were found to be ineligible, must be reimbursed. The Review of the 950,000 parcels contained on the LPIS database is well advanced at this stage and is on target to be finalised in time to allow a comprehensive response to the Commission within the specified time-frame. </p><p>  I have introduced a robust and comprehensive appeal process. In the first instance, applicants are entitled to have their case reviewed by submitting their appeal on the form provided by my Department. If they are not satisfied with the outcome of the review, they can appeal their case to the independent-chaired Land Eligibility Appeals Committee, details of which I announced recently. This Committee will consist of an independent Chairman and appeals officers from the Agriculture Appeals Office. </p><p>  County-specific statistics will be available immediately the exercise is completed.</p></reply>

This legislation will provide a statutory basis for registration of pre-school services and will introduce a range of new enforcement powers for Inspectors at pre-prosecution level. Under the proposed new system, all pre-school services will have to be registered in order to operate. Inspectors will be empowered to specify improvement conditions that a service must comply with; and the threat of removal of registration will be available. This system will, for the first time, provide for timely and effective regulation and enforcement of standards in pre-school services, backed up by statutory registration.  </p><p>  New National Quality Standards for pre-school services will be launched before the end of the year. These Standards will complement the existing Pre-School Regulations  replacing previous explanatory notes; and will set out the quality outcomes and supporting criteria against which inspection under the pre-school regulations will be measured. </p><p>  On foot of Budget 2014, I will be allocating &euro;4.5m in Exchequer funding to support the implementation of the Pre-School Quality Agenda which will seek to support and assure higher standards in pre-school services.  Of this funding, &euro;1.5m is provided to support staff training to meet the new qualification requirements recently announced by my Department.   The current minimum requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year will be increased to Level 6.  In addition, all pre-school assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a new pre-school service, will be subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  These requirements will be effective from September 2014 for new services and from September 2015 for existing services.  </p></reply>

Section 58 of the Act  provides for exemptions for certain categories of childminders from the provisions of Section 51 and the services exempted under this section are not required to give notice to the HSE of their service. </p><p>  Childminders who are not subject to the requirement to notify are, however, encouraged to voluntarily notify their service to their local City or County Childcare Committee which provides a range of supports to enable them to improve the standards of their childcare service. These supports include the Childminders Tax Exemption scheme which provides for a tax exemption for those childminders who have satisfactorily participated in the Voluntary Notification process and whose annual income from childminding does not exceed &euro;15,000.  Despite these supports the number of childminders who opted to voluntarily notify their services only reached approximately 1,250 in 2011.   </p><p>  While my Department continues to actively promote the notification of childminding services and the participation of childminders in quality and training programmes, parents continue to enter into informal arrangements with childminders who are outside the scope of the Regulations. There are no means available to my Department to establish the number of childminders, providing childcare from their own homes, who are not subject to the Regulations and who have chosen not to participate in the voluntary notification process, or  to establish the number of children availing of these services. </p><p>  The number of Childminder participants in the Quality Awareness Programme, provided to my Department by Pobal and based on the City/County Childcare Committee Annual Progress Reports, is as follows:<table><tr><th>at 30 June 2013</th><th>   197</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>   339</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>   475</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>   767</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>1,045</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>1,059</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>   942</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>1,049</td></tr><tr><td>  2005</td><td> 1,284</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>7,157</td></tr></table>  In addition I have, in recent weeks, received the report of the Expert Advisory Group on the Early Years Strategy. The report includes a recommendation on an extension of regulation of childminders. I am currently reviewing this recommendation ahead of finalisation of the Early Years Strategy. </p></reply>

The programme is being introduced on foot of the Programme for Government commitment to adopt an area-based approach to child poverty, drawing on best international practice and existing services to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched, and improve the outcomes for children and young people. The programme is being co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and is expected to have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The programme will build on and continue much of the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) which was also implemented by my Department and co-funded by the Atlantic Philanthropies.</p><p>  In addition to the three PEIP sites, I am expecting that at least 3 new sites will participate in the new programme.  It is also my intention to broaden the impact of the programme by beginning the process of mainstreaming some of the evidence-based programmes which have been positively evaluated and are cost-effective.  The establishment of my Department's Child and Family Agency in the coming months will be important to this process.  </p><p>  Applications to participate in the programme were invited from interested not for profit consortia earlier this year.  Fifty applications were received.  Last July the Government approved the transition of the three sites which participated in the PEIP into the new programme. The programme is seeking to finalize contracts with the PEIP sites in the near future.</p><p>  The remaining applications were reviewed by a Working Group led by my Department, using criteria set out in the application process.  The recommendations of the Working Group have been considered by the Project Team which is overseeing the new programme and are expected to be considered by the Government in the coming weeks.  Successful applicants will be invited to progress to the next, more detailed stage of the process which, if successfully completed, will be followed by contract stage and entry to the programme. </p></reply>

These Regulations are supported by explanatory notes which offer guidance and assist in interpreting the Regulations.  New National Quality Standards for Pre-School Services will be launched before the end of the year.  These new Standards will replace the explanatory notes and will set out the outcomes and supporting criteria against which the quality of child care services will be measured.  </p><p>  Legislation to strengthen the current inspection regime and underpin the Pre-School Quality Agenda is expected to be enacted before the end of the year.  This legislation will provide a statutory basis for registration of pre-school services and will introduce a range of new enforcement powers for Inspectors at pre-prosecution level.  Under the proposed new system, all pre-school services will have to be registered in order to operate.  Inspectors will be empowered to specify improvement conditions that a service must comply with; and the threat of removal of registration will be available.  This system will, for the first time, provide for timely and effective regulation and enforcement of standards in pre-school services, backed up by statutory registration.</p><p>  It is my intention to introduce new qualification requirements for staff delivering child care in the pre-school sector and the new legislative changes will provide for this.  This will be an important new development as, at present, staff working in child care services other than under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, are not subject to any requirement in respect of qualifications.  The minimum requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year will be increased to Level 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ).  In addition, all pre-school assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a pre-school service, will be subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  This requirement will be effective from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services. </p><p>  The legislation will also provide for the regulation of after-school childcare services.  I expect to be in position the commence the development of after-school regulations in 2014.</p></reply>

My view is that persons affected by adoption should be provided with a statutory right to as much information as possible within permissible Constitutional boundaries. The constitutional and legal context within which the development of legislative proposals must be undertaken is complex. This has influenced the existing approach to access to information which, while subject to significant development in recent years, has heretofore operated based upon the consent of all the parties. The proposed legislation is intended to provide for a structured and regulated approach for applicants seeking access to adoption information and is also intended to facilitate contact between parties affected by adoption, including in circumstances where an adoption order was not effected. </p><p>  Complex legal and Constitutional issues have arisen during the course of  preparation of the Heads of Bill including the setting of criteria for balancing an adopted person's right to information about his or her identity as against a birth parent's right to privacy.   This is a particular challenge in considering the impact on individuals in respect of adoptions which took place in the past where the concept of confidentiality and privacy were very central in the adoption process. These issues are currently receiving careful examination and detailed consideration is underway on the part of my Department and the Office of the Attorney General.</p><p>  I am anxious to bring the Heads of Bill before Government at the earliest possible date. Again, my view is that persons affected by adoption should be provided with a statutory right to as much information as permissible within Constitutional boundaries.

Since this issue was brought to my attention, officials in my Department have been seeking a way to address the problems due to the sudden change in Russian legislation. </p><p>  It is my understanding that in order to adopt from Russia it is necessary to have a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt on the date of the court hearing to finalise the adoption, and for a specified period thereafter before the Court order takes effect. In order that those affected could continue with their adoption, which was stopped by this change in Russian law, an amendment to the Adoption Act, 2010, would be necessary. </p><p>  The advice of the Attorney General has been sought and I understand that in principle it is possible to enact legislation which could retrospectively extend the period of validity to declarations. As the Adoption Act, 2010, is drafted on the basis of the incorporation of the Hague Convention and the minimum set of standards outlined therein, the implications of amending the Act must be carefully examined before I make a decision to amend the legislation.  My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, is examining if it is possible to address this situation within the parameters of Irish law and the Constitution.</p></reply>

A person living in Ireland for at least one year is generally considered by the HSE to be 'ordinarily resident' and is entitled to either full eligibility or limited eligibility for health services. People who have not been resident in Ireland for at least one year must satisfy the HSE that it is their intention to remain for a minimum of one year in order to be eligible for health services.</p><p>  The Health Act 1970 (as amended) provides for two categories of eligibility for all persons ordinarily resident in the country, i.e. full eligibility (medical card) and limited eligibility (all others).  Full eligibility is determined mainly by reference to income limits and is granted to persons who, in the opinion of the health Service Executive (HSE) are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services to persons and themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.  There is a provision for discretion to grant a card in cases of &quot;undue hardship&quot; where the income guidelines are exceeded. </p><p>  Persons living in Ireland and receiving a social security payment from another European Union/European Economic Area country or Switzerland, and not liable to contribute to the Irish Social Welfare System and not in receipt of an Irish Social Welfare Payment, may be granted a medical card under the provisions of EU Regulations.  </p><p>  Persons with full eligibility (medical card holders) are entitled to a range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and maternity and infant care services. They are also entitled to prescribed drugs and medicines subject to a &euro;2.50 charge per prescribed item (maximum charge of &euro;25.00 per month).  Other services such as allied health professional services may be available to medical card holders.</p><p>  People with limited eligibility (non-medical card holders) are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services and out-patient pubic hospital services including consultants services.  The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is &euro;75 per night, to a maximum of &euro;750 in any twelve consecutive months.  Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of &euro;100 where the patient does not have a referral note from his/her doctor.

Fees are not paid where eligibility no longer exists e.g. following an assessment of means, emigration or death. Under the Health Act 1970, there is an obligation on all card holders to notify the HSE of any change in their circumstances, which would put them above the Medical Card/GP Visit Card income guidelines.</p><p>  In addition to the review of eligibility on expiration of a medical card, targeted reviews of eligibility were introduced during 2012, in relation to medical cards which had been inactive for more than 12 months.  In such cases, medical card holders were formally contacted to confirm that they were still resident in the State.  In cases where no response was received, eligibility was removed and the payment of capitation fees ceased. </p><p>  In 2012, the HSE introduced data sharing with the Death Events Publication Service (DEPS) operated by the General Register Office (GRO).

Applications are, in the first instance, subject to a means assessment to determine  if assessable income declared is within the set income limits to qualify for a medical card or a GP visit card.  Medical card and GP visit card applications are considered in accordance with the Medical Card and GP Visit Card National Assessment Guidelines. </p><p>  I am advised by the HSE that, if an application is assessed over the qualifying financial thresholds for both a medical card and GP visit card or assessed as under the qualifying thresholds for a GP visit card only, and the application also includes other medical, social or financial details that do not form part of the means assessment, the application will then be considered on discretionary grounds for a grant of a card under the &lsquo;undue hardship&rsquo;/unduly burdensome&rsquo; arranging of a GP service provisions of the medical card scheme of assessment. The assessment to be made in this instance is whether it is considered that &quot;undue hardship&quot;/&quot;unduly burdensome&quot; will occur or an &lsquo;undue burden&rsquo; be placed on the applicant(s) in providing for his/her medical needs or his/her family dependants&rsquo; medical needs in the absence of medical card or GP visit card eligibility. Deciding Officers appointed from within the staff of the HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service take decisions in relation to the consideration of applications to approve or decline the grant of a medical card/GP visit card on discretionary grounds.</p><p>  The National Assessment Guidelines give guidance to a decision maker as to the relevant factors to have regard to in making an assessment as to whether the &lsquo;undue hardship&rsquo;/&rsquo;undue burden&rsquo; provisions apply to the circumstances presented on an application. In particular, the guidelines state that the &quot;exercise of discretion by the HSE, in favour of the applicant, should be considered where meeting the costs of services covered by a medical card or a GP visit card compromises the applicant&rsquo;s or his/her family&rsquo;s ability to meet the essential costs&quot;.  In conducting this assessment,  medical and social circumstances are taken into account. The decision maker may make appropriate inquires or seek advice from other sources to assist with coming to a decision on &lsquo;undue hardship&rsquo;/&rsquo;undue burden&rsquo;, e.g.  the applicant&rsquo;s Doctor(s), the HSE&rsquo;s Medical Officers, Social Worker, etc.</p><p>  In the case of an application that includes evidence as to an individual(s) medical condition, the HSE&rsquo;s assigned medical officers are consulted for their professional advice and expertise and asked to make a recommendation on an application as to whether &lsquo;undue hardship&rsquo; will occur or an &lsquo;undue burden&rsquo; be placed on the applicant(s) in providing for his/her medical needs or his/her family dependants&rsquo; medical needs, having regard to the medical condition(s) presenting. This assessment necessarily involves the medical officers exercising their professional judgment and expertise to evaluate the cost of providing for a particular medical condition, as described on an application, and making a determination having regard to the assessed income and circumstances on an application whether &lsquo;undue hardship&rsquo;/&rsquo;undue burden&rsquo; will occur in the absence of a medical card/GP visit card eligibility. The HSE is satisfied with the current operating procedures in this regard and satisfied that the panel of Medical Officers have the necessary professional expertise and judgment to effectively discharge this function.</p></reply>

All that is required is that a medical report be submitted to the HSE verifying the person's circumstances as above. On receipt of the report confirmation, a medical card issues within 24 hours to the person concerned for a period of six months.</p><p>  The 1970 Health Act states that persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and family qualify for a medical card, having regard to the overall financial situation of the applicant and his/her dependants. Applications are, in the first instance, subject to a means assessment to determine  if assessable income declared is within the set income limits to qualify for a medical card or a GP visit card.  Medical card and GP visit card applications are considered in accordance with the Medical Card and GP Visit Card National Assessment Guidelines. </p><p>  If an application is assessed over the qualifying financial thresholds for both a medical card and GP visit card or assessed as under the qualifying thresholds for a GP visit card only, and the application also includes other medical, social or financial details that do not form part of the means assessment, the application will then be considered on discretionary grounds for a grant of a card under the provisions relating to &quot;undue hardship&quot;/&quot;unduly burdensome&rsquo; to arrange GP services for the medical card scheme of assessment. The assessment to be made in this instance is whether it is considered that &lsquo;undue hardship&rsquo; will occur or an &lsquo;undue burden&rsquo; be placed on the applicant(s) in providing for his/her medical needs or his/her family dependants&rsquo; medical needs in the absence of medical card or GP visit card eligibility.</p><p>  The National Assessment Guidelines provide guidance to a decision maker as to the relevant factors to have regard to in making an assessment as to whether the &lsquo;undue hardship&rsquo;/&rsquo;undue burden&rsquo; provisions apply to the circumstances presented on an application. In particular, the guidelines state that the &lsquo;exercise of discretion by the HSE, in favour of the applicant, should be considered where meeting the costs of services covered by a Medical Card or a GP Visit Card compromises the applicant&rsquo;s or his/her family&rsquo;s ability to meet the essential costs associated with maintenance of employment; provision of reasonable housing; provision of appropriate nurturing and care for children or dependants; provision of adequate heating, nutrition and clothing, or coping with exceptional personal and financial burdens arising from medical or social circumstances.  In conducting this assessment, the Guidelines state that the following issues be taken account of on an application illness or medical circumstances which results in financial hardship; the cost of providing general medical and surgical services; the cost associated with the provision of medical, nursing and dental treatment; the cost of physiotherapy and speech and language therapy; transport cost to hospitals and clinics; addictions such as drink, drugs and gambling; poor money management; social deprivation &ndash; including poor home management; the cost of medical aids and appliances.</p><p>  The HSE will give equal consideration to each of the above factors that present on an application in deciding whether to approve that application for grant of a medical card on grounds of &lsquo;undue hardship&rsquo;/&rsquo;undue burden&rsquo;.</p><p>  The decision maker may make appropriate inquires or seek advice from other sources to assist with coming to a decision on &lsquo;undue hardship&rsquo;/&rsquo;undue burden&rsquo;; these sources may include the Applicant&rsquo;s Doctor(s); the HSE&rsquo;s Medical Officers; the Public Health Nurse; the Community Welfare Officer; social Worker; therapy Services; Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS).</p></reply>

As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees. This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of this measure. </p><p>  The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation. The necessary administrative arrangements will be made during the course of 2014 when the specifics of the legislation are known.  </p><p>  The introduction of a universal GP service constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. A well functioning health system should provide equal access to health care for its patients on the basis of health needs, rather than ability to pay. The principles of universality and equity of access mean that all residents in Ireland should be entitled to access a GP services that is free at the point of use.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to the provision and development of services for these children, having regard to available resources. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Health Service Executive is currently engaged in a national programme of reconfiguring therapy resources for children with disabilities, including autism, with a view to ensuring there is more equitable access to services for children, according to their individual needs.  Established since 2010, the national re-configuration programme is based on the recommendations of the   <i>Report of the National Reference Group on Multidisciplinary Disability Services for Children aged 5-18.</i></p><p>A key objective of the HSE&rsquo;s <i>Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme</i><i>(0-18 years</i>  ) is to ensure there is a clear pathway for all children to the services they need regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability or developmental delay.  In practical terms this means that health professionals and parents will know exactly where a child should be referred and how to refer them.  A fundamental principle underlying the Programme is that children should receive the health services they need as close to their home and school as possible. Some children may have their needs met by their local primary care services.  An Early Intervention Team and a School Age Team will look after all children with more complex needs in a defined geographic network area, regardless of the nature of their disability.  These Teams will be supported by specialist services in areas requiring a high level of expertise.  The Programme supports the principle of providing access to mainstream education where appropriate while also recognising a continuing role for special schools. </p><p>  The specific issue of waiting times for therapy services is an operational matter for the Health Service Executive.  Accordingly I have arranged for these questions to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputies.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of ED waiting time standards is to measure and monitor the acute hospital&rsquo;s ability to provide timely access to in-patient beds and sustain patient flow through the ED. </p><p>  A 6-hour ED time standard is used in New Zealand.  A 4-hour total ED time standard was introduced in the UK in 2001.  Their current standard is that 95% of patients should be discharged or admitted from EDs within 4 hours and no patient should wait more than 6 hours.  Some Australian states have also adopted a 4-hour standard.  There is no agreed standard in the US or in Canada, although the same measurement of time waiting is also used. </p><p>It is important to acknowledge that the number of patients waiting for admission on trolleys is also a measure of waiting.  Trolleys are unfortunately an international phenomenon, occurring in the US, Australia and the UK.   They remain an undesirable feature of the Irish Health Services, even though the work of Special Delivery Unit that I established has led to a significant improvement.  As of 25 October, the year to date improvement is 12.7%, which translates into 7,146 fewer trolleys reported by the INMO in 2013 when compared to 2012.  When compared to 2011, the percentage improvement is 33.6%, equivalent to 24,744 fewer trolleys.</p></reply>

It includes provision of &euro;2,562 million in respect of the Primary Care Reimbursement Service and &euro;400 million for Primary Care services.  This is an increase of 1.7% and 7.6% respectively on the 2012 figures.  Successful transformation of our health services requires a corresponding transformation of our funding model.  The first stage in transforming our funding model is to clarify funding streams through the creation of directorates and corresponding programme based budgets.  As part of this process, a Primary Care Directorate was established within the HSE.  This directorate will oversee the development and strengthening of primary care.</p><p>  Based on the recommendations of the reviews of financial management systems in the health service, the HSE established a Finance Reform Programme in November 2012.  Central to the establishment of this programme was the recognition that successful implementation of the Government&rsquo;s Future Health reform agenda will require a fundamental change in the way financial management is delivered across the health system in Ireland.  The Finance Reform Programme is overseen by the Finance Reform Board, chaired by the Director General of the Health Service and has representation from the HSE Senior Leadership Team, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  The most recent meeting of the Finance Reform Board was held on 9 September 2013 and endorsed the output from Phase 1 of the Finance Reform Programme.  The process for planning for Phase 2 of the Finance Reform Programme is currently underway which will include finalising the business case for the implementation of a unified financial system for the health services.  It is clear that the new requirements from Future Health cannot be delivered within the current arrangements, and that a new operating model for finance is essential to build the foundations for System Reform.</p></reply>

Applications are, in the first instance, subject to a means assessment to determine  if assessable income declared is within the set income limits to qualify for a medical card or a GP visit card.  Medical card and GP visit card applications are considered in accordance with the Medical Card and GP Visit Card National Assessment Guidelines.</p><p>  If an application is assessed over the qualifying financial thresholds for both a medical card and GP visit card or assessed as under the qualifying thresholds for a GP visit card only, and the application also includes other medical, social or financial details that do not form part of the means assessment, the application will then be considered on discretionary grounds for a grant of a card under the provisions relating to &quot;undue hardship&quot;-&quot;unduly burdensome&quot; to arrange GP services for the medical card scheme of assessment.  The assessment to be made in this instance is whether it is considered that &quot;undue hardship&quot; will occur or an &quot;undue burden&quot; be placed on the applicant(s) in providing for his/her medical needs or his/her family dependants&rsquo; medical needs in the absence of medical card or GP visit card eligibility.</p><p>  The National Assessment Guidelines provide guidance to a decision maker as to the relevant factors to have regard to in making an assessment as to whether the &lsquo;undue hardship&rsquo;/&rsquo;undue burden&rsquo; provisions apply to the circumstances presented on an application. In particular, the guidelines state that the &lsquo;exercise of discretion by the HSE, in favour of the applicant, should be considered where meeting the costs of services covered by a Medical Card or a GP Visit Card compromises the applicant&rsquo;s or his/her family&rsquo;s ability to meet the essential costs associated with:</p><p>-  maintenance of employment</p><p>-  provision of reasonable housing</p><p>-  provision of appropriate nurturing and care for children or dependants</p><p>-  provision of adequate heating, nutrition and clothing, or</p><p>-  coping with exceptional personal and financial burdens arising from medical or social circumstances.</p><p>  In conducting this assessment, the Guidelines state that the following issues be taken account of on an application:</p><p>-  Illness or medical circumstances which results in financial hardship.</p><p>-  The cost of providing general medical and surgical services.</p><p>-  The cost associated with the provision of medical, nursing and dental treatment.</p><p>-  The cost of physiotherapy and speech and language therapy.</p><p>-  Transport cost to hospitals and clinics.</p><p>-  Addictions such as drink, drugs and gambling.</p><p>-  Poor money management.</p><p>-  Social deprivation &ndash; including poor home management.</p><p>-  The cost of medical aids and appliances.</p><p>  The HSE will give equal consideration to each of the above factors that present on an application in deciding whether to approve that application for grant of a medical card on grounds of &lsquo;undue hardship&rsquo;/&rsquo;undue burden&rsquo;.</p><p>  The decision maker may make appropriate inquires or seek advice from other sources to assist with coming to a decision on &lsquo;undue hardship&rsquo;/&rsquo;undue burden&rsquo;; these sources may include:</p><p>-  The Applicant&rsquo;s Doctor(s).</p><p>-  The HSE&rsquo;s Medical Officers.</p><p>-  The Public Health Nurse.</p><p>-  The Community Welfare Officer.</p><p>-  Social Worker.</p><p>-  Therapy Services.</p><p>-  Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS).</p><p>  I trust the above clarifies the circumstances, in addition to income, taken into account in deciding whether to approve medical card eligibility on discretionary grounds.</p></reply>

In this context, in July of this year I established a Working Group, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, President of DCU, to carry out a Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career Structure.  The Working Group will examine and make high-level recommendations relating to training and career pathways for doctors with a view to improving graduate retention in the public health system, planning for future service needs and realising maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training.</p><p>  In the course of its work, the Group will examine a range of issues including the pathway for training at every level from Intern to Specialist, and the potential for reducing the length of specialist training. It will also consider mentoring and career planning supports for medical graduates, as well as measures to improve the quality of the training experience. </p><p>  In examining these issues, the Working Group will take account of:</p><p>-  the need to ensure quality, safe, patient-centred health care;</p><p>-  developments in the clinical programmes and recent reports and recommendations relevant to patient safety;</p><p>-  opportunities arising from the Health Reform Programme (for example, the development of hospital groups and the expansion of primary care services);</p><p>-  the achievement of value for money for the State's investment in medical education and training;</p><p>- international good practice in regard to medical training and developments, including EU requirements.</p><p>  I have requested an initial report from the Working Group by the end of November 2013 and a final report by the end of June 2014.</p></reply>

This group includes children who may require short to medium care, children who have a disability and require long-term care and also sick children for whom there is no reasonable hope of a cure and who are expected to die.  "Palliative Care for Children with Life-limiting Conditions in Ireland - a National Policy" (2010), provides the foundation and sets out clear direction for the development of an integrated palliative care service for children and their families, across all care settings.</p><p>  Following the publication of the policy document, the National Development Committee for Children's Palliative Care (NDC) was established by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The Committee is chaired by the HSE and has overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the national policy.  The Committee's membership includes statutory, voluntary, professional and parent representatives.  The Irish Hospice Foundation (IHF), LauraLynn's Children's Hospice and the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Foundation are members.</p><p>  In 2012, HSE regions spent approximately &euro;8.58 million on home nursing for children with life-limiting conditions.  However, it is widely acknowledged that because of how the financial system is set up, this figure did not capture all relevant expenditure and that the total spend was significantly higher.  It is also acknowledged that children with life-limiting conditions, and particularly children with palliative care needs are prioritised within HSE regions.  Every effort is made to care for these children to the maximum extent possible, including home care for the children and their families.</p><p>  The HSE is committed to ensuring that proper governance arrangements are in place, that the care being provided is clinically sound and that those providing the care to this cohort of children are adequately trained.  To this end, a working group has been established in HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster, to restructure the financial recording and reporting system, so that expenditure on home care for these children is properly accounted for.  It is intended that this approach will be replicated across all four regions.  In addition to this, the NDC has commenced working on the development of a model for the provision of Hospice at Home care.  This is being carried out in partnership with current voluntary providers such as the IHF, Laura Lynn's Children's Hospice and the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Foundation. </p><p>  One of the national policy recommendations was the employment of eight Children's Outreach Nurses, whose responsibilities include the facilitation of a co-ordinated support structure for children with life-limiting conditions and their families.  The Nurses identify the needs of each child and ensure that families are appropriately linked in to local services.  All eight nurses are now in place and are located in Drogheda, Limerick, Waterford, Temple Street and Crumlin in Dublin and in Mullingar, Cork and Galway.</p><p>  The first Consultant Paediatrician with Special Interest in Paediatric Palliative Medicine has also been appointed to Crumlin Hospital.  This Consultant is available to provide an advisory service to other paediatric and maternity hospitals.</p><p>  The support structure for these children and their families includes health care staff across a range of disciplines.  Some of these staff require additional training on working with children with life-limiting conditions.  In order to address this, a national programme of continuing professional education on caring for children with life-limiting conditions has been established in partnership with the HSE, IHF and Crumlin Children's Hospital.  I have arranged for the specific issues raised in the Deputy's question to be referred to the HSE for investigation and a direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs.  A new agreement has also been reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry.  From 1 November 2012, the HSE will only reimburse generic products which are priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to the provision and development of services for these children, having regard to available resources.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Health Service Executive is currently engaged in a national programme of reconfiguring therapy resources for children with disabilities, including autism, with a view to ensuring there is more equitable access to services for children, according to their individual needs.  Established since 2010, the national re-configuration programme is based on the recommendations of the   <i>Report of the National Reference Group on Multidisciplinary Disability Services for Children aged 5-18.</i></p><p>  A key objective of the HSE&rsquo;s <i>Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme</i><i>(0-18 years</i>  ) is to ensure there is a clear pathway for all children to the services they need regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability or developmental delay.  In practical terms this means that health professionals and parents will know exactly where a child should be referred and how to refer them.  A fundamental principle underlying the Programme is that children should receive the health services they need as close to their home and school as possible.  Some children may have their needs met by their local primary care services.</p><p>  An Early Intervention Team and a School Age Team will look after all children with more complex needs in a defined geographic network area, regardless of the nature of their disability.  These Teams will be supported by specialist services in areas requiring a high level of expertise.  The Programme supports the principle of providing access to mainstream education where appropriate while also recognising a continuing role for special schools.  The specific issue of occupational therapy reviews and therapy sessions is an operational matter for the Health Service Executive.  Accordingly I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

These appointments are in addition to the existing Chairs of the West/North West Hospital Group, the MidWest Hospital Group and the Children's Hospital Group, Prof. Niall O'Higgins, Mr. Noel Daly and Dr. Jim Browne. CEOs and Boards are already in place for these three hospital groups. </p><p>  The process of recruiting CEOs for the Dublin East, Dublin Midlands, Dublin North East and South-South West Hospital Groups will now commence, in consultation with the newly appointed Chairpersons, through the Public Appointments Service.  My Department will also enter into discussion with the Chairs with a view to appointing the other Board members as soon as possible. </p><p>  A Strategic Advisory Group is now being established, chaired by Mr. Leo Kearns, which will oversee the establishment of Hospital Groups and the subsequent reorganisation of acute hospital services. Hospital Groups will be required, within one year, to develop a strategic plan which will outline their plans for future services within the group area.  These strategic plans will determine the way services are provided within each group, and their successful implementation will be required before Groups can advance to become Hospital Trusts when the necessary legislation is put in place.</p></reply>

Key developments in this regard are set out as follows.</p><p>  My Department has been working with the HSE on a MFTP shadow funding exercise which will commence in the coming days.  This exercise will take place in a selection of hospitals from across the hospital groups and will involve hospitals continuing to receive their existing base budget under a vote cashing system.  However, a process will be put in place to: (i) compare, on a systematic basis, actual hospital activity against baseline activity targets; and (ii) inform hospitals of what the financial implications of any variance from the targets would be in a &ldquo;live&rdquo; system without impacting on budgets.</p><p>  The HSE is also working closely with the Department to begin full phased implementation of MFTP in January.  Money will effectively be following the patient at this point because hospitals will be funded on the basis of activity completed and the achievement of predetermined activity targets.  Budgetary discipline will be delivered under the new system through the use of fixed budgets for MFTP activity.  Appropriate governance arrangements to oversee implementation are being progressed and a communications campaign with the hospitals concerned will be rolled out between now and the end of the year.</p><p>  Work to establish a National Pricing Office (NPO) is also underway.  The NPO will be formed through the merging of the HSE Casemix Unit and the ESRI Health Research and Information Division.  The Office will initially be established on an administrative basis in January 2014, prior to becoming a statutory body.  The key functions of the Office will be to (i) set the national Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) prices on which the MFTP system will be based; and (ii) manage the HIPE data set.</p><p>  These recent developments have built on the progress made earlier in the year.  This included completion of a consultation process which showed that stakeholders were generally welcoming of the move to MFTP.  An independent international expert engaged by the HSE also completed a &ldquo;state of readiness&rdquo; review for roll-out of MFTP.  The key message from this readiness assessment was that the Irish health system is in a strong position to begin phased implementation of MFTP in hospitals in line with the target date of 2014.

There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with a specific illness or disability.</p><p>  However, under the legislation, there is provision for discretion by the HSE to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines. The HSE takes a person's social and medical issues into account in determining whether or not &quot;undue hardship&quot; exists for a person in providing a health service for themselves or his or her dependents.</p><p>  The HSE has an effective system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill in palliative care, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford. They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients in palliative care, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months.</p><p>  For persons with a terminal illness in palliative care, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible.</p><p>  The Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees within its term of office, as set out in the Programme for Government and the Future Health strategy framework.  As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees. This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of this measure.</p><p>  The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation. The necessary administrative arrangements will be made during the course of 2014, when the specifics of the legislation are known.</p><p>  The introduction of a universal GP service constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. A well functioning health system should provide equal access to health care for its patients on the basis of health needs, rather than ability to pay. The principles of universality and equity of access mean that all residents in Ireland should be entitled to access a GP services that is free at the point of use.</p></reply>

All HSE dental clinics prioritise emergency care for children up to 16 years of age, treatment for special needs patients and screening of children aged from 11 to 13 years, including referral for orthodontic services where necessary. After screening, follow-up treatment is provided where necessary. Other services, including screening of children 6 to 8 years, are provided but may be deferred in clinics where there is pressure on resources. The HSE Public Dental Service has recently been re-structured. It is intended that the new arrangements will facilitate standardisation of services available nationally.</p><p>  The HSE provides orthodontic treatment to those who have been assessed and referred for treatment before their 16th birthday. An individual's access to orthodontic treatment is determined against a set of clinical guidelines called the Modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need, i.e. Grade 5 or Grade 4 are provided with treatment. At the time of assessment those with urgent clinical need are prioritised. It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of those on the waiting list for treatment need to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  The most recent information on waiting times relates to the third quarter of 2013:<table><tr><th>Waiting time from assessment to commencement of treatment (Grade 4)</th><th>1 - 6 months</th><th>7 - 12 months </th><th>13 - 24 months</th><th>2 - 3 years</th><th>Over 4 years</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster </td><td>243</td><td>390</td><td>685</td><td>375</td><td>174</td><td>1,867</td></tr><tr><td>HSE West </td><td>711</td><td>259</td><td>1,183</td><td>343</td><td>23</td><td>2,519</td></tr><tr><td>HSE South </td><td>91</td><td>133</td><td>152</td><td>933</td><td>237</td><td>1,546</td></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin North East</td><td>76</td><td>163</td><td>408</td><td>766</td><td>436</td><td>1,849</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>1,121</td><td>945</td><td>2,428</td><td>2,417</td><td>870</td><td>7,781</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>Waiting time from assessment to commencement of treatment (Grade 5)</th><th>1 - 6 months</th><th>7 - 12 months </th><th>13 - 24 months</th><th>2 - 3 years</th><th>Over 4 years</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster </td><td>452</td><td>310</td><td>465</td><td>271</td><td>98</td><td>1,596</td></tr><tr><td>HSE West </td><td>544</td><td>315</td><td>879</td><td>232</td><td>26</td><td>1,996</td></tr><tr><td>HSE South </td><td>536</td><td>333</td><td>392</td><td>307</td><td></td><td>1,568</td></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin North East</td><td>129</td><td>217</td><td>486</td><td>452</td><td>37</td><td>1,321</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>1,661</td><td>1,175</td><td>2,222</td><td>1,262</td><td>161</td><td>6,481</td></tr></table>  The HSE has commissioned an independent review of orthodontic services.  The outcome of this review, which is near completion, will give guidance as to what changes will be desirable to provide the best possible model of care delivery, given the current resources available and future demand for services.</p><p>   Waiting list initiatives introduced in 2011 have meant that dental services dependent on acute service capacity have been assessed in accordance with waiting times and not just on numbers waiting. Intravenous (IV) sedation clinics have been put in place in 4 hospitals using HSE dental staff who have undertaken Diplomas in IV Sedation and Relative Analgesia. This will be extended further in 2014. It is intended that more adults with special needs will be treated using IV sedation rather than general anaesthetic, thus relieving pressure on hospital services and waiting lists.</p></reply>

This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients.</p><p>  Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines. Generic substitution will be introduced incrementally with the IMB prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State. The Board is in the process of reviewing an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines. They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.</p><p>The first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, was published by the IMB on the 7th August. The second and third lists containing groups of esomeprazole and rosuvastatin products were published on the 20th and 24th September, respectively. The fourth and fifth lists containing groups of<b></b>omeprazole and pravastatin products have also been published (on the 11th and 22nd October, respectively).</p><p>  Once the IMB has assessed the initial 20 priority products, then a further list of priority products will be identified and assessed by the IMB and the process will continue until all medicinal products on the reimbursable list have been assessed.</p><p>  Once a List of Interchangeable Medicines is published by the IMB a two stage price reduction process gets underway. First, under the terms of the 2012 APMI Agreement, the price of all relevant products fall by 20%, e.g. atorvastatin prices were reduced from 1st September and esomeprazole and rosuvastatin prices were reduced from 1st October. Secondly, the legislation also provides that the HSE may set a reference price for each group of interchangeable products published on the List of Interchangeable Products with a view to introducing further significant price cuts.</p><p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices. The first reference price (for atorvastatin products) was introduced on the 1st of November.</p><p>  Reference prices are being introduced on a phased basis. The HSE is currently in the process of setting reference prices for esomeprazole products which, it is anticipated, will apply from 1st December 2013.</p><p>  Under the legislation, a pharmacist shall offer the patient the opportunity to agree to the pharmacist substituting the prescribed product for a substitute product (from within a group of interchangeable products) which is in stock and is the lowest cost to the patient or the State. If the product offered is at or below the reference price then the legislation does not impose any unavoidable costs on the patient. However, if the patient wishes to have the more expensive product, then he/she will be liable for the difference between the reference price and the price of the product.</p><p>  The IMB will only add a medicine to the List of Interchangeable Medicines if it meets all the qualifying criteria and can be safely substituted for each of the medicines which fall within a group of interchangeable medicines.</p><p>  Occasionally circumstances may arise where due to an individual patient issue or characteristic that it may not be advisable to switch between different brands of a medicine even if the medicine is included in a group of interchangeable medicines. When this arises a prescriber will be able to indicate on a prescription that substitution should not take place. A pharmacist will then dispense the medicine indicated on the prescription.</p></reply>

However, the HSE has discretion to grant a medical card in certain circumstances. Medical card applicants who are unsuccessful following the means assessment, but who indicate that they suffer from a medical condition, are then referred to the Medical Officer for consideration on a medical discretionary basis.</p><p>  The processing of medical cards at a national level, rather than at a local level as before mid-2011, ensures that all people are assessed in a similar and fair manner when applying for a medical card.  The consideration of discretion is now standardised and operates in an equitable manner. The medical card scheme is now underpinned with a stronger foundation which enables better governance, more transparency and efficient modern processes. Under these processes, nobody who is entitled to a medical card will lose it or be refused one.</p><p>   I would like to point out that there has been no change in the policy of awarding discretionary medical cards.</p><p>  The information sought by the Deputy concerning medical card figures granted on a discretionary basis is not readily available.  However, I have asked the Health Service Executive to supply this information to me and I will forward it to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This increase in funding along with the additional investment in mental health has led to work being progressed on almost every recommendation in <i>Reach Out</i>   including the following actions:</p><p>  -  Supporting over 40 individual organisations and programmes both internal and external to the HSE.  This increase in funding has focused on resourcing front line services for persons who are in emotional distress, who have engaged in self harm or who have been bereaved through suicide.  Many of these services are being delivered by the Non-Governmental Organisation sector with direct funding from the NOSP, including Pieta House, Samaritans, Console etc.</p><p>  -  Working to build the capacity of frontline services providers and communities to respond to suicide through the delivery of a number of suicide prevention training programmes; to date over 42,000 participants have completed the ASSIT and safeTALK programmes.  In addition, the NOSP has invested significantly in the development of Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) services across community mental health teams.</p><p>  -  The NOSP resourced the Irish College of General Practitioners to implement a training programme on suicide prevention for GPs and general practice staff.  International evidence highlights GP training in depression and the management of suicidal behaviour as critical to reducing suicide rates.</p><p>  -  The development of the National Clinical Care Programme for Self Harm in Emergency Departments and the SCAN (Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse) service.</p><p>  -  The delivery of two effective social marketing campaigns on mental health that have changed public attitudes and behaviours related to help seeking and mental health.  The NOSP is also working to develop a new national communication strategy for suicide prevention.</p><p>  -  The NOSP is currently working with the Irish Association of Suicidology and other partners to develop national standards for service providers that will improve the quality and safety of funded services.</p><p>-  The NOSP in partnership with the Department of Education and Skills developed the <i>Well-Being in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention. </i>  These guidelines have been distributed to schools and health services on a nationwide basis.</p><p>  -  The HSE is implementing the Counselling in Primary Care programme.  This national service was launched in 2013 and is delivering counselling to medical card holders at a primary care level.</p><p>The NOSP has been reviewing its current activities to make the most of our available resources, including looking at best practice internationally to inform evidence-based policy decisions.  The review will result in a new Framework which will build on work already undertaken under <i>Reach Out.</i>    Its aim will be to support population health approaches and interventions that will assist in reducing the loss of life through suicide.  This renewed focus will provide for improved coordination and integration of services to ensure that pathways of care for persons at risk of suicide or in suicidal crisis can be accessible, acceptable and available.  </p></reply>

The HSE COPD Clinical Care Programme published a Model of Care for Pulmonary Rehabilitation services in 2010. Health policy in Ireland is committed to service reform that is moving service provision away from the current hospital centric model of care towards a new model of integrated care which treats people at the lowest level of complexity and is as close to home as possible. Depending on their disease trajectory most patients are suitable to avail of community services at some stage in their illness, and therefore pulmonary rehabilitation is being provided by community as well as acute services. In order to improve access to pulmonary rehabilitation programmes the HSE has in recent years included targets in its service plans for both settings.</p><p>  In 2012 the annual target was for 25 % of centres, regardless of the setting (acute hospitals and community areas combined), to have access to pulmonary rehabilitation. It was reported in June of that year that 56% of centres provided a service.</p><p>  In 2013 the target was changed from combined to individual services; 25 acute hospitals and 20 local health areas were required to provide access. Recent reports indicate that currently 25 acute hospitals and 15 local health areas are providing access.</p><p>  For 2014 an increased target of 28 hospitals and 25 local health areas has been proposed.</p></reply>

Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings will no longer qualify for tax relief. The tax relief at source provided to policy holders has been a significant subsidy to the actual cost of premiums charged by health insurers. I am pleased that the Minister for Finance did not remove tax relief in its entirety and has still allowed 20% tax relief on polices up to &euro;1000 gross for adults and &euro;500 for children. </p><p>  It is also important to note that the measure is projected to save the Exchequer &euro;94m in 2014 and &euro;127m in a full year. Pricing of insurance premiums is a matter for insurers. In terms of potential increases in premia that might arise from this measure, it is up to each insurer to contain its own costs and to compete actively on the basis of price. </p><p>  With regard to health insurance costs generally, I have consistently emphasised the vital need to address the rising cost of private health insurance and the necessity for all private health insurers to address their cost base aggressively.  Last year, I established the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance to generate ideas to address health insurance costs. In June of this year, I  appointed an independent Chairperson, Mr. Pat McLoughlin,  who will work with my Department and the insurers on a review process to give effect to real cost reductions in the private health insurance market. Work on this review process is progressing well and I expect to receive an initial report from the Chair very shortly.  </p><p>  I will continue to focus strongly on addressing costs in the private health insurance market, to keep insurance as affordable as possible for people who wish to avail of private health insurance. The Government's clear objective is for the health insurance market to remain as competitive and affordable as possible, as we move towards a new system of Universal Health Insurance.</p></reply>

On 30th October, the HSE announced a communications campaign designed to raise awareness of the rules governing eligibility for medical cards.  This includes providing extra resources to the national Call Centre for public enquiries, a public information campaign through media advertisements, the development of a key new Information Leaflet, improved support on the HSE website, wide ranging training for front line staff and more. The roll out of this campaign is scheduled over the next period, with some elements already actioned already.</p><p>  As a result, communications on the issue of medical cards will be enhanced to ensure the public has all the information it needs. Comprehensive information, particularly on expenses taken into account for medical cards eligibility, will be available. </p><p>  In addition, the National Assessment Guidelines for the medical card scheme are available on the HSE website.</p><p>  The HSE has also established a dedicated contact service for members of the Oireachtas specifically for queries relating to medical cards and GP visit cards, which the Deputy may wish to use for an earlier response to individual queries.

In 2012, the HSE completed a detailed analysis of the numbers and distribution of public health nurses, registered general nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists.  The analysis revealed considerable variation across the HSE&rsquo;s 17 Integrated Service Areas in ratios of health care professionals to population, and to population numbers in areas of high deprivation.  I issued approval to the HSE on the 27th March 2013 to commence recruitment to Primary Care Teams with immediate effect in respect of an additional 251 Primary Care posts.  The allocation and distribution of these posts is based on bringing each Integrated Service Area, where staffing is below the national average, towards the national average.  </p><p>  With respect to the Deputy's specific question regarding Cork City, I have requested that the HSE respond directly.

Under Budget 2013, the income thresholds for an over-70s medical card were adjusted  to &euro;600 gross income per week for a single person, and &euro;1,200 gross income per week for a couple.  Those persons over 70 with a weekly income of &euro;600-&euro;700 for a single person and &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,400 for a couple qualified for GP visit card.  The eligibility criteria relating to the standard medical card means test assessment was amended by removing home improvement loan payments and excluding the first &euro;50 per week from travel to work expenses, such as depreciation, but leaving the mileage element unaffected.</p><p>  With regard to cards awarded on a discretionary basis, at the request of Minister Reilly, the HSE set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards, where income guidelines have been exceeded but difficult personal circumstances, such as an illness, exist.  This panel was established as part of the centralisation of the medical processing which was completed in July 2011.  In previous years, there was a decentralised process which meant there could be inequities throughout the country and discretionary medical cards may have been awarded in some parts of the country and not in others due to the lack of a centralised standardised approach.  Since this centralised approach, there has been no change to the assessment process for discretionary medical cards and the scheme continues to operate in such a way that those who suffer genuine financial hardship as a result of a medical condition receive the benefit of a medical card.  There is a link on the Department&rsquo;s website to the HSE website (www.hse.ie ) where all information on the medical card scheme is available.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-05a.3073.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013110500106#WREEE02900"><p>In Budget 2014, the Minister for Finance announced a cap on tax relief on premia for private health insurance, whereby tax relief for medical insurance premiums will be restricted to the first &euro;1,000 per adult and the first &euro;500 per child insured.  Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings will no longer qualify for tax relief.  It is also important to note that the measure is projected to save the Exchequer &euro;94m in 2014 and &euro;127m in a full year.  Pricing of insurance premiums is a matter for insurers. In terms of potential increases in premia that might arise from this measure, it is up to each insurer to contain its own costs and to compete actively on the basis of price.</p><p>  With regard to health insurance costs generally, I have consistently emphasised the vital need to address the rising cost of private health insurance and the necessity for all private health insurers to address their cost base aggressively.  Last year, I established the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance to generate ideas to address health insurance costs.  In June of this year, I  appointed an independent Chairperson, Mr. Pat McLoughlin,  who will work with my Department and the insurers on a review process to give effect to real cost reductions in the private health insurance market. Work on this review process is progressing well and I expect to receive an initial report from the Chair very shortly.</p><p>  Each year, at my request, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) prepares the <i>Report of The Health Insurance Authority to the Minister for Health, in accordance with Section 7E (1)(b) of the Health Insurance Acts, 1994 &ndash; 2012. </i>  The Authority submitted its most recent report to me in October 2013.  This Report sets out the HIA&rsquo;s evaluation and analysis of information returns supplied by insurers, their analysis of market issues and, arising from their expert analysis, the Authority's recommendations for Risk Equalisation Credits and associated Stamp Duty to apply for the following year.  I am currently considering the recommendations from the HIA in respect of the rates of risk equalisation credits and stamp duty to apply from 1 March 2014.  In the interim, it is important to note that this stamp duty, or health levy as referred to by the Deputy, collected from health insurers is in respect of the number of lives insured by them and is not placed on individual policy holders.  The money collected is used to fund tax credits for older people with private health insurance who, if under a risk rated model of insurance, would be charged a higher premium for health insurance than younger people, given their higher risk profile.  Funding the tax credit for older people ensures that everybody is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health.</p><p>  It is a matter for the insurance companies as to the extent, if any, they pass the stamp duty on to their customers.  The Government remains committed to keeping down the cost of health insurance, so that it is affordable for as many people as possible, as part of measures to ensure the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to Universal Health Insurance.</p></reply>

These Reports set out the HIA&rsquo;s evaluation and analysis of information returns supplied by insurers, their analysis of market issues and, arising from their expert analysis, the Authority's recommendations for Risk Equalisation Credits and associated Stamp Duty to apply for the following year.</p><p>  In setting the rates for Risk Equalisation Credits, following consultation with the Minister for Finance, I must have regard to the Principal Objective of the Health Insurance Act (as amended), which is to ensure that access to health insurance cover is available to consumers with no differentiation between them, in particular as regards the cost of health services, based on health risk status, age or sex. I must also have regard to the aims of:</p><p>-  avoiding overcompensation of registered undertakings or former undertakings,</p><p>-  maintaining the sustainability of the private health insurance market,</p><p>-  having fair and open competition in the market and</p><p>-  avoiding the Risk Equalisation Fund having a surplus or deficit from year to year.</p><p>In addition to recommendations for Risk Equalisation Credits and associated Stamp Duty, the HIA Report also provides an evaluation and analysis of commercial insurers' returns for the twelve month period of the previous July to June and such other matters that the Authority considers ought to be brought to my attention.</p><p>  The 2012 Report, to which the Deputy refers, recommended the approach of setting lower stamp duties and credits for non-advanced cover products, compared with advanced cover products, in order to help maintain the attractiveness of these products to younger customers entering the health insurance market and thereby supporting the sustainability of the market.  I accepted this recommendation and a lower rate of stamp duty and credits for non-advanced products was introduced with effect from 31 March 2013.  My Department will continue to oversee the maintenance of a competitive and sustainable private health insurance market and to monitor developments on an ongoing basis, including the consideration of measures necessary to keep health insurance affordable for younger members, to ensure that the market is regulated appropriately in the transition to a market-based Universal Health Insurance system.</p><p>  The HIA Reports are very detailed and include substantial market sensitive data.  The 2012 Report was published in redacted form on the Department&rsquo;s website earlier this year.  My Department, in conjunction with the HIA, will publish a redacted version of the 2013 Report in due course.</p></reply>

My Department is not aware of the World Health Organisation's position on the matter.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the Government&rsquo;s reluctance to loosen the controls on cannabis generally, Department officials have engaged with experts on how authorised cannabis-based medicinal products for patients may be legally prescribed by medical practitioners and used by patients.

Medical card holders are required to pay prescription charges.  Prescription charges are not payable in respect of items supplied under the Long Term Illness Scheme.</p><p>  In the case of persons who had both the medical card and LTI, the HSE policy was that they should use their medical card to access medicines.  The main reason for this was that the supply of medicines under the LTI cost the HSE considerably more than under the GMS Scheme.  A retail mark-up of 20% was payable to pharmacists for items supplied under the LTI Scheme.  However, following a review of the rates of fees payable to health professionals (under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, 2009) my colleague, Minister Reilly, announced (on the 2nd of July) the elimination of the retail mark-up.  There is no retail mark-up for items supplied under the GMS Scheme.</p><p>  In light of the elimination of the retail mark-up, the HSE was asked by my Department to review its policy.  Following this review, the HSE recently instructed all Local Health Offices that they should no longer refuse to process a Long Term Illness Book application where the patient holds a medical card. A circular advising of this change in policy is to issue to pharmacists today.</p></reply>

The KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin Area Report was informed by an international analysis of maternity and gynaecology service configurations and best practice models of care.  The report noted that Dublin&rsquo;s model of stand-alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally.  It recommended that the Dublin maternity hospitals should be located alongside adult acute services and that one of the three new Dublin maternity facilities should be built on the site of the new children&rsquo;s hospital (tri-location of paediatric, maternity and adult services).  In this context the proposal was that the National Maternity Hospital was to be relocated to St Vincent's, the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital to Tallaght and the Rotunda to the Mater.  In May this year, I announced the relocation of the National Maternity Hospital to the St Vincent&rsquo;s campus.</p><p>  Recognising the need to plan for the provision of tri-located maternity, paediatric and adult services, and in view of the Government decision to locate the new children&rsquo;s hospital on the St James&rsquo;s campus, it will be necessary to review the other maternity-adult co-location plans.  This review will take place in the context of the development of a National Maternity Stategy.  I confirmed on 10 October last that my Department will lead the development of this Strategy in collaboration with the HSE and its National Clinical Programme in Obstetrics and Gynaecology.  The Strategy will provide the blueprint for the safe, effective delivery of maternity services nationally.  The development of the Strategy will build on the work already undertaken as part of the KPMG Independent Review, and on the work underway by the Clinical Programme.</p></reply>

The development and implementation of national asthma guidelines based on international best practice for acute and ongoing asthma management and in relation to this, national asthma education initiatives for patients and health care professionals;</p><p>  2. The organisation and better integration of national asthma services at primary and secondary care levels through development of a national model of care; and </p><p>  3. A national project of auditing acute asthma deaths.</p><p>  Work in relation to Asthma Guidelines has included:</p><p>-  Acute adult asthma guidelines and associated care pathways, treatment protocols and care bundles have been developed for use in all care settings (primary and secondary care levels), in conjunction with other relevant programmes and the Irish College of General Practice (ICGP).  These include:</p><p>-  An in-hospital practical asthma education programme for nurses to underpin and support the implementation of the acute adult guidelines; and</p><p>-  General management asthma guidelines for use in all healthcare settings especially in primary care.</p><p>  The Acute Adult Emergency Guidelines are available through the HSE website.  This user friendly resource will facilitate all healthcare staff in optimising the management of adult patients attending services with an acute asthmatic episode. </p><p>-  Guidelines for acute paediatric asthma have also been completed and should be available soon on the HSE website.  An associated educational programme is being developed at present.</p><p>The National Asthma Programme is developing a National Model of Care (MOC) for Asthma with an implementation plan which will detail how physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals will work with engaged patients to make the clinical decisions most appropriate to their circumstances; and to collaborate with specialist colleagues in providing a safe, seamless patient experience within the health system in Ireland.  This is a key deliverable of the National Asthma Programme for 2013.  As 85 per cent of asthma is managed in primary care without the need for hospital specialist services, the Programme is aiming to provide at primary care level a yearly programme of assessment for asthma called Chronic Disease Watch (CDW) &ndash; Asthma, also known as <i>Asthma Check.</i><i>Asthma Check,</i>   which has been submitted to the ICGP for review, outlines the step-by-step process for the implementation of guideline based asthma management in primary care to deliver optimal outcomes for patients.</p><p>  The Model of Care will also focus on:</p><p>-  Improving access to hospital based specialist asthma services from primary and secondary care services, through Scheduled / Rapid access asthma services (adult/paediatric), and access to specialist asthma therapies.</p><p>-  Improving links through Clinical / Asthma Nurse Specialists within the community services.</p><p>-  Developing and implementing a standard referral pathway to asthma services.</p><p>-  Developing structured assessment and review protocols throughout the system.</p><p>-  Establishing uniform discharge protocols.</p><p>-  Facilitating access to accurate asthma diagnostics.</p><p>-  Examining solutions to develop and subsequently implement an Asthma database / register linked into all care levels (GP, Community Pharmacist and Hospital).  </p><p>  The draft model of care has been circulated for stakeholder consultation.  The National Asthma Programme is aiming to have the Model of Care published by the end of this year. </p><p>  Implementation of the National Clinical Programme for Asthma, which was included in the HSE's 2013 Operational Plan is ongoing and will continue in 2014.</p></reply>

Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines. The IMB will review an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines. They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. </p><p>  The first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, was published by the IMB on the 7th August. The second and third lists containing groups of esomeprazole and rosuvastatin products were published on the 20th and 24th September, respectively. The fourth and fifth lists containing groups of omeprazole and pravastatin products have also been published (on the 11th and 22nd October, respectively).

The Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act 2012 provides the powers to the RSA to undertake this function.    </p><p>  The RSA is currently in the process of rolling out major reforms in the testing system, which will deliver an enhanced service for the customer. Apart from safer roads for all road users, the reforms  are designed to level the competitive playing field for commercial vehicle operators by reducing non-compliance with testing and roadworthiness requirements. The new system will deliver several administrative benefits for operators, including online booking systems, reducing vehicle paperwork to be brought to the test and centralised issuing of the certificate of roadworthiness.</p><p>  No increase in testing frequency has taken place as a result of the reforms. Under EU law, commercial vehicle owners are obliged to test their vehicles annually and it is an offence to use commercial vehicles on public roads without a certificate of roadworthiness (CRW). </p><p>  From 7 October last, a new annual fee, which includes a road safety levy, was introduced. The commercial vehicle reform process has been worked on since 2007 and there has not been any increase since then. The RSA consulted industry on the reforms and the planned road safety levy in November 2011 and the actual levy is lower than that proposed in the public consultation.  There have been a number of awareness raising measures of the reforms over the summer months and the new fees were advertised in national newspapers on 3 October 2013 and are available in full on the RSA website.</p><p>  The levy is also funding enhanced supervision, enforcement and compliance measures being introduced at the roadside and at operator premises. A risk rating system is also being introduced so that roadside enforcement activity is targeted at higher risk operators ensuring that compliant operators are less likely to experience disruption to their daily business.</p></reply>

Air capacity from the US for the summer peak was up more than 20% this year, with 270,000 extra seats on new and existing routes - and further growth is in prospect for next year. But The Gathering was never just about visitor numbers and revenues.  It is also about community pride and strengthening links with the diaspora.  </p><p>   The Gathering helped to strengthen existing links with Irish communities abroad and create new connections.  Tourism Ireland will continue to work with the diaspora networks and will include this global family as part of its future promotional work overseas.  The networks and databases created through The Gathering will also remain as a valuable asset to Irish tourism.</p><p>   A number of Gathering related events and festivals have already been identified as having potential to run again next year or in future years. Similarly, the success of the Emerald Isle Classic college football game, which was a key part of the marketing campaign for the Gathering, is being built on with the game between Penn State &ndash; with the largest alumni association in the US - and the University of Central Florida in Croke Park.  </p><p>  The Gathering also made a vital contribution to the local community. The Gathering network also provided extensive training to more than 2,500 people and these community engagement skills will endure and be available to support other local events.</p><p>  Recently Minister Ring visited the United States to attend the Milwaukee Irish Festival which draws over 500,000 people and Tourism Ireland will do more in this space. Last month, I visited California to promote the new routes between Dublin and San Francisco that will start next April.</p><p>   It should be noted, however, that our research shows that a majority of US visitors to Ireland are not of Irish heritage and the population of the US is becoming more Latino and Asian so we need to ensure that we promote Ireland as a destination to all Americans.</p></reply>

The remaining &euro;14.9 billion available to all Member States is an increase of over 50% on the current financial Transport European Networks allocation for transport over the period 2007-2013. It will not be trebled.    </p><p>  Funding under the CEF will be available largely for projects on the defined Core Network of the Trans-European Network for Transport (TEN-T). There are strict criteria for inclusion in this. In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the Core Network consists of the road rail axis of Cork-Dublin-Belfast (with link to Shannon Foynes Port), the ports of Dublin, Cork and Shannon-Foynes, and Dublin and Cork Airports.</p><p>   A call for proposals is expected in 2014 and my Department and relevant State companies are in the process of identifying potential projects that may be suitable for CEF funding. However, I should point out that the funding available for eligible works projects under the CEF will require matching funds from national sources.  The EU co-funding to be provided under CEF will vary depending on the nature of the works from up to 10% in some cases to up to 50% for some categories of works. Where matching funding will be required from the Exchequer, the availability of such funding is very constrained in the present economic circumstances and this will obviously have a major bearing on the ability to put forward projects under the CEF.  </p></reply>

Also with effect from 19 January, the new plastic card form of driving licence was introduced in all EU Member States. Between 19 January and 25 October, local authorities continued to provide customer services relating to driving licences on behalf of the RSA.</p><p>  On 29 October last, the RSA assumed full responsibility for the service.  The RSA designed the new centralised driver licensing system around a central unit within the Authority and three outsourced contracts. The contracts include one for a front office service, which engages with the public; a second contract for a back office service, to process applications; and a third contract for the production of the plastic card licence. These contracts were awarded by the RSA following competitive procurement processes, in which neither my Department or I had any role. There is no suggestion of taking this business away from post offices as An Post never had any involvement in direct customer services for driving licences. They did tender for the service but were unsuccessful.</p><p>  The RSA awarded the contract for front office services to SGS (Ireland) Ltd., who will operate 34 full-time and 2 part-time offices.  The new network of offices will be open Monday through Saturday and have longer opening hours than the previous local authority operations to facilitate people who may not be able to apply for their licence during normal working hours. Furthermore, people will be able use any of the offices to apply/renew their licence rather than as previously, just the centre in their own county. The target is to process driver licence applications within 8 days. </p><p>  It is important to also state that the requirement to attend in person only occurs once, when the person first receives their new plastic drivers licence when the person's image is captured through the SAFE 2 system and they have their identity verified. This is an important measure to prevent fraud. After attending once in person, people can renew their licence through the post and are not required to attend in person again.</p><p><font color="#FF0000"> </font></p></reply>

The derogation expired on 31st October 2013.</p><p>  This maximum height limit was arrived at following a public consultation process undertaken in 2005. Following this, it was announced in January 2007 that a limit of 4.65m would be introduced. Originally it was proposed that there be a two year derogation for vehicles registered, licensed or in use prior to the introduction of such a limit. Subsequently, following representations from the haulage industry it was agreed that a five year dergoation would apply and this applies to those vehicles registered, licensed or in use prior to the 1st November 2008, when Statutory Instrument 366 of 2008 was signed into effect. </p><p>  Extending this derogation would have the effect of penalising those operators who have adapted their fleet recognising that this derogation was coming to an end, and rewarding those that did not. It is more than six years since the 4.65m limit was announced and the industry has had more than adequate time to accomodate themselves to the new limit.</p><p>   </p></reply>

Currently, many people travelling trans-Atlantic to and from Cork travel through UK or European hubs having to 'back-track'. It would be preferable if they could connect through a US city or fly direct to Cork and would be beneficial for tourism, business and family connections.   Both Dublin and Cork Airports are owned and managed by the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) which operates under a clear commercial mandate.  As such, the promotion and development of routes at Cork Airport, including transatlantic routes, is a matter for the DAA and the airport management in Cork and is not a matter in which I have a direct role though I am will to be supportive in any way that does not breach state aid or competition rules or laws.</p><p>  Under Open Skies agreements, there are no regulatory obstacles for airlines who may wish to operate transatlantic services from Cork.  I understand from Cork Airport that they are actively seeking an airline to operate a service to the east coast of the US.   I would hope that airlines will consider the opportunities that such a route could provide, as well as other routes to the UK and mainland Europe.  In that regard, I strongly welcome the announcement that Ryanair is to commence a new service to East Midlands from 6 November and Aer Lingus Regional is to increase its number of flights this winter to Birmingham and Manchester.  This will improve the connectivity between the cities for both tourists and business passengers.</p><p>   </p></reply>

The consultation period has now concluded and my officials are considering the submissions received and have commenced preliminary work on the Heads of the Bill, which will form the basis for a round of bilateral discussions between the Department and relevant companies and local authorities in November and December.</p><p>  The new Bill will also seek to legislate for some of the new initiatives introduced in the area of corporate governance since the Government assumed office - such as the appearance of Chairmen designate before the Oireachtas committee, a stated requirement of certain board level skillsets and the establishment of a public expressions of interest system to apply for board membership.</p><p>  I hope to progress the drafting of the Bills as quickly as possible and will of course, subsequent to Government approval, present the Heads to the Oireachtas committee for their opinion in due course. </p></reply>

There has been a positive response to the initiative from airlines so far with Ryanair and Aer Lingus Regional both announcing details of new routes and increased services from Dublin, Shannon, Cork and Knock. </p><p>  I would like to see further announcements of this kind from other airlines. More flights into Ireland at more locations will mean more visitors from oversees, and a bigger tourism dividend. The airports and Tourism Ireland have attractive incentive and marketing programmes available which will help support new services and build on the success of The Gathering in the months ahead.</p></reply>

In addition the Utilities Works contract has recently been awarded with the aim that substantive work will commence in January 2014.</p><p>  In relation to the main infrastructure contract, the EU Official Journal Notice seeking advance expressions of interest has been published and will lead to shortlisting of bidders in December. The tender process will continue in 2014 and the aim is to appoint a contractor in Q4 2014. Work on the main contract is then expected to commence in early 2015 and to be completed by the end of 2016. Following testing, commissioning and trial runs the line is currently targeted to open in Q4 2017.</p><p>  Noting the NTA's responsibility in the matter I have referred the Deputy's question to the Authority for a more detailed response.  Please advise my private office if you don't receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>
