    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-21a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072100058#WRA00600"><p>I share the Deputy's concern to ensure that those on low incomes have access to appropriate childcare supports, irrespective of whether they are in receipt of a social protection payment.  With this in mind, the Programme for Government commits to streamlining the existing targeted childcare programmes, including the Community Childcare Scheme, into a new single affordable childcare scheme which would be more accessible for both parents and providers.  </p>  <p>  This commitment reflects a recommendation of the 2015 Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare in Ireland.  That group recommended that all targeted childcare programmes be merged into one single targeted childcare programme with eligibility for a subsidy being determined by income.  This would ensure that subsidies are available to all those who qualify on income grounds, rather than just being available to specific groups such as families in receipt of certain Social Protection payments. </p>  <p>   A project team has been established to develop the proposed new single affordable childcare scheme and work is underway with a view to having the new scheme in in place by September 2017. </p>  <p>  I believe that the new scheme will also provide a robust platform for future investment in childcare in Ireland so that childcare is more affordable for more families.</p></reply>

My first priority in relation to Early Years is to secure the expansion of schemes announced by my predecessor, in Budget 2016.  The expansion of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) free pre-school year is my immediate priority, as is the roll out of the 'Access and Inclusion Model' for Early Childhood Care and Education.</p>  <p>  The report of the Inter-Departmental Group on future investment in childcare recommended that a number of schemes operated by my Department be integrated into a new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme.  Work on this is progressing rapidly, and I intend for this to be rolled out by September 2017.  Alongside this, I am working to improve capacity in the sector.  The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced a significant increase in capital funding available this year to the early years sector, from &euro;4m to &euro;6.5m. I will be seeking additional capital in Budget 2017. </p>  <p>  In planning for the longer term, I will be seeking to develop capacity, quality and affordability in relation to the care of children under the age of three.  I have also established an inter-departmental working group on after-school childcare, and I am working with my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills to advance proposals in relation to school-age childcare.</p>  <p>  I am also continuing to advance the Early Years quality agenda.  The new Childcare Regulations came into effect on 30 June 2016.  From 31 December 2016, all staff working in formal childcare settings will be required to hold a relevant childcare qualification at Level 5, and staff members must hold a level 6 qualification to be permitted to work as ECCE room leaders under the ECCE contract.</p>  <p>  To support staff to meet the new qualification requirements, my Department established the Learner Fund which has already allocated &euro;3.5 million to over 3,000 staff for the purpose of upskilling.  My Department is continuing to support up-skilling in the sector and is working with community childcare facilities to ensure their financial viability. </p></reply>

As the Deputies will be aware, issues in relation to homelessness are a key priority for this Government, as evidenced by the publication of the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness last Tuesday.  While the concerted efforts and actions in the Plan will result in families moving on from emergency accommodation in a shorter timeframe than at present, we must ensure that families and children are supported as much as possible while they are in the emergency accommodation. </p>  <p>  To this end, the Action Plan includes the following additional measures to assist families in emergency homeless accommodation to mitigate the challenges they face:</p>  <p>  -  Additional dedicated child support workers will be appointed in an initiative by the DCYA. The workers will develop support plans for children and families with a particular focus on those with specific needs &ndash; a quarter of children presenting as homeless need this additional support.</p>  <p>  -  Access to early years services. My Department will ask the City and County Childcare Committees to liaise with homeless families and assist them in accessing early years services. A new specific scheme will also be designed from existing resources.</p>  <p>  -  Home School Community Liaison and School Completion staff will assist children and families experiencing homelessness to maintain regular school attendance and prioritise them within the School Completion Programme.</p>  <p>  -  A pilot project will be introduced to support the family functioning of homeless families currently in emergency accommodation by providing off-site or near-site family time including play, homework, cooking and washing facilities, family support and parent support.</p>  <p>  -  The nutritional needs of families and children will be addressed. Some homeless families do not have access to cooking facilities or regular nutritional food, depending on the location of the emergency accommodation. My Department, in partnership with others, will identify problem areas and propose solutions.</p>  <p>  -  Additional resources will be put in place to strengthen inter-agency arrangements within Tusla including Family Support, Social Work and Educational Welfare. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan also contains a number of measures which aim to prevent homelessness amongst other vulnerable groups, including:</p>  <p>  -  Young people leaving State care and at risk of homelessness will be identified and catered for through appropriate housing and other supports required to meet their needs.</p>  <p>  -  Tusla will provide additional emergency refuge accommodation spaces so that victims of domestic violence forced to flee the family home do not find themselves homeless. The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will provide policy and procedural guidance to housing authorities with regard to the role they can play to assist these victims to secure new, independent tenancies as required.</p>  <p>  -  A new facility with accommodation for pregnant women who are homeless will be provided by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, with my Department and Tusla supporting the service. </p>  <p>  I will work closely with my colleagues in Government and with all relevant agencies, to ensure that we address this issue as a matter of major importance.</p></reply>

I plan to work closely with all relevant Government departments to implement these measures in the context of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs. </p>  <p>  Last month I announced details of the &euro;600,000 Youth Employability Initiative which is funded under the Dormant Accounts scheme.  Under the Initiative 28 youth projects will receive grants to support innovative programmes that target disadvantaged young people who are most at risk of unemployment and who are not in education, employment or training.  The programmes will aim to build skills that will enhance their employability and over 1000 young people aged 15 to 24 years across the country will benefit.  My Department is setting up a forum with the successful youth projects in order to gather and share the lessons from this Initiative to inform future policy in this area.</p>  <p>  My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services by the voluntary youth sector, to young people throughout the country.  Each year, over 380,000 young people participate in the voluntary youth services.  Young people who engage in youth work activities have the opportunity to attain specific skills which can enhance employability.  These skills include learning to learn, social and civic competence, leadership, communication, teamwork, and entrepreneurship.  These are the &lsquo;soft skills&rsquo; that are relevant and applicable to industry and valued and sought after by employers. </p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government, I plan to build on initiatives such as the Youth Employability Initiative, which can have a significant contribution to make to the Government&rsquo;s employment agenda particularly for young people who are most marginalised from the labour market. </p></reply>

On that basis it would not be appropriate to include St Patrick's Guild as a Mother and Baby Home, as it did not provide this range of services. </p>  <p>  However, in accordance with Article 1(VII) of their Terms of Reference, the Commission is directed to investigate the exit pathways of children from the homes listed in Appendix 1 of the relevant SI. and to examine the extent to which other institutions were part of the entry or exit pathways for single mothers and children into or out of these Homes.  It is certainly open to the Commission to give consideration to the types of institutions raised by the Deputy in this context.

The Act, which amends the Child Care Act 1991, has three distinct elements.  While the main body of provision relates to aftercare (under sections 2-9), the legislation also includes technical amendments on foot of the commencement of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 (under sections 13-15), as well as amendments to sections governing early years services (under sections 10-12).</p>  <p>  The early years elements of the Act were commenced by the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 (Commencement) Order 2016, Statutory Instrument (SI.) No. 203 of 2016. The Commencement Order appointed 26 April 2016 as the day upon which the early years elements of the Act came into operation. </p>  <p>  With regard to the technical amendments, covered under sections 13, 14 and 15, a draft Commencement Order is currently being finalised by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.  The commencement of these sections will need to be sequenced appropriately with the commencement of related sections of the Health Act 2007 and the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2011.  It is anticipated that the technical amendments will be commenced shortly.  </p>  <p>  Finally, with regard to aftercare, which is covered under sections 2 to 9 of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015, commencement of the relevant provisions will depend on the outcome of consultations with Tusla with regard to appropriate timing and the readiness of the Child and Family Agency to implement same.</p>  <p>  Officials will continue to keep the provisions of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 under review once all elements of the Act have been commenced. </p></reply>

The role included notifying child minders of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities and supporting the CCCs with their work with child minders.</p>  <p>  In recent years, HSE funding for the Child minding Advisory Officer posts has gradually decreased, and is no longer in place in the majority of areas.  The funding of the 30 CCCs was also reduced as part of expenditure reviews in recent years. However, the CCCs continue to provide valuable services at local level and  supporting the child minding sector is an integral part of their work.  As a result, child minders continue to have access to some level of support, training and advice.</p>  <p>  My Department provides annual funding to each CCC to enable them to support and advise all childcare providers at local level.  In 2016, the total amount allocated to the CCCs was &euro;10.4m.  In addition, in 2016 my Department provided &euro;250,000 to the CCCs for Child minding Development Grants.  My Department also provides annual funding, totalling &euro;2.44m in 2016, to seven National Voluntary Childcare Organisations to provide support at a local level to their members.  This included &euro;340,000 for Child minding Ireland (CMI), the representative body for child minders.  This national association supports quality development in family based care for children. It supports parents with childcare choices and concerns and also child minders.  My Department will soon commence work with Child minding Ireland through a consultative group to inform policy on a programme of supports and reforms for the Child minding Sector.</p>  <p>  Decisions on how best to regulate and support the child minding sector will continue to form part of the ongoing work and considerations of officials working on the Early Years Strategy which is due to be finalised by the end of 2016.</p></reply>

In that capacity, my Department has circulated the UNCRC Concluding Observations, published in February 2016, to all Government Departments for attention regarding recommendations appropriate for consideration and action.  These observations include a number of recommendations which engage the areas of responsibility of various Departments.</p><p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People (2014-2020),</i>which was launched by the Government in April 2014, is solidly rooted in the principles and values of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Framework contains 163 commitments, from across all policy domains relevant to children and young people, and there are further commitments in allied constituent strategies subsequently brought forward by my Department; such as the <i>National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-Making (2015-2020).</i>As one might expect, there is a significant degree of commonality between these commitments and the recommendations of the UN Committee in its Concluding Observations.</p><p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>provides for a robust infrastructure to oversee implementation, which is led by my Department.  The Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium is the keystone of the implementation framework, and is responsible for having oversight of cross-government implementation of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>and its constituent strategies.</p><p>Since my appointment as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I have been chairing the Consortium personally.  The Consortium is the primary forum for whole of government working in respect of children and young people, and with the other elements of the implementation infrastructure, will drive the progression of the UN Committee&rsquo;s recommendations.  Membership of the Consortium comprises high level representation at Assistant Secretary level from all Government Departments whose policies have an impact on children and young people.  It also includes senior representatives from the HSE, Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the City and County Managers Association, the Chair of the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees National Steering Group, as well as the Chair and three rotating members of the Advisory Council, established under <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>.  The membership of the Advisory Council, which has an independent chairperson, is drawn from pillars representing the Early Years and Children and Youth sectors and also independent experts.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s first Child Summit will have its inaugural event in September 2016.  This event, which is being hosted by the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance in partnership with my Department, will focus on the Concluding Observations on Ireland under the UNCRC.  The purpose of this high-level conference is to examine from various stakeholder perspectives how the recommendations of the UNCRC may be progressed through existing structures and frameworks, in particular through <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>and other departmental strategies.  Attendees at the event will include a broad range of stakeholders including representatives of Government departments and non-governmental organisations.  </p><p>In addition to the arrangements set out above, my Department in exercising its coordination role going forward will consult relevant Departments on a periodic basis regarding plans and actions relating to the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations.</p></reply>

The operation of the children detention school system under Part 10 of the Act is under the remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.

This represents an increase of over &euro;2.5m on the amount of &euro;4m announced for this programme in February 2016.  This grant has been made available for early years pre-school services, both private and not-for-profit/community, that are intending to expand their service to provide for more capacity in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. Grants of up to &euro;10,000 per provider are being provided.  The extension of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) pre-school scheme so that every child will be able to access free pre-school from the age of three until they start school (entering pre-school in the September, January or April after they turn three) is a welcome development for children, parents and Early Years providers.  It will see more than 60,000 additional children enrolled in the programme by April 2017.  Children will now benefit from an average of 61 weeks of the scheme, up from 38 weeks.  In order to ensure that there is sufficient capacity in the sector to provide for these children, this is one of a number of measures my Department has developed to assist services to expand.</p>  <p>  My Department is consulting closely with the County Childcare Committees (CCCs), the Early Years Sector representatives and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in order to ensure the readiness of preschools to accommodate the additional children enrolling in ECCE from this coming September.</p>  <p>  My Department made data available to the 30 CCCs earlier this year detailing the number of children that will be eligible for ECCE in September 2016, January 2017 and April 2017 per Electoral Division.  This greatly assisted CCCs and service providers to determine the capacity for business expansion.</p>  <p>  My Department has altered ECCE&rsquo;s rules to allow for higher capitation to be payable to services on a room by room basis.  This would allow services with two rooms, but only one graduate, to still receive higher capitation for one of the rooms.  This assists services in expanding capacity and incrementally increasing the number of graduates in their employment.</p>  <p>  My Department has worked closely with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to consider planning issues for services wishing to expand their service.  Earlier this year the DOECLG issued a circular to all Local Authorities asking them to assist early years providers with the their planning queries and the pre-planning consultation phase in so far as possible.</p></reply>

Under new Childcare Regulations, the level 5 requirement came into effect as of 30 June 2016 for newly-registering services and will come into effect for existing services on 31 December 2016.  At present, Community Employment (CE) scheme workers form part of the adult:child ratios in some, but not all, community childcare facilities.  The new qualification requirement will mean that such workers will no longer be permitted to count towards the required adult:child ratio unless they hold the required minimum qualification. </p>  <p>  While I understand that these new regulations may cause initial difficulties in some community childcare services; I am committed to ensuring that all childcare is of an appropriately high quality, and this involves ensuring that every child is cared for by a suitably qualified person, whether a facility is provided on a community-not-for profit basis or not.  To support staff to meet the new qualification requirements, my Department established the Learner Fund which has already allocated &euro;3.5 million to over 3,000 staff for the purpose of upskilling.  My Department is continuing to support upskilling in the sector and is working with community childcare facilities to ensure their financial viability. </p>  <p>  At the request of my Department, the City and County Childcare Committees have established a project to examine the impact of these changes on the sustainability of community childcare services that are currently dependent on CE workers to meet the ratio requirements.  My Department has advised childcare providers who consider that the sustainability of their service is at risk as a result of this measure to contact their local City or County Childcare Committee immediately to discuss this matter. </p>  <p>  I am committed to making high quality childcare more accessible and affordable to more families. I also greatly value the service provided by Community-Not-for-Profit Childcare facilities.</p></reply>

These initiatives include advertisements on social media sites, local and national newspapers and within community settings and support services.  It is hoped that as a result of this campaign, additional families will avail of this programme.  Demand for CCS has reduced in 2015 and 2016, possibly partly due to the economic recovery.</p>  <p>  The number of applications under the CCSP Programme should increase when the school year starts in September 2016 as services have indicated to my Department that they did not wish to implement the programme mid year.</p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare, including after-school care, at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.  Parents qualify as disadvantaged or low income on the basis of means-tested entitlements.  In the case of full day care, parents qualifying for the higher rate of subvention under the CCS programme can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge for childcare in the participating childcare facility.</p>  <p>  At the end of 2015, using savings from that year, my Department lifted the cap on the number of CCS places available through community services and encouraged these services to provide additional CCS places.  Since this time, 1,380 additional places have been provided under CCS by Community services and this number is expected to continue to rise.</p>  <p>  Budget 2016 provided &euro;16m to create an additional 3,200 (full-time equivalent) Community Childcare Subvention ( CCS) childcare places, or approximately 8,000 places based on average uptake.  Traditionally, CCS has only been available through community (not for profit) childcare services of which there are approximately 900 across the country.  Eligible families who did not live in an area with a community service could not traditionally access the programme, hence my Department extended the terms of the CCS Programme so that it could be provided by private childcare providers across the country.  The Community Childcare Subvention Private (CCSP) Programme launched in March of this year. 1,227 individual children have been approved for funding under CCSP and this number is expected to continue to rise. </p></reply>

However, with the extension of the free preschool programme ( Early Childhood Care and Education Programme), many children are now availing of supports for a longer period of time i.e. they continue to retain the full HSE grant towards a Special Needs Assistant for a second year of free preschool. This can mean that there is less funding freed up to support new entrants to the free pre-school programme. </p>  <p>  However, this should not negatively affect children who are entering preschool for the first time as, in June of this year,  I introduced the new Access and Inclusion Model (AIM). </p>  <p>  AIM is a new programme of supports to enable children with a disability to access and fully participate in the free pre-school programme.

These include children who have no allocated social worker.  The plan involves increasing overall staffing levels in Tusla by 323 whole-time equivalents, with an investment of &euro;19.4m over the period 2016-2018.  We allocated &euro;6.1m for this purpose in 2016 for unallocated cases, to fund a net increase of 168 social workers by the end of this year.  It will be important to recruit other grades also, to ensure an efficient service with the right mix of staffing including family support staff and administrative support.</p><p>Tusla has been pro-active in its efforts to meet its recruitment targets in a competitive environment.  Progress is being made and at the end of May 2016, in excess of 170 additional staff were employed directly by Tusla compared to the same period in 2015.  This includes more than 100 social workers.  Furthermore, <i>Tusla Recruit</i>is currently interviewing in excess of 300 applicants for its graduate intake later this year.  Planning for the 2017 graduate recruitment campaign has commencedand will include colleges in Derry, Belfast and Manchester. </p></reply>

The vast majority of such complaints relate to sexual abuse.  The Garda&iacute; are always  informed of these complaints and their role is to carry out a criminal investigation into the complaint.  Tusla's job is to try and establish if the alleged abuser poses a risk of abuse to children currently, and if so, to put in place protective measures in relation to identified children.  The sharing of information by Tusla with third parties must follow fair procedure with the exception of cases where there is an immediate risk to children.</p>  <p>  In terms of overall strategy, retrospective allegations are dealt with by Tusla under its national policy for handling allegations of abuse, "Policy and Procedures for Responding to Allegations of Child Abuse and Neglect", which has been in place since 2014.  I am aware of the complexities of such cases and  raised this issue at my meeting with the Chair of the Board and the CEO of Tusla in June.  I emphasised the importance of dealing with cases as soon as possible, while recognising the practical difficulties that can often arise in relation to alleged events of many years ago.  I have asked to meet with senior officials in Tusla next week to be updated on the steps they are taking to deal nationally with these cases, and on cases currently before the Courts which may impact on Tusla's practice in these matters. </p>  <p>  Tusla's policy is informed by both child protection principles and fair procedures, and sets out the specific steps for Tusla social workers to take in carrying out a risk assessment of an adult where an allegation of abuse has been made against them.  As Tusla is not a policing body it does not have such powers of investigation.  Tusla cannot compel co-operation with individuals against whom an allegation has been made, or indeed the person making the allegation, and must proceed on the basis of fair procedure and due process. As such, Tusla works closely with the Garda&iacute; in such cases.     </p>  <p>  Tusla is undertaking a full review of all referrals of allegations of  retrospective abuse.  This review is looking at all referrals to establish their priority for action. I am expecting this review to conclude later in the year and I have requested Tusla to keep me up to date on its progress and on any emerging issues of concern.  Tusla is also identifying specialist staff to undertake this work nationally. </p></reply>

This represents an increase of over &euro;2.5m on the amount of &euro;4m announced for this programme in February 2016.  This grant has been made available for early years pre-school services, both private and not-for-profit/community, that are intending to expand their service to provide for more capacity in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. Grants of up to &euro;10,000 per provider are being provided.  The extension of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) pre-school scheme so that every child will be able to access free pre-school from the age of three until they start school (entering pre-school in the September, January or April after they turn three) is a welcome development for children, parents and Early Years providers.  It will see more than 60,000 additional children enrolled in the programme by April 2017.  Children will now benefit from an average of 61 weeks of the scheme, up from 38 weeks.  In order to ensure that there is sufficient capacity in the sector to provide for these children, this is one of a number of measures my Department has developed to assist services to expand.</p>  <p>  The award of funding was based partially on evidence of current need and/or projected future demand for additional ECCE places in 2016/2017 in the catchment area of each applying service.  The relevant City/County Childcare Committee assisted Pobal with demand versus supply data.  Value for money was also an awarding criteria and the costs/grant requested relative to the number of ECCE places being created was taken into account when evaluating grant applications.</p>  <p>  I am delighted that so many high quality applications were received under this scheme, and that the majority of applications were approved for drawdown of funding.  I look forward to working with the sector to deliver further improvements in childcare quality, availability and affordability over the coming year.  It is hoped that it will be possible to make a similar capital fund available next year.  This is something that will be addressed in the context of the estimates process and Budget 2017.</p></reply>

However, with the extension of the free preschool programme (Early Childhood Care and Education Programme), many children are now availing of supports for a longer period of time i.e. they continue to retain the full HSE grant towards a Special Needs Assistant for a second year of free preschool.

This measure, which will be introduced from September 2016, means that children will be eligible to start free pr-school when they reach the age of 3, and continue to avail of free preschool until they start primary school (once the child is not older than 5 years and 6 months at the end of the pre-school year i.e. end June).  Following the introduction of the expanded programme there will be three opportunities each year - in September, January and April - for eligible children to enrol for the free pre-school provision.  This will ensure that children aged 3 or over have the opportunity to enrol as soon as possible after their third birthday.  The maximum number of free pre-school weeks to which a child is entitled will depend on their date of birth, and the age at which they start primary school.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the fact that the school year starts in September means that not all children will necessarily be able to avail of two full years after turning three, and prior to starting school; but on average, from September 2016, children will benefit from 61 weeks, up from the current provision of 38 weeks.  The extension of ECCE on this basis was a recommendation of "right from the Start", the Expert Advisory Groups on the Early Years Strategy 2017.</p>  <p>  The expansion of the ECCE programme is a major development that will see the number of children benefitting from the Programme rise from around 67,000 to around 127,000 in a given programme year.  For the 2016/17 programme year, it is estimated that 89,500 children will be eligible to enrol in the Programme from September 2016, an additional 22,000 from January 2017 and a further 15,500 from April 2017. </p>  <p>  The upper age limit for participation in free pre-school was set by the Interdepartmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare on foot of advice received from the Department of Education and Skills.  As the Deputy will be aware, limiting the diversity in age ranges in primary school is considered to be generally in the best interest of children, in relation to peer interaction in junior infants, as well as other educational considerations.  This does mean that different children will spend different lengths of time in free pre-school, but my Department's focus throughout in considering these issues has been on how to achieve the best outcomes for children.</p></reply>

This is being addressed through the Area-Based Childhood programme, the development of a Quality and Capacity Building initiative, and supporting relevant priorities of other Government departments.  As part of this, the Advisory Council for <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, </i>which brings together members of the community and voluntary sector as well as independent experts, has worked on a number of priority areas including homelessness and child poverty.

They have also met with young people working with the Migrants Rights Centre Ireland to discuss issues facing undocumented young people.</p><p>My Department commissions, conducts and consults a wide variety of analysis of the requirements of children in their early years, and this is central to policy development.  Evidence from the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal study informed the recent introduction of new childcare regulations, and the July 2015 report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare was also based on a wide consultation. </p><p>In relation to youth services, my Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of services to young people throughout the country.  Targeted programmes support the provision of youth services for young people who are at risk of drugs and/or alcohol misuse, early school-leaving, homelessness or who are living in disadvantaged communities.  Overall, the funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.

In the case of private residential centres, Tusla carries out a robust process of registration, monitoring and inspection.  This process ensures that the quality of provision is put in place from the start and maintained as part of the service agreement with the provider.  The inspection reports are published on the Tusla website.  </p>  <p>  A child is placed in a residential setting only where they have an identified need that can be met by this service.  This is often where an alternative arrangement, such as a fostering placement, is not considered suitable.  Approximately 5% of children in care across the country use residential services.  The availability of these services need to be responsive and flexible enough to meet existing demand as well as specialist needs of children, availability in emergency cases, or areas where there is an emerging demand for residential services.  Whether operated by Tusla, managed by voluntary groups or run by private companies, the mix of different types of provision provides Tusla with the operational flexibility to meet demand for residential services as it arises.  </p></reply>

The Roadmap to Ratification, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, sets out the substantial legislative agenda required for ratification.  We are on track to ratify the Convention by end-2016.</p><p>Considerable progress has already been made to overcome barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015, and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 was passed by the Seanad on 26 January this year.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>Work is also under way on drawing up an Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification.  It is intended that the Bill will address issues such as the Convention's requirements in relation to reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty, as well as removing archaic references in existing legislation relating to mental health (including the replacement of disqualifications on the basis of 'lunacy' with more appropriate provisions).</p></reply>

In this regard, the Deputy will be aware of the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment to significantly increase parental leave in the first year of a child&rsquo;s life over the next five years.

The Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, published on 9 June 2016, places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers.  Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 851 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 350 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year. So far 534 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide with another 150 more planned to attest in November.  </p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that community policing is the embodiment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, providing a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  It commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme to continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000 as well as doubling the Garda Reserve and increasing the number of civilian staff so as to free up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing.  Community policing, and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from the resources now coming on stream through the accelerated Garda recruitment programme.<table><tr><th colspan="2">Dublin Metropolitan Region Community Garda&iacute; 31 May 2016</th></tr><tr><td>South Central</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Kevin Street</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Kilmainham</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Pearse St</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Donnybrook</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Irishtown</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>North Central</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Store Street</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Bridewell</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>*Fitzgibbon Street</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>112</td></tr><tr><td>NORTH</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Santry</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>D/Airport</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Ballymun</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Raheny</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Clontarf</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Howth</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Coolock</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Swords</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Malahide</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Balbriggan</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Skerries</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Lusk</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Garristown</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>EAST</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Cabinteely</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Shankill</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Blackrock</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Dundrum</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>SOUTH</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Crumlin</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Sundrive Road</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Rathfarnham</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Rathmines</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Terenure</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>WEST</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cabra</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Finglas</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Lucan</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Ronanstown</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Ballyfermot</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Rathcoole</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>DMR TOTAL</td><td>350</td></tr></table></p><p>*Fitzgibbon under renovation</p></reply>

Section 2(4) provides that it is a matter for a court or jury to decide whether the householder's belief with regard to the amount of force used was honestly held and provides as follows: <i>It is immaterial whether a belief is justified or not if it is honestly held but in considering whether the person using the force honestly held the belief, the court  or the jury, as the case may be, shall have regard to the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for the person so believing and all other relevant circumstances.</i></p></reply>

If this is the case, the person concerned is illegally in the State and in breach of the Immigration Act, 2004.  </p>  <p>   It is open to any foreign national who finds themselves in an undocumented situation to apply to the authorities for permission to remain.  Cases are carefully considered before a decision is made.  It should also be remembered that most people become undocumented through their own conscious actions or omissions.  There are currently no plans to engage in any form of blanket regularisation of migrants who are unlawfully in the State.  It is the responsibility of all non EEA nationals who are resident in the State to ensure that they have an appropriate permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Most migrants do in fact comply with this condition and obey the State's immigration laws.     </p>  <p>  At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments "to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons".  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.  In our case there are also considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account.</p>  <p>  Clearly, all illegal immigrant cases are not the same and must be dealt with on a case by case basis taking account of their individual circumstances.  At one end of the scale are those where the person's illegal status is through no fault of their own and indeed the Department continue to deal with cases of this nature on an ongoing basis.  However there are also much more egregious instances of immigration abuse, often at considerable expense to the State and it does not follow that such persons should profit from their conduct.  </p>  <p>  Sometimes case by case consideration will result in a positive outcome for the applicant.  However, in other cases this may result in a decision by the Irish authorities, subject to the oversight of our Courts, that the person has to go home.  That decision should be respected. </p></reply>

Their importance has been recognised in successive Programmes for Government and was underscored by Ireland's first International Education Strategy published in September 2010.  Ireland's strong reputation in this sector has been built up over many years through the provision of high-quality education services, including English language education, and the close cooperation of key Government Departments, including my own Department, in delivering the reform commitments set out in the Programme for Government and the International Education Strategy.</p>  <p>  At the outset I wish to make it clear that any Non-EEA student seeking to come to Ireland to take up an education programme is expected to comply with all the usual immigration requirements and additional requirements for students clearly set out on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Students).  Some of the key requirements relate to taking up places only on eligible programmes, maximum duration of student permission in the State, financial security and private medical insurance. </p>  <p>  In conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills the student regime has been updated over the years to reflect changing requirements and to ensure sufficient controls are in place.  A major review was carried out and published in September 2014 setting out a joint policy statement and key reforms, in particular a new regulatory framework across three separate pillars, as follows:</p>  <p>  -  Restrictions on the programmes permitted for student immigration purposes.</p>  <p>  -  An enhanced compliance and inspection regime.</p>  <p>  -  Strengthening the terms of the student work concession.</p>  <p>  This policy is being implemented on a phased basis taking into account a High Court case taken by two institutions that did not hold the Accreditation and Coordination of English Language Services (ACELS) recognition which meant that transitionary arrangements needed to be put in place in respect of English language education.  In that regard, such providers are now expected to comply with certain additional requirements before being listed as eligible for immigration purposes.  These requirements, among other things, require such providers to demonstrate: transparency of ownership; good governance; adequate learner protection; and higher standards as regards student services and their physical environment.  The first round of applications was opened in July 2015 and also involved unannounced inspections selected on the basis of a risk assessment.  The second phase of reforms was delivered in January 2016 when language programmes were listed for the first time on the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP).  Simultaneously, the Internationalisation Register ceased to exist. </p>  <p>  By its very nature the ILEP is intended to be a temporary solution to address a gap in the lead up to the introduction of the International Education Mark (IEM) which will provide a full quality assurance framework in the future.  In this interim process, however, providers must continue to comply with the new stricter conditions now applicable to the sector in order to retain their listings.  The process is reopened from time to time to allow new applications taking account of expansion of the sector and changing trends in international education.  The ILEP was updated in April 2016 and is expected to be updated again in August 2016, and at future dates to be determined, to reflect such changes, pending the introduction of the IEM.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to stress that my Department has no role in accrediting education providers or education programmes which is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills. </p></reply>

The Joint Agency Task Force is led by the police and revenue services and brings together the relevant law enforcement agencies to better co-ordinate strategic and operational actions against cross-border organised crime.  It involves senior officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI, the Revenue Commissioners and HM Revenue and Customs; it also includes the Criminal Assets Bureau and UK National Crime Agency as well as other interested law enforcement services (such as environmental protection agencies and immigration services).</p>  <p>  The Joint Agency Task Force has been operational and active since the start of this year and I received the first six-monthly report on its work at my meeting with the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, Claire Sugden MLA on 4 July.  The report is available on my Department's website and I have arranged for a copy to be forwarded directly to the Deput</p>  <p>  The report details the work that has been undertaken in establishing the Joint Agency Task Force as well as the particular areas of cross-border criminal activity that have been the subject of joint operations.  There have, for example, been specific operations targeting rural crime, child sexual exploitation and human trafficking for labour exploitation that have resulted in a number of arrests, the seizure of stolen vehicles, equipment and other goods, cash and drugs and the identification by the Revenue services of unregistered business interests.  In respect of rural crime, there was also a specific focus on awareness-raising and providing crime prevention advice at community level on both sides of the border.</p>  <p>  The report illustrates the positive and proactive approach that the Joint Agency Task Force has taken over its first six months and I commend the work of all of the agencies involved.</p></reply>

It was a senseless and unjustifiable act of violence which tragically took the lives of two innocent young people.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the bombing and two murders in Belturbet were the subject of a thorough investigation at the time by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with expert assistance provided by the Army.  The investigations at that time involved close liaison with the authorities in Northern Ireland in an effort to bring the perpetrators to justice.  However, although every avenue of inquiry open to the investigation was pursued at that time there was no evidence to bring those responsible for this crime to justice.  It remains a source of disappointment that no one has yet been brought to justice for these murders.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the investigation into these murders remains open.  While regrettably it is the case that with the passage of time and in the absence of any new evidence emerging, one must be realistic about the prospects of successful prosecutions, it is nonetheless the case that Garda Authorities will pursue any new information or evidence that becomes available and would work with the PSNI to seek to progress the investigation in those circumstances.  I would call on anyone with any relevant information to bring it to the attention of the Garda Authorities.</p></reply>

The measure was designed to boost tourism and create additional jobs in that sector. In my Budget Day speech last year, I suggested that while the case for retaining the measure for the hotel sector in Dublin is diminishing each year with room rates rising particularly during major events, the case for retention of the measure for the rest of the country remained. The Programme for a Partnership Government, published in May, includes a commitment to retain the hugely successful 9% VAT rate on tourism related services, providing that prices remain competitive. </p></reply>

The son or daughter will not be liable to CAT if the value of the inheritance, when aggregated with all other gifts and inheritances received from a parent since 5 December 1991, does not exceed this threshold. CAT, currently at a rate of 33%, is payable on aggregate inheritances in excess of this threshold. </p>  <p>  In addition, where the inheritance consists of agricultural property, including land, it may qualify for relief, known as 'agricultural relief', from CAT once certain conditions are satisfied.  Section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003 provides for this relief which takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable market value of the gifted or inherited agricultural property.</p>  <p>  The person taking the inheritance (the 'beneficiary') of the agricultural property must qualify as a 'farmer' for the purpose of section 89 CATCA 2003.  This means, among other conditions, that a beneficiary's agricultural property must comprise at least 80% by gross market value of the beneficiary's total property at a particular date. Revenue take the view that land on which a wind turbine or solar panels are installed is not agricultural property. </p>  <p>  Thus, depending on the amount of an individual's land that is actually occupied by wind turbines or solar panels, the use of agricultural land for wind turbines or a solar farm may result in a beneficiary not meeting the '80%' test to qualify for agricultural relief. </p></reply>

During the same period there were 4,638 BTL mortgage accounts in arrears for more than 90 days held by non-bank entities, with an associated outstanding balance of &euro;1.37bn and associated arrears of &euro;0.45bn (33 per cent of total outstanding balance).</p>  <p>  The CCMA sets out requirements for all mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears on a mortgage loan which is secured by their  primary residence.  It provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank engages with Retail Credit Firms in relation to their treatment of borrowers under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), as provided for in the CCMA. The MARP sets out the steps which lenders must follow, e.g. communicate with the borrower, gather financial information, assess the borrowers circumstances and propose a resolution.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Government is committed to working with the Central Bank to ensure that the Code continues to be relevant, fair and balanced in respect of the legitimate interests of debtors and creditors, all the while promoting the availability of sustainable solutions to address genuine mortgage difficulty. This will include the Central Bank conducting an assessment of existing sustainable restructuring solutions across all lenders and non-bank entities operating in Ireland.</p></reply>

This second target represented an increase of around 150% in the number of &euro;10 notes dispensed from ATMs previously.  These targets were met by the banks on the dates set, as part of their commitment to the broader goal of improving the efficiency of payments in the National Payments Plan.</p>  <p>  Building on the recommendations in the National Payments Plan, the Central Bank has now set targets for the banks to achieve in terms of issuance of &euro;10, &euro;20 and &euro;50 notes from ATMs by 2018.  These targets were calculated following a study of the requirements of consumers given patterns of cash usage. </p>  <p>  The targets are that 6-10% of all notes by volume are to be &euro;10 notes by the end of 2018, 40-45% of all notes by volume are to be &euro;20 notes and 45-50% of all notes by volume are to be &euro;50 notes.  The latest available data, for Q1 2016, on amounts actually dispensed shows that 7% of all notes are &euro;10 notes, 34% of all notes are &euro;20 notes and 59% of all notes are &euro;50 notes.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is working, in co-operation with the commercial banks, towards these targets.  This topic is a permanent agenda item at the National Cash Forum which is chaired by the Central Bank, and is also discussed at bilateral meetings with banks by the Central Bank. </p>  <p>  By way of additional information, I am also informed by the Central Bank that the commercial banks are in the process of rolling out amended algorithms for their ATM fleet which will provide more choice for customers in relation to the denomination mix of their withdrawals.</p></reply>

Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.</p>  <p>  While it is important to distinguish this division of roles, it is equally important to recognise that both the Registrar of Credit Unions and the Minister for Finance work together for the safety of members' savings and the security of the credit union sector.</p>  <p>  The Registrar recognises the strategic challenges facing the sector, the need to revitalise business models and find ways of doing business to better serve members, delivering on their expectations.  The Registrar is committed to engaging with credit unions on their business model development proposals.  As part of that engagement process, the Central Bank established Sector Stakeholder Dialogues in November 2015 to facilitate engagement with credit unions.  This is with a view to gaining a better understanding of how credit unions want to develop their business model and to identify any changes that may be required to the regulatory framework to facilitate prudent development.  Since the establishment of the Sector Stakeholder Dialogues five meetings have taken place.</p>  <p>  To date the focus of the group has been on a number of areas including:</p>  <p>  -  Longer term lending;</p>  <p>  -  Additional services framework; and</p>  <p>  -  Publication of sectoral data. </p>  <p>  The group has identified co-ordinators for each of the areas and work is progressing.  In the area of lending, the group is discussing objectives for credit unions in relation to longer term lending and the potential impact of current longer term lending limits.  As a first step to making the longer term lending limits more usable, the Registrar has proposed to undertake work on potential changes to the conditions attaching to approvals for existing longer term lending limits, which were originally developed in 2007.  Some initial proposals on how the conditions could be amended have been put forward for discussion within the group.  Members of the group have undertaken to carry out some analysis on the impact of such proposals on individual credit unions and report back to the group.</p>  <p>  In relation to additional services, the development of guidance on the application process for additional services is under consideration with a view to developing and publishing guidance material for credit unions.  In relation to sectoral data, the group is considering the type and format of data that could be published on a regular basis by the Registrar.</p>  <p>  The dialogues will continue over the coming months with the next meeting scheduled to take place before the end of July. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Regulations made by the Central Bank of Ireland (the Central Bank); the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016, which were commenced on 1 January 2016, make specific reference to section 43 of the Act and to the further classes of investments in which a credit union may invest its funds which may include investments in projects of a public nature.  The Regulations provide that investments in projects of a public nature include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.</p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) made a number of recommendations in its recent report presented to me on 29 June 2016.  It is expected that these recommendations when implemented will support credit unions in developing their business models, particularly recommendations around tiered regulation and the review of Section 35.  I will be establishing an Implementation Group to facilitate and oversee implementation of CUACs recommendations.</p></reply>

Credit unions wishing to provide debit cards should engage with the Registrar of Credit Unions to discuss their proposals.  I have been informed that the Central Bank has been clear in its recent engagement with credit unions and other stakeholders who are seeking to offer debit cards that this service must be supported by the appropriate payment account service.  Consequently, the Central  Bank has recently worked with a group of credit unions on the development of full payment account services which will result in an approved additional service, including a payment account broadly analogous to a bank personal current account which appropriately supports payment instruments such as debit cards. This service is subject to application and formal approval by the Registrar of credit unions as an additional service.</p>  <p>  The most frequently applied for services are insurance services on an introduction basis and provision of full service payment accounts.  Since 1 January Insurance Services on an introduction basis have been included as a service exempt from additional services requirements under Part 9 of Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016.  The Central Bank has further informed me that while no credit union has been approved to provide debit cards over the past five years, it is currently progressing a number of applications for a full service payment account which would support payment instruments such as debit cards.</p></reply>

However, other mitigating factors mean the overall increase in the EU budget contribution is now estimated to be in the order of &euro;280m when compared to the forecast underlying the SES.</p>  <p>  It must be emphasised that the final impact depends on a number of variables including the size of the overall EU budget for 2017 (which is not due to be agreed until November 2016), GNI movements in other EU Member States and other EU budget operational developments. My officials will continue to liaise with the European Commission in order to achieve greater clarity on the exact contribution.</p></reply>

On the basis of these figures, however, it is not possible to isolate an underlying measure which directly strips out the factors cited by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, these various factors are clearly exaggerating headline GDP figures in an Irish context and are not reflective of activity levels seen on the ground here.  More concrete indicators of the underlying levels of economic activity (specifically consumer spending, tax trends and labour market developments) all, however, confirm that Ireland's economic fundamentals remain strong.</p>  <p>  It is important to state that gross measures of output recorded by the CSO (i.e. GDP and GNP) record what they are designed to record.  It should be emphasised that all figures published by the CSO are compiled in accordance with best international practice and statistical standards.  However, in a small open and very globalised economy such as Ireland's, it is clear that the relevance of these gross figures as a means of tracking underlying economic trends and changes in actual living standards is more limited than is the case elsewhere.</p>  <p>  In acknowledgement of this, the Central Statistics Office has established an expert group to provide guidance on how a more relevant indicator could be produced and published alongside these gross measures of output in the future.  The Chief Economist of my Department will sit on this group, with the group expected to report later this year.</p></reply>

This has resulted in a mechanical improvement in the general government debt-to-GDP ratio.  In April the CSO estimated the end-2015 debt-to-GDP ratio at 94%. Following the recent revisions to GDP figures, it is now estimated at 79%. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the potential distortionary impact of these statistical revisions, more concrete indicators of the underlying levels of economic activity such as consumer spending, tax trends and labour market developments all corroborate that Ireland's economic fundamentals remain strong and point to a continuation of a now firmly-rooted recovery.  In turn, these developments underpin the sustainability of our public debt dynamics. </p>  <p>  The most important consideration for Ireland's debt sustainability is whether its debt servicing capacity is improving.  Based on how the IMF analyses debt dynamics, on any measure of activity GDP, GNP, domestic demand or Net National Income Ireland's economy is growing faster than the average rate of interest on its debt while it continues to run a primary budget surplus.  Since the GDP revisions, the rating agencies Fitch and Moody's have stated that Ireland's debt sustainability continues to improve across a range of metrics.</p>  <p>  Investors and rating agencies use a number of other ratios that are unaffected by last week's GDP revisions, including general government interest to general government revenue and general government gross or net debt to general government revenue. </p>  <p>  My Department also analyse these developments.  For instance, the ratio of general government interest to revenue is on a firm downward trajectory and stood at around 9.5% last year, down from almost 12.5% in 2013, meaning a reducing proportion of the State's resources are now required to service the debt.  This ratio is expected to continue to decline over the medium term. </p>  <p>  The gross general government debt to revenue ratio is another appropriate indicator and this ratio has also improved significantly in recent years, dropping to 286% in 2015 from over 355% in 2012. </p>  <p>  The State also holds significant cash and other assets, meaning that net debt is well below the headline gross debt figure. </p>  <p>  In summary, while I welcome the continued decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio, I am conscious of the need for in-depth consideration of all the factors that affect our debt sustainability.  My Department continually monitors these factors.</p></reply>

This is the accepted practice adopted by all forecasting institutions.</p><p>The substantial upward revision to the level of GDP in 2015 is largely related to the activities of a small number of large multinational firms and reflects a number of exceptional factors which have limited impact on actual activity in the Irish economy. </p><p>The main channels through which these factors affect Irish GDP figures include:</p><p>- The effect of 'contract manufacturing' where Irish headquartered multinationals contract the production of goods to third party companies abroad but these products are recorded in Ireland's trade balance;</p><p>- The relocation of intellectual property-related assets or patents to Ireland. Ceteris paribus, this will reduce the level of royalty imports and as result increase Irish GDP;</p><p>- An increase in new aircraft imports to Ireland for international leasing activities generating substantial fee income without significant employment effects;</p><p>A detailed breakdown of the contributions made by each factor is not possible given publicly available data.  Also, while it is not possible to identify the exact number of multinational companies that relocated to Ireland it is clear that this revision is largely related to the activities of a small number of large multinational firms in the manufacturing and aircraft leasing sectors.</p></reply>

The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual's basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement and cannot be imposed on suppliers or contractors.</p>  <p>  It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis.  The previous Government established the Low Pay Commission to annually assess the appropriate level of the National Minimum Wage.  The national minimum hourly rate of pay increased to &euro;9.15 per hour on January 1st   this year following Government acceptance of the Low Pay Commission recommendation of July 2015 to increase the rate from &euro;8.65 per hour.  My colleague, Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Mary Mitchell O'Connor presented the Low Pay Commission's recommendations from its second report at cabinet this week.  The commission has recommended a further increase in the national minimum wage to &euro;9.25 per hour.  This recommendation will be considered in detail in the context of Budget 2017 and in line with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to increase the national minimum wage to &euro;10.50 by 2020.</p>  <p>Separately, wage rates and other conditions of employment are provided for in Employment Regulation Orders for the Contract Cleaning and Security sectors.  These statutory Orders came into effect on October 1st   2015 and provide for minimum rates in excess of the National Minimum Wage, with &euro;10.75 per hour payable to workers in the Security sector and &euro;9.75 per hour payable to workers in the Contract Cleaning sector. </p>  <p>  Statutory minimum rates of pay may also be supplemented by social transfers such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement or health, education or housing assistance payments where the need arises and to reflect family circumstances.</p>  <p>  My Department has not had any discussions with suppliers or service contractors in relation to the Living Wage.  However, I can confirm that my Department adheres to all appropriate current wage legislation.</p></reply>

I did, however introduce an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% for 2014 and 2015. I did this to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative.  I confirmed in my Budget 2015 speech that the additional 0.15% levy would expire at the end of last year and this has now happened.  As both levies have ceased no more payments will be due in respect of them. </p>  <p>  The chargeable persons for the pension fund levies are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans.  The payment of the levies is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levies. </p>  <p>  It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levies should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.  While the final levy expired at the end of 2015 the manner in which the trustees choose to pass them on may entail a longer term but lesser reduction in pension payments to retired members than would have been the case if the reductions were made over the temporary period when the levies applied.  This could potentially take the form of a lifetime reduction.  I do not have specific information in relation to the decisions of individual trustees regarding the passing on of the levy.  However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, in no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levies.</p></reply>

Two new primary schools and four new post-primary schools will be established in the Dublin area in 2017.  In addition, one new primary school and two new post-primary schools will open in Dublin in 2018.</p><p>  A range of areas nationwide, including many of the school planning areas in Dublin, are experiencing increased demographic pressure and these are being kept under ongoing review by my Department.  This review takes account of updated enrolment and child benefit data and also the impact of existing and planned capacity increases to schools in these areas.  Following completion of further demographic analyses, additional schools may open nationwide in 2019 and 2020, including to serve the Dublin school planning areas.</p></reply>

All English language providers seeking inclusion on the ILEP have to comply with certain new requirements including declaration of ownership, physical infrastructure, teacher qualifications, attendance rates, compulsory exam registration policies and maximum class size.  They also need to have compulsory learner protection arrangements in place and a separate account facility to safeguard student advance payments.  The first full iteration of the ILEP was published by the Department of Justice and Equality on 20th January 2016.  The ILEP is updated at regular intervals by that Department.</p><p>  For all providers, their listing on the ILEP is contingent on their ongoing compliance with immigration rules and continuing to meet the other conditions required.  Providers will be subject to unannounced inspections, spot checks and other monitoring of compliance.</p><p>  The implementation of these reforms will help to improve the overall quality of Ireland's offering to international students, promote protection for learners and enhance Ireland's reputation, strongly in line with the goals of Ireland's international education strategy.</p><p>  The ILEP process is an interim measure until the introduction of the International Education Mark (IEM) for the provision of education to international learners, which will provide a full quality framework in the future.

F&aacute;ilte Ireland has promoted the English language sector as part of their overall tourism promotional efforts.  Therefore it is not possible to proportion what monies were spent directly on English Language promotion.  My Department has provided &euro;70,000 per year to F&aacute;ilte Ireland over the course of the 2010 - 2015 strategy to provide for English Language training scholarships for teachers in our core markets.</p><p>  A group comprising of representatives from F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Tourism Ireland, industry groups and my Department is currently involved in developing a shared growth strategy to maximise the economic growth of the ELT sector.  This group aims to create an overarching vision and five-year strategy for the ELT sector.</p><p>  Research was conducted as part of developing the ELT strategy and pointed to a need for a clear and coordinated approach by all stakeholders in the ELT sector, with clear connectivity to the Higher Education sector, in order to be able to market Ireland as a destination for international students.  It was identified that there is an opportunity to view the ELT product as part of the broader international education package that Ireland has to offer.</p><p>  To address these issues, as part of the Government's new International Education Strategy (2016-2020), which is due to be published by my Department shortly, we will work towards ensuring that Ireland's education offerings, including the ELT sector, are promoted in a more cohesive way.</p></reply>

The HEA allocates this funding to the institutions and the internal disbursement of this funding, along with funding it receives from private sources, is then a matter for the individual institution.  Most third level institutions provide chaplaincy services for their student body and decisions on such provision is a matter for the individual institutions as autonomous bodies.</p><p>  The HEA recently carried out a survey on chaplaincy services in the higher education sector which showed that the majority of institutions offer some form of chaplaincy service and that there is significant variation in the approach to chaplaincy services in the sector.  Approaches include the appointment of chaplains as full-time members of staff, agreements with a particular church, internal multi-faith functions and additional remit for existing lecturing staff.  The survey showed that the cost of providing chaplaincy services across the higher education sector is estimated at &euro;1.7m per annum.</p><p>  At post primary level, my Department allocates chaplain posts to Community and Comprehensive Schools and designated Community Colleges.  There are currently 154 whole time equivalent chaplain posts allocated to these schools.  The annual cost is approximately &euro;9.5m.</p><p>  The appointment of Catholic or Protestant chaplains to these schools flow from the original agreements concluded when the schools concerned were established.  The chaplains are not necessarily teachers of religion and perform pastoral and counselling roles.  Under current arrangements they can teach a minimum number of hours and subject to their individual qualifications this may be for subjects other than religion.</p></reply>

It is a matter for individual schools to use their professional judgment to identify pupils who will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils.  Schools are supported in this regard by the National Educational Psychological Services. </p><p>  Schools are not required to apply directly to my Department for learning support for SLDs such as dyslexia.  Schools should monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance. The teaching time afforded to each individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each child's individual learning needs. </p><p>  My Department's Circulars SP ED 02/05 and 70/2014 provide guidelines for primary and post primary schools respectively in relation to the utilisation of additional teaching resources which have been allocated to them for pupils with special educational needs.  </p><p>  Specific Learning Disability is not a disability category included in the list of low incidence disabilities which are eligible for the allocation of resource teaching hours to individual students, under the terms of the relevant circulars.</p><p>  As the allocation of support for pupils with SLDs is managed locally by schools, a parent who feels that their child requires additional learning support in school should raise this matter directly with their school Principal in the first instance, or with the Board of Management of the school. </p><p>  In policy advice provided to my Department in 2013 the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) advised that the current system for allocating resource hours to schools to support pupils with specific disabilities is potentially inequitable.  This is because the current system fails to take account of the individual needs of the children concerned. </p><p>  The NCSE recommended that a new model would be developed through which resources would be provided to schools on the basis of profiled needs of each school.  My Department has developed the recommended new model and a pilot of the new model was implemented over the 2015/2016 school year in 47 schools. </p><p>  The pilot has now been completed and a report of a review of the outcomes of the pilot is being finalized.  Following consideration of this report, decisions will be taken as to the timeframe for the introduction of the proposed new model. In the meantime there are no plans to extend the list of disability categories for which resource teaching hours will be allocated. </p><p>  Further supports which are provided to support pupils with Dyslexia include funding for schools for the purchase of specialised equipment; an information resource pack on Dyslexia which has been made available to all primary and post-primary schools as well as provision for continuing professional development for teachers with additional training needs in the area of Dyslexia through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p><p>  The NCSE recently published a list of special classes for the 2016/17 school year. In total there will be 1,153 special classes available next year, which is an increase of over 100% in the number of special classes which were available in 2011, which was 548.</p><p>  The NCSE has advised that for the coming school year there will be 127 early intervention classes, 525 primary ASD classes and 237 post-primary ASD classes, which represents an increase of approx. 16% on 2015/16 classes for children with autism. </p><p>  Of these, there will be 59 ASD classes in Co. Kildare, including 6 Early Intervention Classes for children who are not yet school going age, 41 primary school classes and 12 at post primary level in mainstream schools.  2 of these classes are new classes due to open in September 2016, 1 at primary level and 1 at post primary level. </p><p>  The NCSE continues to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas and has capacity to establish such new special classes where necessary subject to the willingness of schools to open classes.</p><p>  Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs , including those in Co.

The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement.  Consequently this condition is not imposed on suppliers or contractors and contract discussions are not held on this specific issue. </p><p>  It differs from the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis.  The Low Pay Commission was established to annually assess the appropriate level of the National Minimum Wage.  The national minimum hourly rate of pay increased on 1 January 2016 following Government acceptance of the Low Pay Commission recommendation of July 2015. </p><p>  Separately, wage rates and other conditions of employment are provided for in Employment Regulation Orders for the Contract Cleaning and Security sectors. </p></reply>

It is schools that employ teachers and not my Department.  However my Department has issued a number of Circulars addressing this issue in recent years. Circular 31/2011 details a cascade of measures for the recruitment of teachers, prioritising registered teachers over retired registered teachers and unregistered people.</p><p>  A retired teacher who returns to teaching on or after 1 February 2012 will commence at the first point of the incremental salary scale (i.e. the lowest point or starting salary for teachers). Incremental credit for service prior to 1 February 2012, qualification allowances and certain job role allowances are also not payable.  This measure represents a significant financial disincentive for teachers who retired at the top of their salary scale, often with a post of responsibility allowance, to return to teaching.</p></reply>

Through implementation of the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030, the aim is to develop the higher education system to equip people with the knowledge and skills necessary to live fulfilled and rewarding lives, and to meet the social and economic challenges facing Ireland.</p><p>  A core goal for the higher education system under the Systems Performance Framework 2014-2016 is to &quot;meet Ireland's human capital needs across the spectrum of skills by engaged institutions through a diverse mix of provision across the system and through both core funding and specifically targeted initiatives.&quot;</p><p>  The implementation of the System Performance Framework, Strategic Dialogue and agreement of compacts between the Higher Education Authority (HEA) and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) underpins a changed relationship between the State and the higher education system and provides for a new level of accountability for public funding against national objectives for the public funded higher education system.</p><p>  The first System Performance Report was published in June 2014 and the second Systems Performance Report is currently being drafted by the HEA and it is expected that it will be ready for publication later in 2016. </p><p>  In terms of future planning, following the publication of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education, the Oireachtas Committee will consider the issues involved as part of an effort to build a consensus on the future direction of higher education funding. In the meantime, I will be examining the potential for new funding models to ensure that we can deliver results in areas such as disadvantage, skills and research.</p><p>  In addition, we will be mapping out a multi-year vision for the future of this crucial sector which will see the development of a new Systems Performance Framework for Higher Education for the period to 2021.  I will be examining measurement instruments for key areas that will include increasing access for underrepresented groups, flexible and online learning, responsiveness to emerging skills needs, student retention, new apprenticeship models and a renewed focus on improving the quality of the student experience and learning outcomes.</p><p>  My hope is that this can be done in the context of a broad consensus among political and other stakeholders on the priorities for and future funding of higher education.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making recommendations for support, which are set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014 and are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</p><p>  All schools were asked to apply for SNA support for the 2016/17 school year by 29 February 2016.  The NCSE also continues to accept applications after that date, in recognition that enrolments may not have been completed or where assessments were not completed. </p><p>  I announced on 14 June, 2016 that 860 additional Special Needs Assistants will be available for allocation to schools from September 2016, which is a 7% increase on the existing availability.</p><p>This will bring the total number of Special Needs Assistants to 12,900 at a total gross annual cost of &euro;425 million.  This increase reflects the growing participation of children with Special Needs in education and will support their full participation and progression within the educational system. </p><p>  The NCSE advised all schools of their allocations for SNA support for the coming 2016/17 school year on 14 June, 2016.  Details of the allocations which have been made to schools have now been published on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  It should be noted that SNA allocations are not made to individual children, but are made to schools to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs in the school.</p><p>  Where a school wishes to appeal the SNA allocation which has been made to them, they may do so through the NCSE appeal process, details of which are set out at www.ncse.ie.  The option to invoke the NCSE appeals process is open to the school/parent in question, but to no appeal has been received by the NCSE up to June 2016.</p><p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, while Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available the NCSE website.</p></reply>

As noted by An Taoiseach during COP 21 in Paris in late 2015, Ireland will continue our current level of support, which from 2016 to 2020 will ensure &euro;175 million in public funding, mainly for climate adaptation actions.</p>  <p>  The Green Climate Fund was established in 2010 by 194 country parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.  It aims to support a paradigm shift in the global response to climate change, by allocating its resources to low-emission and climate-resilient projects and programmes in developing countries.  The Fund pays particular attention to the needs of societies that are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, in particular Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDS), and African States. It is also designed as an operating entity of the Convention&rsquo;s financial mechanism.</p>  <p>  Ireland has signalled during COP 21 that it will make an initial contribution of &euro;2 million to the Green Climate Fund during 2016 and work on engaging with the Fund is currently underway in terms of completing this process but also in term of building up support over the coming years.</p></reply>

These powers of inspection and enforcement are separate and distinct from the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014 and in particular the Building Control Regulations 1997-2015 which put in place the administrative arrangements by which owners, designers and builders are required to demonstrate their approach to achieving compliance with the Building Regulations.</p><p>In tandem with the commencement of the , the online Building Control Management System (BCMS) was developed to provide a common platform for the clear and consistent administration of building control matters across the local authority sector.  Its purpose is to facilitate building control authorities, building owners, builders and construction professionals in discharging their separate responsibilities under the Building Control Acts.  Oversight of construction activity by local building control authorities has now improved immeasurably with the availability and ready access to detailed data on projects via the online BCMS.</p><p>In addition, A Framework for Building Control Authorities has been adopted by the City and County Management Association in order to standardise work practices, systems, procedures and decision-making in relation to the oversight of building control activity across the local authority sector, to enhance consistency of approach nationally, and to move towards a risk-based approach to inspections by building control authorities.  Standardised inspection templates have also been developed under this process.</p><p>These key reforms to the building control framework represent a reasonable and appropriate response to the many building failures that occurred in the past.  This will lead to improved quality within the construction sector now and into the future.  Nevertheless, my Department will continue to work closely with local authorities, industry stakeholders and members of the public generally to ensure that all concerned understand their obligations under the Building Regulations.</p></reply>

In August 2012, following a public consultation process, new solid fuel regulations were introduced with the aim of ensuring that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of certain residential solid fuels.  The ban now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide, including all towns like Letterkenny with a population greater than 15,000 people, which brings   the ban areas broadly into line with national EPA air quality management zones.</p>  <p>  The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels.  As well as bringing air quality levels into compliance with EU standards, the ban has also had the effect of significantly improving human health in the country. Research indicates   that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.</p>  <p>  Given the significant health impacts, it is not proposed to relax the ban in any areas where it applies.  The stated policy objective is to extend the benefits of the smoky coal ban nationwide, to eliminate discrepancies in the levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for citizens in different locations.</p>  <p>  This process necessarily involves discussion and consultation with a wide number of stakeholders, including with the European Commission, relevant Departments and agencies of Government, the residential fuel industry as well as the general public.  Preliminary discussions on issues that may arise in connection with the proposed nationwide ban have already taken place with some of these stakeholders. It is proposed to launch a public consultation on the national Clean Air Strategy in the near future .   </p></reply>

The Plan is available at the website <font color="#0000FF">.</font>The Plan is divided into five pillars, with each targeting a specific area of the housing system for attention.  Pillar 4 of the Plan, entitled <i>Improve the Rental Sector</i>, commits to developing a comprehensive strategy for the rental sector in Q4 2016. The strategy will be structured around 4 key areas: security, standards, supply and services. One of the specific measures that will fall to be considered under the heading of security is the scope for a move to indefinite leases, replacing the Part 4 four-year tenancy, perhaps with incentives for landlords to waive their right to terminate a tenancy in the event of the sale of the property.</p><p>In addition, the Plan commits to the introduction of a new affordable rental scheme to enhance the capacity of the private rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  The objective of this scheme will be to provide long -term affordable accommodation for low to moderate income key-worker households in urban areas of high demand and provide an economic incentive to increase supply of rental accommodation.  The actions under Pillar 4 also include a commitment to examine standards, costs and feasibility of Build-to-Rent on a large scale, and commission research on ways in which further investment might be encouraged.</p><p>The overarching objective of the strategy will be to increase supply and support the development of a stable, strong and viable rental sector offering true choice for households, investment opportunities for providers and reflecting the rights and responsibilities of tenants and landlords.</p></reply>

Ongoing changes in these numbers would be expected in the context of the management of large volumes of social housing stock.  Further information on precise levels of stock at any one time is available directly from both authorities.  Since commencing the current programme of funding in 2014, to support local authorities in returning vacant social housing units to productive use , my Department has provided &euro;11 million combined to Cork City Council and Cork County Council, to support over 850 vacant homes to be returned to use.  The programme for 2016 will see an additional 220 units remediated across the two Cork authorities at an expected cost of some &euro; 5.5 million.  Further vacant units may arise for remediation over the course of the year from the two authorities and my Department will liaise with both authorities on the further provision of funding.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s funding to local authorities under this programme is on the basis that all remediated social housing units are tenanted straightaway, with priority in allocation given to homeless families to the fullest extent possible.  Furthermore, this funding from my Department is on top of the normal pre-letting works undertaken by local authorities themselves on vacant units.  Many other vacated social units are repaired as part of the normal maintenance work that local authorities carry out continuously on their housing stock, funded from their own resources.</p>  <p>  The strong level of funding provided by my Department and the work undertaken by the local authorities in tackling the backlog of vacant units that had accumulated has resulted in individual local authorities reporting a reduced rate of vacancy of 1-2% of their overall stock.  Between the funding supports available from my Department and the efforts of local authorities themselves, I am satisfied that both local authorities in Cork are in a position to ensure that all social housing units for which there is a housing need can be returned to use.</p>  <p>  More broadly in relation to dealing with vacant social housing stock, the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, sets out commitments in line with best asset management practices, which will see all local authorities operating to a national re-letting performance standard and making greater use of a preventative maintenance approach to housing stock management.   </p></reply>

My Department currently supports a programme of large-scale regeneration projects in Dublin, Cork and Limerick and smaller projects in Tralee, Sligo and Dundalk.  The 2016 allocation for existing commitments on regeneration projects is &euro;50 million.</p><p>A regeneration project by its nature is complex, taking time to develop. It moves through a number of phases including the initial master-planning stage, demolition works, enabling works, refurbishment and/or consolidation works and construction.  Therefore it can take some time before the impact of that work becomes visible such as the delivery of improved homes and living conditions, and improvements in the quality of life in the regenerated area.  In Ballymun, for example, some 2,000 social housing units were provided over the years of that project through a mixture of construction, acquisitions and refurbishment of void/derelict units.</p><p>The regeneration project at Limerick has been in operation for over eight years, with a cumulative investment to date of some &euro;258 million.  2016 will see significant building works, including the major advancement of a contract for 82 new social housing units.  The regeneration project at Cork City will see work advanced on a further 23 new homes commenced in 2016.  Regeneration works consisting of major refurbishment and renewal in Dundalk and Sligo are ongoing, while Tralee regeneration is largely complete.  In the Dublin City area, two new large regeneration projects, Dolphin House and St. Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens, are expected to move onto the construction of new units in 2016.</p><p>While regeneration funding provided by my Department is primarily focused on the physical build programme, funding is also provided for social regeneration activities that help to maintain and develop communities during the physical regeneration process.  The wider impacts of regeneration works, such as increased commercial activity within a regenerated area, can be influenced by a range of factors beyond the remit of a regeneration project, such as prevailing economic conditions, investment by businesses in the area, the local authority development plan and the relevant local authority&rsquo;s local economic and community plan.  Many of the regeneration projects have their own Regeneration Boards, made up of relevant stakeholders, including residents representatives, local authority representatives and State agencies.  Through the shared expertise and multi-agency representation on these boards, they bring a focus to the broader elements of regeneration, including economic and social dimensions, and seek to develop a whole of community approach to the programme.</p><p>Limerick as the largest ongoing regeneration project, is monitored on an annual basis.  One year on from the formal adoption of the Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan, a Monitoring Report has been prepared on the activities relating to Housing and the Physical Environment for the period 2014-2015 and is available at:</p><p>A monitoring report for the period 2015-2016 is currently being finalised. ​</p><p>Limerick City and County Council have also finalised a separate Monitoring Report for the Social Intervention Fund 2012-2014 under the Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan and, I understand, will have it available for public viewing in September 2016. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Regeneration Programme is a priority from a social policy perspective, encompassing social housing improvements as well as social/community and economic renewal of communities.  It reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to an urban regeneration programme that empowers people to work together to improve their communities and the quality of life for all who live within them. </p></reply>

The Government recently increased the rent limits under HAP, allowing for a greater level of assistance from the State from 1 July 2016.  The capacity of local authorities to make discretionary enhanced payments has also been extended to all authorities operating HAP.  These new measures mean that maximum rent limits will increase in every part of Ireland, with the increase reflecting the pressures on rental properties in each particular location.</p>  <p>  The Dublin Region Homelessness Pilot of HAP has been operational since February 2015 across the four housing authorities in the Dublin Region, i.e. Dublin City Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council, and is being implemented through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE).  The focus of the Pilot is to transition qualified households from emergency accommodation into private rented tenancies.  To date almost 350 tenancies have been secured for homeless households through the Pilot.  The operation of the Pilot is kept under review on an on-going basis and I have no plans at present to extend it outside of the Dublin Region.</p>  <p>  Financial support in respect of accommodation needs is also available through the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Rent Supplement scheme which currently supports approximately 57,000 recipients at a cost of &euro;267 million in 2016.  At this time of constrained supply, the Department of Social Protection takes a flexible, case-by-case approach where rents exceed limits; this ensures that people at risk of homelessness or loss of their tenancy are supported under Rent Supplement where increased rental payments are required, and almost 9, 000 households have been supported through this approach.   </p></reply>

Arrangements to carry out the 2016 summary, which will provide updated figures of national housing need later this year, are well advanced.</p>  <p>  The aim of the 2016 Summary of Social Housing Assessments is to capture the total number of households nationally which are qualified for social housing support and whose housing need is not being met.  A household is deemed to qualify for social housing support where it demonstrates its eligibility and need for such support in accordance with the qualification criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the Social Housing Assessment Regulations made thereunder.</p>  <p>  Information sessions for Local Authorities were hosted by my Department on 30 June and 6 July 2016.  Detailed guidance has been prepared by the Housing Agency and provided to all authorities to support the Social Housing Assessment 2016.  The Summary process requires housing authorities to review qualified households who are not currently in receipt of housing support to ensure that they still qualify and still require support, and to ensure that the detail of the applicant households is up to date and accurate.</p>  <p>  As part of this assessment , all Local Authorities have been asked to write to relevant households, including those in transitional and shared or emergency accommodation if relevant, informing them of the assessment and seeking updated information where necessary.  Any household that has been assessed or reviewed since 21 September 2015 does not need to submit updated details under this assessment unless there has been a recent change in the household circumstances.  In the event of non-reply by an applicant, authorities are advised to contact them again and to use all reasonable means of communication available to them in contacting applicants.  Authorities have also been advised to undertake local advertising campaigns informing applicants about the Assessment. </p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme and applies to all existing local authority houses, other than those classes of houses excluded under legislation.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having been in receipt of social housing support for a minimum period of one year and having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum.</p><p>The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the Scheme is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Directions issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, housing authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions and maintenance payments.  The reckonable income can also include certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.</p><p>In determining reckonable income, the income of the tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants can be included, as can the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner / co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them. </p><p>In order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, it is essential that an applicant&rsquo;s income is of a long-term and sustainable nature.  This is necessary to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p><p>The provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, are designed to enable the development of mixed tenure sustainable communities. Part V units are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme to ensure that units delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time. The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration.</p><p>The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  In order to participate in the scheme, the tenant must, in the first instance, meet the eligibility criteria as set out in the relevant legislation.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination of, own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan.</p><p>In line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>and reaffirmed in <i>Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness,</i>published this week, I intend to undertake a review of the 2016 scheme following its first 12 months of operation.

My Department will provide a contribution of &euro;850,000 under the capital programme towards the overall cost of the proposed development, which is estimated at &euro;3.5 million.

Accordingly, while the development of Virginia library may progress at the discretion of Cavan County Council, Department funding for the proposal will be available for drawdown from 2021.  The project will also be subject to a four-stage approval process, which will be dictated largely by Cavan County Council&rsquo;s readiness to proceed through the various stages.  Stage one of the approval process , the initial project capital appraisal, commenced recently and I expect the outcome of the appraisal will be notified by my Department to Cavan County Council in the near future.   </p></reply>

Over the period of the Plan, 47,000 homes will be delivered under the various social housing programmes, together with an expansion of the Housing Assistance Payment scheme nationwide.  This delivery will be achieved through collaboration between local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the National Treasury Management Agency and the private sector.</p><p>Previous to this week's launch of the new Action Plan, social housing targets and funding allocations had issued under the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>to all local authorities in April of last year.  Over &euro;1.5 billion in funding allocations was announced to support all local authorities to deliver social housing via a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes out to 2017.  Those allocations and associated targets for each local authority, including Carlow and Kilkenny, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p><i>www.environ.ie/housing/social-housing/minsters-kelly-coffey-announce-eu15-billion-social-housing-targets-local</i>.</p><p>Following this notification of targets, announcements in respect of a substantial new set of social housing projects were made in May 2015, in July 2015 and in January 2016.  Between these three announcements, almost &euro;680 million has been allocated for over 3,900 social housing new builds, turnkey developments and acquisitions.  Details of these project approvals, including those for Kilkenny and Carlow, are available on my Department's website at the following links: </p><p><i>www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/Housing/News/MainBody,41340,en.htm</i></p><p><i>www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/Housing/News/MainBody,42225,en.htm</i></p><p><i>www.environ.ie/housing/social-housing/ministers-kelly-coffey-announce-further-1000-social-housing-units</i>.</p><p>I am keen that local authorities advance these projects as soon as possible and have assured them that funding is available to fully support their efforts in this regard.  In 2015, Carlow County Council delivered six new social houses through construction, while Kilkenny County Council delivered one.  In 2015 and to end-June 2016, an amount of &euro;776,000 was expended on social housing construction by the local authority in Carlow and the equivalent figure for Kilkenny was &euro;1,764,623.  As per the project approvals set out at the links above, I anticipate a notable ramping up in terms of both construction spend and delivery over the next year and the measures set out in <i>Rebuilding Ireland, an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>, including the establishment of a new Housing Delivery Office within my Department, will have a direct benefit in that regard.</p><p>While social housing construction projects are being advanced, acquisitions of new and second-hand houses and apartments remains an effective means of meeting immediate social housing need.  In 2015, Kilkenny and Carlow County Councils secured the purchase of 37 and 19 new social housing units, respectively.  Some of these acquisitions, as well as some of the approved construction projects, were under the Capital Assistance Scheme whereby Approved Housing Bodies deliver social housing for those with specific needs such as elderly people, persons with intellectual or physical disability and homeless persons.</p></reply>

That ruling was in response to a reference by the High Court seeking clarification of the interpretation of European law emanating from EU Directive 2008/94EC on the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.</p>  <p>  The ECJ ruling has implications for any defined benefit pension scheme where, on the date of the wind up, both the scheme and the employer are insolvent (double insolvency) and where the date of wind-up was after the date of the ECJ ruling in the UK Robins case of 25 January 2007.  Legislative changes were made to the Social Welfare and Pensions Act in 2013 and 2014 amending the Pensions Act 1990 to address the issue of double insolvencies.</p>  <p>  With reference to the detailed pension scheme, it along with a number of other schemes have applied to the Pensions Authority for certification as an eligible scheme as outlined in legislation.

BPP is a unique scheme in that it is the only social welfare payment which has been introduced to cater for a specific disability.  The estimated level of expenditure in 2016 is &euro;14 million. </p><p>There are currently some 1,280 recipients on the scheme.  Data in respect of the number of recipients over the period 2000 to 2013 are set out in the table and show that the number of individuals in receipt of the BPP has been steadily declining.  Data in respect of 2014 and 2015 are not available due to technical reasons.<table><tr><th>Year </th><th>BPP Recipients</th></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>2,229</td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>2,125</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>2,095</td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>2,061</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>2,027</td></tr><tr><td>2005 </td><td>1,985 </td></tr><tr><td>2006 </td><td>1,476 </td></tr><tr><td>2007 </td><td>1,474 </td></tr><tr><td>2008 </td><td>1,472 </td></tr><tr><td>2009 </td><td>1,467 </td></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td>1,485 </td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>1,496 </td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>1,456 </td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>1,385 </td></tr></table></p><p>It is the practice of the Department to encourage those applying for BPP to ascertain first of all whether they would be better off availing of disability allowance (DA) rather than BPP as the structure of the DA scheme is generally more beneficial to claimants.  In particular the assessment of capital is treated differently in the two schemes: under the means test for DA, the first &euro;50,000 of capital is disregarded while for BPP only the first &euro;20,000 of capital is disregarded. </p><p>As to secondary benefits, recipients of both DA and BPP carry an entitlement to a free travel pass and they may be entitled to additional benefits such as the fuel allowance, household benefits package, medical card and supplementary welfare allowance, depending on whether they satisfy the eligibility criteria for these schemes.  Both BPP and DA recipients who live alone are eligible for the living alone allowance.</p><p>While there have been a number of proposals over the years to phase out the BPP and merge it with DA, most recently in a value for money review of the DA scheme published in 2010, there are currently no plans to end the BPP scheme and have it replaced by DA. </p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. </p>  <p>  To qualify for a state pension (contributory) a person must have at least 520 paid reckonable contributions and satisfy a yearly average condition (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is required for a full rate State pension (contributory), and reduced rates of payment may be payable for pensioners with lower averages).  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. </p>  <p>  PRSI credited contributions (&ldquo;credits&rdquo;) are an integral part of the social insurance system.  For the most part they are linked to having an underlying entitlement to a social welfare payment while temporarily detached from the labour force or having entitlement to statutory leave, e.g., parental or maternity leave.  The primary purpose of PRSI credits is to secure social welfare benefits and pensions of employees by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI such as during periods of unemployment or illness for example.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for credits, a person must first have entered insurable employment &ndash; he or she must have paid at least one PRSI contribution as an employed contributor and, unless deemed to be exempted, must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  Subsequently, insured workers may be awarded credits if they claim a social welfare payment because they are out of work, or they are ill or incapacitated, or if they are engaged in certain training or education courses.  When a person does not qualify for a payment, they may sign-on for credits provided they qualify for the award of credits. </p>  <p>  If at any stage in their working life, a person has no PRSI paid or credited contributions for two full tax years, they cannot be awarded credits again until they return to work and pay PRSI contributions for at least 26 weeks.  The rationale for this measure centres on the general principle that there should be a reasonable link between entitlement to benefit and a recent participation in the (active) labour force. </p>  <p>  In 2013 new provisions were announced for older persons who left work before reaching the State pension age of 66 and who wished to claim a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  Ordinarily, people in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment must engage with the Department&rsquo;s activation process and can face penalty rates if they refuse to engage with Department offers of training or education.  These criteria were eased for people aged 62 and over in light of their contribution to society.  They can still avail voluntarily of an array of supports, which are available from the Department if they wish to return to work, training or education.  However, penalty rates are not applied to this cohort should they decide they do not wish to engage with the activation process.</p>  <p>  Entitlement to State pension (contributory) is based upon reckonable contributions paid and/or credited over a working life.  Periods of retirement before State pension age, where a person was not genuinely seeking work, and where they have not been awarded credits, may result in lower such entitlements, compared to the outcome had they reckonable contributions paid or credited during that period.  There are no special arrangements to make State pension qualification easier for public sector employees who retired early, and in many cases they would have paid a reduced rate of PRSI, which is not reckonable for State pension purposes, in recognition of Public Service pension entitlements they may alternatively build up as a result of that employment.  My Department does not have responsibility for Public Service pensions, and any queries regarding the adequacy of such pensions, including for those who have retired early, should be directed to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  Where people cannot qualify for a State pension (contributory) in their own right as they have paid few or no reckonable contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age, if they have an income need.  Notably, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.  However, if someone has a substantial income, such as that from a public service pension, they may not satisfy the means test for payment under that pension.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household and is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance as part of the household benefits package to approximately 419,000 customers, at an estimated cost of &euro;228 million in 2016.  </p><p>For a person on a qualifying payment, the household composition that may allow them to receive fuel allowance would be either they live alone, or only with:</p><p>i. a qualified spouse/civil partner/cohabitant or qualified child(ren);</p><p>ii. a person in receipt of a qualifying payment who would be entitled to the allowance in their own right.</p><p>iii. a person who is receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit in respect of providing full-time care and attention to the fuel allowance applicant or their qualified spouse/civil partner/cohabitant or qualified child(ren).</p><p>iv. a person receiving short-term jobseeker's allowance or basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (i.e., less than 391 days).</p><p>People who are in receipt of a qualifying contributory payment must also satisfy a means test.<i></i>Fuel allowance is not paid if a person&rsquo;s heating needs are provided for in full as part of their accommodation. </p><p>Any decision to change the qualifying conditions for fuel allowance would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Currently, there are no circumstances under which a person&rsquo;s term on T&uacute;s can be extended. </p>  <p>  The T&uacute;s budget for 2016 allows for 8,000 participants.  Extending the period of participation beyond one year for current participants would reduce the overall number of placements available to other people who are long-term unemployed.  The existing 12-month placement period for participants on T&uacute;s is adequate to meet the objectives of the initiative whilst also ensuring that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from it.  </p>  <p>  T&uacute;s was introduced as a direct response to the growth in the level of unemployment during the financial crisis.  With the ongoing welcome reductions in the live register, a review of work schemes, including T&uacute;s, is necessary.  This will ensure that the number and nature of schemes, as well as the conditions governing participation on these schemes, continues to be appropriate.

The means test takes into account assets and income (including earnings).  In the case of a couple, account is taken of the means of both members of the couple and this reflects the fact that married couples, civil partners and cohabitants are financially interdependent on each other.  The income of other members of the household is not taken into account.</p>  <p>  However, where a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claimant is under 25 years of age, the value of the benefit and privilege derived from living with a parent or step-parent is assessed for means testing purposes.  In practice, benefit and privilege is taken to mean the value of board and lodging to applicants residing in the home of parents and the value of same is assessed by reference to a formula (with a wide range of income disregards).  The purpose of the assessment is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants who have this benefit and those who have not, and between people living in relatively better-off households and those whose circumstances are less well off.  It should be noted that the income of other household members is not taken into account in this assessment (for instance, brothers and sisters).</p></reply>

It provides valuable resourcing for service delivery undertaken by not-for-profit companies and co-operatives in communities around the country.  There are some 3,000 people in full and part-time posts which are supported in employment by the programme across approximately 400 not-for-profit companies.  Funding of just over &euro;45m has been provided for the programme in 2016 which will maintain the current level of activity.</p>  <p>  Service providers must operate community or social enterprises that deliver tangible services and are capable of generating non-public revenues from their operations by way of charging fees, sales and/or fundraising.  The programme is not intended to represent full funding for any operation.</p>  <p>  Given the level of resources available and the number of companies currently supported, the Department has been unable to make an open call for new proposals to the programme for a number of years.  However, from time to time as resources allow, the Department does process new applications received from organisations that have expressed an interest in and are considered eligible under the programme.</p>  <p>  This group recently met with the Department to discuss an expression of interest in relation to funding for Dun Na S&iacute; Amenity and Heritage Park under the CSP.  The review of all current expressions of interest is almost completed an outcome is expected in August.  Further information will be available when this process is completed and a decision has been reached.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

For instance, Tourism Ireland and InterTradeIreland are playing a continuing and central role in our economic recovery, with Tourism Ireland driving record tourism numbers to this island and InterTradeIreland building vital exporting capacity among our small and medium enterprises, the mainstay of the all-island economy.  In addition, Waterways Ireland is managing our 1000km of shared waterways, so important for our regional economy and tourism sectors, especially across the border region.</p><p>Proposals to establish additional North South Bodies have not been discussed at the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings I have attended, and of course, under the terms of the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement, any such proposals would require the agreement of the Northern Ireland Executive and the Oireachtas before decisions on them could be made by the NSMC.</p><p>At the North South Ministerial Council meetings that I have attended, the focus of Ministers has been on discussing the sectoral priorities for additional co-operation which they have identified in their respective areas of responsibility, particularly as regards assisting economic recovery, job creation, the best use of public funds and the most effective delivery of services for citizens across the island.  There have already been considerable advances in some of the priority areas they have identified and I look forward to this continuing.</p><p>The North South Bodies are testament to the benefit of working together for mutual benefit.  As stated in our <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>, we will continue to advance North South cooperation, particularly through cross-border bodies and the North South Ministerial Council and harness the potential of the Stormont House Agreement to develop new areas of cooperation.</p><p>At the NSMC Plenary Meeting on 4 July, we discussed the implications of the EU Referendum outcome for Northern Ireland and for relations between North and South.  These discussions included the role of the NSMC and North South Bodies.  In the light of the Referendum result it will be important that the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government continue to fully support the work of the Bodies.  In our contingency plan to deal with the possibility of the UK leaving the EU, one of the key actions is to monitor the short term impacts on enterprise and trade in border counties.

This matches the allocation for 2015.</p><p>The closing date for applications for the 2016 round was 24 February 2016 and applications from over 230 organisations were received.  Recommendations for funding have recently been approved and work is currently underway to contact all applicant organisations to inform them of awards of funding.  While it is not possible to give an exact figure at this point, due mainly to currency fluctuations, it is expected that the overall level of funding provided this year will be similar to previous years.</p><p>In the majority of cases the organisations to be funded will have previously received ESP funding.

In line with these policies Ireland is actively engaged in the strengthening of international standards aimed at addressing gender inequality and promoting women&rsquo;s empowerment at the United Nations and other regional organisations.</p><p>Our participation in discussions at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) and the Third Committee of the General Assembly enable us to influence and express our support for resolutions on such issues including: the elimination of discrimination against women; violence against women; female genital mutilation; the right to education by every girl; and strengthening efforts to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage.  We also raise our concerns regarding the situation of women in specific countries through our interventions at the HRC&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review where the human rights records of individual states are reviewed by other UN Member States.</p><p>Ireland has also played an important part in supporting UN bodies specifically aimed at addressing gender equality and played a key role in the establishment of UN Women.  During the 60th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) in March 2016, Ireland supported side events on: prostitution and the role of men and youth in mobilising its abolition; preventative approaches to Gender Based Violence; the UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women; and on Women, Peace and Security, as part of our longstanding advocacy on this issue.  Our election to serve on the CSW from 2017 to 2021 provides an opportunity to enhance our contribution to the promotion of gender equality.</p><p>Discrimination against women is a central driver of extreme poverty and food insecurity and addressing this is an integral part of our international development policy.  The OCED has commended Ireland for having, <i>&ldquo;consistently played an important agenda-setting role on gender equality and women's empowerment&rdquo;</i>and ensuring that gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment are a significant objective of our bilateral overseas development assistance.  Both bilaterally and at the UN, we consistently emphasise the importance of gender mainstreaming as a key aspect of ending poverty, hunger and discrimination.  During the 30th session of the UN Human Rights Council in September 2015 Ireland addressed the issue of gender and mainstreaming and called for the full and equal participation of women at all decision-making levels in UN bodies.</p><p>At the annual full-day discussion on the human rights of women at the 32nd session of the Council in June 2016, Ireland&rsquo;s statement focused on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, highlighting the importance of implementation of the Agenda to ensure that the poorest and most vulnerable women and girls are not left behind.</p><p>Ireland supports EU engagement to promote and protect women&rsquo;s human rights as part of its external actions.  In June 2016, the EU Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) adopted the report on the implementation of the EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy (2015-2019) which outlines the actions taken by the EU to promote the human rights of women in 2015.  These include the adoption of a Gender Action Plan (2016-2020) and the policy for Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality (2016 &ndash; 2019) as well as a commitment to provide &euro;100 million over the next seven years to support gender equality and women's and girls' empowerment projects.</p></reply>

Ireland will, for the first time, serve as a member of the Commission from 2017 to 2021.  Our membership of the Commission provides an opportunity for Ireland to further enhance our commitment to the promotion of gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment.</p><p>This commitment is set out in our statement of foreign policy, &lsquo;<i>The Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World</i>&rsquo; and is also a central objective of &lsquo;<i>One World, One Future: Ireland&rsquo;s Policy for International Development&rsquo;.  </i>It is implemented through the mainstreaming of gender equality across our foreign policy, including our policy for international development, as well as providing direct support to programmes aimed at achieving women&rsquo;s empowerment.</p><p>The negotiations on the 2030 Agenda, which Ireland had the honour of co-facilitating, have resulted in a broad consensus across the entire UN membership on the critical importance of empowering women and girls for sustainable development.  Ireland&rsquo;s work towards the empowerment of women and girls in conflict-resolution and peace-building is pursued through our second National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security, launched in January 2015, which implements United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325.  We have also played a key role in the establishment of UN Women, the UN body to promote gender equality.  Through our engagement at the UN General Assembly and Human Rights Council, Ireland also works to promote gender equality, to combat all forms of discrimination against women and prevent gender-based violence.</p><p>As a member of the Commission on the Status of Women, Ireland will continue to strengthen our international engagement in support of gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment.  We have pledged to work to strengthen the voice and functioning of the Commission, support its contribution to the wider 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and promote the participation of civil society in its work.  We will also continue to support and contribute to the EU&rsquo;s engagement at the Commission.</p></reply>

At the International Gaza Reconstruction Conference, held in Cairo in October 2014, donors pledged USD3.5 billion to support recovery efforts in Gaza in the aftermath of the conflict.</p>  <p>  The World Bank is taking the lead on monitoring pledges made at the Conference and its most recent report of 19 April 2016 indicates that USD1.409 billion has been disbursed, which represents 40% of the funding pledged.  I am aware that the current rate of disbursement is less than expected, contributing to a pace of reconstruction much slower than needed.  According to the report, only 9% of totally damaged houses and 45% of partially damaged houses have so far been rebuilt, and 14,800 families continue to be displaced.  While recent indications are that residential reconstruction is picking up momentum, the amount of construction material imported into Gaza continues to be lower than needed.</p>  <p>  As an immediate response to the Gaza crisis, Ireland provided &euro;500,000 in July 2014 to the Emergency Appeal of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) to help provide urgently needed food, shelter and medical aid to thousands of families many of whom had to flee their homes.</p>  <p>  At the International Gaza Reconstruction Conference, I pledged a further &euro;2.5 million towards urgent immediate needs and long term recovery efforts.  &euro;2 million of this has been provided to UNRWA&rsquo;s Gaza Emergency Appeal.  During my visit to the Middle East last month, I met with UNRWA&rsquo;s Deputy Commissioner General, Sandra Mitchell, who provided me with a detailed briefing on the very significant progress made in rebuilding UNRWA&rsquo;s educational and medical facilities.  I was pleased to announce at that time, a further &euro;500,000 for UNRWA&rsquo;s response in Gaza.  This fulfils our pledge of &euro;2.5 million made at the International Gaza Reconstruction Conference in 2014 and brings our total support to the Gaza crisis to &euro;3 million.</p>  <p>  Ireland has met its pledge in full in the timeframe specified and I would urge all countries to fulfil their pledges.  It should be recalled, of course, that many of the pledges made, like Ireland&rsquo;s, were to be phased over a period of time.  Many States also made clear that their willingness to donate was linked to progress in discussions to ensure that this type of conflict did not happen again.  Unfortunately there has been little progress in this regard.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to press, at EU level and elsewhere, to maintain focus on the humanitarian needs in Gaza and for an end to the continuing blockade.</p></reply>

Whatever shape new trade arrangements emerging from a UK exit from the European Union might take, the deep-rooted and longstanding economic relationship between Ireland and the UK will undoubtedly remain important to us.  At the same time, it is important to recognise that Ireland has long been working to deepen its market penetration and market diversification, a strategy that can only continue to reap significant dividends in terms of safeguarding our long-term economic prosperity.</p><p>For example, while growing in volume terms, the percentage of exports to the UK as a percentage of total global exports has declined over the period 2005 to 2015; the majority of Irish services and merchandise exports are, in fact, to the European and US markets.  This trend is consistent with the ambition outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Enterprise 2025 Strategy, setting as a target a 50% increase in exports to non-UK markets.</p><p>While we must and will continue to cultivate these more traditional markets, the Government recognises that ongoing and indeed intensified market diversification is crucial for Ireland&rsquo;s long term economic resilience.</p><p>Currently, Local Market Teams are chaired by the relevant Ambassador in our twenty-seven priority markets.  They comprise the representatives of the Embassy and relevant State agencies.  These teams submit annual market plans as well as six-monthly reports of activity.  In the course of a 2014 review of the Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy, seven additional high-potential and exploratory markets were identified to increase our engagement with high-growth markets in Asia, Latin America and Africa.</p><p>Guided by this, new Embassies have been opened in Bangkok (Thailand), Jakarta (Indonesia), Nairobi (Kenya) and Zagreb (Croatia) as well as Consulates-General in Hong Kong (China), Austin (Texas, USA) and Sao Paulo (Brazil).  The opening of these new Embassies and Consulates strengthens Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to take advantage of emerging market opportunities.</p><p>In January this year, I launched an Economic Diplomacy Strategy that seeks to build on the consolidation of the Department&rsquo;s trade role in recent years by establishing a network of locally hired Commercial Attach&eacute;s to extend the range and impact of our Embassies&rsquo; activities in support of trade.  Our Embassies in Mexico, Brasilia, Buenos Aires, Bucharest, and Jakarta have all provided a firm and immediate basis for the appointment of a locally hired, term-limited, Commercial Attach&eacute; and it is proposed to appoint such officers to these locations in the coming months.  In addition, provision is already made for the appointment of an Economic Development Officer (EDO) in Abuja, funded from the Irish Aid budget, whose role would be analogous to that of a Commercial Attach&eacute;. There is potential to make similar appointments in other locations.</p><p>Within the context of our already very successful Local Market Teams, this initiative will equip Embassies with the resources and autonomy to become active and open business hubs for Ireland&rsquo;s exporters, thereby strengthening the work of promoting Irish business undertaken by the State agencies and their networks overseas.</p><p>Through our Mission network, the Department will also be supporting Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s international trade mission schedule for the rest of 2016, to include trade missions to Northern Europe, USA, China, India and other high-growth markets.  With regard to the UK Referendum in particular, IDA Ireland is liaising directly with its 1200+ client companies and potential investors in order to work with them on the implications of the result in order to identify new opportunities for Ireland in certain sectors, many of which already form part of the IDA&rsquo;s marketing strategy.</p><p>Building on impressive growth in the agri-food sector, our Mission network also supports the opening of new markets for Irish food and food products, which is of critical importance and plays a key role in helping to achieve the sustainable growth targets set out in the Food Wise 2025 industry development strategy.  This strategy includes overall growth projections for the agri-food sector for the next decade, including an increase in exports of 85% to &euro;19 billion by 2025.  Exports in this sector in 2014 amounted to &euro;10.45 billion.  Non-EU markets accounted for 28% of total Irish agri-food exports that year, with significant potential for further growth.  These new markets, with growing middle class populations and increasing levels of disposable income, will provide significant growth opportunities for Ireland&rsquo;s agri-food and drinks sectors in the coming years.</p><p>All of these efforts by our Embassies and Local Market Teams abroad will be guided by the Export Trade Council, which I chair, and the associated parent Departments, including Trade Division within my Department.  In the period leading up to the Referendum, I consulted with the Export Trade Council on a number of occasions and convened a further meeting only yesterday, at which Government Ministers, State agency heads and private sector representatives with proven business expertise had a productive discussion of the strategy and tactics outlined above, reaffirming market diversification as a key mitigating factor in alleviating Ireland&rsquo;s exposure to economic uncertainty.</p><p>Furthermore, it has been decided that the formulation of a new successor policy to the Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy will be accelerated.  <i>&ldquo;Trading Better&rdquo;</i>will set out a coherent medium term plan to enhance and improve how we support Irish exports and investment.</p></reply>

The OPW therefore has no responsibility for maintenance, nor any authority to carry out any works there.</p>  <p>  Local flooding issues are, in the first instance, a matter for each local authority to investigate and address, and they may carry out flood alleviation works from their own resources.  Local Authorities may also apply to the Office of Public Works (OPW) for funding of flood mitigation works under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor works to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  The scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame.  Any application received will be considered in accordance with the scheme eligibility criteria, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management.  Details are published on the OPW website www.opw.ie.</p>  <p>  The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding, is the OPW's Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  300 locations nationwide are being assessed under the Programme.  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans.</p>  <p>  In relation to the River Erne system, Cavan Town; and in relation to the Dromore River system, Ballybay are Areas of Further Assessment (AFA) being assessed as part of the North Western-Neagh Bann CFRAM Study, one of six study areas.</p>  <p>  The draft flood mapping is now being finalised, work on the development of preliminary options to address flood risk is significantly advanced leading to the development of integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific measures that can address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified.  The OPW works in close co-operation with the Rivers Agency of Northern Ireland on the North Western-Neagh Bann CFRAM Study.</p>  <p>  A public consultation day was held in Cavan Town on the draft flood mapping on 19th February, 2015 and a further event was held on 17th February, 2016 on the preliminary options.</p>  <p>  A Public Consultation Day was held in Ballybay on the draft flood mapping on 18th February, 2015 and a further event was held on 15th February, 2016 in relation to the preliminary options.</p>  <p>  In addition, a national statutory public consultation on draft flood maps concluded on 23rd December, 2015.</p>  <p>  The draft Plans are being made available for Statutory Public Consultation on a rolling basis from Friday 15th July, 2016.  The draft Plans for the North Western-Neagh Bann River Basin District will be available in the second phase of the roll out, scheduled to commence in August 2016.

Any necessary works to address flooding caused by pluvial or inadequate surface water drainage systems are the responsibility of the local authority.  The local authority is responsible also for the ongoing maintenance of certain watercourses within Drainage Districts in the county.</p>  <p>  The OPW carries out its own programme of Arterial Drainage Maintenance to a total of 11,500km of river channel and approximately 730km of embankments nationally.  These maintenance works relate to arterial drainage schemes completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945, whose purpose was primarily to improve the drainage of agricultural lands.  The OPW has a statutory duty to maintain the completed schemes in proper repair and in an effective condition.  The annual maintenance programme typically involves some clearance of vegetation and removal of silt build-up on an average five-yearly cycle.</p>  <p>  The planned OPW maintenance programme in Co Cavan in 2016 includes work on some 18km on the Inny scheme, approximately 7km on the Boyne scheme and 3km of the Glyde and Dee scheme.</p>  <p>  The planned OPW maintenance programme in Co Monaghan in 2016 includes work on approximately 65km of the Monaghan Blackwater Arterial Drainage Scheme and some 35km of the Glyde and Dee scheme.</p></reply>

It is expected to hold a formal, statutory Public Exhibition later this year, when statutory consultees, affected landowners and the public will have an opportunity to comment on the proposed scheme.  Following this, work on the detailed design will be progressed with the aim of enabling the Office of Public Works (OPW) to submit the Scheme for Ministerial Confirmation under the Arterial Drainage Acts as early as possible in 2017.</p>  <p>  Subject to Confirmation of the Scheme by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the OPW will aim to appoint a civil works contractor and commence construction within a short period thereafter.  Due to the likely scale and complexity of the proposed Scheme, it is likely that the Scheme will be undertaken on a phased basis under a number of contracts.  The design consultants have commenced work on a Phasing Report which will assist a structured implementation of the Scheme.  This will be a very significant scheme with commensurate costs estimated at &euro;60-&euro;80m, though this figure is to be finalised at construction stage, and it is anticipated that the works will take at least 4-5 years to complete.</p>  <p>  Both the OPW and Cork City Council are anxious that works would commence at the earliest possible date and investigations are underway to see if some advance works at Morrisons Island could be undertaken by the City Council under its own powers.  Should this prove feasible, then funding would be provided to the Council by OPW to enable it to progress such works in early 2017.  This work, once complete, will significantly reduce the frequency of tidal flooding in Cork City.</p>  <p>  Detailed design and confirmation of the remaining phases of the scheme will follow on after Public Exhibition and it is likely to take approximately 12 to 18 months to complete these phases.  It is envisaged that the subsequent construction phases of the scheme will follow on immediately.</p>  <p>  &euro;1.795million has been spent on the Lower Lee project to date on fees, surveys etc.</p>  <p>  As the outline design for Blackpool has been completed, it has been decided to separate this and make it a scheme in its own right.  The proposals for Blackpool were on display during the Public Exhibition period late last year and it is hoped to complete the detailed design of the Scheme and proceed to the tender process for a civil works contractor before the end of the year.  The Scheme will also be sent for Confirmation to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform at the same time and subject to no issues arising, a contractor could be appointed in quarter two 2017.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to the provision of a flood relief scheme for the people of Cork City and the OPW has made provision for the cost of implementing both schemes in its Multi Annual Budget Profiles over the period 2016-2021.</p></reply>

The Group is reviewing whole-of-Government policies to support the OPW Flood Risk Management Plans, and is due to report to me with its recommendations shortly.  As part of the Group&rsquo;s work, the Department of Finance has been carrying out research in the area of flood insurance including an analysis of the different approaches to flood insurance taken in other countries.</p>  <p>  I will bring the Group&rsquo;s report to Government for its consideration as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works (OPW) has no role or function in relation to the oversight or regulation of insurance matters.  The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks. </p>  <p>  In March 2014, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Insurance Ireland (II), the representative body for the insurance industry in Ireland, and the Office of Public Works (OPW).  This Memorandum sets out principles of how the two organisations will work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on completed OPW flood defence schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.  II members have committed to take into account all information provided by OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas.</p>  <p>  The Memorandum came into effect on 1 June, 2014 with an initial tranche of data provided by the OPW to II in respect of 12 completed flood defence schemes and showing the design, extent and nature of the protection offered by these works.  A further tranche of data was provided to II in January 2015 covering a further 4 completed flood defence schemes.  OPW will continue to provide data to II as flood defence schemes are completed. </p>  <p>  The OPW has also shared its programme of capital works with II.</p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland estimates that flood cover is included as standard in 98% of household insurance policies throughout the country.  II has carried out a number of surveys among its members to ascertain the extent to which flood insurance cover is available in the areas for which OPW has provided data on completed flood defence schemes.  The results of the most recent survey were provided in January of this year; they indicate that 83% of property insurance policies in these areas include cover against flood risk.  Where the defences are permanent in nature the percentage is 89%; where demountable defences are used the percentage is 78%.</p>  <p>  II has pointed out that the effective operation of demountable flood defences requires accurate forecasting systems and methods, flood alert systems and monitoring, efficient mobilisation of equipment, manpower and materials and the timely and correct operation of the demountable defences.  It has identified a number of specific risks associated with the operation of demountable defences and has stated that, should a failure occur in the deployment of demountable flood defences, the financial impact for insurers would most likely be very significant.  Because of this potential exposure, insurers have limited risk appetite for providing flood insurance in areas protected by demountable defences.</p>  <p>  I met recently with Insurance Ireland to stress the need for flood victims to have the best possible chances to be able to obtain insurance cover at reasonable cost.  I highlighted that OPW schemes using demountable defences are built to the required standard and to provide robust levels of flood protection to properties.  I welcome a commitment given to me by II to assess the risk from the deployment protocols, warning systems and emergency response systems in place.  II and OPW will begin work to share information on the performance and deployment procedures of these defences.</p></reply>

The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual's basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement and cannot be imposed on suppliers or contractors. </p>  <p>  It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis.  This Government established the Low Pay Commission to annually assess the appropriate level of the National Minimum Wage.  The commission's second report on the national minimum wage was submitted to Government on 19 July 2016 and the recommendation was made by the Commission that the hourly rate for an experienced adult worker be increased by 10 cents will be considered by Government in the context of Budget 2017.</p>  <p>  Statutory minimum rates of pay may also be supplemented by social transfers such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement or health, education or housing assistance payments where the need arises and to reflect family circumstances.</p></reply>

On foot of the meeting, my Department expressed an interest in acquiring the lands in question in early May.</p>  <p>  NAMA responded by indicating that its Board had recommended that NAMA engage, where feasible, with other State bodies, where that body has expressed an interest in acquiring a property for a purpose specifically linked to its statutory function.  NAMA further indicated that an independent market valuation should be sought and that there are occasion where an open marketing exercise may be required.</p>  <p>  Between May 2014 and September 2015 there was intermittent contact with NAMA by officials from my Department.  Discussions in August and September 2015 related to the valuation of the land in question.</p>  <p>  I understand there have been recent media reports regarding the proposed sale by NAMA of 4,900 acres at Glenasmole, incorporating part of the area popularly known as &lsquo;the Featherbeds&rsquo;.  I also understand a separate commercial property management firm is handling the sale and has advertised the property for sale by private treaty.</p>  <p>  The majority of the land in question is designated as a Special Area of Conversation (SAC) and Special Protection Area (SPA).  Given its proximity to Wicklow Mountains National Park and its importance for nature conservation as an SAC and SPA, it is clear that it would make an important addition to the National Park.  However, given the scare resources available for capital investment in our National Parks and Nature Reserves, I am mindful of the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of the Parks and Reserves.</p></reply>

In the context of expanding bed capacity, the HSE is endeavouring to address staff recruitment or retention difficulties in certain Child and Adolescent facilities, such as the Eist Linn unit in Cork.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p><p>Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held.  In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. </p><p>The nursing home loan (Ancillary State Support) is an optional benefit of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, the purpose of which is to ensure that a person does not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long-term nursing home care.  Where a person&rsquo;s assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on such assets (7.5% of the value of such assets per annum) may be deferred.  The loan can be repaid at any time but will ultimately fall due for repayment upon the applicant&rsquo;s death.  Repayment of the loan is made to the Revenue Commissioners.  </p><p>Where the loan becomes repayable on the applicant's death, the repayment of the loan amount based on the principal residence <i>only</i>can be further deferred or postponed in certain cases.  This is known as 'further deferral'.  Its purpose is to ensure that certain individuals, for whom the asset is their principal residence, will not need to sell or re-mortgage the asset in order to repay the nursing home loan.  Instead, such individuals can defer repayment of the loan for the duration of their lifetime.  </p><p>Section 20 of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009 details the persons who may qualify for a further deferral.  These are as follows:</p><p>- The spouse or partner of the applicant, where the asset concerned is their principal residence; and</p><p>- A connected person who meets the qualifying conditions set out below.</p><p>A connected person is: </p><p>- A child of the person in receipt of Nursing Home Loan (or the spouse/partner&rsquo;s child) if they are under the age of 21 years or if their assets do not exceed the asset disregard; </p><p>- A sibling if their assets do not exceed the asset disregard;</p><p>- A relative in receipt of a disability or similar allowance, blind person&rsquo;s pension, or the State pension (non-contributory), or whose income does not exceed the State pension (contributory); </p><p>- A relative who is in receipt of a foreign pension or allowance similar to those outlined in (c) above; </p><p>- A relative who owns a building to which the principal residence is attached (e.g. &ldquo;a granny flat), or </p><p>- Any person who cared for an applicant prior to the latter entering the nursing home (this is defined by reference to relevant social welfare payments).</p><p>The connected person must also satisfy the following three conditions: </p><p>- The asset in question must be their only residence; and </p><p>- They must have lived there for not less than 3 years preceding the original application for the Nursing Home Loan; and </p><p>- They must not have an interest in any other property.</p><p>Once the criteria are met in respect of the application for further deferral, the repayment of monies to Revenue will be deferred until that person sells the principal residence or passes away (whichever event occurs first) provided that the applicant continues to meet the criteria listed above.</p><p>Only one further deferral can be granted in respect of Ancillary State Support and any person(s) who have an interest in the principal residence must provide their consent to the further deferral.</p><p>In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, a grandchild would be able to make an application for further deferral <b>once the grandchild meets the criteria listed above</b>.  If the Deputy would like to further enquire about a specific case, the local Nursing Homes Support Office will be able to provide further information.

In 2015 the United Nations Children's Funds (UNICEF) estimated a worldwide shortage of 65 million doses of BCG.  The vaccine has not been available in Ireland since the end of April 2015.  Consequently, BCG vaccination clinics in HSE Clinics and Maternity hospitals have been postponed until new stock arrives.</p>  <p>  There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland.  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG vaccine to ascertain when the vaccine might be available.  The HSE has also asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which licenses and regulates all human medicines in Ireland, to source an alternate supplier of the BCG vaccine.  Efforts have been made to find a company who can provide the vaccine for use in Ireland which satisfies all the HPRA requirements on safety and efficacy.  To date no suitable alternative BCG product has been found.  Therefore the HSE has been unable to procure the BCG vaccine from any other source and still awaits the product from the HPRA licensed supplier of the vaccine. </p>  <p>  The supplier has indicated that supplies of the vaccine are not expected to be delivered into Ireland until early 2017.  When the HSE receives the vaccine, they will arrange appointments for vaccination clinics ensuring that those at high risk are offered vaccination first.</p></reply>

Every year there are 3.2m outpatient attendances at our hospitals.  100,000 patients have an elective inpatient procedure and 800,000 have a planned day case procedure.  Up to the end of May 2016, there has been an increase of over 19,000 scheduled inpatient / daycase procedures, in comparison to the same period in 2015. </p><p>The key issue for patients is how long they have to wait.  It is important to note that approximately 60% of patients wait less than 6 months for their required outpatient appointment or inpatient/daycase procedure.  The HSE seeks to ensure that those whose clinical needs are most urgent are prioritised accordingly, while managing the needs of those who have been waiting longest for routine treatment in chronological order. </p><p>The Minister for Health met with the HSE National Director for Acute Hospitals on Friday, 15 July, regarding proposed measures to tackle waiting lists.  The Minister for Health requested that the HSE prepare an action plan, setting out specific measures that the HSE will implement, in conjunction with hospitals, between now and the end of 2016 in order to tackle waiting lists.  </p><p>This Government recognises that a sustained commitment to improving waiting times is required, with a particular focus on those waiting longest. Consequently, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to &euro;15m funding to the NTPF to address waiting lists in 2017, as part of the Programme&rsquo;s commitment to a continued investment of &euro;50m per year to reduce waiting lists.  This commitment seeks to utilise the expertise of the NTPF to further assist the HSE in addressing specific waiting list pressures.  The Department will engage with the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the HSE to deliver on this commitment.  As outlined in the Programme, this initiative will commence in 2017 and focus on those patients waiting longest. </p><p>With regard to access to cross border healthcare, the EU Directive 2011/24/EU on Patients&rsquo; Rights in Cross Border Healthcare aims to ensure EU citizens may access safe and good quality healthcare services across EU borders.  The Directive establishes a framework for cross border healthcare between EU/EEA states to facilitate patients to access care in another Member State in accordance with their entitlements in their own country.  Under the Directive, known as the Cross Border Healthcare Directive (CBD), insured patients are entitled to have the costs of cross-border healthcare services reimbursed if the healthcare service in question is among the benefits to which they are entitled in their Member State of affiliation.  As such, it allows Irish residents to avail of healthcare in other EU or EEA (excluding Switzerland) Member States that they would be entitled to within the public health system in Ireland, which is not contrary to Irish legislation. </p><p>Public patients may access the healthcare they require in either the public or private healthcare system of the country abroad under CBD.  Access to healthcare abroad is based on patients following public patient pathways - i.e. patients must demonstrate they have followed the equivalent public patient pathways that a patient would follow if accessing public healthcare in Ireland.  Referral for care under the CBD may be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other HSE clinicians.  The CBD excludes certain health services, e.g. services of public health, long term care, organ transplantation, etc.  All persons on public waiting lists, other than for such exempt health services, are eligible for the Scheme.</p><p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) operates the CBD in Ireland.  The HSE, through the National Contact Point (NCP) office, provides information for patients on the Cross-Border Directive on its website - <i></i>- and also by phone.  The principal function of the NCP is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements. </p><p>Potential users of the CBD Scheme should note that reimbursement will be at the cost of the treatment availed of abroad or the cost of providing the healthcare in Ireland whichever is the lesser.  The NCP is able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State.  The HSE also advises where a patient is in any doubt as to the need to seek prior authorisation before availing of a consultation or treatment abroad to contact the NCP.  The NCP is happy at that stage to advise patients of the reimbursement rate that will apply to the assessment/treatment being accessed. </p><p>The HSE endeavours to reimburse the cost of treatment incurred or the cost of providing such healthcare in the State, whichever is the lesser, to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of a claim for reimbursement, in line with Prompt Payment Legislation.</p><p>The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the right to healthcare, if any, that they may have through the European legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (EU Regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them.</p></reply>

In Ireland one in four children is currently either overweight or obese.  Overweight and obesity are conditions which develop over a number of years and obesity tends to track into adulthood.  Overweight and obesity are not just about the shape or size of the individual.  These conditions are associated strongly with chronic diseases such as Type II Diabetes, certain cancers, chronic heart and circulation diseases, musculoskeletal problems and mental health problems.  The causes, risk factors and determinants of overweight and obesity are multiple and it is not simply over eating or/and lack of exercise.  These risk factors include access and availability of affordable healthy food, safe exercise and leisure activity and facilities, cultural and social norms, education and skills, genetic and biological factors as well as individual lifestyle choices.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has finalised &lsquo;A Healthy Weight for Ireland - Obesity Policy and Action Plan, 2016-2025&rsquo; which sets an ambitious but realistic target of reversing the current trends of childhood overweight and obesity.  The principles of the Policy are based on the Healthy Ireland Framework.  It takes a whole of Government and a whole of society approach where every sector is making a valuable contribution to prevent and reduce the current levels.  It is based on best available evidence and benefited greatly from an extensive process of consultation with children and young people.  The Policy will be launched later in the year.</p></reply>

The complaint relates to the inability of Ms Mellet, who was carrying an unborn child with Edwards Syndrome (a fatal foetal abnormality), to access a termination of pregnancy within this jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently studying the findings of the  Committee and considering what measures should be taken.  We are also consulting with the Office of the Attorney General and with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as they act as the Agent for the Government before the United Nations Human Rights Committee.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that termination of pregnancy is regulated in Ireland by constitutional and statute law and in particular the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution (Article 40.3.3) which acknowledges and guarantees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable, to defend and vindicate that right, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother. </p>  <p>  I believe that the Government&rsquo;s commitment to develop a consensus approach on the Eight Amendment within a Citizen&rsquo;s Assembly is the way to move forward.  The issue of fatal foetal abnormalities can be examined as part of this process and I would expect the views of the UN Human Rights Committee will also be considered.  </p>  <p>  Aside from the constitutional issue of the Eight Amendment I am also considering within the law what other services and supports can be put in place to help women in these circumstances. </p></reply>

However, I would underline the importance which I attach to improving patient safety.  Related to that, it is widely acknowledged that a strong patient safety culture is linked to high patient safety incident reporting.  Increased incident reporting should lead to earlier identification of patterns and trends in clinical incidents in order to maximise learning as swiftly as possible in the health system. </p>  <p>  The National Incident Management System (NIMS) was established by the State Claims Agency.  The NIMS has the capacity to manage no harm incidents, near misses, dangerous occurrences and complaints as collectively defined by the World Health Organization.  All incidents in the healthcare sector including Serious Reportable Events (SREs) which are the most serious forms of error that cause harm to patients must be reported directly on to NIMS since June 2015. </p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill provides that public health service providers must notify serious patient incidents (reportable incidents) occurring in their services to the State Claims Agency and to HIQA or the Mental Health Commission, as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The Department has taken very seriously the critical challenges to the health services in relation to patient safety.  A number of crucial gaps in relation to patient safety leadership and patient safety culture at both policy and service delivery level were examined in 2015 and in direct response to this a set of far reaching and significant patient safety reforms were proposed in line with international best practice. </p>  <p>  In November 2015, the Government approved a major programme of patient safety reforms which included the establishment of a National Patient Safety Office (NPSO) in the Department of Health.  The establishment of the NPSO is to provide the Department with the capacity to take greater oversight of the system of patient safety to support the Minister&rsquo;s need for a direct and accountable implementation response to patient safety incidents, HIQA recommendations, National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) guidelines and escalation alerts to the State Claims Agency. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the NPSO will provide the required leadership and direction with regard to patient safety policy and legislation relevant to patient safety for the healthcare system.  It will develop the model for the new National Patient Advocacy Service.  Through surveillance of patient safety trends, production of patient safety and complaints profiles for specific patient, clinical and service cohorts, and, delivery of the national framework for clinical effectiveness it will identify, based on evidence, patient safety priorities and required patient safety initiatives. </p>  <p>  Appropriate management and reporting of patient safety incidents is a key aspect of overall policy and system requirements for a safe quality health system.  Patient safety incidents can have significant impacts on individual patients and as such are treated as a high priority by my Department. </p></reply>

The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  Currently, 2725 people live in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p>  <p>  The HSE has established a subgroup, under &lsquo;Transforming Lives&rsquo;, the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions.  I welcome the fact that the needs of people moving from congregated settings will be fully taken into account during this process as the model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan.</p>  <p>  In terms of housing, the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government are working in collaboration to support the transition of people with a disability from institutions to social housing in the community under the Government's National Housing Strategy for People with Disability 2011 to 2016.   </p>  <p>  The HSE's 2016 National Service Plan has set a target of 165 people to move from institutions in 2016 into suitable accommodation.  This is being supported by &euro;20 million in capital funding from the Department of Health in respect of acquiring and renovating properties in priority institutions identified by the HSE. </p>  <p>  In addition, I am pleased to note that the Department of the Environment is providing &euro;10 million under the Capital Assistance Scheme to provide suitable accommodation for people transitioning from institutions in 2016.  The HSE estimate that a further 100 people could benefit from this initiative.  &euro;1 million in ring-fenced leasing funding is also being made available by the Department of the Environment in 2016 to support people moving from institutions into suitable social housing in the community.  This demonstrates the joined up commitment of both Departments to support the de-congregation programme.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has developed a three strand approach to accelerate transitions from institutions in the period 2016-2021, with a target of 900 people to move to more suitable accommodation in this period. </p>  <p>  -  Strand 1- is focused on large institutional settings at high risk of not meeting HIQA Standards;</p>  <p>  -  Strand 2- is focused on moving people into suitable social housing in the community through the Department of Environment schemes; and </p>  <p>  -  Strand 3- is focused on remaining service users in congregated settings who could move to suitable accommodation.</p>  <p>  As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on "Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion", I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, the Deputy can contact my private office and they will follow the matter up with the HSE.</p></reply>

The strategy emphasises that most people with dementia live in their own communities and can continue to live well and to participate in those communities. </p><p>However, the Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme refers specifically to a set of actions which have been identified and are agreed with Atlantic Philanthropies and co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and the HSE.  </p><p>The Programme provides for:</p><p>-  The rollout of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Homecare Packages for people with dementia;</p><p>-  The provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, who are the critical and initial point of contact with the health system for those with dementia; and</p><p>-  Measures to raise public awareness, address stigma, and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia.</p><p>Progress to date on the implementation of these measures is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>PRIORITY AREA</th><th>UPDATE</th></tr><tr><td>Establish a Dementia Strategy Implementation Office</td><td>A National Dementia Strategy Implementation office has been established.

A suite of Key Performance Indicators to measure impact have been developed, and are ready to be used in the reporting and verification process. A standard operating procedure for home care packages including for those living with dementia have also been developed and are in use.  Work has begun on developing integrated working through consortia, in two initial sites (North Dublin and Cork).  The lead and key stakeholders have been identified, the first meeting has been held and objectives have been set.  To date 133 people living with dementia have benefitted, with 85 currently active.</td></tr><tr><td>Dementia Awareness Programme and Attitudes to dementia survey</td><td>HSE Health and Well-being and HSE Communications divisions have developed a nationwide support campaign.  This is aimed at people with dementia and their carers, working in collaboration with a range of partners. The campaign strategy entitled &ldquo;Dementia Friendly Ireland&rdquo; has established a steering committee, chaired by Professor Brian Lawlor.   This committee has completed a literature review, an attitudes survey and both qualitative and quantitative research including a sounding board event inclusive of People With Dementia and Carers. This research will inform the campaign which is envisaged as being launched in September 2016.</td></tr><tr><td>Education and training in dementia care for primary care teams and GP&rsquo;s</td><td>A research collaboration agreement has been signed between University College Cork and Primary Care Education, Pathways &amp;amp; Research of Dementia (PREPARED) project collaborators Dublin City University and Irish College of General Practitioners.

The Strategy recommends that services should be woman-centred and provide integrated, team-based care, with women seeing the most appropriate professional, based on their need.  A choice of care pathway will be provided and women will be helped to make an informed decision around their care pathway. </p>  <p>  A National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme is being established to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services by bringing together work that is currently undertaken across a number of HSE divisions.  The Programme will develop a detailed Strategy implementation plan and timetable.  Progress on the implementation of the Strategy will form part of the normal performance dialogue between the Department and the HSE and the Programme will submit an annual report to me which will be published.</p>  <p>  The Strategy will give rise to both capital and revenue costs over the ten years 2017-2026.  &euro;3 million development funding has been provided for maternity services in the 2016 Service Plan; this funding will be allocated in line with the Strategy and includes the establishment of the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme and maternity networks, appointment of additional staff, development of specialist bereavement teams and implementation of the Maternal and Newborn Clinical Management System.  It will be necessary for the Programme to examine the ongoing capital and revenue requirements at network and hospital level, and this work will inform the annual Estimates process.</p></reply>

These provide for the establishment of systems of identifiers for clients and for healthcare providers, both professionals and organisations.  They also allow for Individual Health Identifiers to be assigned to individuals and to establish the related governance structure.  Operational responsibility for the identifier system has been delegated to the HSE as provided for in the Act.  The data to establish the register is leveraging the work that is ongoing in supporting the Public Services Card initiative by the Department of Social Protection.  The register and supporting infrastructure has been designed and built and is currently being tested.  The next step is to populate the register with live data.  As the Health Identifiers Act is essentially a patient safety initiative to positively identify patients and clients it is important to ensure the validity of the data pertaining to each individual. It was anticipated that the register would have been in a full production environment by the end of Q2 2016 but there has been some slippage due to technical resource scheduling constraints and is now expected to be in place by end Q3 2016.</p></reply>

It is currently being provided to a cohort of patients involved in a piloting and feasibility study. </p>  <p>  The report of an implementation group established  by the HSE to determine the conditions to govern the wider availability of buprenorphine-naloxone recommends the phased increased access to the product for a cohort of patients in specific circumstances, subject to the required legislation being enacted to provide the product on the same statutory basis as methadone. </p>  <p>  If the provision of buprenorphine-naloxone is to be given the same statutory basis as methadone, in order to ensure its safe appropriate and cost-effective use, an amendment to the Misuse of Drugs (Supervision of Prescription and Supply of Methadone) regulations 1998 will be required.</p>  <p>  The Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill 2016 is currently making its way through the Houses of the Oireachtas and will allow for the revocation of the previously confirmed regulations.  It is hoped that this Bill can be enacted before the summer recess.  New regulations will then be required to allow legitimate users, such as patients with a prescription and healthcare professionals, to possess the newly controlled substances.  Work is underway on drafting these regulations as a matter of priority. </p>  <p>  Any regulations made in relation to buprenorphine-naloxone will be drafted subsequent to this legislative agenda and will then be subject to the 3-month EU notification under the EU Technical Standards Directive.</p>  <p>  The resource requirements for making buprenorphine-naloxone more widely available following the enactment of the required legislation will be examined in the context of the estimates process for 2017.</p></reply>

This important objective is again reflected in the agreed HSE Service Plan for this year.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made since 2008 when there were 247 such admissions to adult units, and this subsequently declined to 89 in 2014.  Last year, there was a slight increase to 95 such admissions, against a background of increasing demands overall on  the HSE Child and Adolescent Mental Health service.  It should be noted that the number of admissions for 2015 does not necessarily equate to the actual number of children admitted, as an individual child may be admitted on more than one occasion over any given year.  In 2015, there were a total of 356 Child and Adolescent Mental Health admissions, of which 261 (73%) were to age-appropriate units and 95 (27%) were to Adult Units.  In May 2016, 97.2% of bed days used were in Child and Adolescent Inpatient Units, which is an improvement on 95.4% for April.  Performance generally continues to be above the HSE Service Plan target figure of 95%, and indications also are that where a child has been admitted to an adult acute in-patient unit, the length of stay has been kept to a minimum. </p>  <p>  The current HSE Service Plan allows for a degree of operational flexibility regarding emergency placements in adult units.  This is particularly the case where very short-term placements take place, and where full account is taken of all other relevant factors such as the preferences of all those involved, or geographical considerations relating to access or visiting.  In such situations, the HSE closely monitors on a weekly basis all child admissions to adult units, with a view to minimising admissions as much as possible.</p>  <p>  The Government remains strongly committed to reducing, insofar as possible, the numbers involved in this issue, especially in light of the operational factors I have outlined.  I hold regular meeting with the HSE Mental Health Division to specifically review progress on this matter, and to see what further improvements can be realised.  I will be progressing this with the Executive over coming months, particularly in the context of opening additional Child and Adolescent Mental Health beds in Cork, thus increasing operational beds from the 66 at present to hopefully around 74 by year end.  Other key related issues that need to be progressed include enhancing community based care for young people as additional mental health staffing comes on-stream, together with ensuring that existing best practice at local level is standardised nationally.  I concur with the Deputy's concerns on this important issue, but I am satisfied that the HSE is working to absolutely minimise the number of children being placed short-term in adult mental health units, and that the Executive makes any special arrangements necessary in individual cases to protect and monitor these vulnerable young people.</p>  <p>  The Government will also shortly launch the Task Force on Youth Mental Health, which will focus on promoting positive mental health and resilience among young people.</p></reply>

Additional funding of &euro;1.042m was allocated under the 2015 Service Plan to increase capacity at OLCHC, and an additional orthopaedic surgeon, anaesthetist, and support staff, are now in place with recruitment of a further additional orthopaedic surgeon underway.  Capital funding was also provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further, and this is currently being commissioned.  The Children's Hospital Group is proactively working on nurse recruitment to support the opening of the new theatre. </p>  <p>  In order to address waiting times in the interim, 66 patients from Crumlin have been treated at other hospitals where capacity was available and where that was clinically appropriate.  These included Temple Street, Cappagh, Tallaght and the Blackrock Clinic.  External capacity was also been identified at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore in the UK.

The key component of this is a new fund of &euro;500 million, which is in turn comprised of two elements.  The first is a &euro;150 million voluntary EU-wide measure that will compensate farmers for reducing their milk output in the final quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. </p>  <p>  The second is a &euro;350 million fund that will be allocated to Member States in the form of national envelopes, which Member States can use in accordance with their domestic circumstances, but with specific conditions attached.  Details on the latter are still to be finalised, and my Department is engaging closely with the Commission and with other Member States with a view to agreeing these details as soon as possible.  Ireland&rsquo;s allocation from the fund will be &euro;11.09 million, and this can be topped-up by 100% with national funding. Member States will be required to notify the Commission by 1 November 2016 of the measures to be adopted.   </p>  <p>  Other measures in the July package include the extension of SMP intervention and private storage from September 2016 to February 2017 (and a commitment to avoid market destabilisation when releasing product), and the payment of advance payments of 70% for the basic payment scheme and 85% for RDP schemes from October 2016.  The Commissioner also undertook to consider a sector-specific income stabilisation tool as part of the forthcoming mid-term review of the 2014-2020 MFF.   </p>  <p>  This represents a considerable success from an Irish viewpoint.  Firstly, the threat of the available funding being entirely conditional on supply control has not materialised.  Secondly, there is considerable flexibility for Member States in using the 70% of the package that has been earmarked for national envelopes.  While there is still some work to do here, I am determined that the maximum possible flexibility will be achieved, in line with the arguments that I have been making strongly in recent months. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Commission has agreed to calls that I have consistently made recently for a high level of advance payments under Pillar and Pillar 2 schemes in 2016, which will provide a welcome cashflow boost for farmers.  I am also very pleased that it has chosen to extend the operation of SMP intervention and private storage from the end of September 2016 to the end of February 2017.  This is again in line with Ireland&rsquo;s views on the best approach, as we see intervention as the most effective and cost-efficient response to the current difficulties.  It is also important to note that the Commissioner undertook to avoid any market disturbance when the time comes to release stocks from storage.</p>  <p>  Other items discussed included proposals from the Commission to simplify the implementation of greening, an update on the current state of play in relation to international trade issues, and an outline of the work programme of the Slovak Presidency, which took over the reins of Council at the beginning of this month.</p></reply>

In addition to these value increases, the dairy industry targeted a 50% increase in milk production by 2020, to be progressed following the abolition of milk quotas in April last year. </p>  <p>  Progress on those targets were monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis.  The fourth annual report &ldquo;Milestones for Success 2014&rdquo;, published in September 2014, showed that the sector had achieved very significant progress on these targets and illustrated the manner in which the Food Harvest 2020 vision of &lsquo;smart, green, growth&rsquo; is being attained.  The latest data available show growth of 34% and 32% for primary production and exports, respectively, versus the baseline period.</p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025, the new ten year strategy for the agrifood sector published in July last year, is the successor to the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  Food Wise 2025 Strategy believes that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025: increasing the value of agrifood exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increasing value added in the sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion; and increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion.  With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agrifood sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development.   </p>  <p>  Last week I launched the first annual progress report of Food Wise 2025: Steps to Success 2016.  Food Wise: Steps to Success showed that, of the 330 detailed actions which were due to commence in 2015 or 2016, 28% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken and a further 67% have commenced and are progressing well.   </p>  <p>  I believe that this is a good start and I will press on to get as many actions as possible completed within the next year.</p></reply>

The BDGP builds on the large investment in data recording and genomics which have been made in recent years and will continue to drive further developments and improvements in this area.</p>  <p>  The BDGP has been agreed with the European Commission as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan (2014-2020) alongside a number of other schemes.  I am conscious of the positive effect that the programme will have on the Irish suckler herd.  It will help to improve productivity, profitability and carbon efficiency in the Irish suckler herd.  I firmly believe that the scheme will deliver long-term and cumulative positive effects for both suckler farmers participating in the scheme, and farmers who buy the progeny of suckler cows for further finishing. It is a significant contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of sustainable beef. </p>  <p>  In relation to any possible reopening of the scheme, this will have to be considered in the context of an assessment of budgetary priorities, the operation of the Rural Development Programme and the potential impact both upon the scheme itself and other schemes.</p></reply>

In general terms an eligible hectare is one that is used for an agricultural activity or, where the area is also used for a non-agricultural activity, is predominantly used for such activities.  An area is predominantly used for agricultural activity if that activity can be exercised without being significantly hampered by the intensity, nature, duration and timing of the non-agricultural activity.</p><p>While cases involving solar panels will be examined on an individual basis, the European Commission has advised that the area covered by the solar panels will be deemed ineligible for the purposes of claiming BPS.  Furthermore, in line with the Department&rsquo;s current approach on land eligibility, where the area of a parcel covered by solar panels is 70% or greater of the overall parcel, that parcel will be wholly ineligible.  If less than 70% is covered by solar panels and the agricultural activity is not hampered by the presence of the solar panels, the area not covered by solar panels may be eligible. </p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has informed me that before a final decision is taken on introducing a new support scheme - which may include support for solar PV - that Department will run a public consultation, which will give all interested parties an opportunity to participate in the development of the scheme.  Details of the next public consultation will be advertised on their website www.dcenr.gov.ie.  Before any such scheme could be introduced, it would have to secure Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission.</font></p></reply>

Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agrifood sector in particular.</p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agrifood exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region. This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.</p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025, I intend to lead a Trade Mission that will visit Vietnam, Singapore and China in early September.  My Department is currently working with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland to finalise the arrangements for this mission, which will include participants from across the agrifood sector and will feature extensive trade contacts as well as political discussions with my counterparts in the host countries. </p>  <p>  I am also considering a range of other destinations for later in 2016 and for 2017, although no decision has yet been made in terms of content or timing.</p></reply>

It is subject to a requirement to secure access to the required radio spectrum by way of licence.  The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of ComReg under the Communications Regulation Act, 2002 as amended, and accordingly I have no function in this matter.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the independent role of ComReg, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the establishment of a mobile phone and broadband Taskforce which will consider immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.  I am in discussion with my colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in this regard and arrangements are being made to put this in place as a matter of priority.  Discussions have also taken place with mobile operators and with ComReg in relation to the issues impacting on mobile phone coverage and possible measures which could be considered to address deficiencies. These can be considered in the context of the work of the Taskforce. </p>  <p>  Licences issued by ComReg apply terms and conditions on Mobile Network Operators, such as quality of service and minimum population coverage obligations.  Responsibility for both monitoring compliance and addressing non-compliance with such obligations rests with ComReg.  The design of the individual networks is a matter for the operator concerned, although operators tend to exceed their minimum coverage requirements for commercial reasons.  </p>  <p>  The provision of services to all customers can be affected by several factors given that mobile telephone services are a radio based technology and therefore services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets, the capacity of the network and proximity to mobile telephone antennas.</p>  <p>  Any customer, including those in Cavan and Monaghan, who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance.  If this fails to resolve matters, customers can refer a complaint to ComReg, who will investigate the service provider&rsquo;s compliance with its contractual obligations.  </p>  <p>  My Department also understands that two mobile operators are in the process of upgrading their networks in the Monaghan and Cavan area. Further significant investment, particularly in 4G technology, is planned throughout 2016.  Upgrades to mobile networks can cause temporary disruptions to coverage, as new equipment is installed and commissioned.  The positive outcome of such disruption is, however, a deployment of an improved service.</p>  <p>  Local Authorities also have an important role to play in terms of facilitating the siting of necessary infrastructure such as masts and antennae.  The Telecoms and Internet Federation, part of IBEC, has been proactive in seeking to meet with Local Authorities and public representatives to fully discuss the various issues around mobile coverage and the factors that can impact on the quality of service consumers&rsquo; experience.  I would encourage all Local Authorities and public representatives to engage with the Telecoms and Internet Federation on these important issues.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>broadband.gov.ie</i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area, which is the subject of procurement.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services and includes Bailieborough in the townland of Tanderagee, County Cavan.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered. </p><p>The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention and includes Canningstown in the Townland of Tullylorcan, County Cavan.</p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including Cavan.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.  The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to <i>broadband@dcenr.gov.ie.</i></p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus for the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ( 'PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum. On 5<sup></sup>July 2016, I announced that my Department has also identified a further 170,000 premises which are currently marked BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map and which are unlikely to get access to services.  My Department is currently in the process of identifying these additional premises with a view to including them in the formal procurement process. </p><p>The Department has now moved to the next stage in the procurement process.  In this Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase, the Department are now commencing the formal dialogue process with three qualifying bidders.  The qualifying bidders will shortly be furnished with a draft contract, with detailed specifications for a quality and affordable high speed broadband network. </p><p>Following the ITPD stage, which will take a number of months, the Department will issue final tender documentation to bidders.  When final tenders have been submitted a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s).  The current schedule envisages contract(s) award in June 2017. </p><p>The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of bidders short-listed and the complexities that may be encountered during the dialogue process.  It must be noted that bidders will need several months to prepare their draft bids and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at these stages of the process.</p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and / or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country. </p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the rollout of the broadband network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of county or regional broadband action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

The White Paper on Energy policy published in December 2015 also includes a commitment to introduce a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme designed to encourage the development of Ireland's abundant, diverse and indigenous renewable energy resources, including solar photovoltaic technology.</p><p>It is widely recognised that solar photo voltaic technology has become more cost competitive for electricity generation over the last few years, not only compared with other renewables such as wind energy but also compared with conventional forms of generation.  With these significant changes in the cost of the technology, the deployment of solar photovoltaic technology in Ireland has only recently become a potential cost-effective option to increase energy security, contribute to our renewable energy targets, and support economic growth and jobs.  It is also recognised, however, that while the cost competitiveness of solar photovoltaic technology has improved, it would still require a subsidy in order to be developed on a commercial basis.</p><p>In-depth economic analysis is currently underway to inform the cost of a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme.  While no decision has been taken on the precise renewable technologies to be supported - and the appropriate level of tariffs remain under consideration - the cost and technical viability of a range of renewable technologies,  including solar photovoltaic technology, are being assessed.</p><p>Designing and implementing a new scheme is a complex task and it is expected that the broad details of the new scheme will be available early next year.  Before these details are announced, my Department will run a second public consultation, which will give all interested parties an opportunity to input into the design of the new scheme.  Details of the consultation will be posted on my Department's website <i>www.dcenr.ie</i>.  Ultimately, the introduction of any new scheme will be subject to Government approval and State aid clearance by the European Commission.</p></reply>

The scheme is a key action under the business strand of the Government&rsquo;s National Digital Strategy, and is specifically designed to support small and micro enterprises to trade online.</p><p>The scheme is administered in partnership with Enterprise Ireland and the 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEO) nationwide.  It offers financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500, subject to match funding, coupled with training, mentoring and networking supports to help small businesses to develop their online trading capability.  Small businesses, with 10 or fewer employees and less than &euro;2m in revenue, that have little or no capacity to trade online, are eligible to apply.  </p><p>Over 2,200 businesses have, to date, successfully applied for a trading online voucher and the rollout of vouchers continues nationwide.  Trading Online Vouchers are activating small businesses and sole traders from across a wide range of sectors including, retail, manufacturing, professional services, food as well as arts, crafts and design.  The financial and performance details relating to the scheme are summarised in the following table.</p><p>Prospective applicants attend a half day information seminar delivered by their respective LEOs, and receive training in connection with ecommerce and guidance in relation to the scheme.  To date, almost 5,000 business owners-managers have benefitted from advice and peer-to-peer support through their participation in these information seminars. </p><p>Applications are received directly by individual LEOs who award vouchers to qualifying businesses on a competitive basis, following evaluation by an expert panel.  Successful applicants are expected to complete their trading online project within 4 to 6 months, subsequent to which grants can be drawdown, following standard verification procedures.</p><p>On 31 May last, I published the second report into the scheme&rsquo;s enterprise impacts based on research conducted with over 600 voucher recipients, along with research by Indecon into the size and shape of Ireland&rsquo;s digital economy.  These reports, which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at<i>dcenr.ie </i>highlight the critical importance of digital to economic growth and prosperity in Ireland. </p><p>Findings from this year&rsquo;s enterprise impacts report reveal that businesses that moved online experienced an average increase in sales of 21%, and customer enquiries increased by 84%.  Businesses that are growing expect to recruit on average 1.4 more employees, and 3 out of 5 began to export for the first time.  Online sales did not displace existing sales for 73% of businesses and 89% expect the trading online component of their business to become more important in the next six months.  It is particularly noteworthy that both urban and rural based businesses benefit equally from the online opportunity.  Overall, trading online is contributing to sustainable regional economic development throughout Ireland. </p><p>The Government is committed to rolling out the scheme to more interested businesses, and building on the success of the Trading Online Voucher Scheme to put Ireland further ahead of our European counterparts in realising the benefits of selling goods and services.<table><tr><th>-</th><th>Pilot (2013-14)</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016 to date</th></tr><tr><td>Funding Allocation </td><td>&euro;0.01m</td><td>&euro;5m</td><td>&euro;3.7m</td><td>&euro;3m</td></tr><tr><td>Actual Expenditure </td><td>&euro;0.01m</td><td>&euro;0.65m</td><td>&euro;1.87m</td><td>&euro;1.19m</td></tr><tr><td>Vouchers Approved</td><td>50</td><td>491</td><td>1,280</td><td>480 </td></tr><tr><td>Vouchers Redeemed</td><td>34</td><td>68</td><td>970</td><td>294  </td></tr></table></p></reply>

This Scheme provides funding for private roads and laneways, the maintenance and improvement of which is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant landowner.  The level of ring-fenced funding provided by the Department in 2011 was &euro;5 million.  While the LIS does not have a ring-fenced allocation in 2016, local authorities may use a proportion of State grant funding (15% of the Discretionary Grant) for LIS should they wish to do so.  In addtion Councils can also provide monies from their own resources towards LIS.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government provides that, as the economy recovers, the Government will promote increased funding for Local Improvement Schemes, on an annual basis.  A major objective for the new Government will be to prioritise new investment in local and regional road maintenance and improvements, and LIS funding will be promoted in that context.</p></reply>

The funding allocations for public transport under the Capital Plan will see us reach <i>&quot;steady state&quot; </i>funding levels by 2020. </p><p>In addition, some capital works are being undertaken in the GDA that will greatly enhance the capacity of the public transport system in our capital when complete.  These include Luas Cross City which is on schedule to open at the end of 2017, the Phoenix Park Tunnel which I expect to open for services later this year, the City Centre Re-signalling project, and investment in the bus fleet and bus priority measures. </p><p>Funding is also provided in the later years of the Capital Plan for the new Metro North Project that will enable construction of the link to commence in 2021 with a view to delivery by 2026/2027.</p><p>The DART Underground project remains a key element of integrated transport for the GDA and implementation of the overall DART Expansion programme is proposed in the NTA's <i>Transport Strategy for the GDA 2016-2035</i>.  The Capital Plan provides funding for redesign and planning for the revised lower cost DART Underground.  It also funds other elements of the overall DART Expansion Programme including electrification of the Northern line to extend the DART to Balbriggan.</p><p>Obviously, I would like to see some of these projects progressed sooner but funding remains fairly constrained.  If additional funding becomes available in the next few years, although there will be many competing demands, I will be making a strong case for additional investment in public transport to support economic growth, social needs, and contribute to our climate mitigation targets.</p></reply>

CSO figures for the period January to May 2016 show further strong performance from the GB market with growth in visit numbers of over 15.7%, when compared with the same period of 2015.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland, the agency responsible for marketing the island of Ireland as a visitor destination in overseas markets, has an extensive marketing programme in place for the second half of 2016 which is underway in 23 markets including Great Britain.  Tourism Ireland is closely monitoring the situation following the UK referendum, and is meeting regularly with tourism industry representatives to plan ahead in this new market environment.</p>  <p>  In the longer term, the Programme for Government commits to implementing the policy objectives in the Tourism Policy Statement "People, Place and Policy &ndash; Growing Tourism to 2025" and achieving the targets for Irish tourism contained therein.  The UK vote does not change this. </p>  <p>  While the GB market contributed 41% of overseas visits in 2015, the share of overseas visitor revenue from British visitors is approximately 23%.  There is a commitment in the Tourism Policy Statement to prioritising tourism marketing efforts towards those markets providing higher revenue returns.  One of the actions in the Tourism Action Plan 2016-2018 is to develop a new strategy to increase visitor numbers and revenue from new and developing markets.  The terms of reference for this review are being finalised at present.</p>  <p>  There are no changes to how people can travel between Ireland and the UK in the short term and I am confident that Ireland's strong tourism offering will ensure that the Great Britain market will continue to be an important source of overseas visits to Ireland in the short, medium and long term.</p>  <p>  While I have not yet met with the Ministers with responsibility for tourism in the UK Government or the Scottish Government, I did meet with the Northern Ireland Minister for the Economy, Simon Hamilton MLA, at the 22nd Plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council on 4 July.  It was agreed at the meeting that a full audit will be undertaken in all sectors of North South cooperation, including tourism, to identify the possible impacts, risks, opportunities and contingencies arising in the phases preceding and following the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.</p></reply>

Encouragingly, F&aacute;ilte Ireland research shows a very significant improvement since 2010 in overseas visitors' perception of value for money in Ireland.  However, we must be constantly aware of our visitors' disapproving views of value for money in the years leading up to 2010.  We cannot become complacent about the improvement of more recent years and we must be constantly vigilant to maintain these ratings otherwise we will seriously endanger the health of the tourism sector. </p>  <p>  If the sector does not strive to remain competitive and offer value to the visitor, it will not only risk losing the gains it has made but also make it very difficult for Government to continue to support tourism the way it has, when so many other sectors also seek support. </p>  <p>  I am well aware of the capacity constraints that exist in Dublin and of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's analysis which shows that there are already approximately 5,500 rooms in development for delivery over the coming years.  The delivery of this stock of rooms will be essential to alleviate the pressure on supply of rooms in the city.  This will, of course, be subject to the individual investment decisions by hotel owners and developers and I intend to do all that I can to assist in that delivery.</p></reply>

Since August 2007, it has been standard practice for a Garda Forensic Collision Team to close a road following a fatal or serious injury collision, and to undertake a detailed investigation in respect of all relevant matters in relation to the collision and the location.  Form LA16 is then completed and factual information pertaining to such collisions is recorded including establishing if there are road factors which may have contributed to the collision, and which need to be remedied.  Where appropriate, a file is forwarded by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  These LA16 Forms are also then sent to the National Roads Authority (NRA) which analyses and decides whether any remedies may be necessary to address such factors.  If relevant the NRA then indicates to the relevant Local Authority what remedial actions are needed.    The Action 94 feasibility study is not being released at this time until the deliberative process in relation to the matter is fully completed, including what other measures may assist in delivering its road safety objectives.</p></reply>

In addition, the Strategy indicates that the public transport needs on the Swords/Airport to City Centre corridor may require a higher level of public transport capacity than the existing provision, both in advance of the delivery of new Metro North which is scheduled for operation in 2026/2027 and also to serve areas south of the M50 subsequent to the implementation of new Metro North.  The NTA indicates that this additional capacity may take the form of a BRT service or a BRT type service.  Any final arrangement will be designed to be complementary to the new Metro North scheme.  </p>  <p>Funding is being made available for initial planning and design work for the Blanchardstown to UCD and Clongriffin to Tallaght BRT schemes under the Government's Capital Plan 'Building on Recovery Infrastructure &amp;amp; Capital Investment 2016-2021'.

It is now a matter for the US Secretary of Transportation, Anthony Foxx, to decide whether to confirm that tentative decision or not. I and my Department continue to liaise with the European Commission regarding the matter.  The Commission agrees that the 2&frac12; year delay by the US authorities in making a decision on NAI's permit application is not acceptable.  The next step in resolving the issue would be for the Commission to initiate a formal arbitration under Article 19 of the EU-US Open Skies Agreement.  It is hoped that by granting the permit there will be no need to take this step.  However, I am confident that the Commission, if necessary, will take the appropriate action under the Agreement to help resolve this dispute.   I look forward to a decision being confirmed by the US Department of Transportation as soon as possible so that NAI can start operating the new route from Cork to Boston and other new transatlantic routes.</p></reply>

The Department's Guidelines for Setting and Managing Speed Limits reiterates these responsibilities and provides guidance in relation to such. The Guidelines encourage the use by local authorities of the 30 km/h Special Speed Limit in residential areas accompanied by appropriate signage.  Local authorities have also been requested to review and update all speed limits in their administrative areas in accordance with the Guidelines and this process is currently on-going.  Other publications such as the Traffic Management Guidelines and the Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets also detail the options available to local authorities to facilitate traffic calming measures and to promote reduced vehicle speeds.    In addition to the 30 km/h Special Speed Limit, I am also making provision for a 20 km/h limit in the Road Traffic Bill 2016 which, once passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, will be available for implementation by local authorities.</p>  <p>  ​The Department continues to support local authorities in implementing speed reduction measures in housing estates and residential areas, by providing detailed advice regarding the application of Special Speed Limits and appropriate traffic calming engineering measures, as well as by providing dedicated funding for appropriate signage.  These efforts have led to many local authorities making very good progress in implementing a 30 km/h Special Speed Limit in housing areas across the country.  If further measures are deemed necessary to reduce speeds in local communities, it is a matter for local authorities to assess what actions can best deliver the desired safety improvements.</p></reply>

Under the Capital Plan, &euro;100 million is being committed to smarter travel and carbon reduction measures, including cycling greenways and other cycling and walking infrastructure.  We have also committed to supporting the extension of the existing public bike schemes in a number of our cities and driving the roll-out of additional schemes in other areas.</p>  <p>  Smarter travel have been delivered in a number of towns throughout the country under Smarter Travel programmes such as Active Travel Towns, Smarter Travel Areas and National Cycle Networks.  Significant investment has also been made in cycling greenways and in cycling infrastructure in urban areas.  In Dublin, the recently published 2015 Canal Cordon Count demonstrates how effective the investment in cycling in Dublin has been.  It shows that there has been a steady year on year growth in the number of cyclists crossing the cordon in the morning peak - almost 11,000 in 2015, an increase of 125% when compared with 2006.  </p>  <p>  In creating a culture of walking in Ireland it is important to ensure that walking is a safe and pleasant experience.  There is a strong convergence between walking and cycling as alternative and sustainable transport modes.  Accordingly, funding resources are aimed at progressing both walking and cycling as means of everyday transport for leisure and commuting.</p></reply>

The primary objective of each National Mitigation Plan is to specify and adopt the policy measures required to manage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at an appropriate level to ensure that the national transition objective set out in the Act can be furthered incrementally.  The first National Mitigation Plan will track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures within the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.</p>  <p>  The Act creates a statutory obligation on a number of sectors, including transport, to develop sectorial climate change mitigation measures for inclusion in the national plan.</p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with key stakeholders, has been making good progress on developing proposals for transport measures as our contribution to the Plan.  As the Deputy will know, the National Plan will also incorporate input from the key sectors of electricity generation, built environment and agriculture. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are also engaging with other sectors responsible for preparing mitigation plan measures through representation on a Steering Group chaired by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  This collaboration will seek to secure that the most appropriate of the sectorial measures would be selected for inclusion in the national plan.  The development of measures is taking place in the context of and subject to the generally applying budgetary processes governing proposals for additional spending and taxation measures.</p>  <p>  The new Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to publish the draft National Mitigation Plan for public consultation within 6 months of the new Government forming.  This will allow the public and stakeholders to feed into the continued development of the Plan.  It is envisaged that a final National Mitigation Plan will be submitted to Government in May 2017.</p></reply>

This takes account of PPP commitments and also allows for income from tolls and for some investment in roads from the local authority sector. Under the Capital Plan this target in terms of steady state maintenance should be achieved in 2020.World Bank Transport Note (TRN-4) notes that postponing road maintenance results in high direct and indirect costs.  If road defects are repaired promptly, the cost is usually modest.  If defects are neglected, an entire road section may fail completely, requiring full reconstruction at three times or more the cost, on average, of maintenance costs.  The South African National Road Agency Ltd. (SANRAL) estimates that repair costs rise to six times maintenance costs after three years of neglect and to 18 times after five years of neglect.    Heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) cause most of the damage to road pavements and where the volume of such vehicles increases from year to year it will of course shorten the overall life of a road pavement and intervention will be required at an earlier stage.</p>  <p>  The Capital Plan includes proposed transport investment priorities to 2022.  The transport element of the plan was framed by the conclusions reached in the Department of Transport&rsquo;s Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport.  This report highlighted the importance of maintenance and renewal of transport infrastructure together with targeted investments to address particular bottlenecks and critical safety issues.</p></reply>

This target was agreed under the EU Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC and is broken into three key sectors with individual targets for each sector: 40% of electricity supply (RES-E), 12% of heating (RES-H), and 10% of transport (RES-T).</p>  <p>  By 2014, Ireland had a achieved a level of 5.2% for RES-T which is over halfway to the 2020 target. A distance of 4.8% remains to be reached in the period 2015-2020. Sustainable liquid biofuels has been and is expected to continue to be the largest contributor to RES-T in the period to 2020, through the biofuel obligation scheme where fuel suppliers are required to include a level of biofuel in their annual sales of transport fuels. There will also be a contribution to target from electrification. Although EVs have not contributed at the level originally expected by this point, I understand that with the implementation of further measures to increase the penetration of biofuels and EVs, the distance that remains to the target can be bridged by the end of 2020.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the European Agreement, drivers of vehicles with tanks and certain tank components, and some drivers of vehicles carrying dangerous goods in packages, must hold a special vocational certificate of training, commonly described as an ADR driver training certificate.</p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority (HSA), an agency under my Department, is the competent authority in Ireland for the administration and enforcement of all ADR hazard classes, apart from Class I (explosives) and Class 7 (radioactive substances).  The ADR Regulations require the national competent authority to provide a training and examination regime for dangerous goods drivers.  This training and examination regime is currently administered under a HSA contract, by the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport Ireland (CILT), a non-profit professional examination body.</p>  <p>  I note the Deputy&rsquo;s concern that apparent changes in the standard of the ADR driver training examination may have made it more difficult for drivers to acquire an ADR Driver Training Certificate.  I am informed that no significant change has been made to the exam system that would affect individual performance in these exams, other than to introduce questions in line with adaptations to the ADR legislative regime affecting the mandatory training that has to be completed prior to sitting an exam.  The examination is rigorously monitored by CILT, in conjunction with the HSA, to ensure that it is robust and fit for purpose.  Individual exam questions are reviewed prior to introduction into the exam by subject matter experts and monitored in terms of candidate performance per exam by CILT.</p>  <p>  I understand that pass rates have been consistent over the duration of the exams since they were first administered by CILT in 2006.  Pass rates are in the region of 80%, which means that some candidates do not pass on the first attempt.  These candidates are allowed to re-sit an exam, should they choose to do so, and they must repeat the training before presenting at the exam once again. </p>  <p>  The details supplied suggest that heretofore exam questions were specific to the dangerous substances being carried by a particular driver and that consequently the type of questions being asked in the current exam make it more difficult for drivers to acquire an ADR Driver Training Certificate.</p>  <p>  I am informed that Irish exam system processes approximately 2000 drivers every year, all of whom sit the Basic exam, which covers all hazards with the exception of classes 1 and 7 (explosives and radioactive substances).  In addition, a specialisation exam is available to be taken by those who are road tanker drivers, or very occasionally by drivers who require specialisation in explosives or radioactive substances.  The overall exam pass rate has remained consistent at approximately 80%, with no evidence to suggest the exam is more difficult than at any other time.</p>  <p>  Prior to 2013, the exam regime allowed for an exam specific to Class 3 flammable liquids.  While not specific to these substances, the exam had originally been provided to cater to the needs of the petroleum industry.  However, the HSA, in conjunction with CILT, decided in 2013 to cease to offer the Class 3 flammable liquids exam following a steady reduction in take-up of this exam option by drivers in the fuel industry carrying diesel, kerosene and petrol.  Most drivers were already opting to sit the full Basic exam, as it offered greater flexibility in seeking alternative employment opportunities at a time when many drivers in the fuel sector were being made redundant. </p>  <p>  I am informed that exam questions in the original class specific exam were never confined to flammable liquid hazards alone, as this category of dangerous goods can also result in secondary hazards with toxic, corrosive, and environmentally hazardous characteristics, etc. The training and the exam questions associated with the previous class specific exam was therefore very similar to the content of the current Basic exam for an &ldquo;all class&rdquo; certificate.  I am informed that at no stage have questions on explosives or radioactive substances been asked in either the Class 3 exam or the Basic exam. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy inquired about differences between the exam regime operating in Ireland and the position in other jurisdictions, notably the UK.  Under the terms of the European Agreement, the different national competent authorities can specify the content for a Basic exam, which can focus on specific classes or even specific substances.  This results in considerable variation in what is provided across the different jurisdictions.  In Ireland an &ldquo;all class&rdquo; exam, together with specialisation exams for road tankers, explosives and radioactive substances, in line with the ADR standard, have proven to be the most cost-efficient and well-supported options. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Health and Safety Authority, as the national competent authority, remains open to any requests from industry stakeholders to cater for a specific ADR class or substance &ndash; as had applied prior to 2013 in the case of the Class 3 exam.  Representations by the fertiliser industry also led, for instance, to the introduction for a limited period of a Class 5.1 exam, but that class specific exam was short lived as the overall level of demand was low.  No request has been forthcoming from a petroleum representative body for the development of a separate training course leading to the re-introduction of a separate Class 3 flammable liquids examination.</p></reply>

No. 27 of 1995).  Gift vouchers that are not financial services products are covered also by the provisions of the European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 484 of 2013). Gift cards that come within the definition of &ldquo;electronic money&rdquo; in the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011 are subject to the provisions of these Regulations unless the card can be used only to acquire goods or services in the premises of the card issuer or within a limited network of service providers or for a limited range of goods and services.  The issuer of a gift card which comes within the definition of electronic money must, at the request of the electronic money holder, redeem the monetary value of the electronic money at par value at any time.  Redemption may be subject to a fee in specified circumstances and any such fee must be proportionate and commensurate with the costs actually incurred by the issuer of the electronic money.</p>  <p>  My Department published the draft Scheme of a comprehensive Consumer Rights Bill for public consultation on 25 May 2015.  In addition to Parts dealing with the consolidation and updating of the law on the supply of goods, digital content and services and on unfair contract terms, the draft Scheme contains a number of provisions for the regulation of gift vouchers, including a proposed ban on expiry dates in contracts for the supply of gift vouchers.  The responses to the gift card provisions raised a substantial number of issues, including concerns expressed by businesses about the impact of a complete prohibition on expiry dates and the need for clarity and certainty in respect of the regulation of gift cards that come within the scope of the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011.  While the present proposal is for a ban on expiry dates for gift cards that do not come within the scope of the Electronic Money Regulations, I am willing to listen to other views and possible approaches, such as a requirement that gift cards remain valid for a set period such as five years.  </p>  <p>  While I am anxious to progress the Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill, I have to take account of current European Union legislative proposals for Directives on consumer contracts for the supply of digital content and consumer contracts for the online and other distance sale of goods.  These proposals which were announced in May 2015 and published in December 2015 overlap very substantially with two of the main parts of the draft Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill.  Discussions on the digital content proposal at working party level have proceeded rapidly with a first reading of the proposal completed by April 2016 and agreement reached at the June Justice and Home Affairs Council on the basic principles of the proposal and on political guidelines for future work on it.  The Slovak Presidency has indicated that it hopes to achieve agreement in the second half of 2016 on a full or partial general approach to the digital content proposal and to commence the examination of the proposal on online sales.  In this situation, I will have to give serious consideration to whether it would be premature and inadvisable to bring forward a legislative proposal to the Oireachtas when a directly related and fully harmonised legislative proposal is proceeding through the European Union legislative process.  The wisdom of enacting legislation in the Oireachtas in 2017 if large parts of that legislation would have to be repealed or substantially amended within a relatively short space of time is obviously open to question.  I will review the progress of the two European Union proposals later in the year with a view to deciding the best course of action to take with regard to the Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill.</p></reply>

The latest data available is for the first quarter of 2016, during which there were 136 site visits countrywide. The breakdown by county of those is provided in the following table. Figures for the second quarter will be available early next month.</p><p>It is important to note that data on site visits is not an accurate measure of the level of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) activity in a region or county. That is partly because approximately 70% of all FDI investment won by IDA Ireland comes from its existing client base, rather than new companies. </p><p>IDA Ireland actively tries to encourage client companies to locate in regional locations outside of Dublin. This is consistent with the IDA&rsquo;s strategy for 2015-2019, which identifies regional development as a key priority of the Agency. This strategy is also targeting an increase in investment of at least 30%-40% in each region outside Dublin. </p><p>The data in the following table reflects a steady increase in the number of site visits outside of Dublin. In 2015, 57% of site visits were to locations outside of the capital, up from 43% in 2014. Figures for the first quarter of 2016 show that this trend is continuing, with 58% of visits conducted so far this year being outside of Dublin. </p><p>The decision by a company of where to locate can be influenced by a number of factors. These include access to qualified talent, proximity to transport hubs, the ready supply of suitable property and the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services<b>. </b>Ultimately, while the IDA does its utmost to encourage companies to consider locations that are most in need of investment, the final decision of where to situate rests with the business itself. </p><p>IDA IRELAND SITE VISITS BY COUNTY 2014, 2015 and Q1 2016<table><tr><th>County</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>Q1<br /><br />2016</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>30</td><td>48</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>205</td><td>242</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>19</td><td>41</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>22</td><td>40</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>10</td><td>20</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>7</td><td>15</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>3</td><td>12</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>11</td><td>31</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>12</td><td>28</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>359</td><td>565</td><td>136</td></tr></table></p></reply>

It has been particularly important in leveraging philanthropic and other private investment in order to put in place the research laboratories, institutes, equipment and, most importantly, the people to undertake research in our higher education system.  Ultimately, the goal of all of our investment in research and development (R&amp;D) is to support knowledge creation, knowledge transfer and innovation for economic and social progress.</p>  <p>  In the five &ldquo;cycles&rdquo; of investment under PRTLI to date, there has been a total investment of &euro;1.213 billion (&euro;935m public and &euro;278m private) and this investment has helped to put in place some 145,000 square metres of physical space for research and direct support for some 3,500 researchers and postgraduate students including through &ldquo;Structured PhD&rdquo; programmes and other related human capital elements.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for PRTLI transferred from the Department of Education and Skills to the (then) Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation in May 2010.

Officials in DJEI have commenced work on this and a detailed proposal for a successor to Cycle 5 of PRTLI will be brought to Government for approval.

Under the Regional Plan, Enterprise Ireland launched a competitive call, the Community Enterprise Initiatives Fund, with a budget of &euro;5 million over two years, which focused on community-driven enterprise initiatives and how all the local players, public and private, can work together to maximise job creation.  The Fund was open to organisations or groups of organisations with innovative ideas to create jobs, promote entrepreneurship, boost innovation or enhance exports.  As this was a competitive fund, due to limited funding, it was not be possible to award aid to all eligible projects.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland announced, on 1 June, the applicants that were offered funding for their proposals under the Community Enterprise Initiative Scheme.  Bailieborough Development Association Limited was successful in applying for funding for expanding the existing state of the art business facilities through the development and renovation of the Bailieborough Courthouse.  This will result in the expansion of business activities, offering advice to business on funding opportunities, training programmes, business development, networking, etc.</p>  <p>  I am determined to support the regions to help them to achieve their potential and ambition.  In that regard, I would point out that Enterprise Ireland will issue a 2nd call under the Community Enterprise Initiative later this year.  This new call will be open to those that may have been unsuccessful under the first call for proposals and also to new applicants. Enterprise Ireland will work with all applicants that apply for funding under the second call for proposals. </p>  <p>  I will engage closely with Enterprise Ireland to continue to roll out a series of new competitive regional funding initiatives that deliver on the potential of local and regional strengths; and promote collaboration among the various public and private interests to create new enterprises and jobs.</p></reply>

Within the time available it has not been possible to calculate an exact figure.  However, I can advise the Deputy that the annual additional salary cost to the Department of introducing a minimum hourly rate of &euro;11.50 per hour is estimated to be in the region of &euro;200,000 per annum based on current figures for 58 staff employed at Cleaner, Services Officer, Services Attendant and Clerical Officer grades.  This figure reflects recent recruitment of staff at the start point on the relevant incremental scale for their grades.  However, as the maximum point on the incremental scales for Services Officer, Services Attendant and Clerical Officer is above the minimum hourly rate, over time, based on satisfactory performance, each staff member in these grades would proceed to earn more than the current Living Wage figure of &euro;11.50 per hour.  I have asked all agencies under the aegis of my Department to advise me of the position insofar as it relates to their agency and will communicate this information to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</p>  <p>  The Living Wage campaign was designed as a voluntary initiative centred on the social, business and economic case for same and, accordingly, it is not one based in legislation.  The National Minimum Wage sets the statutory pay minimum under law.  Given the voluntary nature of the Living Wage Campaign, suppliers and service contractors are not obliged to pay their employees the wage proposed.  They are, however, required to confirm that they have taken account of their statutory and legal obligations relating to the employment protection and working conditions of their employees, in the provision of goods and services sought for my Department through the relevant procurement process.</p></reply>

Funding for research is awarded according to the criteria set out in the various funding programmes operated by research funders irrespective of whether the research is basic or applied.  Calls for proposals are announced at various times throughout the year depending on the research funder involved and details of such calls are advertised on the respective research funders&rsquo; websites.  The most recent survey of R&amp;D performed in the higher education sector (HERD survey published July 2015) shows that basic research accounted for 51% or &euro;320m of that expenditure in 2012/13.</p>  <p>  Under Innovation 2020, a competitive fund to support qualified researchers to undertake project-based frontier research is being developed.  Funding will be awarded on the basis of the excellence of the research proposals and assessed through a rigorous and international peer-review process.

The first work programme spanned the years 2014-2015; the current work programme spans the 2016-2017 and the final one will span 2018-2020.  Each work programme is published at the start of the relevant period and sets out the detailed list and timing of calls for proposals that will be issued over the course of the two or three year period.</p>  <p>  A National Support Network has been put in place to work with researchers and companies to identify opportunities in Horizon 2020 and to assist them in preparing proposals for funding.  The Network is led by Enterprise Ireland, and is comprised of sectorial experts who are designated as National Contact Points for each of the sub-programmes within Horizon 2020.  A number of these sectorial experts are based in other agencies and Government departments.</p>  <p>  Thus, the national support network has considerable advance notice of upcoming opportunities for funding in Horizon 2020.  Based on their in-depth knowledge of the sector, including familiarity with researchers with relevant expertise and innovative companies active in relevant markets, combined with information on the available budget for the calls and the likely success rate, along with historical performance, the National Contact Points are well-placed to advise potential applicants on which calls they should apply to in order to maximise their chances of success. </p>  <p>  The Strategic Research Proposals Group, which brings together Government Departments and State Agencies funding research, chaired by the Chief Scientific Advisor to the Government, is working with stakeholders to promote large proposals to programmes with significant funding available and for which Ireland has a strong competitive advantage.</p>  <p>  In June I outlined the benefits of Horizon 2020 funding at a breakfast event organised by Enterprise Ireland and attended by multinational companies including Irish multinational companies.  The heads of three of DJEI&rsquo;s agencies, Julie Sinnamon, Chief Executive of Enterprise Ireland; Martin Shanahan, Chief Executive of IDA Ireland; Prof Mark Ferguson, Director General of Science Foundation Ireland and Chief Scientific Advisor to the Government also spoke at the event to outline their support for participation in Horizon 2020.</p></reply>

Further details are available at www.enterprise-ireland.com/brexit</p><p>2.  <b>UK Market Support:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland's UK team will support clients to identify key business opportunities in the short and medium terms.  They will also provide advice and support on responding to the implications of Brexit such as improving competitiveness and reducing supply chain costs.</p><p>3.  <b>Competitiveness and Market Development Supports:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland will intensify its work with clients, to improve their competitiveness in the market, through its management capability and development programmes.</p><p>4.  <b>Market Diversification Support:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland will intensify its strategy of supporting clients to diversify into new markets.  As part of this strategy, Enterprise Ireland will intensify its International Trade &amp;amp; Investment events schedule for the rest of 2016 to include trade missions and events to Northern Europe, USA, China, India and other high growth markets.</p><p>5.  <b>International Sector Clustering Strategy:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland will expand its focus on promoting Irish sectorial cluster capabilities in key sectors to international buyers in growth markets including Northern Europe, USA and Asia Pacific.</p><p>In addition, engagement by IDA Ireland, both with their existing client companies and with new prospective investors, on issues arising as a result of the UK Referendum will, of course, continue on an ongoing basis.  Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to our membership of the European Union, which provides for full access to that market for businesses located in this country, and our specific advantages for inward investment, will be highlighted by my Department and by the IDA at every opportunity.</p></reply>

New Service Agreements will be processed shortly by my officials with the cooperation of the City and County Childcare Committees. </p>  <p>  Once in contract for the ECCE programme providers will be paid either a weekly standard rate of &euro;64 or a higher capitation rate of &euro;75 (depending on the qualifications of the preschool leader) for each child that is registered with and attending their facility.  These rates reflect the Budget 2016 changes which increased the ECCE back up to 2012 levels.  On 26 August 2016, all successful new applicants, whose Service Agreement is in place by 18 August 2016, will be given an advance payment of &euro;960 (based on three children for five weeks at the standard rate of &euro;64).  Thereafter, payments are intended to be paid every five weeks in advance through to the end of May 2017.</p>  <p>  My Department also administers three other targeted childcare programmes which your constituent may be eligible to participate in.  The names of these programmes are Community Childcare Subvention (Private) (CCSP); Afterschool Childcare (ASCC); Community Employment Childcare (CEC).  Kerry County Childcare Committee is happy to assist any eligible services to apply to participate in these programmes.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, my Department, with the assistance of Pobal, invited applications from all services contracted to deliver its various childcare programmes to be consider for capital funding.  The funding was specifically for existing pre-school providers &ndash; both community/not-for-profit and private providers &ndash; who want to expand their services to cater for more children from September 2016.  The closing date for that round of funding has now passed.</p>  <p>  On 8 July 2016 I announced that more than &euro;6.5m in capital funding was allocated through my Department to 1,006 pre-school providers nationwide.  This represents an increase of over 2.5m on the amount of &euro;4m announced for this programme in February 2016. Grants of up to &euro;10,000 per provider are being provided. </p></reply>

One of the terms of this Agreement is that the Agreement may be terminated by either party by serving 3 months written notice to the other party.  It follows that the childcare provider should inform the parents as soon as is practicable after serving notice to my Department.</p>  <p>  Closure of facilities is a normal factor of the administration of the ECCE programme.  Childcare providers find it necessary to close or relocate for many reasons.  My Department funds 30 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) to assist both parents and childcare providers in matters relating to childcare such as closures and relocation of facilities.  Ordinarily, when notice has been given of a closure, a CCC immediately carries out an assessment of local availability of childcare places in other services in the proximity of the affected services and works with parents to assist them in making alternative childcare arrangements.  It is a priority of my Department that all children registered in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) free pre-school year receive their full entitlement during their period of entitlement.</p>  <p>  My Department is working with the childcare sector to prepare for the significant expansion to pre-school provision under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme announced in Budget 2016, commencing September 2016.  The Department is in the process of rolling out a number of measures to increase the supply of ECCE places across Ireland from that time.  This expansion will see the number of children benefitting from the Programme rise from around 67,000 to around 127,000 in a given programme year.  From September 2016 both the standard and higher rates of capitation for the ECCE programme will increase by &euro;2 per child, per week; and the rules relating to higher capitation rates will also be reformed to enable more services to benefit from the higher rate.</p>  <p>  My Department made detailed information available to the CCCs at the beginning of this year indicating the number of children, by every electoral division across the country, who would be eligible for an ECCE place in September 2016, January 2017 and April 2017.  The Department is working closely with the CCCs to match this data against reported capacity in the sector to meet the increase in demand, and to develop action plans for areas where a shortfall in supply may be identified.</p></reply>

Tusla, within its national office, has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team.  This team produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, and includes detailed reporting on key performance indicators on waiting times for cases to be allocated.  Tusla also provides me with information on children in care, their placement type, care status and allocation of social workers.  Tusla has operational responsibility for individual cases and holds the data for individual cases.  My Department does not, nor should it, have access to this information but a requested briefing can be provided where the circumstances warrant it, and on occasion Tusla has alerted the Department on certain issues through the 'Need to Know' notification route.</p>  <p>  Each referral received by the Agency is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team.  Preliminary screening is aimed at establishing the appropriateness of the referral to Tusla services and, if necessary, is followed by an initial assessment of the concern to determine the best course of action for the child and their family.  Over half of all referrals received by Tusla are welfare concerns and Tusla's policy is to refer these to relevant family and community support services.  At any stage, if a determination is made that there is abuse, whether physical, emotional, sexual or neglect, from which there is an ongoing risk of harm, the child protection pathway is followed.  A social worker works with the parent/s to support them to provide safe care for their child.  In a minority of cases this may lead to the child being placed on the Child Protection Notification System (CPNS) or the child being received into care.  I wish to assure the Deputy that Tusla deals immediately with emergency cases, including for instance, if a child has been abandoned or is in immediate physical danger or at immediate risk of sexual abuse.</p>  <p>  As required under Section 8 of the Child Care Act 1991, my Department also receives the annual 'Review of Adequacy' report compiled and published by Tusla, which reviews the adequacy of the child and family services provided by the Agency.</p></reply>

It should be noted that unaccompanied minors seeking asylum are treated the same as any other child in care, and are placed in foster and residential care placements.

While my Department has a key role in this, as does Tusla, responsibility for children is shared by all sectors of society, including parents, Government departments, statutory and non statutory agencies and service providers.</p><p>There have been recent key developments in relation to child protection.  The Children First Act 2015 (the Act) was signed into law on 19 November 2015.  The introduction of this legislation was in line with a key Programme for Government commitment, and it represents an important addition to the child welfare and protection system as it will help to ensure that child protection concerns are brought to the attention of Tusla without delay, and will place an explicit responsibility on providers of services to children to keep children safe, and to put in place procedures to manage any risk.</p><p>The Act provides for mandatory reporting by key professionals; comprehensive risk assessment and planning for a strong organisational culture of &lsquo;safe&rsquo; places for all services provided to children; a provision for a register of non-compliance; and the statutory underpinning of the existing Children First Interdepartmental Implementation Group which promotes and oversees cross-sectoral implementation and compliance with Children First.</p><p>The legislation will operate side-by-side with the existing non-statutory obligations provided for in <i>Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2011</i>.  The Guidance is currently being revised and updated to take account of the new legislative obligations so as to provide in one place a comprehensive reference resource for individuals and organisations.</p><p>A Children First Implementation Inter-Departmental Group was established to promote the importance of Children First compliance across Government and to ensure a consistent approach is adopted.  The legislation includes a provision to place this Group on a statutory basis and to expand its membership to include all Government Departments.  This reflects the importance that is being attached to all Departments, sectors, agencies and services fully complying with the ethos of Children First, and their specific statutory and non-statutory responsibilities.</p><p>Taken together, the Children First Act and the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, along with the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, represent a significant legislative framework to promote the welfare and protection of children.</p></reply>

It is a priority of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, that children in care are safe and have opportunities to thrive.  Tusla's arrangements for the monitoring of the safety of children in care is based on the following:</p><p>- Comprehensive assessment of foster carers;</p><p>- Vetting of foster carers, as well as the adults residing in the households;</p><p>- Allocation of a Link Social Worker for the supervision and support of foster carers;</p><p>- Allocation of a dedicated social worker to the child in care to support the child and allow for a Care Plan to be implemented and reviewed;</p><p>- Training of all social workers, social carers and foster carers in child protection and the Children First guidance (2011);</p><p>- Social workers engage directly with children and talk with them about their rights, safety and future.</p><p>Where an allegation or concern is made to a social worker by a child, it is their responsibility to ensure the concern is listened to and to respond accordingly.  The immediate safety of the child is always central in responding to any allegation of physical, emotional, sexual abuse and neglect.  Following an allegation the overall safety of the child is considered.  Where there is an obvious ongoing risk to a child, whether in their family home or in a care placement, the child has to be made safe.  That either involves removing the risk, or removing the child.  The impact of removing a child from their home is a serious one with possible adverse implications for them, and so should only be done where there is no alternative and where it is based on an assessment of the best interests of the child.  The allocated social worker will also review the child's care plan and arrange for specialist assessments to determine what therapeutic or medical services are required.</p><p>Allegations of abuse can be made against anyone, including  biological parents, family members, foster carers, friends, professionals, other children and in some cases, people unknown to the child.  It is important to note that any child welfare or protection issue raised by a child should be dealt with under <i>Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children</i>(2011).</p></reply>

Dublin, currently provides a total of 54 detention places for young people ordered to be remanded or committed by the courts.  This comprises 6 places for girls up to the age of 18 and 48 places for boys up to the age of 18 who are remanded in custody and up to the age of 17 for those serving a sentence of detention.  Boys aged 17 who are serving a sentence of detention are currently detained in Wheatfield Place of Detention which comes under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  They are accommodated in a self-contained facility which is completely separate from adult prisoners.  It is my aim to assign responsibility for 17 year old boys who are serving a sentence of detention to the Oberstown campus this year.  This will end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities.</p></reply>

This figure currently represents 100,000 children.</p><p>In order to understand and improve the lives of our children, my Department commissioned the Growing Up in Ireland study.  The study examines the lives of Irish children from a wide range of perspectives including economic vulnerability.  My department is also developing a national indicator set to track progress against the five national outcomes in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Future</i>including Outcome 4: Economic security and opportunity, which covers the issue of child poverty.</p><p>The Government acknowledges the challenge in successfully achieving the child poverty target, but remains committed to meeting it.  I believe that having an ambitious target and actively monitoring this will provide a roadmap towards which we can develop and implement a strong multi-dimensional policy response.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection has the lead role in coordinating government strategies on child poverty.  It also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion and has identified child poverty as a key cross-sectoral priority to be addressed.  Officials in my Department are working very closely with the Department of Social Protection in informing the plan for this cross-sectoral priority.</p><p>As part of its role in implementing Better Outcomes Brighter Futures, my Department has identified prevention and early intervention as a key cross-sectoral priority to be addressed in conjunction with a sub-group of the Advisory Council.</p><p>My Department addresses this priority through three levels.  Firstly, it co-finances, with The Atlantic Philanthropies, the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2017) to the combined value of &euro;29.7m.  The ABC Programme is designed to prevent inter-generational poverty through area based programmes with a strong prevention and early intervention focus.  The ABC Programme has a strong evaluation component allowing us to identify the programmes, initiatives and approaches which impact positively on children's outcomes.  Secondly, it is developing the Quality and Capacity Building Initiative that aims to mainstream existing and emerging learning from initiatives such as ABC Programme and secure a system-wide change in children and young people services.  Thirdly, it also supports the implementation of priorities by other Departments such as homelessness and child poverty that are relevant in the context of preventing and reversing poor outcomes among children.</p><p>There are also a number of areas of focus that support our response to child poverty within my Department.  These include:</p><p>- &euro;345 million invested annually on early childhood care and education and after-school support programmes which provide care to 100,000 children;</p><p>- &euro;51m allocated to support the provision of youth services by the voluntary youth sector for 2016;</p><p>In addition, Tusla delivers a range of services focusing on the welfare, protection and support for children, young people and their families which are key to supporting outcomes which assist in reducing the impact of child poverty.</p></reply>

Based on the responses of mothers for the 9-year-old cohort, 24% of children had been victims of bullying in the previous year, but 40% of children themselves reported that they had been bullied.  The difference between the two figures may reflect under-reporting of incidents by children to their parents, or a differing perspective of what constitutes bullying.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that there is an Action Plan on Bullying published by the Minister for Education and Skills which recognises the need to tackle bullying - and cyberbullying as one aspect of it - in a wide social context.</p>  <p>  In relation to cyberbullying, the Office of Internet Safety, under the Department of Justice and Equality, takes lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children.</p>  <p>  The most important step in addressing bullying, including cyberbullying, is for parents to talk to children about their experiences.  The Action Plan published by the Minister for Education and Skills sets out twelve actions to help prevent and tackle all forms of bullying in school. The actions focus on support, teacher training, research and awareness training.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people.  The voluntary youth sector involves approximately 1,400 paid staff, including youth workers and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Budget 2016 provided an additional &euro;1.1m in current youth funding to my Department bringing the total allocation for the youth services to &euro;51m in 2016.  This additional funding was a 2.5% increase over 2015.  It will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.</p>  <p>  Last month I announced details of youth work projects that are to receive funding under the new &euro;600,000 Youth Employment Initiative.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2016, funding of &euro;51m has been provided to my Department for these schemes.  In addition &euro;2.6m in capital funding, also provided in Budget 2016, will be used to support small scale projects, including refurbishment, health and safety fit-outs and accessibility improvements in local youth services.</p>  <p>  In 2016, an amount of &euro;500,405 has been allocated for the projects and services under Kildare Youth Services, which operates under Youth Work Ireland.  This is an increase of more than &euro;12,000 on the 2015 allocation.  My Department provides funding to Kildare Youth Services under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme in respect of six local youth projects in Athy, Naas, Leixlip, Newbridge, the Curragh and Kildare town and a Youth Information Centre in Naas.</p>  <p>  I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet, regularly with many voluntary organisations and groups providing services to children and young people to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people, having regard to resources available to us and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs.  Ongoing engagement and dialogue with the youth sector organisations and with young people themselves are priorities in the development of the policies and services to support young people&rsquo;s development and learning.</p>  <p>  At local level, Youth Officers of the Education and Training Boards have an important support role on behalf of my Department, to local youth services.  My Department works closely with them to address issues that arise for local services.  Officials of my Department met Kildare Youth Services and have visited their Kildare Youth Service to hear about their work and their proposals for the provision of services in County Kildare.

I am satisfied that Tusla takes its responsibility very seriously regarding the welfare of children in care and that there is a robust framework of regulations and standards, to ensure that children are placed in safe and caring settings.  The following table shows the number of children in care at the end of each year and the latest available figure for 2016, the number in foster care (General and Relative) and the corresponding percentage:<table><tr><th></th><th>Number of Children in Care</th><th>Number of Children in Foster Care</th><th>% of Children in Foster Care</th><th>General</th><th>Relative</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>6,160</td><td>5,564</td><td>90%</td><td>3,776</td><td>1,788</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>6,332</td><td>5,816</td><td>92%</td><td>3,979</td><td>1,837</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>6,460</td><td>5,998</td><td>93%</td><td>4,140</td><td>1,858</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>6,463</td><td>6,011</td><td>93%</td><td>4,137</td><td>1,874</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>6,388</td><td>5,932</td><td>93%</td><td>4,100</td><td>1,832</td></tr><tr><td>2016 (30 April)</td><td>6,376</td><td>5,929</td><td>93%</td><td>4,136</td><td>1,793</td></tr></table></p><p>All children in care should have an allocated social worker but it is important to note that if a child has not been allocated a social worker, the cases are reviewed regularly by the principal social worker and are managed by duty social work teams to ensure the necessary needs of the children are being met.  At the end of April 2016, over 93% of all children in care had an allocated social worker.</p><p>As the majority of children in care are in foster care family settings in the community, indicators of stability of the placement and participation in education are useful in monitoring the performance of Tusla in relation to overall welfare.  I am happy to say that Tusla has reported that the results for these indicators are positive and show that placement stability is high and participation in education is on a par with the national participation rates.</p><p>Foster carers are selected on the basis of their ability to meet the needs of individual children.  In some cases a child may require a foster care placement with additional supports to meet additional needs and in these cases extra supports and respite facilities may be provided when required.  Social work support is also provided for foster carers in the form of a link worker.  The link worker is a professionally qualified social worker and meets regularly with foster carers to provide training, information and whatever other support that may be required.</p><p>I would also note that the Agency provides funding to the Irish Foster Care Association which provides additional supports to carers.</p></reply>

Social work duty teams keep high priority cases under review by regularly checking to ascertain risk to the child, and where necessary will reprioritise the case.</p>  <p>  The Child and Family Agency, Tusla, holds the statutory responsibility for child welfare and protection, and is the appropriate body to receive reports of concerns relating to children at risk.  Children First sets out the roles and responsibilities for all citizens to report child welfare and protection issues to Tusla, and where criminal matters are involved, the Garda&iacute;.  The majority of referrals received by Tusla are from Garda&iacute;, HSE or Tusla officers, family members, schools and voluntary agencies.  In 2015 there were 25,361 child welfare concerns and 18,235 child protection concerns received by Tusla.  Referrals are made to the local Tusla office.  Referrals about a child can come from a number of sources so there are some duplicates in the referral figures.  Some referrals will be more appropriate for universal services, such as those provided in the community or health sectors.</p>  <p>  Each referral received by the Agency is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team.  Screening and preliminary enquiries are aimed at establishing the appropriateness of the referral to Tusla services and, if necessary, a preliminary enquiry is followed by an initial assessment of the concern.  This will determine the best course of action for the child and their family.  Over half of all referrals received by Tusla are welfare concerns and Tusla's policy is to refer these to relevant family and community support services.</p></reply>

The extent to which each child avails of these services depends on the individual profile in each case.</p>  <p>  On admission, every child is assigned a specific member of staff who acts as the child&rsquo;s "keyworker".  The focus is on developing supportive relationships with the main emphasis placed on education and rehabilitation rather than on control and security.  Each child is screened to determine any clinical services required, such as psychology, psychiatry or speech and language therapy.  A &ldquo;Placement Plan&rdquo; is developed and reviewed at regular intervals during each child&rsquo;s stay in detention.  This ensures that all relevant supports that may be available in the community on a child&rsquo;s release are put in place.  The plan identifies responses to the identified needs of a child on release and names persons willing to assist in the rehabilitative process.</p>  <p>  In addition, a strong ethos of school attendance, education and training is in place in the children detention schools, tailored to each child's needs.  Education and training services are provided by the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board.</p>  <p>  The key principles of the Children Act 2001 are that detention of a child should only be imposed as a last resort.  Among the other options that may be considered are the programmes provided by the Probation Service and Garda Youth Diversion Programme.  From the most recent data currently available, the effectiveness of this policy can be gauged when one sees that in 2013 a total of 10,420 young people were referred to the Garda Diversion Programme and a total of 106 children either remanded or sentenced to a period of detention in the children detention schools.  In 2014, 9,991 children were referred to the Garda Diversion Programme and a total of 142 children were either remanded or sentenced to a period of detention in the children detention schools.  This would indicate that when all children in contact with the criminal justice system are considered, there is an emphasis on the promotion of non-custodial options as a first priority.</p></reply>

The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.</p><p>The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement and cannot be imposed on suppliers or contractors by either my Department or its agencies.  In the circumstances, my Department has not had discussions with suppliers or service contractors regarding the payment of the living wage to their employees.</p><p>It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis.  The previous Government established the Low Pay Commission to annually assess the appropriate level of the National Minimum Wage.  The national minimum hourly rate of pay increased to &euro;9.15 per hour on January 1<sup>st</sup>this year following acceptance of the Low Pay Commission recommendation of July 2015 to increase the rate from &euro;8.65 per hour.  More recently, the Commission&rsquo;s second report on the national minimum wage was submitted to Government on 19<sup>th</sup>July last and the recommendation made by the Commission that the hourly rate for an experienced adult worker be increased by 10 cents will be considered by Government in the context of Budget 2017.</p><p>Separately, wage rates and other conditions of employment are provided for in Employment Regulation Orders for the Contract Cleaning and Security sectors.  These statutory Orders came into effect on 1<sup>st</sup>October 2015 and provide for minimum rates in excess of the National Minimum Wage, with &euro;10.75 per hour payable to workers in the Security sector and &euro;9.75 per hour payable to workers in the Contract Cleaning sector.</p><p>Statutory minimum rates of pay may also be supplemented by social transfers such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement or health, education or housing assistance payments where the need arises and to reflect family circumstances.</p></reply>

As of July 20th, funding of &euro;548,760.00 has been approved, and &euro;181,090.80 has been drawn-down.  The remainder of allocated funding will be drawn down over the course of the year as fees fall due.  The Learner Fund remains open for new applications until July 31st, 2016 and I would encourage providers seeking to complete a level 6 qualification to apply without delay.  Once this closing date has passed, officials in my Department will examine options for re-opening the learner fund to additional childcare staff later in the year.</p>  <p>  In 2014, the Learner Fund was introduced to support childcare staff to meet the new qualification introduced as part of The Early Years Quality Agenda.  In order to further improve quality in pre-school services, one of the items to be progressed, as part of The Early Years Quality Agenda, was the introduction of a requirement that all staff working with children in early years services should hold a qualification in early childhood care and education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) or equivalent and that pre-school leaders in ECCE services would be required to hold a minimum Level 6 qualification, or equivalent.  The Learner Fund has already allocated &euro;3.5 million to over 3,000 staff for the purpose of up-skilling to the minimum qualification of Level 5.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, following an EGM of the board in March 2016, my Department was informed of the intention to proceed with an orderly wind-down of the service.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises that the service in question provides childcare support for children from a disadvantaged background, and understands that the closure of this service will cause difficulties for parents and children who use the service.  My Department notes that the interim management of this service and Longford County Childcare Committee have both indicated that this service could have been sustainable, were it not for legacy debt and governance issues.  The establishment of a new Community Childcare Service here would provide the opportunity for a new start for the facility.  My Department is keen to see a new service established as soon as possible and is prepared to work constructively with stakeholders to develop a plan for the provision of sustainable childcare services to the impacted families.</p>  <p>  Whilst my Department is very keen to assist with a solution, my Department does not have authority to provide exceptional funding to a private childcare provider over and above the programme funding that would be due for the provision of childcare places under the Early Childhood care and Education (ECCE), Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) and Community childcare Subvention (CCS) programmes.</p>  <p>  My Department and Pobal are continuing to engage with Longford CCC in relation to McEoin Park and the re-establishment of a service for the local community.  Proposals were requested from a number of existing community based services in May 2016 and while none were forthcoming at that time Pobal and Longford CCC are still pursuing options locally in relation to the reopening of a service on the site.</p></reply>

The creation of a Master Plan for the Island was considered necessary in order to identify a vision for the sustainable development of the remediated Island, linking industrial development and tourism potential alongside the activities in the Naval Base.  It was also to ensure that the necessary remediation infrastructural works can, where possible, complement future development plans for the Island.</p>  <p>  As you may be aware, ownership of Haulbowline Island has been temporarily transferred to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to facilitate the completion of the remedial works.  Accordingly, funding for the remedial works has been included in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine Vote for 2016.  The Department of Defence has received no funding in respect of the remedial work, the development of the Master Plan or the implementation of the Plan.</p>  <p>  There are currently infrastructural developments being undertaken in the Naval Base to ensure that the ongoing operational needs of the Naval Service can be met.  This development is informed by the Master Plan, although most aspects of the Master Plan are awaiting completion of the remedial work on the island.</p>  <p>  The position of the Naval Service as the priority user of Haulbowline has been stressed by the Department of Defence during the development of the Plan and accordingly both the Navy and the Department will play a central role in its implementation while facilitating the development of those parts of the island not required now or in the future for Naval Service operations.</p></reply>
