    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-27a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022700058#WRA00800"><p>The increased rent limits introduced by the Government in 2016, together with the additional discretion available to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, are allowing HAP households to find suitable accommodation. On average in 2017, 350 additional tenancies were supported by HAP each week, with over 33,000 households currently having their housing needs met under the scheme.  </p>  <p>  From available data, at the end of Q4 2017, 22.4% of the total number of households being supported by HAP were benefiting from the additional flexibility. When the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region is removed, 16.7% of households nationally were benefiting from the additional flexibility, meaning that less than one in six tenancies required additional support above the defined HAP rent limit. In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 15.2% above the relevant limit.</p>  <p>  HAP is only just about to complete its first full year of operation on a national basis. Increasing the HAP rent limits in particular local authority areas could have further inflationary effects, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support. </p>  <p>  My Department closely monitors the level of discretion being used by local authorities, taking into consideration other sources of data, including Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) rent data published on a quarterly basis. I am satisfied that the maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally sufficient to support the effective operation of the HAP scheme. However, I will continue to keep the matter under review.</p></reply>

This review was undertaken following representations made by three elected members of Wicklow County Council.</p><p>In carrying out the non-statutory review involved, Senior Counsel visited the lands involved, had access to all relevant Council files and engaged directly with relevant elected members and officials of the Council, both through meetings and written correspondence as necessary.  He noted, for the record, that in carrying out the review, he had received full co-operation from all the parties referred to.</p><p>The review found that there was no deviation by the Council from the relevant legal requirements and administrative requirements or practices.  The report of the review was published in April 2013. The conclusions and recommendations of the review were fully accepted by the then Minister and continue to stand. The report remains available to view on my Department's website, the link for which I will arrange to have circulated with the Official Report.  </p><p>Subsequent correspondence was received from a number of parties, including current and former members of Wicklow County Council, on a range of issues, including matters relating to the lands in question.  This correspondence has been examined in detail by my Department and once this process is concluded, my Department will be replying to the parties concerned.</p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensuring the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in Rebuilding Ireland, a review of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase Scheme&rsquo;s operation, including the income eligibility criteria referred to by the Deputy,  has been undertaken. The review has incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process which took place in 2017 and saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations.</p>  <p>  The review is now complete and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations including one relating to the issue of the minimum reckonable income criterion which the Deputy has referred to. In finalising the report some further inter-Departmental consultation was necessary and due consideration had to be given to possible implementation arrangements. These matters are now almost completed and I expect to be in a position to publish the outcome of the review shortly.</p></reply>

A detailed database and GIS map of these sites showing their location, size, boundaries and other information can be accessed on the Rebuilding Ireland website.</p>  <p>  In addition to this mapping exercise, all local authorities and the Housing Agency have been requested to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for housing lands in their ownership, with particular emphasis on prioritising those sites with the greatest potential to deliver housing at scale, in the short to medium term. These plans are close to finalisation and will be published on the websites of the respective local authorities and the Housing Agency, in due course.</p>  <p>  The delivery of additional social and affordable homes, to buy or rent, will rely on the State developing the full potential of its residential land bank. In relation to social housing developments, as at end Q3 2017, there were 772 schemes, involving some 12,300 homes, at various stages of delivery on local authority and Housing Agency lands. This Construction Status Report is also available on the Rebuilding Ireland website and Minister Murphy will be publishing an updated report shortly, reflecting the position at end 2017.</p>  <p>  There remains further significant potential for the delivery of social and affordable homes from the public land bank. Following on from the second Housing Summit with local authority Chief Executives on 22 January, each Chief Executive has been asked to submit in early March an outline of their respective housing delivery programmes. The overall scale of delivery and timescales will be informed by these responses. In the context of my Department's role in driving and co-ordinating housing delivery, a dedicated Residential Land Management and Development Group has been established to oversee this important work.  </p>  <p>  Finally, from a longer-term strategic perspective, as part of Project Ireland 2040, the Government announced on 16 February its intention to establish a new National Regeneration and Development Agency, which will have a role in managing the State's wider publicly-owned land bank to ensure that overall development needs, including housing, are met. The new Agency will work closely with local authorities, Government Departments, Agencies and other State and semi-State bodies to secure the best use of public lands and ensure the delivery on the objectives of the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan.</p></reply>

Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation.  If the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office. Also, there is a right of appeal to the Courts on a point of law.</p></reply>

I am absolutely committed to this objective. Hotels are not a suitable or secure form of accommodation for families and especially for young children for anything other than a short period of time. </p>  <p>  My Department and I are working with local authorities to accelerate the delivery of social housing for those who need it and while these more permanent housing solutions are being put in place, we are working with local authorities to deliver family hubs. These family hubs are a first response only but do provide more suitable, safe and supported family living arrangement.</p>  <p>  Family hubs offer family living arrangements with a greater level of stability than is possible in hotel accommodation, with the capacity to provide appropriate play-space, cooking and laundry facilities, communal recreation space, while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  Furthermore, such arrangements will facilitate more coordinated needs assessment and support planning including on-site access to required services, such as welfare, health, housing services and appropriate family supports. In addition, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive provides ongoing training to all operators of emergency accommodation and nutrition is addressed as part of this training.  </p>  <p>  I fully recognise that families living in hotel accommodation face many challenges and that is why I want to significantly increase the accommodation available in family hubs.  There are currently 20 hubs in operation (17 in Dublin, 2 in Limerick and 1 in Kildare) providing almost 500 units of family accommodation.  However, I have asked local authorities to bring forward proposals for further facilities of this kind, located, as much as possible, close to the communities where families are experiencing homelessness. My Department will continue to fund and work proactively with local authorities in relation to the delivery of these hubs.</p></reply>

It is precisely for that reason that the <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>has prioritised the supply of new and more affordable homes. Importantly, all housing construction activity indicators are moving in the right direction, showing that the focus on increasing and accelerating housing supply is working. </p><p>Recognising that initiatives introduced to date are having an impact and will have a greater impact in time, I announced last month a package of initiatives to help alleviate affordability pressures faced by households, particularly in areas of high housing demand and high accommodation costs. The measures announced were the new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, a new Affordable Purchase Scheme and a new Affordable Cost Rental Scheme. Further details on this suite of initiatives are available on the rebuildingireland.ie website.  </p><p>The new affordable purchase scheme will be governed by the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which will be commenced shortly.  Once the relevant provisions are commenced, I will develop, in consultation with the Housing Agency and local authorities, detailed Regulations covering the operation of the Scheme, including eligibility criteria.  </p><p>In order to kick-start the delivery of affordable homes, I am providing Exchequer funding of &euro;25 million, over 2018 and 2019, for a targeted programme, under which local authorities will make low-cost serviced sites available for affordable housing, working with Approved Housing Bodies or co-operative housing associations as appropriate. </p><p>A pilot project on the cost rental initiative is currently being progressed in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, in conjunction with the Housing Agency and Approved Housing Bodies, using publicly-owned land. I expect this pilot to go to the market later this year to secure a development partner and the best value for the State and prospective qualifying renters.</p><p>I anticipate that there is significant potential for the delivery of affordable homes on local authority lands.  Following on from the Housing Summit on 22 January, I have asked local authority Chief Executives to submit in early March an outline of their respective affordable housing programmes.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly, working with the relevant local authorities across the Greater Dublin Area, will co-ordinate a strategic metropolitan plan for the Dublin area. Engagement with each of the four Dublin local authorities will be undertaken as part of preparing the MASP, through the RSES process.</p><p>The MASPs will inform each local authority development plan, focusing on high-level issues that affect each city as a whole across local authority boundaries, as well as setting investment priorities, ranging from planning for transport, housing and economic development to major regeneration areas and projects. Plans for the future development of individual areas will be a matter for the relevant local authority to pursue through the relevant development plan, in line with the overarching planning policy objectives of the NPF.</p><p>Implementation of the NPF will be supported by an investment of &euro;2 billion for urban regeneration and development purposes, focusing on cities and towns in excess of 10,000 in population, and complemented by a similar &euro;1 billion fund for regeneration of smaller towns and villages which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development.</p><p>The Urban Regeneration and Development Fund will be a competitive bid-based fund, operated in line with criteria that my Department is in the process of drawing up in consultation with the Department of  Public Expenditure and Reform.  The funding for urban regeneration and development, which will become available from 2019, is additional to the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) and at this preliminary stage, it would be expected that urban regeneration initiatives leveraged by the funding being made available would include the provision of the homes required in the cores of our cities and towns.</p><p>The overall purpose of the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund is therefore to achieve sustainable growth in Ireland&rsquo;s five cities and other larger urban centres, complementing the similar focus of the rural regeneration and development fund being developed by the Department of Rural and Community Development.</p><p>Given that Project Ireland 2040's significant policy shift towards securing more compact and sustainable urban and rural development will require significantly more effective land management in key development areas, it is proposed to establish a National Regeneration and Development Agency to assist in ensuring a more effective approach to strategic land management, particularly in terms of publicly owned land.  The Agency will act as a national centre of expertise, working with and supporting local authorities, public bodies and other interests, to harness public lands as catalysts to stimulate regeneration and wider investment and to achieve compact, sustainable growth, with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects.</p><p>The detailed arrangements in relation to the establishment, location, staffing and powers of the Agency will be finalised as quickly as possible.  At this point, however, I envisage that the Agency would be tightly focused and would seek to work primarily through the statutory powers of the stakeholders it is being established to assist, such as the local authorities who already have extensive powers to acquire, compulsorily if necessary, lands for development and to deliver infrastructure.</p></reply>

Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers.</p>  <p>  In general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, the homeowner, the builder, the developer and/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme. It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.</p>  <p>  In August 2017, my Department published a Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings, where concerns arise. The Framework is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. The Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors, both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations.</p>  <p>  In addition, in response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety,  the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management  in my Department was tasked with co-ordinating a high-level Task Force to lead a re-appraisal of fire safety in Ireland. The report arising from this exercise is expected to be available shortly.   </p>  <p>  In response to the many building failures that have emerged over the past decade, my Department introduced the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 (S.I. No. 9 of 2014), which require greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.  A Certificate of Compliance on Completion is jointly signed by the builder and the assigned certifier. This must be accompanied by plans and documentation to show how the constructed building complies with the building regulations and also the inspection plan, as implemented.</p>  <p>  In addition, in May 2017, the Government approved the draft heads of a Bill to place the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) on a statutory footing and the Bill was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning, and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny.  I received the Committee&rsquo;s report on 14 December 2017 and I am considering its recommendations, with a view to progressing the drafting of the Bill.</p>  <p>  Once enacted, the Bill will provide consumers who engage a registered builder with the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator and will complement the reforms which have been made through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations and contribute to the development of a culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Building Regulations, work has been on-going in my Department to review Part B/Technical Guidance Document (TGD) B &ndash; Fire (2006). A new Part B/TGD B Volume 2 (2017) came into force on 1 July 2017, in relation to dwellings. Important revisions in the TGD B Volume 2 include enhanced provision for fire detection and alarm systems in dwelling houses, guidance on fire safety in community dwelling houses, guidance on timber frame construction, including new provisions in respect of timber frame party walls, enhanced provisions in respect of loft conversions, new provisions for galleries in dwelling houses and other general updates. Work is currently underway on a revision to Part B/TGD B Volume 1, which will deal with all other buildings.</p></reply>

This was the position that pertained prior to the establishment of Irish Water, when individual local authorities held responsibility for public water services.  </p><p>In the interests of water conservation, Irish Water developed the First Fix Leak Repair scheme to assist customers by notifying them where suspected leakage is occurring outside their house but within the boundary of their property. This is done through metering data.  The relevant policy document, as approved by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities on 5 August 2015, is published on Irish Water&rsquo;s website at the following weblink -  </p><p>.</p><p>I understand that to date the scheme has resulted in repairs capable of delivering savings equivalent to a combined total of 89 million litres of water a day.  </p><p>The Report of the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services (April 2017) recommended that the First Fix scheme remain in place and that further options be explored to address the issue of leaks within the boundaries of a users' property.In this regard, I understand that Irish Water will be engaging further with the CRU in 2018 to assess how the benefits of the First Fix scheme may be applied to leaks on the customer side of unmetered properties.</p><p>I understand that the position in relation to responsibility is less clear in respect of service connection pipes between the property boundary and the public water main.  I understand that in many cases, these were not historically taken in charge or taken into public ownership by the water service authorities, and so that legal responsibility for their upkeep did not pass to Irish Water.  I have been advised by Irish Water that as a matter of practice, Irish Water will take responsibility for water pipes that are in the public realm.</p></reply>

It is to deliver 1,500 social housing units in total, via three bundles. The first bundle, as referred to by the Deputy, comprises a total of six PPP sites, and will provide over 500 units in the Greater Dublin Area. The tender documents were issued to the three candidates in December 2017 and the dialogue period is presently on-going. Tenders for this bundle are due to be submitted in June 2018.</p>  <p>  Regarding the value for money (VFM) for this project, the Central PPP Unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform provides guidance in relation to PPP projects. It sets out four specific VFM tests that are applied in the case of PPPs over the course of the planning and procurement process. These tests focus on assessing whether or not the PPP approach compares favourably with the alternative cost of using traditional procurement to achieve the same result. The purpose, sequence and format of the four VFM tests in the PPP approval process are set out clearly in the central PPP guidance.</p>  <p>  Bundle 1 of the Social Housing PPP Programme is at a stage whereby it has successfully met the criteria under the first two of these VFM tests. The first of these was the Provisional PPP Assessment Report that was prepared by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) in 2014 on behalf of the Department of Finance, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and my Department. It has also passed the Public Sector Benchmark (PSB) test, which was signed off in December 2017. Two further VFM tests will be carried out on this project prior to financial close on the final contract. As a result of this rigorous process, I am confident that this PPP project will provide value for money to the State.</p>  <p>  This process also entails robust financial evaluation of proposed bidders at various stages, which is relevant to the Deputy's query concerning contractual problems. In addition to these evaluations, under the terms of the PPP contract, in the case of liquidation of a consortium member or an entity under the contract, the PPP consortium's funders and remaining shareholders are required to intervene and implement rectification measures to ensure the project is completed to the satisfaction of the State. These measures would also apply in the case of the PPP contracts delivered under Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

Since the national roll out, my Department has been working intensively with local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to develop and implement the scheme. There have been a number of national and local press advertising initiatives, as well as targeted online promotion, in an effort to ensure that property owners who can benefit from the scheme are aware of the benefits.</p><p>I can confirm that at the end of 2017, applications in respect of a total of 820 houses had been received by local authorities nationwide. A total of 41 applications have been received across the four Dublin local authorities, with 26 of these properties being deemed suitable for social housing, and 7 unsuitable, following an initial evaluation. A Lease Agreement has been signed in respect of 1 property, which has now been tenanted.  A detailed breakdown of the RLS data up to end Q4 2017 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>.</p><p>The nature of the RLS means that the period leading up to the signing of contracts &ndash; sourcing and inspecting the properties, and negotiation with owners - is the slowest part of the process. All local authorities are active in sourcing and identifying potential properties and it is expected that significant numbers of contracts will be entered into once that process is complete. Once contracts are signed, delivery is estimated at between 2 and 6 months, a fraction of the time involved for a capital acquisition or build project.</p><p>Feedback from local authorities indicates that, in many cases, properties requiring extensive repair work, and therefore not suitable for the RLS, have been secured under the Buy and Renew Scheme which facilitates local authorities or AHBs to purchase vacant properties for social housing use. In addition, anecdotal evidence suggests that the levels of vacancy recorded as part of Census 2016 have significantly reduced in the interim, particularly in urban areas like Dublin where many previously vacant homes have since been occupied. </p><p>It is clear from end 2017 output, that RLS has not yet delivered the level of new social housing homes envisaged. I have reviewed the operation of the scheme, as part of the review of Rebuilding Ireland, and I have concluded that the scheme has significant potential but there are areas where it can be improved to make it more attractive and effective. At the Housing Summit held on 22 January 2018, local authority Chief Executives were advised that, from 1 February 2018, a number of key changes were being made to the scheme. These include:</p><p>- a reduction in the minimum lease term required from 10 to 5 years;</p><p>- increasing the proportion of market rent available to property owners where they take on more responsibilities under the tenancy, meaning that up to 92% of market rent will be available; and</p><p>- provision of additional funding for property owners, over and above the current &euro;40,000 limit, where the dwelling is a bedsit type dwelling being brought into compliance with the Standards for Rented Houses Regulations and made available for social housing. </p><p>I am making &euro;32 million available for the scheme in 2018 and I expect local authorities and AHBs to continue to implement the scheme locally and to achieve the target of 800 new properties this year.</p></reply>

My Department issued a circular in this context to all local authorities in October 2017, a copy of which is available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p>. </p><p>The guidance circular is an immediate measure intended to ensure that existing planning regulations are adhered to and that they are used appropriately to facilitate genuine home-sharing and to protect the supply of rental accommodation and housing stock.  It provides guidance to planning authorities, where an application for planning permission has been made for the purpose of short-term letting.</p><p>There is a specific exemption in article 10(4) of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 for, within certain limitations or restrictions, development consisting of the use of a house for overnight guest accommodation which, therefore, does not require planning permission. This exemption is typically or traditionally relied on in the context of provision of B&amp;amp;B type accommodation.  The circular does not provide guidance for planning decisions for houses that are covered by this exemption.</p><p>However, the term &ldquo;house&rdquo; does not, for the purposes of article 10(4), include a building designed for use or used as 2 or more dwellings or a flat, an apartment or other dwelling within such a building.  Providing overnight guest accommodation in such dwellings is therefore  specifically excluded from this exemption and may constitute a material change of use and, if it does, such use requires planning permission.</p><p>In this context, the circular provides guidance to LAs when considering applications for planning permission for a material change of use to allow short-term letting in such dwellings and also in houses that are not covered by this exemption.</p><p>This guidance is a first step, and is not intended to resolve all the issues related to short-term letting.  It does not constitute an alteration to the existing planning regulations, which are unchanged by the guidance circular.  Indeed, any changes to existing regulations relating to the exemption from the requirement to obtain planning permission are subject to approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, as set out in the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.</p><p>The broader licensing and regulatory approach, on which the Working Group is developing proposals, will provide the comprehensive framework to do this.  The draft report of the Working Group is currently being finalised and I will consider its recommendations when I receive it, before initiating a targeted public consultation on the proposals.</p></reply>

While there are nine points of review within the CWMF, my Department has combined these to just four for capital-funded social housing construction projects.</p><p>My Department's approvals themselves represent a small minority only of the time taken in advancing a construction project onto site. The approach that is followed means that local authorities forward design proposals and costings to my Department sequentially, as the local authorities advance the projects through their own planning work. </p><p>However, it is important that we continuously strive for efficiency in the delivery of social housing. Accordingly a review was undertaken during 2017 of the processes and procedures in place for the approval of such construction projects.  As part of this, a joint working group of the County and City Management Association and my Department has agreed an overall target programme of 59 weeks for progressing a typical social housing construction project from initial capital appraisal submission by the local authority (Stage 1), to construction contract award. The group has also produced new guidelines for local authorities on advancing such projects.  Revisions have also been made to the single-stage approval process for social housing construction projects under &euro;2m to increase its use, while projects using the framework for rapid delivery housing also avail of a streamlined approval process.</p><p>These improvements, in particular the target programme of 59 weeks for progressing typical social housing construction projects, are now being implemented but in respect of previous projects, as seen in the quarterly Social Housing Construction Status Reports now being published (see ), the equivalent time for a range of typical projects was from 61 to 70 weeks, averaging at 65 weeks.  My Department remains committed to the accelerated delivery of all social housing projects and will work with all local authorities and approved housing bodies to ensure that quality and value for money projects are delivered efficiently and effectively.</p></reply>

Subject to the planning process and the eventual development applications made, it is estimated that approximately 3,300 of the 20,000 new homes will be for social housing purposes, made up of Part V units and additional social housing which will be provided on the 13 State-owned sites benefiting from the LIHAF-funded enabling infrastructure.  On most of these publicly-owned sites, additional affordable housing will also be provided for sale or for rent.   </p>  <p>  As required under the scheme criteria and conditions, a key focus has been to ensure that there is a proportionate dividend for the State&rsquo;s investment in infrastructure, as demonstrated by either provision of housing at scale at certain prices, a proportionate reduction in house prices across all of the homes being facilitated or a specified number of homes which will benefit from a larger price reduction.

However, Rebuilding Ireland is focused on accelerating delivery of housing across all tenures and a comprehensive programme of action is well underway, which will see investment of more than &euro;6 billion to deliver 50,000 social housing homes nationally, through build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing, over the period to 2021. With the increased national targets and additional funding under Rebuilding Ireland, targets for 2018 to 2021 are now being finalised with local authorities. </p>  <p>  In addition to the provision of adequate funding, the availability of suitable lands for development is key to ensuring the delivery of sufficient housing supply.  All local authorities have been requested to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for residential lands in their ownership to ensure they are brought forward for development at the earliest opportunity. The Plans for Wexford will be reviewed by my Department once received. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department is in receipt of a large volume of applications for funding across a wide range of capital and current related housing programmes for all local authorities, including Wexford County Council. Therefore, my Department is not in a position to provide details of all applications received from the Council. </p>  <p>  In relation to applications made, my Department has approved a range of projects for Wexford County Council and those in the pipeline can be viewed in the latest status report for social housing construction projects, as at end Q3 2017, which is available on my Department's website at the following weblink:  http://www.housing.gov.ie/housing/rebuilding-ireland/minister-murphy-announces-additional-eu100m-housing-and-homelessness-2017.  </p>  <p>  The Q3 2017 report details 772 schemes recently completed, on site, or undergoing planning, design or procurement, which will deliver some 12,300 homes across all local authorities.  </p>  <p>  The report shows a significant level of activity being undertaken by Wexford County Council, in conjunction with Approved Housing Bodies, across 38 projects delivering in the region of 390 homes. In addition, the Council is undertaking feasibility work on  a number of further  projects, with the potential to deliver almost 180 additional homes.</p>  <p>  In relation to full year outputs for 2017, provisional details on the number of social housing homes delivered across the country, were published on 15 January 2018. A breakdown of these homes, in terms of build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing, across all local authority areas, including Wexford, will be made available shortly, following completion of the necessary validation process.</p></reply>

Accordingly, under the vacant site levy provisions, there will be a cumulative effect associated with not activating a site for development purposes for each year that a site remains vacant or idle.</p>  <p>  As announced in Budget 2018, it is proposed to increase the rate of levy from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020 in respect of sites included on the local vacant site registers in 2019. Legislative provision for this increase along with amendments to other relevant provisions will be tabled by way of Seanad amendments to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, which is presently at Seanad Committee Stage. These amendments are currently being drafted by my Department in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.</p>  <p>  With regard to addressing the issue of the hoarding of residentially zoned land, a number of amendments to the provisions relating to the extension of duration of planning permissions have also been tabled in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016. The amendments proposed are collectively aimed at tightening up the provisions in relation to the extension of duration of planning permissions and ensuring that extensions of duration, without commencing substantial development, will no longer be facilitated.</p>  <p>  Following a commitment given in Budget 2015, a public consultation was conducted by the Department of Finance on the issue of unused zoned and serviced land with a view to examining what taxation measures might be taken to penalise land owners who do not develop such land.  On considering the outcome of the public consultation and further to the enactment of the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 which introduced the vacant site levy, the Department of Finance determined that no new tax intended to encourage the development of residentially zoned and serviced land - separate to the vacant site levy - would be introduced at that time. </p>  <p>  In relation to a land tax, in the 2012 Report of the Inter-departmental Group on the Design of a Local Property Tax (the "Thornhill Group"), the basis of assessment for the Local Property Tax (LPT) was comprehensively examined, including both the "taxable value of the property" option and a site value tax (SVT). The report favoured the use of market value of residential properties as the basis of assessment and this recommendation was accepted by the Government.</p>  <p>  The Thornhill Group concluded that the arguments for SVT were outweighed by the likely difficulties in ensuring acceptance by taxpayers, i.e. arriving at values that were evidence based, understandable and acceptable to the public in addition to complexities and uncertainties in the valuation effort necessary to put an SVT in place. In contrast, the Group considered that, under a market value approach applied to housing, the market value of a residential property would be related to the characteristics of the building itself, the site on which it was located and the characteristics and amenities of the neighbourhood. There would be a relationship between the market value of a house and benefits to the owners in terms of enjoyment of the amenity value of the properties. </p>  <p>  Subsequently, at the request of the Minister for Finance, the operation of the LPT was reviewed in 2015 by Dr. Thornhill. A number of submissions to the review favoured changing the basis of determination of LPT liabilities to site value, floor area or variations thereof. Dr. Thornhill considered these but remained of the view that market value is the most appropriate and equitable basis on which to determine LPT liabilities.</p>  <p>  Tax issues are a matter for the Minister for Finance and neither I nor my Department have been lobbied in relation to the possible introduction of a land tax.</p></reply>

The Task Force was requested to oversee and report on these initial actions as well as reviewing existing arrangements and systems for fire safety and related issues which impact on fire safety in Ireland.  As it carries out its work, the Task Force is considering information and developments arising from inquiries and reviews in the UK of the Grenfell Tower fire.</p>  <p>  This initial work in relation to both multi-storey social housing buildings and medium to high rise buildings has been carried out and all local authorities have reported back to my Department as requested. The Fire Safety Task Force established two sub-groups which have reviewed the returns received. </p>  <p>  The returns indicate that multi-storey social housing buildings in Ireland are generally designed, built and equipped appropriately for domestic fire risk, although a number of fire safety issues were identified and followed up. </p>  <p>  In the category of medium to high rise buildings (greater than 6 stories or 18 m high), more than 800 buildings were identified  through the national survey undertaken. A number of these were identified as having external cladding which gave rise to concerns and in these cases building owners have been required by local authorities, using their powers under the Fire Services Act, to undertake fire safety assessments in these specific buildings. National guidance on further actions in light of the results of these fire safety assessments, taking account of emerging information on the cladding issue from international sources, was prepared by the Task Force Sub-Group and was published by my Department in  December 2017. The assessment process in individual buildings, and remediation work where deemed necessary in a small number of buildings, is on-going and may continue for some time. </p>  <p>  The intended preparation of an interim report from the Task Force was impacted by a number of severe weather events in late 2017, including ex-Hurricane Ophelia, which required temporary re-prioritising of the National Directorate&rsquo;s resources. However, the work of the Task Force has now advanced significantly and I expect to be provided with their report in the next few weeks. When I have had time to consider the Report and its recommendations, I will decide on and announce follow-up actions aimed at further enhancing fire safety in Ireland.</p></reply>

Local authorities were engaging with the property owners in relation to 573 properties, 31 agreements for lease had been signed and 9 homes had been delivered and tenanted.

At the Housing Summit held on 22 January 2018, local authority Chief Executives were advised that, from 1 February 2018, a number of key changes were being made to the scheme. These include:</p><p>- a reduction in the minimum lease term required from 10 to 5 years;</p><p>- increasing the proportion of market rent available to property owners where they take on more responsibilities under the tenancy, meaning that up to 92% of market rent will be available; and</p><p>- provision of additional funding for property owners, over and above the current &euro;40,000 limit, where the dwelling is a bedsit type dwelling being brought into compliance with the Standards for Rented Houses Regulations and made available for social housing. </p><p>Funding of &euro;32m is available for RLS for 2018 with an overall target of 800 dwellings. The target number of social houses to be delivered across all delivery mechanisms in each Local Authority area out to 2021 was confirmed to each Local Authority on 5 January 2018, with a particular focus on 2018 delivery. Each Local Authority Chief Executive is now required to furnish a report confirming and setting out how their Local Authority will deliver on its social housing target over the coming years. The targets and details of the delivery programme of each Local Authority will then be published.</p></reply>

Section 34 provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination in any notice served. The reason must be one of those set out in section 34; for example, that vacant possession is required for substantial refurbishment of the dwelling.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Acts to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.  Section 56 of the Act provides that, where there is an abuse of the termination procedure in section 34, a tenant may bring a complaint to the RTB on the basis that they have been unjustly deprived of possession of a dwelling by their landlord. </p><p>Notice periods for the termination of a tenancy by a landlord vary, depending on the duration of the tenancy, but periods of up to 224 days are required.  If a landlord is terminating the tenancy on the grounds that he or she intends to substantially refurbish or renovate the dwelling in a way that requires the dwelling to be vacated for that purpose, the notice of termination must include a statement;</p><p>(a)specifying the nature of the intended works and providing a copy of any related planning permission. Where planning permission is not required, the notice or statement must specify the name of the contractor and the proposed dates for the works.</p><p>(b)that the landlord is required to offer to the tenant a tenancy of the dwelling if it becomes available for re-letting within a period of 6 months, subject to certain conditions. </p><p>On 23 November 2017, the RTB published a comprehensive set of guidelines on what constitutes substantial refurbishment or renovation for the purposes of a section 34 ground for tenancy termination. The guidelines are available on the RTB website at the following link:</p><p>I have asked my Department to keep under review whether there is value in placing these guidelines on a statutory footing.</p><p>As this is a matter between landlord and tenant, it would be inappropriate for me to intervene or comment on any specific case.</p></reply>

Given the &euro;116 billion taxpayer spend envisaged, the Government believes that it is essential that citizens understand how and where this investment will be made and how it will impact on their lives.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">To this end, a comprehensive citizen awareness programme has been developed for the plan, with the goal of informing as many citizens as possible, creating awareness of the plan and enhancing citizen engagement with the detail in it relating to their lives.  While the full spend will not be finalised until the end of the campaign, an indicative budget of &euro;1.5m has been allocated from within the overall &euro;5 million allocation.  The cost for the launch event for the plan was approximately &euro;45,000 ex vat.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  This is a multi-faceted, year-long communications programme, co-ordinated by the Strategic Communications Unit (SCU) in my Department, which </font>uses existing contracts (agency, media buying etc) and<font color="#2F2F2F"> includes the following aspects:</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">- Comprehensive briefings from cross-Government Senior Officials</font></p><p>- Regional Launch Events</p><p>- Sectoral Forums</p><p>- County Forums</p><p>- Online communications programme</p><p>- Production of informational videos</p><p>- National and Regional Outdoor campaign</p><p>- National and Local Print Media - Content Partnerships</p><p>- Cinema Campaign</p><p>- Content Partnership with Regional and National Radio Stations.</p><p>No TV Advertising is included in this information programme.</p><p>In keeping with previous National Development Plans, Project Ireland 2040 is being communicated to citizens through media partnerships.  Content partnerships have been established with the following media outlets:</p><p>- Irish Times</p><p>- INM Group</p><p>- Examiner Group</p><p>- Journal Media</p><p>- 30 Regional Newspapers</p><p>- 28 Local and National Radio Stations</p><p>The media buying process to enable this was handled by a third party media buying organization, appointed via an open procurement competition.</p><p>As with previous National Development Plans, all stories run under media partnerships are clearly identifiable as such.</p><p>Each media organisation was provided with a content pack relating to Project Ireland 2040.  Any decisions relating to editorial style were entirely a matter for each organisation.  The SCU had no input in selecting or contacting any external or third party interviewees.  The SCU had no direct contact with regional media organizations.</p><p>In general, funding for campaigns will come from the Strategic Communications budget.  In some cases, there will be a 50/50 split with the relevant Government Department, depending on the nature and scope of the campaign.  As regards printing costs for Project Ireland 2040, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was responsible for the printing costs associated for the National Development Plan and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government was responsible for the costs associated with printing of the National Planning Framework.</p><p>Project Ireland 2040 was launched in Sligo IT on Friday February 16th 2018.  Events of the day included a Government meeting to approve the plan, the actual launch of the plan and a number of media engagements carried out by myself and the Cabinet.  My Department was responsible for all planning and arrangements for the day.  This involved attendance by the following:</p><p>- 7 Cabinet Secretariat/Protocol staff to support the Cabinet meeting</p><p>- 9 SCU staff to support the launch</p><p>- 5 Officials/advisers with policy responsibility</p><p>- 5 Press Officers to support media engagements</p><p>As the launch is very recent, payments such as travel and subsistence and hotel accommodation have not yet been processed through our financial system.</p><p>In addition to the campaign for Project Ireland 2040 outlined above, the Strategic Communications Unit utilises all media in the course of the delivery of Government priority campaigns.  The choice of media is informed by the nature, subject and reach of the campaign.  As part of the Healthy Ireland Campaign, the SCU with their colleagues in the Department of Health, formed a media content partnership with a national daily newspaper to produce health supplements as part of the campaign.  Similarly, the Unit worked with the Department of Education and Skills on a supplement in a national daily newspaper as part of the Action Plan for Education.</p><p>Costs for these media content partnerships are as follows:<table><tr><th>Newspaper</th><th>Campaign</th><th>Cost</th></tr><tr><td>Irish Independent</td><td>Healthy Ireland</td><td>&euro;96,300 ex vat</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Independent</td><td>Action Plan for Education</td><td>&euro;8,600  ex vat</td></tr></table></p><p>The Project Ireland 2040 campaign is ongoing and is subject to regular review.  Therefore, the cost of media content partnerships is not yet finalised.  It will be published once finalised.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s continuing active engagement in EU Battlegroups enhances our capacity to influence the ongoing development and evolution of the rapid response capacity of the EU, in particular, the role Battlegroups can play in reinforcing and acting as a strategic reserve for UN operations. </p>  <p>  The United Nations strongly supports the development of Battlegroups as a capability that could be made available in support of UN mandated missions. It also supports the development of rapid deployment skills and capabilities within the Defence Forces, together with improved interoperability with like-minded States. Participation in EU Battlegroups further supports Ireland&rsquo;s international security and defence policy and enhances our bilateral relations with contributing Member States.</p>  <p>  To date Ireland has participated in the Nordic Battlegroup in 2008, 2011 and 2015, the Austro-German Battlegroup in 2012 and both the German led and UK led Battlegroups in 2016. The total costs directly associated with Irish participation in the two EU Battlegroups in 2016 is &euro;2.763m.  It should be noted that approximately two thirds of this figure relates to direct payroll costs, which would have been incurred in the normal course. The remaining costs relate to subsistence, allowances, transport, flights and other such costs incurred during the preparation and standby period for the Battlegroup.</p></reply>

The work on elaborating the details of these project proposals and potential participants is currently on-going at EU level and Ireland is playing a full part in those deliberations. Once these deliberations have been completed the next step will be for a Council Decision to approve the first tranche of PESCO projects to be developed along with the project participants. It is anticipated that the Council will be in a position to take that decision in early March 2018.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is difficult at this juncture to make any predictions on costs associated with participation over the next five years.  Any costs incurred by Ireland will be dependent on which projects Ireland chooses to participate in, and the provision of full project plans by the project leads. Project choices will take into account the on-going development of Defence Forces capabilities for peace support and crisis management operations. In any event, costs associated with the development of capabilities would be incurred in the normal course and will therefore be met from within the Defence Vote.</p></reply>

The barbarity of the attacks by the Syrian regime on its own people, the deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure, including homes, hospitals and schools, and the refusal of the Assad regime to allow humanitarian aid in, or injured civilians to leave, has been shocking, even by the standards of the Syria conflict to date. </p>  <p>  I can only imagine how terrifying this is for the people there, who have no way to protect themselves or their children, and no way to leave.</p>  <p>  On numerous occasions in this House, I have condemned the violence in Syria and I reiterate that condemnation in the strongest terms today.</p>  <p>  I attended a UN Security Council briefing on this issue in New York last week, where UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres appealed for an immediate suspension of violence in Eastern Ghouta to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid, and for evacuations. Ireland strongly endorsed this call, and welcomed the adoption of a UN Security Council resolution on Saturday that called for an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian access. However, the bombardment of Eastern Ghouta has continued in defiance of this resolution. The international community must redouble its efforts to press for a full and immediate ceasefire, and unhindered humanitarian access to besieged populations in Syria. </p>  <p>  The brutal repression of dissent by the Assad regime since March 2011 has cost the lives of almost half a million people so far. Over 13 million people require humanitarian assistance, including close to 3 million people trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas. In addition, 5.5 million Syrians have fled to neighbouring countries and the region. </p>  <p>  The Assad regime and its allies have repeatedly targeted civilians, including through use of &ldquo;starve or surrender&rdquo; techniques, forced displacement under the guise of truces, denial of humanitarian assistance and deliberate attacks on civilian infrastructure such as schools, markets and hospitals. </p>  <p>  Clearly an end to the conflict, and to Assad&rsquo;s barbarous rule, is urgently needed. Ireland fully supports the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254, which call for an end to violence; full humanitarian access, a democratic political transition and accountability and transitional justice.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as the situation on the ground justifies these measures. </p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Syria at their informal meeting on 15 February and again at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting on 26 February. Ireland added its voice to calls for the immediate and full implementation of the ceasefire demanded by the UN Security Council.  </p>  <p>  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-brokered talks in Geneva and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground. The EU and its Member States have to date mobilised more than &euro;10.4 billion for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance inside Syria and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort. The EU hosted a donors&rsquo; conference for Syria in April 2017 at which pledges totalling &euro;5.6 billion were made, and will host another donors&rsquo; conference for Syria in April 2018.</p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has contributed over &euro;90 million to the humanitarian effort in response to the conflict in Syria, including &euro;25 million in 2017 alone. Through our annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the Syria crisis. Ireland also supports a broad range of efforts to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria.</p></reply>

In particular, there are serious concerns about the Israeli military court system which is used in relation to Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including children. The same system does not apply to Israeli settlers in the same geographical area. These courts have a near-one hundred percent conviction rate, a statistic which raises serious questions about the system&rsquo;s compliance with international standards of due process.Ireland has raised our concerns at EU level and in international fora. In the most recent Universal Periodic Review of Israel, which took place last month, Ireland raised the issue of administrative detention, and made recommendations on the rights of detainees. During my visit to the Middle East last month, I raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the detention of minors directly with the Israeli authorities, including the issues of night-time arrests and blindfolding. Ireland also provides financial support to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs who are active in bringing these issues to light.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific case raised by the Deputy, the minor was not arrested directly after the incident, but an arrest later took place following political attention being paid to the case in Israel. The arrest was carried out in the middle of the night, and later broadcast on Israeli television. This raises serious concerns. </p>  <p>  Irish and other EU diplomats have attended the person in question&rsquo;s hearings in the military court, as this case has developed. The handling of this case so far is worrying. The minor is being held in Israel, which makes family visits very difficult. She is being held without bail pending trial, which may result in a very long period of detention, on the basis that she is a danger to public safety. This allegation lacks serious credibility.</p>  <p>  The individual&rsquo;s mother and other family members have themselves been arrested and held. The heavy-handed approach to dealing with the minor and her family risks creating an impression that there is an attempt to intimidate or to punish, related to their refusal to stop protesting against the occupation under which they live. </p>  <p>  The Israeli authorities should ensure that all legal proceedings are in accordance with international standards of due process, including especially those related to children. I recall that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child entails obligations to use detention only as a means of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time, in the case of minors. My Department will continue to monitor this and other cases.</p></reply>

My Department is engaging with other Government Departments and, both here on the island of Ireland and through our overseas Embassy network, with a range of individuals, groups and institutions, who are considering and planning conferences, seminars, cultural responses, acts of commemoration and other initiatives to mark the 20<sup>th</sup>anniversary of the achievement of this seminal Agreement.  The Government&rsquo;s programme will include events in Dublin, Washington, London, and Belfast.  These will include a revised production of <i>Rising to Reconciliation</i>, which was developed for the 18<sup>th</sup>anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement and uses poetry, images and music to reflect on the troubled journey towards peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland.  Events to mark the people&rsquo;s vote for the Agreement on the 22<sup>nd</sup>May are also under development. </p><p>While I do not propose to establish a dedicated all party group for the purposes of marking this anniversary, I would be happy to consult and engage with all political parties and other interested stakeholders and have asked my officials to follow up in this regard. </p><p>The events marking this important anniversary will provide an opportunity to reflect on the peace process, past and present; to remember the loss of life during the years of conflict; and to look back at all that has happened on the journey of peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland.  </p><p>This journey is of course an ongoing one, and the continued imperative to work to realise the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement will form an essential part of the Government&rsquo;s approach to the 20<sup>th</sup>anniversary.</p></reply>

The provision of redress is intended to return impacted customers to the position that they would have been in had the relevant issue not arisen and the compensation, which  is to be reasonable, must reflect the detriment involved arising from and/or associated with being on an incorrect rate.

Determinations have issued in respect of 79 of those appeals. On average it took 213 days between the hearing and the determination. It is of note that one of the outstanding determinations relates to an appeal that will directly impact on approximately 350 others.</p><p>The TAC has informed me that these figures do not reflect the complexity of the appeals or the reasons for any possible delay. The TAC advises that hearings can be adjourned for a number of reasons to include the submission of further evidence, for further hearing at a later date, to await the outcome of Court proceedings etc., and of course for consideration by the Commissioner of the appeal prior to the determining of same. I am further advised that in certain circumstances, hearings or determination can take place in respect of part of an appeal; however the appeal will remain open until all issues are concluded. For these reasons, it is not possible for the TAC to estimate how many appeals it intends to hear in 2018. The TAC is seeking to increase its resources and facilities to allow it increase its output and in that regard my Department is currently reviewing a recent request for additional resources from the TAC. </p><p>I am informed that the TAC is increasingly conducting less formal hearings with a view to assisting all parties reach a settlement or agreement more expeditiously. These informal hearings are also being used in order to facilitate the timely progression of appeals and where possible, to agree the main points prior to the formal hearing. In the last year, the TAC has arranged over 200 of these informal hearings which would have directly dealt with 826 individual appeals, notwithstanding that the outcomes of these may have impacted upon other appeals also. Although some remain to take place, the TAC has been able to proceed with 135 informal hearings in relation to 618 individual appeals. A number of these proposed informal hearings have had to be postponed or cancelled at the request of either the Office of the Revenue Commissioners or the appellants. I am informed that it is the TAC&rsquo;s intention to continue with informal hearings, where appropriate, during 2018. </p><p>Following its establishment in 2016, I am informed that approximately 3,322 appeals transferred to the TAC, at various stages during 2016, from both the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of the Appeal Commissioners. The TAC has further advised me that, as of 30 January, it currently has approximately 3,648 appeals.

These forecasts will take account of all policy changes announced since Budget 2018, including the impact of the National Development Plan (NDP).  </p><p>However, the specific impact of the NDP out to 2021 on the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement (EBR) and on fiscal space, based on certain assumptions, is set out in the table.</p><p>The NDP announced four new funds that will begin operating from 2019. These are the Rural, Urban, Innovation and Climate Action Funds. The funds will be partly covered by an unallocated capital reserve in the first instance, leaving an additional cost, which will both pre-commit unallocated fiscal space and worsen the EBR.</p><p>The net nominal EBR increase resulting from the three funds is set out in the last row of the following table:<table><tr><th>New Funds, &euro; millions</th><th>2019</th><th>2020</th><th>2021</th></tr><tr><td>Rural</td><td>55</td><td>80</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Urban</td><td>100</td><td>120</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>Innovation</td><td>20</td><td>30</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>175</td><td>230</td><td>270</td></tr><tr><td>Less Capital Reserve</td><td>-98</td><td>-136</td><td>-94</td></tr><tr><td>Net Increase</td><td>77</td><td>94</td><td>176</td></tr></table></p><p>As the Climate Action Fund, set out in the table below, will be funded from the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) levy, it will have no impact on Voted Expenditure or the EBR.<table><tr><th>&euro; millions</th><th>2019</th><th>2020</th><th>2021</th></tr><tr><td>Climate Action Fund</td><td>20</td><td>30</td><td>40</td></tr></table></p><p>In calculating the impact on net fiscal space under the Expenditure Benchmark, it is assumed that both the Urban and Rural Funds will be recorded as gross fixed capital formation (i.e. subject to &lsquo;capital smoothing&rsquo; over four years) and that the Innovation and Climate Action Funds will be treated as capital grants (i.e. not smoothed). A further assumption is that the funding from the capital reserve will offset the Rural and Urban Funds.</p><p>Should the operation of the funds change these assumptions then the figures below will need to be amended.</p><p>The cost, in fiscal space terms, of the four funds is therefore:<table><tr><th>&euro; millions</th><th>2019</th><th>2020</th><th>2021</th></tr><tr><td>Fiscal Space Used</td><td>54</td><td>36</td><td>54</td></tr></table></p></reply>

At its simplest, an individual who might otherwise be engaged as an employee by the end-user of his or her services provides the services to the end-user through an intermediary.  Typically the intermediary used in such circumstances is a company.  The company can take the form of a personal services company (PSC), with only one worker who is also a director.  The company earns all, or almost all, of its income from supplying the services of the worker/director to the end user.  A variation on the PSC arrangement is a managed service company (MSC), which supplies the services of more than one individual.</p>  <p>  I understand that the UK tax authority, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has recently been successful in the appeal case referred to by the Deputy. This appeal was taken by an intermediary company which had a contract with a television company in relation to the provision of the services of a journalist.</p>  <p>  The appeal case related to a charge to tax and national insurance contributions arising under specific UK tax and social security legislation relating to the supply of a person&rsquo;s services through an intermediary.  In summary, Chapter 8 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act, 2003 and the Social Security Contributions (Intermediaries) Regulations 2000 provide that where the services of an individual are supplied through an intermediary to an end-user in certain circumstances, the intermediary company is required to treat all payments and benefits, including for example dividends, made to that individual as employment earnings and to deduct and remit PAYE income tax and national insurance contributions accordingly. Those circumstances are where the individual would be regarded for income tax and national insurance purposes as an employee of the end-user if the services were provided under a contract directly between the end-user and the individual. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that we have no comparable legislation in Ireland governing the taxation of individuals engaged through intermediary companies.  As a consequence, there is no basis for Revenue to seek to ignore contractual arrangements entered into by such a company and to apply the tax treatment that gave rise to the appeal.</p>  <p>  In relation to the question of an investigation or audit, I am further advised by Revenue that it cannot comment on matters relating to any specific identified taxpayer or narrowly defined group of taxpayers.  However, in the absence of legislation similar to that referred to above, there is no statutory basis for Revenue to take the approach that gave rise to the recent UK appeal.</p>  <p>  In January I, along with my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, published a report informed by the public consultation on the use of intermediary-type structures and self-employment arrangements. The consultation invited submissions on possible measures to address the loss to the Exchequer that may arise under various scenarios including where an individual, who would otherwise be an employee of an end user, provide his or her services to that end user through an intermediary vehicle.</p>  <p>  The report concludes that the major part of the Exchequer loss is attributable to the much lower social insurance contribution payable by self-employed individuals as compared with aggregate total social insurance contribution paid by and in respect of employees.  It therefore recommends that the most effective step to take is to consider reducing the differential in social insurance rates.  </p>  <p>  The report also examined options to address this challenge by providing that, in certain circumstances where an individual is engaged through an intermediary and that engagement bears the characteristics of dependent employment by the end user of the person&rsquo;s services, that end-user would be required to deduct income tax and PRSI under the PAYE system. The report recommended that such proposals should be further explored and would have potential to reduce the scope for aggressive tax planning.  </p>  <p>  I am examining these recommendations along with my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to review individual cases as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that should apply in such cases.  </p>  <p>  However, I wish to inform the Deputy that issues faced by returned emigrants, both from EU and non-EU countries, featured prominently in the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s examination of the motor insurance sector.  Accordingly, Recommendation 6 of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance aims to address the problems faced by this category of drivers.  Pursuant to this recommendation, a protocol has been agreed between the Department and Insurance Ireland under which insurance companies have committed to accepting the driving experience returning emigrants gained while abroad, when the driver has had previous driving experience in Ireland.  The guiding principle of the protocol is to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated any differently to any other driver subject to their ability to demonstrate, and the insurance company to verify, continuous driving experience and the normal acceptance criteria of the company.  What this means is that the returning emigrant will not be disadvantaged from spending time abroad.  Furthermore, under the protocol insurance companies will not distinguish between countries on the basis of which side of the road driving takes place therein or, indeed, whether the country is a member of the EU or not.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, insurance companies have agreed to provide relevant and helpful information on their websites to make it easier for consumers to understand the implications of their move abroad from a motor insurance perspective.  As part of this exercise, they will outline what people need to do under a number of different circumstances depending on the length of time they intend being away from Ireland. </p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland submitted a report on the implementation of this recommendation to the Department of Finance on 22 December 2017.  This report confirmed that Insurance Ireland members have agreed to publish the wording of the agreed protocol on their company websites and any other forms of social media, in addition to providing training for staff who can work through issues with emigrants before they leave, whilst they are out of the country and when they return to Ireland.  The stated intention is &ldquo;to resolve any issues well before they arise and for the consumer to be aware of the considerations when moving abroad&rdquo;.  The wording of the agreed protocol is also available on the Insurance Ireland website. </p>  <p>  The report also outlines some sample cases which demonstrate how the rolling-out of the protocol has already led to disputed cases being resolved to the benefit of returning emigrants, and provides figures indicating that the number of such cases being processed under the Declined Cases Agreement is decreasing.</p>  <p>  If, however, a returning emigrant is unable to secure a motor insurance quotation on the open market, they may be in a position to avail of the Declined Cases Agreement process, and the relevant contact details are: declined@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914.

The event, which was hosted by my colleague Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD, is now in its third year and is a key deliverable as part of the Government&rsquo;s International Financial Services 2020 (IFS2020) Strategy. The organisation and execution of the Forum is the responsibility of IDA Ireland, with input where required from Departments and agencies as part of IFS2020.</p>  <p>  The international financial services (IFS) industry is an important pillar of the Irish economy, directly employing over 42,000 people across the country. The employment is a mix of those working for international firms that have chosen to locate activities in Ireland and indigenous Irish firms that export internationally traded financial services.</p>  <p>  The current Government Strategy for the IFS sector, IFS2020, was developed in 2015 to address the challenges of growing the sector at a time of unprecedented change. The IFS2020 Strategy is led by Minister D&rsquo;Arcy with the purpose of protecting and growing employment in IFS companies in the IDA and Enterprise Ireland portfolio. The vision of IFS2020 is for Ireland to be the location of choice for specialist international financial services, building on our strengths in talent, technology, innovation and excellent client services, while focusing on capturing new opportunities in a changing market and embracing the highest forms of governance.</p>  <p>  The EFF 2018 was a tremendous success with over 700 domestic and international delegates in attendance. The core function of the event is to promote Ireland as a location for IFS. This is achieved by bringing together the leading organisations in the public and private sector to discuss the future of the European financial system. In doing so, the Forum highlights the commitment of the Government of Ireland to the European project and the range of IFS activities that are carried out from here. The Forum also highlights the commitment of the Government of Ireland to the sector and the partnership approach it adopts with industry to grow the sector in Dublin and throughout the country.</p>  <p>  The 2018 Forum was opened by An Taoiseach and featured keynote addresses from Philip Lane; Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, Colm Kelleher; President of Morgan Stanley, and Beno&igrave;t C&oelig;ur&eacute;; Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank to name a few.</p>  <p>  As part of the Forum, I had the pleasure of delivering a keynote closing address and having an on-stage conversation alongside Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President for the Euro and Social Dialogue, also in charge of Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union at the European Commission. This provided the opportunity for both the Vice President and I to share our perspectives on the policy and regulatory developments impacting financial services in Europe today and in the year ahead. It was particularly notable as the Vice President delivered his first public remarks on the final report of the High Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, an area of key importance for the future of finance. Ireland offers a unique blend of expertise and a proven track record in the area of green and sustainable finance, with a globally-recognised cluster of talent in renewable energy finance and experience in green asset management, and I welcomed the Vice President&rsquo;s statement.</p>  <p>  The European Financial Forum, as a Government-led initiative, is a unique event that is emerging as a fixture in the international media. Having the Forum as an annual event serves as a focal point for the work of the IFS2020 strategy and provides a platform to respond to significant events such as Brexit.</p>  <p>  Preliminary planning for the 2019 Forum is currently underway, led once again by IDA Ireland. We hope that the 2019 EFF will build on the continued success of the EFF as a showcase for Ireland&rsquo;s financial services environment and Ireland as a location for high-quality investment.</p></reply>

As it was a Maltese incorporated company, the liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that under the Insurance Act 1964, as amended, monies may be paid out of the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF), with the approval of the High Court, in relation to an insolvent insurer, to meet claims up to a limit of 65% or &euro;825,000 of the claim, whichever is the lesser.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of my decision in principle that the State will ensure that Setanta third party claimants are compensated in full, which was announced on 30 January. The Department of Finance is now working through the detailed arrangements to implement this decision, which is likely to require legislative change.  In this regard, the next step is to give consideration as to whether there is any state aid or other legal issue associated with the proposed approach.  The Department is currently working with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office on this issue and once the position is clarified I can give an indication of the likely timeline for payment, including the payment of the additional 35% to those who have settled their claims and have already received compensation of 65% of their claim subject to the limit outlined above.</p>  <p>  The liquidator for Setanta Insurance has informed me that as of 31 December 2017, there are 1,577 active claims, of these 573 claimants have been paid compensation from the ICF subject to the 65%/&euro;825,000 limit.</p>  <p>  No date has been fixed for the next payment from the ICF, but the Liquidator has informed me that preparatory work is underway in respect of some 275 claims to the value of c &euro;5.8m, with a view to the Accountant to the High Court making an application before the end of March. These  payments will be paid subject to 65%/&euro;825,000 limit. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that only claims which have been settled can be included in applications to the High Court for payment from the ICF. The process of settling claims is still ongoing and is subject in some cases to complex negotiations between all relevant parties. It is hoped that by the State taking steps to ensure that third party claimants are compensated in full, this will encourage the settlement of all outstanding claims as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

The Central Bank has no jurisdiction over unregulated third parties and, consequently, has no power to either impose requirements on or investigate the activities of such unregulated loan owners.  </p><p>Regulated credit servicing firms are firms who manage or administer loans on behalf of the unregulated firm and such firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;, such as the Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.  Again, however, the requirements of the CCMA only apply to the regulated firm and not the unregulated loan owner.

This is an EU competency and the Government has committed to work with our EU counterparts in seeking to reform this area. </p>  <p>  Defibrillators, other than implantable defibrillators, are liable to VAT at the standard rate, which in Ireland is 23%. Parts or accessories are also liable to VAT at the standard rate. There is no provision under existing VAT law that would make it possible to apply a reduced rate or zero rate to the supply of such products. Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rate on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. As such a zero rate cannot be applied to defibrillators. Any changes to VAT rates outside of what is currently permitted by the EU VAT Directive must be negotiated at EU technical working groups and ultimately agreed by the EU Council of Finance Ministers.</p>  <p>  As part of the Action Plan on the future of VAT launched on 7 April 2016, which sets out the Commission&rsquo;s pathway for modernising the VAT system, the EU Commission published its proposal on the structure of VAT rates on January 18, 2018. Technical and political discussions have commenced at EU Council among all Member States and as these discussions progress Ireland will take the opportunity to continue to recommend that Member States should be able to apply specialised VAT rating to defibrillators and other emergency-medical and rescue equipment.</p>  <p>  In advance of any change that might be made at EU level to the VAT rating of defibrillators and other products that pose difficulty for community groups, I am happy to draw your attention to the Budget 2018 announcement of a VAT compensation refund scheme, which will compensate charities for the VAT they occur on their inputs, in recognition of the work undertaken by the charities sector.  </p>  <p>  The scheme will take effect from 1 January 2018 but will be paid one year in arrears. That is, charities may make a claim in 2019 for VAT costs arising in 2018. Charities will be entitled to a proportion of VAT based on the level of non-public funding they receive. A capped fund of &euro;5 million will be available to the scheme in 2019.

This new calculation is similar to that used by the European Central Bank.  It takes into account the size and risk of credit institutions, the Central Bank&rsquo;s role in their supervision within the Single Supervisory Mechanism but also reflects the Central Bank&rsquo;s consumer protection, anti-money laundering and financial stability mandates.

This framework was required to counter potential large scale sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland, where lower sulphur standards apply.</p><p>Since its introduction in 2010 to the end of 2017, Carbon tax receipts amounted to almost &euro;2.9bn.These figures include receipts from Solid Fuel Carbon tax of &euro;91.6m from 2013 to 2017. Further information on Carbon tax receipts is published on the Revenue statistics website at: </p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The current VAT rate on solid fuel in the State is 13.5%. The rate of VAT on solid fuel in Northern Ireland is currently 5%.  There is not, at present, a comparable carbon tax regime in place in Northern Ireland.Based on the current rate of Carbon Tax in this State of &euro;20 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>emitted, the specific rates for Solid Fuel Carbon Tax are as follows:</p><p>Coal:&euro;52.67 per tonne</p><p>Peat:&euro;36.67 per tonne (peat briquettes)</p><p>&euro;17.99 per tonne (milled peat)</p><p>&euro;27.25 per tonne (other peat)</p><p>Certain solid fuels, primarily coal, are regulated under the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels Regulations) 2012 (SI No. 326 of 2012), as amended.  These Regulations are enforced and applied by local authorities under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  </p><p>The following aspects of the Solid Fuel Carbon Tax should be noted:</p><p>- Solid Fuel Carbon Tax is payable by a taxable person who makes a first supply of solid fuel in the State;</p><p>- every supplier who intends to make a first supply of solid fuel in the State must register with Revenue for the purposes of the tax;</p><p>- liability to Solid Fuel Carbon Tax does not arise on the physical presence of the goods in the territory of the State, but on supply in the State by the taxable person who is obliged to make a return and pay the tax one month after the two-month accounting period;</p><p>- a supplier based outside of the State who brings solid fuel into the State for sale direct to the public, must register for SFCT with Revenue; </p><p>- the tax is not payable by private individuals travelling to the North to collect solid fuel for their personal consumption, provided the private individual accompanies the fuel back into the State;</p><p>- persons extracting peat in this State for their own use and not for supply are not liable to SFCT tax and are not required to register with Revenue.</p><p>The Solid Fuel Carbon Tax is applied using Revenue&rsquo;s standard model of self assessment with liable taxpayers subject to the possibility of Revenue audit of Solid Fuel Carbon tax returns.  It is important to note that European Union Single Market constraints preclude the use of any cross-border movement controls in the administration of this tax.  Under EU law, the tax cannot give rise to trade restrictions or intra-EU formalities.  While Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel, such authority would not be relevant from the point of view of enforcing Solid Fuel Carbon Tax, given that liability does not arise on the physical presence of the goods in the territory of the State.  Liability arises on the first supply of the solid fuel in the State by the taxable person who is obliged to make a return and pay the tax one month after expiry of the two &ndash; month accounting period.  This means that collection of the tax is heavily reliant on the regulatory regime for sales of certain solid fuels operated by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and enforced by local authorities.  I understand that there is ongoing contact between Revenue and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in relation to this area.</p><p>Data is not available on the amount of solid fuel sold between Northern Ireland and this State.  </p><p>The serious threat that fiscal fraud poses to legitimate business, to consumers and the Exchequer is recognised and I am advised by Revenue that tackling this criminal activity has been one of its priorities over recent years.  There is extensive formal and informal cooperation in place between Revenue and the UK tax authority, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), which is the responsible tax authority in Northern Ireland.  Where appropriate, this also includes An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  The aim of this cooperation is to target the organised crime groups responsible for a large proportion of criminal activity, including activities aimed at combatting fiscal fraud as it relates to a range of excisable products such as mineral oils, tobacco products and alcohol.  The setting up in 2016, within the framework of &ldquo;A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan&rdquo;, of a Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their Northern Ireland counterparts was a further step in supporting and facilitating such cross border cooperation.  </p><p>Mutual Assistance procedures are also in place in both Revenue and HMRC which can support specific compliance interventions (including audits) relating to the tax affairs of any specific person.</p><p>I am advised that there has not, to date, been specific consultation between Revenue and HMRC in relation to the carbon tax and VAT aspects of the solid fuel sector.  In this regard it should be noted that there is not, at present, a comparable carbon tax regime in place in Northern Ireland for the sale of solid fuels.</p><p>Revenue also works in close cooperation with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office, and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat both the illicit fuel and tobacco trades.</p></reply>

The Act provides a very broad definition of public bodies at Section 6(1) and a body meeting that definition is an FOI Body unless they are otherwise explicitly exempted.</p>  <p>  The Act further provides that all new public bodies comprehended by this definition will automatically come under freedom of information (FOI) legislation, unless specifically exempted by order. This reversed the system under previous legislation whereby new bodies would have to be brought into the scope of the legislation by order. The Act also provides the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with the power to make an order bringing a body under the Commissioner's remit if it is financed, wholly or partly, or directly or indirectly by means of monies provided by a Minister of the Government.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the entities referred to by the Deputy, the Irish Environmental Network is an umbrella organisation comprising some 30 non-Governmental organisations.  A preliminary analysis indicates that these organisations are charities or not-for-profit bodies and it is unlikely that they would meet the criteria set out in Section 6(1) of the Act.  However, it would be a matter for the organisations themselves in the first instance to decide whether they are comprehended by section 6(1) of the Act or not should they receive a request under the Act.  Where there are differing views on the status of a body, it is open to the requestor to seek the view of the Information Commissioner on the matter. </p></reply>

This aligns with the most recent projection for Ireland's potential growth from the European Commission for Ireland for the 2020s.</p><p>The level of Exchequer investment that would equate to a 4 per cent share of projected GNI* - using the projections adopted in the NDP - and projected GDP - assuming nominal GDP growth of 4 per cent for the period 2022 - 2027, as well as the total for the ten-year period are set out in the following table.  The level of Exchequer investment set out in the NDP is also included in the table for the Deputy's convenience.<table><tr><th>&euro;   Billion</th><th>2018</th><th>2019</th><th>2020</th><th>2021</th><th>2022</th><th>2023</th><th>2024</th><th>2025</th><th>2026</th><th>2027</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Investment   proposed under the NDP</td><td>5.8</td><td>7.3</td><td>7.9</td><td>8.6</td><td>8.9</td><td>9.4</td><td>10.0</td><td>10.5</td><td>11.0</td><td>11.6</td><td>91.0</td></tr><tr><td>Investment at   4% of GNI*</td><td>8.0</td><td>8.3</td><td>8.6</td><td>9.0</td><td>9.3</td><td>9.7</td><td>10.1</td><td>10.5</td><td>10.9</td><td>11.4</td><td>95.8</td></tr><tr><td>Investment at   4% of GDP</td><td>12.1</td><td>12.6</td><td>13.1</td><td>13.7</td><td>14.2</td><td>14.8</td><td>15.4</td><td>16.0</td><td>16.6</td><td>17.3</td><td>145.7</td></tr></table></p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the December 2016 report of the Economic Statistics Review Group recommended the use  of GNI* as the most accurate measure of the size of the Irish economy.  Increasing public capital investment too much or too quickly could heighten overheating risks and exacerbate capacity constraints in the economy.  Potential overheating risks were addressed as part of the review of the capital plan as published in September.  This highlights the importance of adopting a prudent and measured approach to increased public capital spending as reflected in the National Development Plan in circumstances where there is some uncertainty regarding the cyclical position of the economy and the risk that the continuation of strong economic growth could result in overheating of the economy.</p></reply>

I do not have a role in respect of applications or proposals for individual projects at county level. </p>  <p>  The ten-year National Development Plan (NDP) has been put in place to underpin the implementation of the National Planning Framework (NPF) to support the development of all counties and regions, both urban and rural areas.</p>  <p>  The NDP sets out an investment programme of &euro;116 billion, aligned to the ten National Strategic Outcomes (NSOs) detailed in the NPF which are critical to long-term economic, social and environmental sustainability in the period to 2040.  Investment in urban and rural regeneration and development, drawing on two new Funds with total resources of &euro;3 billion established for this purpose have the potential to have a transformative impact on both urban and rural areas and communities countrywide.</p>  <p>  Total funding of &euro;8.8 billion is allocated to the NSO of strengthened rural economies and communities which is a cornerstone of NDP, including in relation to the delivery of the National Broadband Plan and significant investment in regional and local roads.  The NDP also contains, as a priority, increased investment in public transport including train fleets.  </p>  <p>  Chapter 5 of the NDP details as a fundamental objective of the Plan the investment planned in enhancing regional growth potential through an integrated programme of measures including, for example, regional sectoral clustering and the promotion of entrepreneurship on a regional basis.  The Plan also highlights the importance of strengthening Ireland's international connectivity through continued investment in ports and airports, including under the Regional Airports Programme.  It sets out the major programme of investment planned in the heritage area including in national parks and nature reserves.  Continued investment over the ten years of the Plan to ensure the sustainable management of water resources is a further investment priority which is clearly relevant to all regions and counties.  Finally the Plan sets out the investments planned in the areas of quality childcare, education and health services which are a defining characteristic of attractive, successful and competitive places.</p>  <p>  Under the NPF, and as set out in section 6.3 of the NDP, the three Regional Assemblies are now tasked with co-ordinating, promoting and supporting the strategic planning and sustainable development of their regions, consistent with the objectives of the NPF, through the preparation of Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES).  The RSES for the Southern Region provides the opportunity for the priorities for County Wexford, for example, that are included in the existing Wexford County Development Plan, to focus on sustainable growth, quality of life and on achievable employment and population growth within Wexford and the Southern Region to be integrated into a regional investment plan which is expected to be a major driver of the implementation of the NPF.</p></reply>

Consultants Mott Mc Donald are leading on the design of the flood defences element with Roughan O&rsquo;Donovan commissioned to design the proposed new road bridge. Initial site investigations have been completed, along with archaeological and ecological assessments and reports. An advance programme to control and eradicate invasive species of vegetation is currently underway.  Further advance construction elements which involve relocation of services and utilities along the Promenade is expected to commence in 2018.</p>  <p>  It is proposed that a month-long public information event will take place in Enniscorthy in early Summer at which the scheme design and Environmental Impact Assessment Report and other relevant reports will be made available to the public. This event will be advertised and all stakeholders will be notified in advance. Following this event, comments received will be assessed, and designs may be amended as a result. Subsequently, formal Confirmation or approval for the scheme will be sought from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, with construction expected to start in mid to late 2019.</p></reply>

Having visited the area the following day I saw at first hand the extensive damage and disruption caused by this flood event, particularly to the community in the Inishowen Peninsula area. </p><p>A national study to assess and propose measures to manage Ireland&rsquo;s flood risk is being undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW) through its Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme. The CFRAM Programme is focussing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, designated in 2012 as being at potentially significant risk of flooding. The flood risk for each of these areas has been assessed, through detailed engineering techniques to assess their risk and impact from flooding. This risk and the proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified to manage that risk are outlined in the Flood Risk Management Plans. </p><p>Carndonagh, Clonmany and Buncrana-Luddan are three communities that have been studied as part of the North Western &ndash; Neagh Bann CFRAM Programme.</p><p>In relation to Carndonagh, the Plans propose measures consisting of using storage areas along with a series of embankments and walls along the Donagh River. Improved channel conveyance would protect properties impacted by flooding from the Carndonagh watercourse and hard defences would protect properties impacted by flooding from the Glennagannon River. Proposed plans for Buncrana &ndash; Luddan consists of a series of sea walls, flood embankments and floodwalls to protect against coastal and fluvial flood events. </p><p>While the houses in question in Elm Park are in the Buncrana &amp;amp; Luddan AFA, the current proposed measures does not protect these houses. However, when a scheme for Buncrana &amp;amp; Luddan is progressed to detailed design, the August 2017 flood events will inform the extent of the measures to be implemented to mitigate flood risk in the area.</p><p>Flood Relief Schemes will be subject to project-level development and assessment. Future development and the detailed design for the schemes will take account of recent flood events.</p><p>As the flood risk in Clonmany was assessed as relatively low no structural flood relief schemes are proposed, at this time. The Plans set out those non-structural measures in place or proposed that can benefit all at risk communities and properties, including emergency response, national flood forecasting, individual property protection and community resilience. </p><p>Local flooding issues are a matter, in the first instance, for each Local Authority to investigate and address. Donegal County Council may carry out flood mitigation works using its own resources. The Council may also apply to the Office of Public Works for funding of flood mitigation works under this Office's Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme. The purpose of this scheme, introduced in 2009, is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas. The OPW has approved 32 Minor Works schemes in Donegal at a cost of &euro;1.2m. Details of these schemes are on the OPW website<i>, </i><i><i>www.opw.ie</i></i></p><p>In summer 2017, the OPW finalised all Plans and each Plan was submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (D/PER) for an independent review of the environmental assessments. Having now received the outcomes of the independent review of the environmental assessments for the Flood Risk Management Plans, the Commissioners of Public Works will in the coming weeks submit the Flood Risk Management Plans to the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for approval. </p></reply>

Galway. Many of these properties reverted to the Office of Public Works (OPW) to identify an alternative State use or manage their disposal.</p><p>In 2016, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na/Policing Authority undertook a review of the closed Garda Stations.  In late 2017, the preliminary review initially identified six stations for re-opening.  These were:</p><p>- Ballinspittle, Co. Cork</p><p>- Bawnboy, Co. Cavan</p><p>- Leighlinbridge, Co. Carlow</p><p>- Donard, Co. Wicklow</p><p>- Stepaside, Co. Dublin</p><p>- Rush, Co.

Galway is on hold pending the recommendations arising from the review.</p></reply>

These areas were all stable in terms of population growth, so no new school places were required. However sufficient demand for more choice emerged in 28 areas, including in New Ross. </p>  <p>  In the majority of the 28 areas surveyed where sufficient demand emerged, including New Ross, the level of parental demand for a wider choice indicated a size of a four classroom school being required to accommodate such a level of demand.</p>  <p>  Under the patronage divesting process, a school could be opened where a school building became, or was due to become, available as a result of an amalgamation/closure of an existing school.  In some areas, in responding to demand for diversity where existing patrons were unable make school properties available, my Department also included an examination of properties held in public ownership.</p>  <p>  In order to facilitate the opening of these schools, their initial establishment, as with most new schools, has been in temporary start-up accommodation, pending a permanent school building being made available.  All schools, irrespective of their location, have to operate within their available accommodation and manage annual pupil intake accordingly.</p>  <p>  The initial establishment of these schools as four-classroom schools and the need to be cognisant of managing the available accommodation has been reflected in my Department&rsquo;s engagement with the patron body of the schools, Educate Together.  Indeed, a case has been submitted by Educate Together to my Department to further expand New Ross ETNS and four other schools opened under the patronage divesting process and this is currently under consideration.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently carrying out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to identify areas of demographic growth and determine where additional school accommodation is needed in order to plan for school provision nationwide and this work is almost complete.  In this context, the outcome of the nationwide demographic exercises will input into consideration of the case submitted by Educate Together. </p>  <p>  My Department has announced a new Patronage Reconfiguration process, which will accelerate the delivery of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools, to reach 400 multi-denominational and non-denominational schools by 2030. Unlike the previous process, this plan will focus on live transfers, so that a school which transfers under this process would not be reliant on temporary accommodation.</p></reply>

The LCA programme is a two-year Leaving Certificate programme aimed at preparing students for adult and working life.  The programme sets out to recognise the talents of all students and to provide opportunities for developing personal responsibility, self-esteem and self-knowledge, and to help students apply what they learn to the real world.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility and choice of each individual school to decide to put in place the LCA programme, based on the educational needs and interests of their students.  It is also for schools to decide on the admittance of a student to the programme in their school. Schools are encouraged to provide maximum access to these options and to have clear procedures in place regarding how the available places are allocated to students.</p>  <p>  A grant in respect of the LCA is paid annually to post-primary schools offering the programme in June of each year. It is paid to schools for the pupils enrolled in both year one and year two of the programme.  The rate is &euro;151 per pupil in accordance with Circular letter 0029/2016 which can be accessed on the Department's website.</p>  <p>  In addition to the funding provided, schools that choose to organise the LCA programme are entitled to an additional fixed allocation of 0.5 of a teaching post, over the standard allocation. There is no minimum number of LCA pupils required for schools to secure the additional teaching allocation from my Department. </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to supporting this programme, which is appropriate for members of the student cohort whose needs, aptitudes and learning styles are not fully catered for by the other two Leaving Certificate programmes (Leaving Cert Established and Leaving Cert Vocational Programme). That is why I have asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to consider the LCA, as part of its review of Senior Cycle which commenced in 2017. This review will help to ensure curriculum development continues to respond to the changing needs of learners, society and the economy.</p></reply>

This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p><p>Other children may have such complex needs that the recommendation in their professional reports state that they are best placed in a special school. </p><p>The NCSE is aware of emerging need in the north Dublin area from year to year, and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need.</p><p>The enrolment of a child in a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school. My Department and the NCSE has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools. </p><p>In this regard, where Parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school placement, for the 2018/19 school year, they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process. Contact details are available on <i><i>www.ncse.ie</i></i></p><p>The NCSE is continuing to work with schools, parents, NEPS, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in the North Dublin area for children with special educational needs, to ensure that each child has a school placement appropriate to their needs for the 2018/19 school year.</p><p>The NCSE published guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools which provide information on setting up and organising special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools. These guidelines are available to download from the website <i><i>www.ncse.ie</i></i>.</p><p>During the Committee Stage debate of the School Admissions Bill, I outlined my intention to include a provision that will provide, based on reports and advice from the NCSE, a power for the Minister to require a school to open a special class or increase the number of special classes in schools identified by the NCSE. My Department officials are currently engaging with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the development of legislative proposals on this matter which they hope to bring forward to Government for approval.</p></reply>

It is important to note that all eligible children are accommodated under the terms of the scheme.</p><p>Arising from commitments in the Programme for Government, a review of the Concessionary Charges and Rules element of the School Transport Scheme was undertaken. </p><p>The review was published in December 2016 and made recommendations on both the charges and the rules element of concessionary school transport.  </p><p>With regard to the charges for concessionary school transport the recommended course of action was to continue with the current position whereby charges remain in place for those in receipt of concessionary places.  I agreed with this recommendation on the basis that those applying for concessionary transport are making a conscious decision to do so, understand that they are not eligible for school transport and understand the implications of this choice at the time of application.</p><p>The report also recommended that the number of concessionary places should be reduced in line with the rules introduced in 2012 on a phased basis.  Previous plans to advance this option were put on hold, pending the completion of the review. </p><p>However upon consideration of the review and following discussions with the Cross Party Working Group which I established to feed into the review, I decided that there should be no planned programme of downsizing in the coming years except in line with normal operational decisions within the current scheme.</p><p>The terms of the School Transport Scheme are applied equitably on a national basis.</p></reply>

This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p><p>Other children may have such complex needs that the recommendation in their professional reports state that they are best placed in a special school. </p><p>The NCSE is aware of emerging need in County Kildare from year to year, and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need.</p><p>There are currently 70 special classes in the County, including 62 ASD special classes. A further 282 students, including students with ASD, are placed in 4 special schools in Kildare.</p><p>The enrolment of a child in a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  My Department and the NCSE has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools. </p><p>The parents of the child referred to by the Deputy are encouraged to contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and request assistance in identifying educational placements.  Contact details are available on <i><i>www.ncse.ie</i></i></p><p>The NCSE is continuing to work with schools, parents, NEPS, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in the Kildare area for children with special educational needs, to ensure that each child has a school placement appropriate to their needs for the 2018/19 school year.</p></reply>

It is intended that this could be done through some premium in capitation grants for schools.</p><p>I do recognise the need to improve capitation funding for schools having regard to the reductions that were necessary over recent years. Budget 2018 marks the second year of major reinvestment in the education sector, as we continue to implement the Action Plan for Education, which has the central aim to make the Irish Education and Training service the best in Europe within a decade.  In 2018, the budget for my Department will increase by &euro;554 million to over &euro;10 billion. One of the actions of the 2016-2019 Action Plan is to restore capitation as resources permit. Capitation funding remains a priority for me to address as part of the Action Plan.</p><p>The process is under way for restoring grant funding that is used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff.  Circular 0079/2017 outlines the current rate increases in order to enable schools implement the arbitration salary increase for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation.</p><p>In relation to the timeline for payment of a premium in capitation grants, this can only be determined when there is funding available through the budgetary process for improvements in capitation grants. A decision will have to be taken at that time on whether any such funding should be channelled in the first instance to delivering on the commitment in the Action Plan 2016 to 2019 to restore capitation funding over a 3 year period before looking at premium payments for schools who have adopted the principles of cost effective practice. </p><p>When budgetary resources are available to provide a premium capitation payment for schools, my Department will then consider the most appropriate mechanism to gather evidence on whether or not schools have adopted the principles of cost-effective practice.</p><p>Issues in relation to school costs will also be dealt with through the Parents and Students Charter, which each school will develop and operate, following the enactment of the Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill 2016.</p></reply>

I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers. The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.</p>  <p>  As a result of the changes I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511, at a cost of over &euro;200 million across the public service.</p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010. It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million. Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. </p>  <p>  A commitment is included in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 to consider the issue of newly qualified pay within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement. That process has now commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.  The three teacher unions attended that first meeting.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that within 3 months of the passing of the Act, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service. </p></reply>

It is open to all patrons and prospective patrons to apply for patronage of a school under this process and parental preferences for each patron, along with an analysis of existing provision in the area, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process.</p>  <p>  This process was followed in relation to the decision on the patronage of the new primary school which opened in September 2016 to serve the Drumcondra_Marino_Dublin 1 area.  My Department assessed the applications received from the prospective patrons, including examining the parental preferences received in the applications to ensure they represented children living within the school planning area which the school is set up to serve.  My Department prepared an assessment report for the consideration of the New</p>  <p>  Schools Establishment Group (NSEG) which then submitted a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision. </p>  <p>  The patronage assessment report which is published on my Department's website, while indicating substantial support for an Irish medium school, reflects nearly twice as many valid preferences for an Educate Together school in this area as for a Gaelscoil. I accepted the recommendation of the NSEG and the school under the patronage of Educate Together opened in September 2016.</p>  <p>  While there are three Gaelscoileanna already operating in the area, the NSEG, in their report to me, noted the strong level of demand from parents for Irish-medium education in the area and recommended that this should be kept under review in the context of future demographic exercises. In this regard, my Department is currently carrying out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to identify areas of demographic growth and determine where additional school accommodation is needed in order to plan for school provision nationwide and this work is almost complete. </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>In regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.  In addition, as you will appreciate, in order to deliver an effective policing service, it is essential that Garda management have the flexibility to deploy Garda resources to meet operational policing needs and address critical issues as they arise.  For this reason, the number of Garda available in any one Garda Station on a particular day is subject to the operational requirements of the overall Division.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware Carrigaline Garda Station forms part of the Togher District.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Togher District on 31 January 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 120 of whom 6 are designated Community Garda.  There are also 3 Garda Reserves and 11 Garda civilian staff attached to the Togher District.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom 10 have been assigned to the Togher District.  I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College.  Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda District, including the Togher District.</p><p>In relation to the number of &quot;Community Garda&iacute;&quot; it is important to recognise that community policing is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  The official categorisation as a &quot;Community Garda&quot; simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities including through the giving of talks to schools, community groups and others.  It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.</p><p>I am assured by the Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Overall the Model advocates a partnership based, pro-active, community-orientated style of policing.  It is focused on crime prevention, problem-solving and law enforcement, with a view to building trust and enhancing the quality of life of the entire community.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies. </p><p>As part of the Community Policing Model An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work in partnership with local communities, to prevent and deter crime through initiatives such as Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert, Text Alert and the Garda Schools Programme as well as through more formal structures such as Joint Policing Committees.</p><p>The Community Policing Model also places a strong emphasis on Crime Prevention and within each Garda Division, where there are specialist Crime Prevention Officers (CPOs), who are trained to encourage, promote and advise on crime prevention within communities.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Engagement Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network. </p><p>I have previously stated that I welcome the strong emphasis that the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District.  In terms of progress on this important initiative, I am informed that a draft Community Policing Framework which outlines the manner in which Community Policing Teams will be established has been completed and is subject to internal review before being approved by the Garda Executive for implementation.</p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information I have set out in tabular form the total Garda strength and the Community Garda strength of Carrigaline Garda station for the years 2009 - 2017, and as of 31 January 2018.  I have also set out similar information in relation to the other stations in the Togher Garda District over that period.<table><tr><th>Strength of Carrigaline Garda Station 2009 - 2018*</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Community   Garda&iacute;</td><td>Garda&iacute;</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>1</td><td>19</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>1</td><td>20</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1</td><td>19</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>1</td><td>18</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>1</td><td>20</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>1</td><td>18</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>1</td><td>18</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>1</td><td>19</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>1</td><td>19</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>1</td><td>18</td><td>19</td></tr></table></p><p>*Up to 31 January 2018<table><tr><th>Togher Garda Station 2009 - 2018*</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Community   Garda&iacute;</td><td>Garda&iacute;</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>2</td><td>59</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>2</td><td>58</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>2</td><td>53</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>2</td><td>53</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>2</td><td>49</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>2</td><td>50</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>1</td><td>49</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>2</td><td>44</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>2</td><td>54</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>2</td><td>55</td><td>57</td></tr></table></p><p>*Up to 31 January 2018<table><tr><th>Bishopstown Garda Station 2009 - 2018*</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Community   Garda&iacute;</td><td>Garda&iacute;</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>2</td><td>23</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>2</td><td>20</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>2</td><td>22</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>2</td><td>20</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>2</td><td>19</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>2</td><td>19</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>2</td><td>19</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>2</td><td>19</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>1</td><td>18</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>1</td><td>19</td><td>20</td></tr></table></p><p>*Up to 31 January 2018<table><tr><th>Douglas Garda Station 2009 - 2018*</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Community   Garda&iacute;</td><td>Garda&iacute;</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>2</td><td>20</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>2</td><td>25</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>2</td><td>25</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>2</td><td>24</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>2</td><td>22</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>2</td><td>22</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>2</td><td>19</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>2</td><td>18</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>2</td><td>17</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>2</td><td>18</td><td>20</td></tr></table></p><p>*Up to 31 January 2018</p></reply>

During the section 115A court review, the court considers the reasonableness of the refusal using a balanced range of criteria and has power, if satisfied, to impose the proposed personal insolvency arrangement on the dissenting creditor(s).  This court based review effectively removes the so called &ldquo;Bank Veto&rdquo;.</p><p>Since the introduction of the section 115A court review, 78 cases have been approved by the courts in favour of the debtor.</p><p>Currently, there are over 500 cases before the courts.  A significant High Court judgment in early February addressed two key issues that had become a logjam in the process.  Namely, technical issues around the application for a court review and a fear from personal insolvency practitioners that creditors might pursue them for costs in a personal capacity.  These issues have now been adequately addressed.  The judgment has been positively received by both the Insolvency Service of Ireland and Personal Insolvency Practitioners.  Subject to any possible appeal, it is expected the judgment will lead to increased activity in Personal Insolvency Arrangements. </p><p>The High Court has published a number of important detailed judgments on the criteria that will be applied by the courts in section 115A review cases, and the types of mortgage arrears resolutions that may be imposed.  Those precedents involved the following issues.</p><p>- <b>Separated Spouses - </b>a case involving a separated spouse who restructured her mortgage.  The Court rejected a claim by the bank that, before any restructure, the bank needed the co-operation of the other joint borrower.</p><p><b>- Rejection of unsustainable warehousing proposal and approval for negative equity write-off - </b>a<b></b>case where the mortgage lender wanted to warehouse part of a mortgage. The Court ruled that this could not be done unless there is a reasonable prospect of the couple paying back the warehoused amount.  The Court, instead, imposed the Personal Insolvency Arrangement which wrote off most of the negative equity.</p><p><b>- Fixing interest rate for the long term - </b>a case concerning a mortgage rate fixed for 27 years.  In assessing if this unfairly prejudiced, the financial institution (a fund rather than a bank), the court held that it was appropriate to compare with market investment returns rather than with the interest rates and terms that are available to a bank which also has to raise capital.  The Court decided that the Personal Insolvency Arrangement proposal, including the fixed interest rate, was fair and reasonable in this context and was not unfairly prejudicial.</p><p>Under Abhaile, the Government&rsquo;s national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service, a borrower may apply for legal aid to the Legal Aid Board to seek a court review under section 115A where their proposed Personal Insolvency Arrangement has been rejected by the creditors.</p></reply>

Where a new trend emerges, the ISI will add to the scenarios on its website.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the ISI is not aware of any creditor whose credit guidelines provide debt for equity as a standard offering to personal insolvency practitioners.  However, the ISI is aware of a number of debt for equity solutions that have been proposed by personal insolvency practitioners to cater for the exceptional circumstances of individual debtors.  These proposals are currently subject to the section 115A court review process.  I understand that the ISI will continue to monitor the progress of these cases and will publish such a scenario on its website if cases are successful.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-27a.716.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022700076#WRT02800"><p>The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 has modernised the regime for personal insolvency and brought Ireland in line with international best practice by providing for a range of debt resolution options within a statutory framework which balances the rights of creditors and debtors.  The Personal Insolvency Arrangement, in particular, is an innovative solution that seeks to restructure or settle secured debt. Other important elements of this framework include the statutory protections regarding the debtor's reasonable living expenses and their home.</p>  <p>  Since its establishment in 2013, the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) has returned over 6,000 debtors to solvency with over 2,000 of those cases being Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIAs) which deal with mortgage debt. In over 90% of these PIA cases, debtors have been able to stay in their homes.  This is a significant achievement given that many cases involved arrears exceeding 720 days.</p>  <p>  In addition, the solutions introduced in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 have served as a catalyst for over 120,000 informal agreements between debtors and creditors, as reported by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Debtors now have realistic alternative options available to them through the ISI if negotiations break down.</p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a number of amendments and supports, since 2012, to ensure the success of the solutions provided by the personal insolvency legislation.  These include the section 115A court review process and the Abhaile Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service.</p>  <p>  The section 115A court review process permits a debtor to ask the Court to review and assess the reasonableness of a rejected PIA and, where satisfied as to its reasonableness, make an order confirming the PIA proposal.  This removes the so-called &ldquo;Bank Veto&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Another important enhancement is Abhaile, the Government&rsquo;s national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service.  This was introduced in 2016 to ensure that people who are in danger of losing their home have access to free professional advice, including advice from a personal insolvency practitioner.  In addition to detailed financial advice, Abhaile offers legal advice to homeowners in mortgage arrears with the aim of allowing them to find a solution to their arrears and to stay in their homes where possible.</p>  <p>  Since 2016, the Abhaile Scheme has engaged with over 10,000 people in mortgage arrears, most of them in the chronic arrears category over 360 or 720 days in arrears.  Up to 19 February 2018, Abhaile has provided: </p>  <p>  - financial advice and negotiation help &ndash; through Dedicated Mortgage Advisers working with MABS &ndash; to over 4,900 borrower households in home mortgage arrears;</p>  <p>  - vouchers for professional financial advice and help on home mortgage arrears from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner, to 8,292 borrowers;</p>  <p>  - vouchers for legal advice on home mortgage arrears from a Legal Aid Board solicitor, to 2,285 borrowers;</p>  <p>  - help from a duty solicitor for unrepresented borrowers before a County Registrar&rsquo;s court on home repossession, to over 3,340 borrowers.</p>  <p>  My Department is also finalising a review of the operation of the Personal Insolvency Acts.  The review is taking place under section 141 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, which requires the Minister for Justice and Equality (in consultation with the Minister for Finance) to review the operation of Part 3 of the 2012 Act, and responds to a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p>  <p>  Submissions made by stakeholders via a public consultation on the operation of Part Three of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 contain a range of recommendations to enhance the process and to support increased engagement with the personal insolvency system.  These submissions are being analysed and considered by my Department as part of the review along with recent developments in personal insolvency, including recent High Court judgments related to the process.  I look forward to bringing proposals to Government in the coming months to address the conclusions of the review.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware the Garda Stations of Ballyfermot and Ronanstown form part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West Division. I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the DMR West Division on 31 January 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 667 of whom 64 are designated as Community Garda&iacute;. There are also 26 Garda Reserves and 53 Garda civilian staff attached to the DMR West Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom 137 have been assigned to the DMR West Division. Of these 18 and 14 have been assigned to Ronanstown and Ballyfermot Garda Stations respectively. </p><p>I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the DMR West Division.</p><p>I have requested a report from the Commissioner in relation to the measure in place to tackle antisocial behaviour in the area referred to by the Deputy and I will write directly to the Deputy when the report is to hand.</p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information I have set out below in tabular form the total number of Garda&iacute; and the number of Garda&iacute; categorised as Community Garda&iacute; attached to Ballyfermot and Ronanstown Garda stations as of 31 January 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available.<table><tr><th>Station</th><th>Community Garda&iacute;</th><th>Garda&iacute;</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Ballyfermot</td><td>6</td><td>77</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>Ronanstown</td><td>10</td><td>78</td><td>88</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Theft carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment. For burglary, the maximum penalty is 14 years' imprisonment, and for aggravated burglary, a sentence of up to life imprisonment can be imposed.  In 2015, the law in this area was further strengthened by the introduction of legislation targeting repeat offenders.  The Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015 seeks to ensure that persons awaiting trial for burglary of a dwelling who have recent convictions or pending charges for domestic burglaries can be denied bail in appropriate cases.  The Act also provides for consecutive sentences for prolific burglars of dwellings.  In addition, the Criminal Justice Act 2007 provides for presumptive minimum sentences for certain repeat offences in certain circumstances.  The offences to which these presumptive minimum sentences apply include aggravated burglary. </p>  <p>  I will continue to keep this area of law under review.</p></reply>

Other common reasons for prisoner transfers include court appearances, to participate in a particular training or educational course or to assist in reintegration. Recommendations are also made to me in relation to the transfer of long term sentenced prisoners by the Parole Board.</p><p>When making decisions in relation to the transfer of prisoners for the two categories listed above, a range of factors are taken into consideration including: </p><p>- The safety and best interests of the prisoner</p><p>- The nature and gravity of the offence</p><p>- Length of sentence served to date </p><p>- Length of sentence left to serve </p><p>- Behaviour in prison</p><p>- Prisoner&rsquo;s medical needs</p><p>- Previous criminal record</p><p>- The views of local management and services</p><p>- The capacity of a receiving prison to accommodate a given prisoner</p><p>My statutory powers in relation to decision-making in respect of transfers have been delegated to a number of senior officials in the IPS.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that Douglas, Passage West, Bishopstown, Togher, Carrigaline, Blackrock, Anglesea Street and Crosshaven Garda Stations are located in the Cork City Division.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Cork City Division on 31 January 2018, the latest date for which information is currently available, was 666.  There are also 42 Garda Reserves and 68 Garda civilian staff attached to the Cork City Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 38 have been assigned to the Cork City Division. I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Cork City Division.</p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information I have set out below in tabular form the strength of the Garda stations concerned for the years 2010 to 2017 and as of 31 January 2018.<table><tr><th>Strength of Douglas Garda Station 2010-2018*</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>20</td></tr></table></p><p>*Up to 31 January 2018<table><tr><th>Strength of Passage West Garda Station 2010-2018*</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>2</td></tr></table></p><p>*Up to 31 January 2018<table><tr><th>Strength of Bishopstown Garda Station 2010-2018*</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>20</td></tr></table></p><p>*Up to 31 January 2018<table><tr><th>Strength of Togher Garda Station 2010-2018*</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>57</td></tr></table></p><p>*Up to 31 January 2018<table><tr><th>Strength of Carrigaline Garda Station 2010-2018*</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>19</td></tr></table></p><p>*Up to 31 January 2018<table><tr><th>Strength of Blackrock Garda Station 2010-2018*</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>23</td></tr></table></p><p>*Up to 31 January 2018<table><tr><th>Strength of Anglesea Street Garda Station 2010-2018*</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>275</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>274</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>271</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>278</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>275</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>270</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>282</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>297</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>295</td></tr></table></p><p>*Up to 31 January 2018<table><tr><th>Strength of Crosshaven Garda Station 2010-2018*</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>2</td></tr></table></p><p>*Up to 31 January 2018</p></reply>

My department is continuing to evaluate the scope of the sectors, with a particular focus on the Cash for Gold sector, with a view to determining the level of regulation which will be proportionate and appropriate. </p>  <p>  I am of course keenly aware of the long standing public concern about the way in which Cash for Gold businesses might be abused by criminal elements, particularly burglars. This concern has been highlighted recently in media reports of such abuse. It is, however, important to recognise that regulation of this sector could potentially have a very significant impact on a broad range of businesses, such as jewellers and antique dealers. The regulatory and resource burden of such measures, both for the affected businesses and for the public service, requires careful examination to ensure that it is proportionate to the issue and carefully targeted.</p>  <p>  This requires consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other Government Departments and stakeholders, which is currently underway. There has already been one round of public consultation on the cash for gold issue, and this has been valuable in feeding into the continuing work within my Department to draw up a workable approach. It may be appropriate to consider a further round prior to finalising proposals for regulation. It is my intention that we will be in a position to publish these proposals within a year.</p></reply>

A prohibited weapon is defined as a firearm under the same Act, and accordingly the restrictions that apply to firearms in the Firearms Acts apply to pepper sprays and electroshock weapons.  I have no plans to amend these provisions.  </p>  <p>  In considering whether or not to grant licences for the possession, use or carriage of firearms, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na take into account a number of factors provided for in the relevant legislation. In this context, in September 2009, the Garda Commissioner issued revised guidelines in relation to the operation of the firearms legislation which are designed to be of benefit to both members of the Garda&iacute; and members of the public.    </p>  <p>  These guidelines state that:  &ldquo;The protection of life and property is a function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and civilians are only entitled to use reasonable force to protect  themselves and their property.  The combined effect of this means that there is no justification for seeking to possess a firearm for purposes of personal protection or protection of property.  When assessing an application for a firearm certificate, a superintendent or chief superintendent should not take into account as part of a &lsquo;Good Reason&rsquo; a reference to personal protection."</p></reply>

The objective of this review was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation. </p><p>The review concluded that a revised district and station network commensurate with the organisation&rsquo;s resource base would best meet public demand.  </p><p>In the case of certain stations, many of which were only open part-time and manned by a single Garda, the review determined that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.</p><p>In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  </p><p>As a result, the Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme was implemented in 2012 and 2013. </p><p>This was reflected in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Policing Plans for 2012 and 2013 which set out the details of the closure of 39 Garda stations in 2012 and 100 Garda stations in 2013 and the amalgamation of twenty eight Garda districts to fourteen enlarged Garda districts.  </p><p>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the closures allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  As a result of the Programme, communities have benefited from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which has enabled An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver an improved policing service to the public.</p><p>The stations closed under the 2012 and 2013 Policing Plans are set out below: <table><tr><th>No.</th><th>Garda Station</th><th>County</th><th>No.</th><th>Garda

Video games are exempted works for classification purposes unless they fall within the terms provided for in section 3(1)(a) or (b), which covers the grounds for the prohibition of works.</p>  <p>  Ireland is part of the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) system, which is a Europe-wide rating system with regard to video games.  The Director of the Irish Film Classification Office (IFCO) is on the council of PEGI.</p>  <p>  PEGI is not incorporated into Irish law.  It is a European self-regulation initiative set up in 2003 to rate video games on the basis of age classification.  These classifications are then subject to independent verification before a supply licence is issued to the publisher. Video games are classified by age appropriateness at the following age levels: 3+, 7+, 12+, 16+ and 18+. </p>  <p>  I understand that it is now normal practice for IFCO to view video games which are rated as 18+ to allow the Director of Film Classification to form an opinion as to whether such games fall within the terms provided for in section 3(1)(a) or (b) of the Video Recordings Act 1989.</p>  <p>  A key component of video game arrangements is that the classification systems set out above are designed to provide useful information as to the content of the product. In particular, the intention is to assist parents/guardians in making informed choices concerning the media they acquire for their children or which they permit their children to use.</p>  <p>  In the context of the Questions raised by the Deputy, I take the reference to &ldquo;prevalence of gambling&rdquo; as relating to &ldquo;in app purchases&rdquo; or &ldquo;loot boxes&rdquo; which appear in video games to enable a player to increase the chance of success in the game. There is no element of gambling involved in such purchases. These purchases do not involve placing a bet or the taking of risk either on a party to party or exchange basis. I understand that such purchases, as an e-Commerce activity, are the responsibility of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></reply>

All non-EEA nationals are required to keep their permission to remain in the State up to date at all times and failure to do so may adversely affect an application for a certificate of naturalisation.  </p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.  While most cases are now generally processed within six months, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process. </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

In brief, it is an offence to use words, behave, publish or distribute written material, or broadcast any visual images or sounds which are threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended, or, having regard to all the circumstances, are likely to stir up hatred.  </p>  <p>  &ldquo;Hatred&rdquo; is defined in that Act as &ldquo;hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  Where a criminal offence such as assault, criminal damage or a public order offence is committed against a person based on their race, religion, colour, ethnicity or some other ground, the offence is prosecuted through the wider criminal law.  It is accepted that such an offence can be more serious on account of the hate or prejudice motivating the crime and Irish courts do consider evidence of a crime being motivated by hate or prejudice as an aggravating factor at sentencing.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently engaging in a review of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 as well as the criminal law dimension of the wider Government objective of tackling hatred and xenophobia in Irish society.  The review will take account of the progress of the Private Members Criminal Law (Aggravation by Prejudice) Bill 2016.</p></reply>

A determination on whether an applicant satisfies the statutory criteria attendant to naturalisation can only be made after an application for naturalisation has been received.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  The Act sets out the statutory conditions which must be met for naturalisation.  These include that, regardless how long an applicant may have resided in the State, the applicant must have a period of 1 year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the 8 years immediately preceding that period, have had a further total residence amounting to 4 years (in the case of an application based on being the spouse or civil partner of an Irish citizen the Act reduces this further period to 2 years during the preceding 4 years).  </p>  <p>  The guidance notes attached to the application form inform applicants that arrangements for assessment of residence are on the basis that the person is physically resident in the State for the required period of time and that where there are significant absences from the State the application may be refused. </p>  <p>  Where an applicant is found to be non-resident for substantial periods of time such periods will not be reckonable for the purposes of satisfying the statutory residency conditions for naturalisation.  While the Act clearly stipulates the statutory minimum periods of residence required in the State, and that the final year be continuous residence, it has long been recognised that many people may travel abroad for a holiday, or may have some unexpected or unavoidable reason to travel abroad.  In this regard it is considered that a reasonable and generous period of up to 6 weeks be allowed for absences from the State for normal holidays and other short term and temporary nature absences, such as for business meetings or a family wedding or bereavement or medical emergency while abroad, and that such short term nature absence from the State would not impact on the statutory residence requirement.  The Minister may allow some further discretion where there are wholly exceptional or unavoidable circumstances.  Every application is considered on its own merits having regard to the statutory conditions set out in the Act.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.  </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that as of 31 January 2018, the latest date for which figures are currently available, there are a total 121 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and 16 Garda Civilian Staff members attached to the GNIB. </p>  <p>  The GNIB reports to the Garda Commissioner through the normal Garda reporting relationships and is subject to the same oversight arrangements as set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended.  Obviously, because of the operational nature of the various duties carried out by the GNIB, the Bureau work very closely with the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department to deliver on overall immigration objectives.   </p>  <p>  With regard to statistics on refusals of leave to land, the UN Committee Against Torture, in its concluding observations on the second periodic review of Ireland, requested that the State "provide the Committee with data on the countries of origin of persons denied leave to land and the point of embarkation for the State party to which they were returned in its next periodic report."  The next periodic report for Ireland is due to be submitted in August 2021, and it is intended that Ireland will be in a position to respond fully to this recommendation well in advance of that date. </p></reply>

Under this exception, the bankrupt person&rsquo;s interest in their home will automatically re-vest in the bankrupt person, if the Official Assignee has not applied to Court for its sale before the third anniversary of the person being adjudicated bankrupt. </p>  <p>  Because bankruptcy adjudication means that the bankrupt no longer owns their former property and cannot validly enter into any transactions regarding it, and because that property generally remains vested in the Official Assignee after the person is discharged from bankruptcy, the practice has been that solicitors for a purchaser of property will search on the Bankruptcy Register to verify that the vendor has not been adjudicated bankrupt. </p>  <p>  I am advised that some jurisdictions do provide for removal from the register following discharge, but it must be borne in mind that conveyancing law and property registration systems can vary substantially, even between common law countries. </p>  <p>  My officials are examining this issue and will keep it under review in the context of overall development of insolvency and bankruptcy registers.  </p></reply>

For example, the Office has responded to a number of applications for relief from Restriction Orders previously made by the Courts.</p><p>The lower numbers in more recent years are attributable to two principal factors.</p><p>Firstly, as has been detailed in previous responses, the ODCE&rsquo;s enforcement strategy in recent years has been to concentrate its resources on investigating more serious indications of wrongdoing the result of which is, typically, the submission of a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for consideration. By definition, these investigations, when compared with District Court prosecutions (which make up the bulk of the earlier years&rsquo; numbers): </p><p>- are substantially larger in scale; </p><p>- are far more complex;</p><p>- are substantially more labour intensive, particularly as regards Garda and professional resources;</p><p>- typically involve the issuing of multiple Production Orders to multiple parties;</p><p>- typically involve multiple possible offences over multiple years;</p><p>- are prone to give rise to novel issues of law, for example, the interaction between criminal investigation and individuals&rsquo; privacy rights;</p><p>- typically involve substantial volumes of documents (often into thousands of documents from multiple sources in both hard copy and electronic form) and significant numbers of witnesses. </p><p>As such, investigations of this nature, for obvious reasons, take considerably longer to bring to a conclusion than is the case with District Court prosecutions. In that context, it is also important to bear in mind that, as has also been detailed in previous responses, in the case of files referred to the DPP, it is the DPP and not the ODCE that takes the decision as to whether to direct charges. Therefore, the matter of direction of charges on indictment is entirely outside the control of the ODCE.</p><p>Secondly, on legal advice received from Senior Counsel following two High Court judgements in disqualification applications brought by the ODCE in 2014, the ODCE suspended that programme of activity pending an appeal by the ODCE to the Court of Appeal.  In 2016, the Court of Appeal overturned the decision made by the High Court in one of these cases.  Based on the decision in the Court of Appeal, the Office has recently recommenced its programme of seeking the disqualification of directors in appropriate cases.  However, many of these are now being dealt with by way of undertakings rather than Court applications and, as such, the effect of the undertakings regime introduced by the Oireachtas in the Companies Act 2014 will be to reduce the number of people having to appear before the Courts, thereby freeing up Court time for other matters and reducing the associated costs to the individuals concerned. </p><p>In addition to the Court actions initiated by the ODCE, nearly 1,000 company directors have been restricted or disqualified on foot of Court applications made by liquidators over the same period.  In every one of these cases, the ODCE has first reviewed the circumstances of the case and, having examined the liquidator&rsquo;s report, has determined that the liquidator should not be relieved of the obligation to make such applications.</p><p>Finally, I would note that not all enforcement actions taken by the ODCE result in Court applications.  Rather, the ODCE operates a graduated approach towards enforcement, i.e., where deemed an appropriate response, indications of non-compliance are dealt with, inter alia, by way of warning, statutory direction (i.e., directing compliance) etc. </p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland has approved funding for a number of research and innovation projects in this area and has seen some client activity in this space, particularly in the areas of education, entertainment and marketing.  Going forward, Enterprise Ireland would expect a greater number of companies to be involved in augmented reality and virtual reality industries, particularly in the above areas. To support these companies, Enterprise Ireland offers an array of supports and I am satisfied that these supports will assist entrepreneurs and companies in the augmented and virtual reality sectors to realise their ambitions. </p><p><b>- Start-Ups:</b>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s provides support to start-up companies to assist with business planning, mentoring and development advice, feasibility funding and finance, often in the form of equity investment, as appropriate to the founder&rsquo;s ambitions and the company&rsquo;s potential and stage of growth.</p><p><b>- Competitiveness:</b>Enterprise Ireland  recognises that Irish companies must be competitive in order to succeed in international markets.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Lean Business Offer encourages client companies to adopt lean principles and to build the capability and capacity of their people to identify problems and improve operations. </p><p><b>- Capability &amp;amp; Management Development: </b>In addition to providing tailored support in creating and implementing business growth plans, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Capability and Mentoring Department has developed a number of programmes focused on supporting leadership and management and building international sales and marketing capabilities in Irish companies.</p><p><b>- Supporting Internationalisation, including market diversification: </b>For Irish owned companies internationalisation is vital for growth. To support this, Enterprise Ireland has a presence in 33 overseas locations worldwide to give client companies access to foreign markets. Enterprise Ireland  assists companies to build the knowledge and capability required for success in international markets by providing financial and non-financial supports. In addition, Enterprise Ireland runs Trade Missions to support clients win new export business and build international networks and partnerships.</p><p><b>- Access to Finance:</b>Enterprise Ireland offers a range of financial supports to assist clients through all stages of the business development cycle.  The nature and level of support offered to clients will depend on the individual company&rsquo;s development needs and is assessed in consultation with their development adviser. In addition, the State, through Enterprise Ireland, has invested heavily in stimulating and facilitating the availability of Seed and Venture Capital to provide access to finance for SMEs.</p><p><b>- Innovation:</b>Enterprise Ireland recognises that innovation is critical to the continued success of client companies in order to gain competitive advantage and create the next generation of winning products and services. Enterprise Ireland provides financial and non-financial support to companies to further improve their innovative capability and capacity.</p><p><b>- Research Collaboration:</b>In order to promote business innovation with the ultimate aim of creating jobs, Enterprise Ireland works with the broader enterprise base in Ireland including foreign-owned MNCs and with the research community.  The Technology Centre programme which Enterprise Ireland runs jointly with IDA Ireland brings consortia of indigenous firms and multinational companies together with academia to tackle problems that are prevalent in specific sectors or technology areas.</p><p>Innovation continues to be a priority for Enterprise Ireland. In 2017 it had 1,065 collaborative innovations between industry and Higher Education Institutes, 436 Technology Gateway projects for industry, and helped client companies secure &euro;475 million in Horizon 2020 funding. I am confident that the work of my Department, through Enterprise Ireland, will result in exciting developments in all technologies, including virtual and augmented reality technology.</p></reply>

The Agency has, with that goal in mind, established a specialist Division to examine new forms of investment, including opportunities in sectors such as Robotics, Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR), Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics. </p>  <p>  Ireland now has a growing base of investment by technology companies in this area. IDA Ireland client companies who are part of an AR/VR cluster in Ireland include DAQRI, Intel, Valeo Vision Systems, Microsoft, Accenture, Google, Facebook and SAP. The Agency has also identified and engaged with a number of other AR/VR companies overseas with a view to bringing more such investment to Ireland. </p>  <p>  As part of its work to attract investment by companies in emerging technologies to Ireland, the Agency participates in a number of global AR/VR conferences each year. The IDA, for example, supported the AR/VR Innovate conference in Dublin in 2015, including through a client dinner in the margins of the event. The Agency&rsquo;s staff will continue to participate in future events that have the potential to attract investment from overseas AR/VR firms, with the aim of both attracting new employment to the country and developing the sector further here. </p></reply>

They are working vigorously to enable companies to consolidate market share within the UK and also to become more resilient by broadening their sales to other international markets. </p><p>The six LEOs in the Border region are also working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.  </p><p>I am conscious that further efforts are needed to ensure that companies in the Border Region are resilient to economic shocks, such as Brexit. To this end, I am committed to ensuring that Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs will continue to work with companies from the region to drive their innovation, competitiveness, internationalisation and Brexit preparedness.</p><p>My Department provided additional capital funding in 2017 to enable EI and the LEOs to ramp up its supports in light of Brexit to drive improvements in: </p><p>- productivity, </p><p>- innovation, </p><p>- management capability and leadership skills,</p><p>and really driving the ambition of managers to look to other markets around the world.</p><p>My Department has been working with the Department of Finance, Enterprise Ireland (EI) and Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and others to develop potential supports to respond to the needs of businesses impacted by Brexit. The Brexit Loan Scheme, announced during Budget 2018, will provide affordable working capital financing to eligible Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit, or which will be in the future. The Scheme will be delivered by the SBCI through commercial lenders to get much needed working capital into Irish businesses. </p><p>In 2017 my Department provided for an increased current expenditure pay provision of &euro;1.7m to enable EI recruit 39 Brexit specific posts to work at home and across the globe in EI&rsquo;s 33 offices abroad.  My Department provided EI with a further &euro;1.3 million in Budget 2018 to recruit approximately 18 additional staff.</p><p>Specific programmes introduced during 2017 have included;</p><p>- A &lsquo;Prepare for Brexit&rsquo; online portal and communications campaign.</p><p>- An enhanced programme of trade and investment missions and other trade promotional events.</p><p>- An online &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo; to help all Irish businesses self-assess their exposure to Brexit. The Scorecard generates a report on weak areas and suggests some initial next steps. 1,909 companies had used the Scorecard by mid-December of 2017.</p><p>- A new Eurozone Strategy to increase exports to Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020. This strategy aims to support companies to broaden their export footprint beyond the UK, and thereby improve economic resilience.</p><p>- A new &euro;5k &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; that supports the costs of SME clients in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit.</p><p>- EI is hosting &ldquo;Prepare for Brexit&rdquo; breakfast roadshows nationally to engage with companies.</p><p>- Three new strategic communications campaigns launched to target separate elements of Brexit preparedness. &lsquo;Global Ambition&rsquo; is aimed at encouraging companies to export; &lsquo;PrepareforBrexit&rsquo; highlights actions required by companies to improve resilience; and a new &lsquo;Irish Advantage&rsquo; campaign will target Eurozone buyers to buy Irish innovation in key Brexit impacted sectors.</p><p>This Brexit focus has continued into the 2018 plan.

The Act brought about major reform in the area of mental health law and practice in Ireland.  The Act which, commenced in 2006, provides safeguards for those involuntarily admitted and detained in approved centres and puts in place mechanisms for the regulation and inspection of our mental health services.  The Act also established the Mental Health Commission.</p>  <p>  My Department has introduced a number of Acts amending the 2001 Act.</p>  <p>  The Mental Health Act 2008 was enacted on an emergency basis to deal with issues that had arisen in a court case at that time, specifically in relation to unexpired and expired renewal orders.  The immediate passing of the legislation was deemed to be necessary to reduce the possibility of impacting negatively on patient health.</p>  <p>  The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 introduced the definition of &lsquo;authorised person&rsquo; to the Mental Health Act 2001.  An "authorised person" is a person empowered under the Act to lawfully remove persons to an approved centre.  The need to amend the Mental Health Act 2001 arose from High Court proceedings where a patient sought and was granted a declaration that her removal to a psychiatric hospital was not in accordance with the Act.</p>  <p>  The Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2015 introduced a significant change with regard to the administration of Electroconvulsive Therapy.  Following the commencement of this Act, where a patient who has been admitted on an involuntarily basis, has capacity and refuses ECT, that patient&rsquo;s wishes must now be respected.  Up to that point, the Mental Health Act allowed for administration of ECT to people who were &lsquo;unwilling&rsquo; to consent.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a comprehensive review of the 2001 Act by an Expert Group was published in 2015.  The previous Government accepted the thrust of the Report of that Expert Group and approved the preparation of the General Scheme of a Bill to reflect the Report&rsquo;s recommendations in revised mental health legislation. </p>  <p>  The Review contains 165 recommendations and is progressive in nature. First and foremost, it sets out to promote and protect the rights of persons with mental illness.  This is in addition to promoting access to the most appropriate and highest achievable standard of care and support.</p>  <p>  The previous Government agreed with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Expert Group Review and approved the preparation of the General Scheme of a bill to reflect changes in revised legislation.  This work is underway at official level and is expected to be significantly progressed by mid-year.  I acknowledge that progress on finalising this work has been slower than anticipated, but it is a complex undertaking and when changes are proposed on such a large scale, we must ensure they are made in a careful and considered manner.</p></reply>

The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that in recent times some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may take the matter up with their HSE Local Health Office, who will investigate the complaint.</p>  <p>  If the local office determines that the charge was inappropriate, it will inform the HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service who will arrange to refund the cost of the blood test to patient and recoup this amount from the GP.  The local office will inform the GP of the decision to deduct the payment.</p></reply>

Allowing for recruitment and training, I am advised that it is likely to take at least 18 months to achieve 100% access to anomaly scanning.  In the meantime, I am assured that the Programme will continue to work with the six Hospital Groups to assist in increasing access to anomaly scans for those units with limited availability.

The development of an implementation framework for the National Policy &amp;amp; Strategy for the provision of Neuro-rehabilitation Services in Ireland is a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p>  <p>  The HSE has established a National Steering Group to develop the implementation framework, comprising representatives from across the whole health system, including Heads of Social Care and the National Clinical Programme for Rehabilitation Medicine, Acute Hospital services, Mental Health, Primary Care and Health &amp;amp; Wellbeing, Health &amp;amp; Social Care Professionals and the Neurological Alliance of Ireland. </p>  <p>  The focus of the National Steering Group is to develop a framework which is implementable across the country.  The Steering Group considers that a Managed Clinical Rehabilitation Network model represents best practice as a means of providing neuro-rehabilitation care and support/accommodation needs.  The HSE&rsquo;s Social Care Division and its Clinical Programme and Strategy Division are working in tandem to progress this.</p>  <p>  The specific information sought by the Deputy is a service matter for the HSE.  Accordingly I have arranged for the Deputy&rsquo;s questions to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.  </p></reply>

An estimated 55,000 people in Ireland have a form of dementia, and this figure is expected to nearly treble to 150,000 by 2046.  While the majority of people with dementia are aged over 65, it is important to remember that one in ten people diagnosed with dementia are under 65.</p>  <p>  As a response to the increasing number of people with dementia, the Irish National Dementia Strategy was launched in December 2014.  The Strategy aims to improve dementia care to allow people with dementia to live well for as long as possible and have services and supports delivered as well as possible.  My Department and the HSE are working on a review of the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy which will be published in the second quarter of this year and will identify what has been achieved so far and set out the further work that is required to implement the Strategy.  The work on the review will feed into the estimates process for 2019 and subsequent years.</p>  <p>  In parallel with the Strategy, a National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme (NDSIP) was agreed by the Department of Health, the HSE and Atlantic Philanthropies.  &euro;27.5million was committed to the Programme over a three year period across a number of initiatives, including dementia specific intensive homecare packages, an education and training programme for GPs and Primary Care Teams, and an information and awareness campaign which seeks to challenge public misconceptions about dementia and the challenges facing people living with dementia.</p>  <p>  In the medium term, the HSE plans to create compassionate, inclusive communities for people with dementia and their carers, by building a network of local and national partnerships under the Dementia Understand Together campaign.  Plans are progressing to further implement the Dementia Strategy through the National Dementia Office, including in the area of diagnosis, post-diagnostic supports and care pathways.</p>  <p>  In 2017, my Department secured &euro;1.23 million in Dormant Accounts funding to develop a number of projects which are designed to expand public awareness of dementia and to improve care for people with dementia.  These projects include a national post-diagnostic support pathway, a national dementia registry, the staffing of assistive technology libraries in all CHOs and the establishment of dementia friendly community groups.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that people with dementia continue to live their lives as fully as possible, in their own homes and communities for as long as they can.  We are committed to supporting the work of the National Dementia Office in creating meaningful projects which will have a lasting positive effect on the lives of people with dementia, their carers and families.</p></reply>

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard laboratory approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and has been agreed by experts from the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and other Irish and international experts.  This testing is available in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics by General Practitioners.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.</p>  <p>  The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre website (www.hpsc.ie) gives extensive information on Lyme Disease diagnosis, treatment and how to avoid tick bites.  A Lyme Disease Subcommittee of the Scientific Advisory Committee of HPSC with professional clinical, entomological, scientific and environmental health expert representation (including a representative of the Lyme Support Group, Tick-Talk Ireland) has been established to explore all possible ways of raising awareness about Lyme disease.  This Subcommittee is expected to meet shortly with a view to finalising it report.  This report will cover a number of areas, including initiatives undertaken to date, summary advice relating to awareness, preventive advice for the general public, preventive advice and material for those responsible for sites or locations known to have or suspected as having higher densities of ticks, and summary advice relating to GP management of the condition.  Any person who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.</p></reply>

It is worth noting that in 2016 the children's hospitals recorded that approximately 13% of patients did not attend their Outpatient appointment.  This is something that must be tackled.  A number of steps, including the commencement of a national waiting list validation project by the HSE, are being taken to ensure the lists are accurate and these efforts are to intensify in the coming months.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and  sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decison-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for the localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the only licensed use for the patch in Ireland.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.</p><p>When the plasters were first introduced, the budget impact was low, because of the specific indication for which they are licensed.  It was therefore a cause of clinical concern that, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where, as a nation, we were using more plasters than the entire UK National Health Service, with ten times our population.</p><p>When a treatment is intended for a small group of patients, and evidence suggests that it is being  used for many times that number, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review its use.  In 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing had been for the licensed indication.</p><p>Following the clinical review, and in the interest of ensuring appropriate patient care, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches from 1 September 2017.  This process supports their appropriate use, ensuring that post-shingles patients continue to receive this treatment.</p><p>Under the new arrangements, all patients receiving lidocaine plasters for the licensed indication, shingles, were automatically approved on the HSE system.  All of these patients continue to receive the treatment under the community schemes.</p><p>Non-shingles patients were given a three month grace period, in which their GP could move them to other treatments or apply for continued reimbursement.  However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients were no longer automatically reimbursed under the community drugs schemes.</p><p>In order for non-shingles patients to receive the patch through the community schemes, their GP must apply online for continued reimbursement approval.  If an application is refused, the GP may appeal, making a clinical case for the patient.  The HSE advises that the turnaround time for applications is three working days and for appeals it is five days.</p><p>As of 16 February, approximately 1,500 post-shingles patients have been approved, and the plaster is being provided to those patients in the normal manner.</p><p>Another 4784 non-shingles patients were registered by their GP, and 14% of these patients, 670 people, have been approved.  In addition, 284 online appeals have been made, including patients who were never registered, and over 65% of these patients have been approved.</p><p>Over 2300 patients are now approved for the plaster in the drug schemes, with more than 850, over one third, approved for use other than post-shingles pain, based on the clinical case made by the GP.</p><p>It is clear that this new process supports appropriate use and prescribing and both post-shingles patients and other appropriate cases can continue to be treated with lidocaine plasters. </p><p>The introduction of the new approval system was flagged in August 2017, when details of the proposed changes were circulated by the HSE to prescribers and pharmacies. This advice has been re-issued in the last week, and information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE Medicines Management Programme website.  (<i></i>)<i>.</i></p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

The manufacturer, CSL Behring, was notified in August 2017 that the HSE was unable to recommend reimbursement.  The HSE concluded that there was not enough evidence to suggest that patients would derive a clinically meaningful benefit from this treatment and that the current price was not a cost effective use of resources. </p>  <p>  A number of patients were on an access scheme for this product, operated by the manufacturer, for the treatment of Alpha-1 deficiency.  This scheme was being run independently by the manufacturer.  Without reference to the HSE, the company decided that the scheme would end on 30 September 2017.  This decision left approximately 20 patients without access to medication.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, the company modified its decision and agreed to continue to supply the medication free of charge for the patients on the access scheme for a further six months, or until the next clinical trial commences in 2018, but from October 2017 it would not cover the cost of administering the medicine.</p>  <p>  Due to the critical and exceptional circumstances, the HSE decided to facilitate a transitional arrangement, under which it would fund the necessary nursing service to ensure that patients would continue to receive the medicine until a new clinical trial commences in 2018.</p>  <p>  The Company anticipates that approximately half of the current access group of patients will be recruited into the next clinical trial in 2018.</p>  <p>  The terms of this transitional arrangement, under which the HSE has agreed to fund the administration of the drug, includes a requirement that the lead clinician ensures that appropriate alternative treatment regimes are put in place in good time for those patients not proceeding onto the next trial.</p>  <p>  The HSE has written to the consultant for assurance that these conditions are being complied with.</p>  <p>  This transitional arrangement does not alter the reimbursement decision of the HSE in relation to Respreeza.</p>  <p>  The company is welcome to submit a new reimbursement application, which will be assessed in line with the 2013 Act.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and  sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for the localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the only licensed use for the patch in Ireland.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. </p><p>When the plasters were first introduced, the budget impact was low, because of the specific indication for which they are licensed.  It was therefore a cause of clinical concern that, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where, as a nation, we were using more plasters than the entire UK National Health Service, with ten times our population. </p><p>When a treatment is intended for a small group of patients, and evidence suggests that it is being used for many times that number, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review its use.  In 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing had been for the licensed indication. </p><p>Following the clinical review, and in the interest of ensuring appropriate patient care, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches from 1 September 2017.  This process supports their appropriate use, ensuring that post-shingles patients continue to receive this treatment.</p><p>Under the new arrangements, all patients receiving lidocaine plasters for the licensed indication, shingles, were automatically approved on the HSE system.  All of these patients continue to receive the treatment under the community schemes. </p><p>Non-shingles patients were given a three month grace period, in which their GP could move them to other treatments or apply for continued reimbursement.  However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients were no longer automatically reimbursed under the community drugs schemes.</p><p>In order for non-shingles patients to receive the patch through the community schemes, their GP must apply online for continued reimbursement approval.  If an application is refused, the GP may appeal, making a clinical case for the patient.  The HSE advises that the turnaround time for applications is three working days and for appeals it is five days.</p><p>As of 16 February, approximately 1,500 post-shingles patients have been approved, and the plaster is being provided to those patients in the normal manner.</p><p>Another 4784 non-shingles patients were registered by their GP, and 14% of these patients, 670 people, have been approved.  In addition, 284 online appeals have been made, including patients who were never registered, and over 65% of these patients have been approved. </p><p>Over 2300 patients are now approved for the plaster in the drug schemes, with more than 850, over one third, approved for use other than post-shingles pain, based on the clinical case made by the GP.</p><p>It is clear that this new process supports appropriate use and prescribing and both post-shingles patients and other appropriate cases can continue to be treated with lidocaine plasters. </p><p>The introduction of the new approval system was flagged in August 2017, when details of the proposed changes were circulated by the HSE to prescribers and pharmacies.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p><p>Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income, such as their pension and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held, such as their principal private residence or cash assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets is not counted at all in the financial assessment.  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.  This is known as the three year cap. No participant will pay more than the actual cost of care.</p><p>Under NHSS rental income is considered income for the purpose of the financial assessment, and is assessed at 80% less any allowable deductions.  Allowable deductions include tax paid to Revenue and therefore any tax paid to Revenue should be deducted from the rental income.  Other deductions include health expenses, payments required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence. </p><p>Action 17 of the Strategy for the Rental Sector commits the Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government (DHPLG) to examine the treatment under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme's financial assessment of income from the rental of a person's principal private residence where they move into long term residential care. </p><p>The Department of Health will continue to work closely with the DHPLG on this matter and will consider suitable options that may assist with regard to the issue of vacant homes.  However, in the consideration of any options, we must be mindful of the potential sensitivities around this issue for older people.  It is important to remember that the transition into nursing home care can be a challenging time, including emotionally, and we must avoid adding distress to people in the consideration and development of options on this topic.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-27a.1302.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022700093#WRLL00700"><p>The reduction in the numbers of children admitted to adult psychiatric units is a priority for the HSE Mental Health Services and for myself. It is fully accepted that admission to an age appropriate facility is in the best interest of the child.</p>  <p>  Where a child requires admission to an in-patient bed, a bed in a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) unit is sought in the first instance. A decision to admit to an adult unit is made only if a CAMHS admission is not feasible. Where such admissions take place HSE Standard Operating Procedures apply. An admission to an adult unit must be advised to the Mental Health Commission and is generally to a separate area in the adult unit with appropriate supervision.</p>  <p>  Most child admissions to adult units are for children in the 16-17 age bracket. The HSE advises  that admission to an adult unit may often be more appropriate for the individual and to avoid any impact on younger children in CAMHS in-patient units. Children admitted to adult units are provided with special support by the HSE.  </p>  <p>  Progress in this area has been significant since 2008 when there were 247 such admissions to adult units in that year. This declined to 81 in 2017, despite a background of increasing demands overall on Child and Adolescent Mental Health services. CAMHS has seen a 26% increase in referrals between 2012 and 2017.</p>  <p>  It is important to note, that the number of  admissions  does not necessarily equate to the actual number of children admitted, as an individual child may be admitted on more than one occasion in any given year. In 2017, there was a total of 307 CAMHS admissions, of which 226 (74%) were to age appropriate units and 81 (26%) of admissions of Children were to Adult Units. The temporary closure of some CAMHS beds, such as the Linn Dara Unit in Dublin, influenced the admission rates to adults units in 2017. </p>  <p>  In terms of bed days used, in 2017, based on the most recent figures available, 96.9% of bed days used were in Child and Adolescent Inpatient Units. Performance generally continues to be above the HSE Service Plan target figure of 95%, and indications are that where a child has been admitted to an adult acute in-patient unit, the length of stay has been kept to a minimum. </p>  <p>  The HSE Service Plan allows for some operational flexibility surrounding emergency placements in Adult Units, particularly where very short-term placements take place.  Full account is taken of all relevant factors such as the preferences of all those involved, and geographical factors relating to access or visiting. In this context, the HSE continues to closely monitor on a weekly basis all child admissions to adult units with a view to minimising such admissions. </p>  <p>  I and departmental officials regularly meet with the HSE to review various mental health issues including the potential for further improvement on age appropriate CAMHS admissions. Relevant data is regularly published on the HSE website and is subject to regular monitoring by the Department of Health. Bearing in mind all the circumstances, I am satisfied that, where children have to be placed short-term in adult mental health units, the Executive makes any special arrangements necessary to protect and monitor these young people.</p></reply>

Their recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  This season (2017/18) the HSE procured the trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine for all those in the recommended at risk groups and health care workers and carers.  The trivalent vaccine used in Ireland is the most widely used influenza vaccine in Europe. </p>  <p>  NIAC is considering the need to expand the current recommendations for influenza vaccine, including the potential community wide benefit of extending recommendations to include all children.</p>  <p>  Initial evidence suggests that the vaccine provides higher protection against the Influenza A strains than recent years (H3N2 &amp;amp; H1N1).  While it is less effective against the B strains predominating this year, people who received the flu.  Vaccination remains the most effective means of preventing infection by seasonal influenza viruses and can reduce severe disease that can lead to hospitalisation and death.</p>  <p>  The influenza vaccine purchased by HSE is based on WHO advice on the composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2017/8 northern hemisphere Flu season which issued on 2 March 2017.  It recommended that trivalent vaccines for use in the 2017-2018 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following:  </p>  <p>-   an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; </p>  <p>  - an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus; and </p>  <p>  - a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus.</p>  <p>  Influenza vaccine is most effective when circulating viruses are well-matched with viruses contained in vaccines.  Due to the constant evolving nature of influenza viruses, the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System &ndash; a system of National Influenza Centres and WHO Collaborating Centres around the world &ndash; continuously monitors the influenza viruses circulating in humans and updates the composition of influenza vaccines twice a year.  For many years, WHO has updated its recommendation on the composition of the vaccine (trivalent) that targets the three most representative virus types in circulation (two subtypes of influenza A viruses and one influenza B virus) and since the 2013&ndash;2014 northern hemisphere influenza season, a fourth component is recommended to support quadrivalent vaccine development.  Quadrivalent vaccines include a 2nd influenza B virus in addition to the viruses in trivalent vaccines.</p>  <p>  The HSE Communications Plan which launched on the 2 October 2017 had an initial focus on Health Care Workers.  Radio adverts commenced on the 9 October and ran for three weeks.  There were further radio ads over the holiday period when ILI rates exceeded the baseline threshold for the first time.  People aged 65 and over as well as pregnant women were the primary audiences for the radio campaign, which also reached medically at risk groups and Health Care Workers as they make up a more generic radio audience.  Digital advertising and promotions targeting risk groups, the over 65s, pregnant women and healthcare workers and likewise there will be options for further campaigns when flu levels go above the threshold.</p>  <p>  The HSE &ldquo;Under the Weather&rdquo; website gives advice to people on what to do if they suspect they are developing influenza.  Health is one of the themes of the cross-sectoral &lsquo;Be Winter Ready&rsquo; campaign which launched on 8 November 2017. </p>  <p>  The HSE reviews and updates its influenza plans, including the communications strategy, taking into account the lessons learned from previous years, with a view to targeting key groups to get the greatest impact in terms of people receiving the influenza vaccine.</p></reply>

The number of NCHDS has increased by 270 in the 12 months ending December, 2017 to 6,331 whole time equivalents, and by 1,323 in the 4 years since December 2013. </p>  <p>  It is recognised that retention of doctors is critical to the future growth of the medical workforce.  In July 2013 a Working Group, chaired by Prof. Brian MacCraith, President, Dublin City University, was established to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structure. The Group made 25 recommendations relating to training and career pathways for doctors with a focus on improving graduate retention in the public health system and planning for future service needs. Initiatives taken on foot of the Group's recommendations include the launch of a  careers and training website, which gives information about each specialty, including details of training pathways and training duration, increasing the number of family friendly training places and the appointment of lead NCHDs across sites.  The MacCraith Implementation Monitoring Group continues its work and has identified the need to progress other key recommendations including protected training time, task transfer and better coverage of training costs incurred by  NCHDs. </p>  <p>  With regard to nurses, the number of nurses and midwives has increased by 942 in the 12 months ending December 2017 to 36,777 whole time equivalents and by 2,599 in the 4 years since December 2013.  In terms of the number of nurses required in public hospitals, the Nursing Recruitment and Retention Agreement, was concluded with the INMO and SIPTU Nursing last year.  This committed the HSE to increasing the number of nurses and midwives by 1,224 additional permanent posts across the health service in 2017.  Indications are that there has been significant growth in the appointment of nurses and midwives in recent months with 942 WTE of the 1,224 posts filled (including student nurses).  The HSE remain committed to the Agreement and efforts will continue to fill the remaining posts.  Funded workforce plans for 2018 are in the process of being developed.  </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the HSE recognises the need to continue to focus on the recruitment and retention of front-line staff, such as doctors and nurses, and that it is committed to making the public health service a more attractive place to work.</p></reply>

Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs. The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring/Summer session 2018. I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage. The proposals seek to ensure that:   </p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation; </p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme; </p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and </p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  It is hoped to bring a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government shortly, seeking Government approval to the drafting of the Bill for the new Transport Support Payment.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment. The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020.  Following closure of the scheme in February 2013,  no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.</p></reply>

It is also intended to raise awareness in the fishing industry of the negative impact such waste can have on the marine environment. </p>  <p>  Through the Fishing for Litter project, fishing ports and fishermen have been actively recovering marine litter as well as better managing waste, both on board and ashore.  This is done on a voluntary basis and while fishermen are not paid directly for their participation, they are supplied with large hardwearing bags in which they can collect marine litter that accumulates in their fishing gear as part of their normal fishing operations, as well as their own waste that they generate during fishing trips.  Filled bags are returned to the quayside in participating ports and moved to secure containers ready for safe and responsible disposal.  Specific waste facilities are provided at the participating fishing ports into which fishermen can deposit their waste free of charge.  In 2017, around 50 trawlers in 9 ports - Clogherhead, Castletownbere, Ross A Mhil, Killybegs, Greencastle, Kinsale, Dunmore East and Dingle and Union Hall - participated in the project.  As part of this project novel waste management technologies are being tested on board vessels.</p>  <p>  In addition, since 2005, BIM has been working with industry on the recycling of old fishing gear.  A total of 400 tonnes of nylon netting has been successfully recycled. During 2016 and 2017, BIM assisted by my Department, Donegal County Council, Wexford County Council, Clogherhead Development Group and several other private companies, cleared the stockpiles of old fishing gear that had built up over the years in various ports and prepared this for recycling.  A total of 187 tonnes of bulk material was removed from the ports in counties Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Cork, Waterford, Wexford and Louth, of which 100 tonnes consisted of valuable polyethylene netting that has been readied for recycling. </p>  <p>  BIM&rsquo;s Responsibly Sourced Seafood (RSS) standard compliments Origin Green. In developing Origin Green plans, seafood companies set targets around their raw material sourcing and reduction of their environmental impacts, including waste management. As part of each plan, companies are asked to source from suppliers with recognised certifications such as the Responsibly Sourced Seafood Fishing Vessel Standard or broader sustainability measures.  The RSS system provides an accredited, independently certified raw material supply source as part of these plans.  Individual certification to the RSS requires applicants to demonstrate compliance, awareness and understanding of the waste management procedures in their harbour centre or port. This benefits their fishing operations by assuring that fishermen are fishing responsibly and are committed to reducing their impacts on the marine environment.</p></reply>

Data from the AIM system below is based on the definition of a beef cow which has calved at least once in its lifetime.  Furthermore, many farmers with suckler cows have another main enterprise on their farms, and so would not be defined as predominantly &lsquo;suckler farmers&rsquo;.</p>  <p>Bearing in mind those caveats, my Department&rsquo;s Animal Identification System (AIM) records all births, movements and disposals in accordance with EU requirements.  The AIM system reports data on the bovine herds on a county basis. According to the AIM system as of the 31st   of December 2017 there were 5,372 herds in County Cork as a whole that had at least one beef cow in their herd, which had calved at least once in its lifetime.  Note that these figures may be revised when the Department publishes the AIM annual Bovine Statistics Report in March.  </p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the importance of the suckler sector to Ireland's rural economy and the wider agri-food industry.  The sector is an integral component to the overall vitality and continued strength of beef farming in rural Ireland.  My Department currently provides a range of income and investment supports to suckler farmers, including direct payments and grant schemes such as BPS, ANC, GLAS and TAMS, as well as the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP).</p></reply>

One of the two mandatory priority categories National Reserve is &lsquo;Young Farmer&rsquo;.  For the purposes of the &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; priority category of the National Reserve a young farmer is defined as follows:</p><p>- must be aged 40 or less in the year in which s/he first submits an application under the Basic Payment scheme;</p><p>- must be setting up an agricultural holding for the first time in his/her own name or has set up such a holding during the five years preceding the first submission of the BPS application;</p><p>- must have submitted a valid BPS application in the year of application to the National Reserve.  </p><p>Successful applicants must also hold a recognised agricultural educational qualification at FETAC Level 6 or equivalent and have an off-farm income of not more than &euro;40,000 in either of the two most recent tax years.  </p><p>Successful applicants under the National Reserve can receive an allocation of new entitlements from the National Reserve on the basis of one entitlement for one hectare at the National Average value of entitlements.  Applicants who already hold existing entitlements which are below the national average value can receive a top-up whereby the value of those entitlements will be increased to the national average value.  </p><p>The Young Farmers Scheme is a separate scheme that provides for an additional payment to young farmers based on eligible activated entitlements.  Payment under the scheme is a flat rate payment issued to eligible applicants and is paid per activated entitlement, subject to a maximum of 50. This scheme operates each year from 2015 to 2019.  The definition of a young farmer for the purposes of the Young Farmers Scheme is the same as that which applies to the young farmer priority category of the National Reserve.  While the same agricultural educational qualification requirement also applies, there is no off-farm income threshold applicable under the Young Farmers Scheme.  </p><p>Both the 2018 National Reserve and the 2018 Young Farmers Scheme are currently open for online applications, with a closing date for receipt of applications of 15<sup>th</sup>May 2018.</p><p>Additional Schemes:</p><p>Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme:</p><p>Under the Areas of Natural Constrains (ANC) scheme farmers are paid on their lands which are designated as disadvantaged.

Stocking density requirements can be satisfied by cattle, sheep, goats, horses, donkeys and/or deer.  </p><p>Under the 2018 ANC scheme the following land categories and payment rates apply.  This table takes account of proposed new payment rates to be implemented further to an increased funding allocation of &euro;25 million under ANC 2018.

The aims of the program are to manage the local population of badgers downward to mitigate badger to cattle transmission.  An annual culling effort is managed to ensure these lower density levels are maintained.  The long-term culling of badgers is not ideal or sustainable.  They are protected by national legislation and are listed within the Berne Convention.  Therefore, they are captured under a licence granted to my Department by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  </p>  <p>  Field trials testing the effectiveness of badger vaccination as an alternative to removal were conducted from 2014 to 2017 in areas where the wildlife program had been running in excess of 5 years and where local densities of badgers were considered low enough to be suitable candidates for vaccination with BCG.  The findings confirmed that vaccination of badgers can play a role in reducing the level of infection in cattle.  </p>  <p>  From January 2018 the formal vaccination programme commenced in the areas which formed part of the field trials, i.e. in parts of counties Monaghan, Longford, Galway, Tipperary, Waterford, Kilkenny, Cork and in all of Louth.  Badgers in a vaccination area will be captured/vaccinated/released instead of being captured/culled.  The vaccination program will continue on an annual basis, so each year&rsquo;s births in vaccination areas will be vaccinated as they are captured.  The vaccination area will be expanded incrementally to all parts of the country during the 2018-2022 period.  I cannot be more specific in terms of a timescale for implementing the vaccination programme on a county by county basis given that capturing of badgers takes place only in areas where serious outbreaks of TB are identified and my Department finds following an epidemiological examination that badgers are the likely source of infection.  In addition, to achieve optimum results, areas under consideration for vaccination must have a low badger density and a cattle population that is testing clear, all of which are taken into account in deciding the way forward with managing TB outbreaks in any given area.</p></reply>

The amount is based on the market value of the animal i.e. the price that might reasonably have been obtained for it, from a purchaser on the open market, if the animal had not been affected by TB.  Each reactor is valued by an independent valuer and the Department pays the difference between this valuation and the salvage value, which the farmer receives directly from the slaughter plant. </p><p>Herdowners compensated under the On Farm Market Valuation Scheme may also qualify for supplementary payment under the Depopulation, Income Supplement and Hardship Grants Schemes subject to compliance with the relevant criteria.</p><p>Compensation for brucellosis (BR) was made in line with above schemes until Ireland became officially BR free in 2009.

Local authorities are asked to make every effort to ensure they are achieving the best value through the public procurement process.  My Department's contribution to local authorities has been reducing over the past years from &euro;2.3 million in 2014, &euro;725,000 in 2016 and an amount of &euro;533,839 was paid in 2017, due to the fact that demand and supply of equines has come into line and there have been much greater export opportunities to the continent of Europe in recent years.  </p>  <p>  This reduced contribution is reflective of a number of other factors including initiatives being progressed in the animal welfare area, including active enforcement of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 and the EU Equine Identification Regulations.  The increased emphasis on re-homing of horses is being assisted greatly through my Department's funding to animal welfare organisations.  My Department also provides funding to local authorities to support the development of urban/traveller horse projects in their respective areas.  These projects focus on education and create awareness on compliance with animal welfare regulations thereby reducing numbers of straying horses.  Other measures promoted by my Department to reduce numbers of abandoned horses include assistance provided to welfare organisations to introduce initiatives that facilitate the micro chipping, passporting and castration of stallions at a reduced cost to owners.  </p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of all horse owners to look after horses in their care or ownership and to dispose of them appropriately.  The option for slaughtering for human consumption is available to horses that are compliant with equine identification and meets all ante &amp;amp; post mortem requirements.  </p>  <p>  In relation to treating of unidentified/undocumented horses by veterinary practitioners, a guidance note for veterinary practitioners has been on the Department's website for some considerable period of time.

The effect of this approach was that veterinary practitioners treating such animals, on examining these passports, acted in the belief that the animals in question had already been excluded from the food chain.  Accordingly, they did not deem it necessary to record the medicinal treatments on the passports of the equines in question where they were treated with certain 'restricted' animal remedies. </p>  <p>  As it is not possible to confirm from the identification documents in question that the corresponding equines have not been administered such medicinal treatments that are prohibited for use in equines entering the food chain, my Department is of the view that, in order to protect the food chain and public health, the equines corresponding to the passports in question must be excluded from the food chain irrevocably. </p>  <p>  My Department has therefore written to Horse Sport Ireland, directing that they discontinue this practice. </p></reply>

The latest EPA projections, published in April 2017, which reflect the implementation of policies and measures as of the end of 2015, indicate that Ireland is expected to exceed its annual non-ETS sector emissions limits under the EU Effort Sharing Decision from 2017 onwards, and that emissions could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020.  </p>  <p>  The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself.  It is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis.  In the light of this, Ireland&rsquo;s 2030 target will present a very significant challenge.  </p>  <p>  As a means of addressing this challenge, I published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Mitigation Plan last July.  It provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  A key objective of the Plan is to close the gap to Ireland's 2020 EU target and to prepare for the EU targets that Ireland will take on for 2030.  The Plan sets out over 70 individual mitigation measures and 106 related actions to reduce emissions in the four sectors with the most significant contribution to national emissions (Electricity Generation; the Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use).  Although the Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve either Ireland&rsquo;s proposed 2030 target or the 2050 transition objective, it has established the framework for the development and implementation of medium-to-long-term policy options so as to achieve progressive emissions reductions in each of its four key sectors. </p>  <p>  The Plan is also a living document that will be updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.  The most recent list of measures currently in place in the context of National Mitigation Plan is set out in the 2017 Annual Transition Statement, which I laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 8 December last.  This Statement details the key measures in place in the respective sectors, the objective for each measure, estimated mitigation potential and funding information, where appropriate.</p>  <p>  Building on the approach set out in the National Mitigation Plan, the Government&rsquo;s recently launched &lsquo;Project Ireland 2040&rsquo;, comprising the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan 2018-2027, which will support significant progress towards Ireland&rsquo;s National Transition Objective for 2050.  National Strategic Objective 8 of The National Development Plan commits funding of &euro;21.8 billion towards climate action investments, including some &euro;14 billion to be invested by Ireland&rsquo;s semi-state companies and by the private sector.  This means that almost &euro;1 in every &euro;5 to be spent in the framework of the National Development Plan over the next decade will be on climate action, with a strong focus on strategic investments in the areas of transport, renewable energy, grid development and interconnection, the built environment, and flood risk management, to address the significant climate change challenges that Ireland faces.  </p>  <p>  This funding commitment provides a clear opportunity for significant upscaling in our investments to deliver deep emissions reductions in the coming decade and to further develop and implement the National Mitigation Plan.  This will be essential both in order to meet Ireland&rsquo;s targets, under the draft EU Effort Sharing Regulation, for a 30% reduction in non-ETS  sector by 2030, relative to 2005 levels, as well as to make significant progress towards Ireland&rsquo;s National Transition Objective for 2050 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Ireland by at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) and, in parallel, to pursue an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.</p></reply>

The scheme targeted the high electricity use associated with milking parlours by funding upgrades to high efficiency pumps and variable speed drives (VSDs).  These measures can reduce electricity consumption for milking by 60% which can result in savings of over 10% on total farm energy costs.  SEAI are reviewing possible new technologies with Teagasc with a view to launching the new scheme in April with c.&euro;400,000 of funding from my Department. </p><p>There is a range of other supports for energy efficiency and emissions reductions available through the SEAI which may be of interest to the agricultural sector.  These include energy management training for SMEs; free information and best practice guides on energy management; and the EXEED (Excellence in Energy Efficiency and Design) scheme.  The SEAI also produces the &ldquo;Triple E&rdquo; Register of products approved as being energy efficient.  Coupled with the Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA) scheme, this allows businesses to identify and buy the most energy efficient equipment and write down the cost of such equipment in the year of purchase rather than over 8 years.  More detail of these supports can be found on the SEAI website at <i>www.seai.ie.  </i></p></reply>

Today, almost seven out of ten of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband.  Since this Government came into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband.  This will increase to nearly eight out of ten premises by the end of this year and by 2020, nine out of ten premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection.  This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.  The premises referred to by the Deputy is in an amber area on my Department&rsquo;s high speed broadband map, which is available at<i><font color="#2F2F2F"> www.broadband.gov.ie. </font></i>It is therefore included in the State intervention area under the national broadband plan, NBP.</p><p>In April 2017 the map was updated, moving 84,500 premises from the blue to the amber area. This was done because commercial operator plans in those areas had not materialised.  The premises referred to by the Deputy was among the number moved from blue to amber. </p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  That procurement process is now in its final stages.</p><p>In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the mobile phone and broadband taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the broadband officers is continuing to strengthen.  These broadband officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.There is a link to a list of these local broadband officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

Addressing the climate challenge requires a whole-of-society and whole-of-Government approach.  The radical step change represented by the national development plan will need to be matched with efforts in all sectors, and public expenditure commitments will need to be complemented with taxation measures, regulation, and behavioural change.</p>  <p>  During the period of the Plan, key capital investments to be overseen by my Department will comprise some:</p>  <p>  - &euro;3.8 billion on upgrading the energy efficiency rating to achieve a minimum of BER Rating B in the existing residential, commercial and public building stock.   Coupled with this, new buildings will be regulated to the highest standards and the roll-out of digital connectivity will facilitate &ldquo;smart buildings&rdquo;;</p>  <p>  - &euro;1 billion on rolling out energy-efficient heating technologies under the support scheme for renewable heat aimed at large heat users, along with support for heat pumps and roof solar in at least 170,000 homes;</p>  <p>  - &euro;0.2 billion to incentivise the uptake of 500,000 electric vehicles by 2030, and provide additional charging infrastructure.   Related support measures include a ban on new non-zero emission cars being sold in Ireland after 2030 and no NCT certificate for non-zero emission cars after 2045.</p>  <p>  - &euro;0.1 billion on energy research funding to accelerate diversification away from fossil fuels to green energy.</p>  <p>In addition,  the new renewable electricity support scheme will support the installation by public and private entities of up to 4,500 MW of additional renewable electricity.  </p>  <p>  Commercial State owned enterprises under my Department&rsquo;s aegis will also play a crucial role in climate action initiatives.  Major investment projects in excess of &euro;13 billion by inter alia, ESB, EirGrid and Bord na Mona, include the decarbonisation of electricity generation involving the conversion of Moneypoint power station and the peat burning plants to more sustainable low-carbon technologies and the roll out of national smart energy metering programme.  Enhanced electricity interconnection and ongoing grid reinforcement will increase energy security and facilitate more variable electricity generation. </p></reply>

An initial draft working document of the new proposal was circulated to stakeholders in November 2017.  The regulatory process to develop and improve this proposal is ongoing and involves significant stakeholder consultation.  Exemptions for several specialist lighting applications, including stage/theatre lighting, and how best to define these exemptions without creating loopholes to the regulation are being considered as part of this process.  It is expected that the regulation will be adopted by the EU Commission towards the end of 2018.   Any further queries on the proposal should be directed to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p></reply>

The Act provides for a declaration of non-use of a vehicle to be made at any time in the month before tax falls due.   Where a declaration is not made within the required timeframe, motor tax must be taken out for the minimum period provided for in legislation, along with any arrears incurred by the vehicle owner.   A new declaration can then be made at any stage during the final month of the new motor tax disc if the vehicle is thereafter not going to be in use in a public place.   These arrangements were well publicised at the time of introduction of the legislation.</p>  <p>  In relation to insurance,  Article 2(5) of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing)(Amendment) Regulations 1992 provides that, on each application for motor tax, the owner of a vehicle shall produce to the licensing authority (motor tax office), if so requested by that authority, relevant evidence of insurance in respect of the vehicle.    Relevant evidence of insurance generally means a certificate of insurance showing that when the motor tax disc comes into operation, there will be in force an approved policy of insurance covering the use of the vehicle.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the fact that there is already a provision for discretion to be exercised by licensing authorities, I will consider the matter further insofar as it applies to those applying for motor tax in the circumstances described by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Addressing urban congestion on both the strategic road network and locally in certain locations is an important theme in the strategy.  The measures proposed are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region.</p>  <p>  A number of key public transport projects will be delivered across the Dublin region over the period of the new national development plan 2018-2027 which will address growing congestion in the city and capacity constraints on the existing public transport network.  These projects include BusConnects, Metro Link and priority elements of the DART expansion programme.  In addition to these, there will be continued investment in sustainable transport projects including traffic management and other smarter travel projects along with new urban and cycling routes in Dublin to allow transport infrastructure to function more effectively and relieve congestion.</p>  <p>  BusConnects is the main investment priority for public transport to address growing congestion in Dublin in the short to medium term.   A radical improvement in the bus system can deliver a step change in performance across all areas of the Dublin region within a relatively short time. BusConnects will provide a greatly enhanced bus service across Dublin, with high quality infrastructure, including continuous bus lanes as far as is practicable along the busiest bus corridors along with a network of park and ride facilities at key locations, enhanced services and major improvements in ticketing and information.   The advantage of a bus-based solution is that the implementation can start quickly and the benefits of BusConnects can start coming on stream progressively from 2019.</p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for further reply on the information sought and issues raised.  The Deputy should contact my office should a reply not be received within 10 days.</p></reply>

While it is welcomed that so many new customers are using the extended green line, it has meant that, at certain times of the day, some trams are operating at capacity.  The Luas cross city project included the purchase of seven additional new trams which, at 55 m length, have a higher passenger capacity than existing trams, carrying up to 379 passengers per tram and increasing overall capacity on the green line.  Two of these additional trams very recently came into service.  Another is currently in Ireland undergoing final testing and commissioning and is expected to go into passenger service at the start of March.  The remaining four trams, following the necessary final testing and commissioning, will be put into service progressively over the following ten weeks.   Once all seven new trams are fully deployed they, together with the existing fleet, will provide additional passenger capacity on the green line in the short-term.</p>  <p>  The NTA has also advised of planned changes to the Luas green line timetable in May to improve the frequency of service between Broombridge and Brides Glen, particularly in the morning and evening peak periods on the green and red lines.  </p>  <p>  Into the future, passenger numbers are expected to increase further on the green Line over the next few years, and the green line capacity enhancement project - which was recently approved by Government - is the next step in the medium term to further expand capacity, especially at peak hours, so as to cater for future demands along the line.  The project features in the NTA&rsquo;s published GDA Strategy.  It involves the lengthening of the 26 existing green line trams from 43 m to 55 m and the purchase of a further 8 new 55 metre-long trams which will greatly increase the passenger capacity of the fleet to meet future passenger demand.  The capacity increases at peak periods which will be provided by the project will assist in reducing crowding on the green line and enhance accessibility for mobility and sensory impaired users during these periods.  A necessary complementary investment project, known as the green line infrastructure upgrade - an investment project to lengthen the platforms at the existing green line stations - was completed towards the end of last year and enables the use of the new, longer trams.</p></reply>

A further &euro;135m capital funding is allocated over this same period for investment in Sustainable Urban Transport projects, and these will include projects that will provide either direct or indirect improvements for urban cycling.  In addition to these cycling-specific investments, the BusConnects programme, which will involve re-configuring the city bus network and infrastructure, will also entail construction of significant new cycling facilities alongside bus routes on the key radial routes into the city centre and provide safe cycling arrangements, largely segregated from other traffic along those corridors. All these substantial investments will allow us to further increase the numbers cycling, thereby easing congestion, improving public health and enhancing the liveability of our cities.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Government's recently published National Development Plan, as part of the annual Estimates process, the multi-annual capital allocations will be reviewed and extended annually on a rolling basis to cover the coming 5-year period.  This will provide Government with an annual opportunity to review the allocations in light of any implementation issues arising and/ or new priorities which may emerge as the National Development Plan is implemented.  The NDP also commits to a full mid-term review of the National Development Plan in 2022, to allow Government to take stock of progress in terms of delivery of the planned projects and programmes, and to allow Government to review and reaffirm its investment priorities.  The review will be carried out in order to prepare and publish a new updated 10-year plan for public capital investment in 2023, covering the period 2023 to 2032.</p></reply>

In addition, the Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to proceed with the metro scheme.</p>  <p>  The recently published Project Ireland 2040 now proposes to take forward a Metro Link scheme to run from Swords, via Dublin Airport to Dublin&rsquo;s south city centre (operating in tunnel under the city centre) and onwards to Sandyford using the existing Luas Green Line to ensure that growth along this corridor can be accommodated.  This will provide Dublin with a high capacity, high-frequency cross-city rail corridor serving critical destinations such as Swords, Dublin Airport, Dublin City University, Ballymun, the Mater Hospital and existing destinations along the Luas Green Line to Sandyford.  Metro Link will provide faster reliable journey times to and from these key destinations while offering interchange with other rail, DART Expansion, light rail and bus services. </p>  <p>  The next steps are that the details of the Metro Link scheme (Swords to Sandyford) will put out to public consultation in the coming weeks, with construction expected to commence in 2021 with a view to delivering the project by 2027.</p></reply>

Allocations under the 2017 round of the programme were announced on 30 November (local projects) and 21 December (regional projects) with a total of &euro;60m allocated.  Under this most recent round of the SCP, the maximum grant which could be applied for was &euro;150,000 for local projects and &euro;200,000 for a regional project.</p>  <p>  In relation to future investment, the recently published National Development Plan 2018 - 2027 contains a commitment to establish a new &ldquo;Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund&rdquo; with &euro;100m available over the coming years.  The Fund will be for larger projects where the proposed Government contribution exceeds the amount available under the SCP.  </p>  <p>  My officials will draft the terms and conditions of the new scheme over the coming months.  All projects funded under the scheme will be subject to the Public Spending Code and State Aid requirements.  In terms of calls for proposals, it is envisaged that at a minimum, the National Governing Bodies of Sport and local authorities will be asked to prioritise projects for possible inclusion.  Prior to the terms and conditions of the new scheme being finalised and relevant organisations having the opportunity to apply, it is obviously not possible at this stage to say whether any specific projects will be supported under the new scheme.  I am aware however, of the development plans for the stadium referred to and recently visited the venue at the request of Deputy Peter Burke to be updated on the proposals in this regard. </p></reply>

In addition, the Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to proceed with the metro scheme.</p>  <p>  The recently published Project Ireland 2040 now proposes to take forward a Metro Link scheme to run from Swords, via Dublin Airport to Dublin&rsquo;s south city centre (operating in tunnel under the city centre) and onwards to Sandyford using the existing Luas Green Line to ensure that growth along this corridor can be accommodated.  This will provide Dublin with a high capacity, high-frequency cross-city rail corridor serving critical destinations such as Swords, Dublin Airport, Dublin City University, Ballymun, the Mater Hospital and existing destinations along the Luas Green Line to Sandyford.  Metro Link will provide faster reliable journey times to and from these key destinations while offering interchange with other rail, DART Expansion, light rail and bus services. </p>  <p>  The next steps are that the details of the Metro Link scheme (Swords to Sandyford) will put out to public consultation in the coming weeks, with construction expected to commence in 2021 with a view to delivering the project by 2027.  An application for a Railway Order will be submitted when a detailed Business Case for the scheme has been approved that seeks power to construct and operate the scheme and also to ensure that the necessary compulsory purchase order arrangements are given effect to secure the scheme.</p>  <p>  In relation to development levies, they are in the first instance a matter for the relevant local authorities.  I understand that both Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council have been advised by the National Transport Authority to cease their existing Development Contribution Schemes for Metro North, and that the process of refunding contributions to those who paid them has begun.  Noting NTA's advice in this particular regard, I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for further reply on the information sought and issues raised.  The Deputy should contact my office should a reply not be received within 10 days.</p></reply>

This further enhancement of ECCE to two full years delivers on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers.</p>  <p>  This new measure will address the inconsistencies that led to a wide range in the number of free preschool weeks; some children could avail of 61 weeks, while others could avail of 88 weeks, and will ensure a programme that is more equitable for children.</p>  <p>  The number of entry points into ECCE will revert to one at the beginning of the 2018 programme year (September).

The objective of the new Fund is to drive collaborative, coordinated and complementary packages of investment between Departments, agencies, Local Authorities and other public bodies, to transform our rural towns and villages and their outlying areas.  </p>  <p>  Proposals for funding will be made on a competitive bid-based approach, based on delivering on the objectives in the National Planning Framework to support rural Ireland.  The Plan provides that proposals submitted for funding will have to demonstrate a participant contribution from State, local authority, or other funding.  This is currently the case in relation to the schemes operated by my Department and helps to achieve additionality.</p>  <p>  Initial funding of &euro;315 million is being allocated to the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund over the period 2019 to 2022.  This initial phase will allow my Department to build on existing initiatives which it administers, as well as to support new collaborative initiatives as outlined above.  The initial period of funding will also provide an opportunity for an assessment of both specific projects and the method of allocation of this funding, and will inform further allocations.  Funding under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund will continue beyond 2022, to 2027.</p>  <p>  As set out in the National Development Plan, my Department currently operates a number of schemes to support rural regeneration.  These include the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, CL&Aacute;R and the Rural Recreation Infrastructure Scheme.  While each of these schemes makes a valuable impact in its own right, I want to build on the synergies between the schemes to achieve better outcomes for people who live in rural areas. </p>  <p>  The National Development Plan also envisages that, over time, these schemes will be integrated into the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund.  This will provide an opportunity to align the schemes with complementary initiatives operated by other Departments to maximise the impact on rural communities of investment across national and local government, and achieve better value for money.  </p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing proposals for the detailed operation of the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, and I will announce the details following consultation with relevant Government colleagues.</p></reply>

LEADER is administered by Local Action Groups (LAGs) which deliver funding in accordance with Local Development Strategies that have been agreed for each LAG area. </p>  <p>  &euro;220 million of the available funding has already been allocated to the 28 LEADER sub-regional areas throughout the country.  This allocation covers the full duration of the Programme rather than being allocated on an annual basis.  This provides greater flexibility to Local Acton Groups in managing their allocation within and between years.  The allocation for County Louth for the period of the programme is &euro;6,101,862.</p>  <p>  The overall expenditure incurred for Co. Louth under the 2014-2020 LEADER Programme as of 22 February 2018 was &euro;408,782.  The figure includes expenditure on Preparatory Support (for the development of a Local Development Strategy for Louth), Administration costs (which includes Animation) and Project Payments.</p>  <p>  As of 22 February, 20 projects with a value of over &euro;258,390 had been approved for LEADER funding in Louth.  A further 3 projects requesting over &euro;148,230 in funding are at various stages of the approval process.  This funding will be drawn down as projects start to incur expenditure and submit payment claims.</p>  <p>  I anticipate that there will be a significant increase in project approvals and expenditure over the course of 2018 based on the progress which has been made nationally in approving projects in recent months.  My Department has also introduced a number of administrative improvements to the LEADER programme which will also assist LAGs and project promoters in their delivery of the programme. </p></reply>

It is a supplementary income support scheme designed specifically for those participants whose income falls below a certain limit.  To remain eligible to participate on the scheme the participant must be actively farming or fishing and satisfy the means test pertaining to the farm/fish assist or jobseekers allowance. </p>  <p>  The means assessment for RSS includes income that the participant and their spouse/civil partner or cohabitant has and means derived from any capital or property (except their own home).  In general, the means assessment that applies to the RSS is the farm assist scheme criteria.  Accordingly, 70% of all self-employment (engaged in by a participant and their spouse/ civil partner) whether farm or off-farm is assessed as the gross yearly income which they may be reasonably expected to receive less all costs necessarily incurred in carrying out the self-employment. </p>  <p>  Payment of RSS is not taken into account when assessing the weekly means.  An additional annual disregard of &euro;254 for each of the first two children and &euro;381 for the third and subsequent children is also applied under the farm assist criteria, where applicable. </p>  <p>  This Department endeavours at all times to ensure that only eligible customers benefit from the scheme.  This also applies to people who are already participating on a scheme.  Any change in a participant's/household's circumstances should be notified to the Department as this may impact on their continued entitlement and their rate of payment.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the current yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome.  Under this new arrangement, a person who reached pension age after 1 September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Up to 10 years of other credits, for example when unemployed or ill, may also be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years.  So, for example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseeker credits, and 15 years HomeCaring Credits, over a 50 year period.</p>  <p>  For those who do not qualify for the State Pension (contributory) (SPC), there are other state pension payments available.  Notably, they may qualify for the State Pension (non-contributory) which is a means-tested payment (based on their share of household means) with a maximum payment of 95% of the SPC.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult (based on their own means), amounting up to 90% of a full rate SPC pension.  Consequently, if a person doesn&rsquo;t receive a State pension after pension age, they have both significant means and have made little or no contribution to the Social Insurance Fund.  Introducing a new pension entitlement for such people would reduce the resources available for other pensioners, most of whom have less means than they do, and have contributed significantly more to the Social Insurance Fund.</p>  <p>  The model of TCA which will be in place for all new pensioners from 2020 will be decided upon following a consultation later this year, and I do not wish to pre-empt this process, nor the Government decision and legislation which will follow it.  However, I can state that adequate provision for home-carers will be an important factor in the final design.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).

The WSS does this by allowing the employer to make up the cost of a potential shortfall in productivity through grant assistance. </p>  <p>  The subsidy scheme is operated under three strands based on the number of employees with a disability employed.  To participate on the WSS an employee must work a minimum of 21 hours per week up to a maximum of 39 hours per week.  The basic rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour. In addition to a fixed hourly rate per employee (Strand 1), Strands 2 and 3 may be paid in cases where an employer has three or more employees participating on the scheme.  There are currently 2,520 participants employed through the scheme and the estimated cost of the scheme in 2018 is &euro;23 million. </p>  <p>  On an annual basis, the minimum subsidy that an employer can receive is &euro;5,787, where they employ one employee working 21 hours per week, while the maximum subsidy is &euro;17,122 where the employer is benefitting from all three stands and where the employee is working 39 hours per week.  </p>  <p>  The design of the scheme does not provide that the basic hourly subsidy rate of the WSS is explicitly linked to the National Minimum Wage.  Hence, the WSS rate was not reduced when the National Minimum Wage was reduced in 2011.  I have no plans to link the WSS rate with the increase in the National Minimum Wage or to increase the hourly rate of subsidy at this time. However, the scheme is kept under ongoing review and any potential changes to the rate of subsidy could only be considered as part of the wider Budget and estimates process. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The person&rsquo;s Public Service Identity Dataset is verified as part of this process.  Adopted people are treated in the same way as other individuals in terms of verification of identity.  Name, date of birth, place of birth and mother&rsquo;s birth surname are generally verified from the birth certificate or, in the case of an adopted person, from an adoption certificate. </p>  <p>  Generally, in the case of an adopted person, the details on the birth register will be different to those on the adoption register and are not consistent with their current identity.  </p>  <p>  As my Department has access to the Irish Birth Register, the above details can be verified without the need for the individual to physically present a birth certificate, providing that the record can be located on the Register.  </p>  <p>  However, in contrast, my Department does not have access to the Irish Adoption Register.  Accordingly, staff would not be aware of a customer&rsquo;s adoption status.  In such circumstances, the individual is asked to bring a copy of their adoption certificate.  This requirement is stated clearly in SAFE 2 registration invitation letters and on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  When a person presents for a SAFE 2 appointment without a birth certificate, and their birth registration details cannot be located on the Register, they are asked to contact the General Register Office (GRO) to obtain same.  This could be a birth certificate or an adoption certificate. No reference to adoption is made. </p>  <p>  Regarding a person, unaware of their adoption status, finding this out as a result of attending for SAFE registration, this situation presents itself for such persons in all instances where they are required to provide their birth details, for example, passport applications. Discussions are ongoing with the Adoption Authority and the GRO with regard to how best to verify such details for adoptive persons. </p>  <p>  For persons adopted in Ireland, there are two forms of certificate, a full certificate and an abridged certificate. Both are acceptable for the purposes of SAFE registration. Where persons are requested by the Department to provide a birth or adoption certificate, there is a reduced fee of &euro;1.00.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the number of adopted persons who have undergone SAFE registration, the Department does not hold information on a person&rsquo;s adoptive status. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It provides part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping-stone back to employment.  However, it is important to note that these placements are not full-time sustainable jobs and are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market or getting a job for the first time.  The scheme commenced operation in 2011 as a response to the high level of unemployment and the large numbers on the Live Register at that time.  There are 47 Local Development Companies (LDCs), as well as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, involved in the delivery of the T&uacute;s programme - known as Implementing bodies (IBs).   </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes.  Long-term unemployment is expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecasted fall in overall unemployment. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that given the welcome improvements in the labour market in recent years with reducing numbers of long-term unemployed on the Live Register, which is the target cohort for T&uacute;s, it is proving difficult to fill the number of places available nationwide.  However, changes were introduced recently to the selection criteria for T&uacute;s which should broaden the availability of T&uacute;s to a greater number of people on the live register.  This includes an increase in the percentage of assisted referrals from 20% to 30%, as well as permitting someone who has had a break of up to 30 days on the Live Register in the past 12 months to be considered eligible for T&uacute;s selection. </p>  <p>  In the five years since the end of December 2012, there has been a 48% fall in the numbers on the Live Register who are more than 1 year unemployed.  In this context the Department is currently engaging with the Irish Local Development Network &ndash; the representative body for the IBs.</p>  <p>  The Department keeps all aspects of its activation programmes under review to ensure the best outcomes for participants and communities.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

They must first write a letter to their landlord, outlining the issues and giving them a reasonable period in which to rectify the situation.  If the problem persists after the letter has been sent, the tenant may take a case against the landlord through the Residential Tenancies Board.</p><p>Disputes that involve alleged breaches of minimum standards include the following:</p><p>- Allegations of breach of landlord obligations pursuant to Section 12 (1) (b) in which a landlord of a dwelling is obliged to carry out all such repairs necessary to ensure that a dwelling complies with the standards for housing and repairs and replacements of fittings necessary to ensure the dwelling is to a standard comparable to the condition at the commencement of the tenancy and in compliance with any such standards for the time being prescribed; </p><p>- Allegations of breach of tenant obligations, pursuant to Section 16 of the Act, to ensure that no act or omission by the tenant results in a breach of landlord obligations (and, in particular, the landlord&rsquo;s obligations under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992), to notify the landlord or his agent of any defects that need to be repaired and allow the landlord or a person acting on his behalf reasonable access to carry out such repairs. </p><p>Section 86(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides that tenants must continue to pay rent, pending the determination of a dispute that has been referred to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).  It is important that a tenant must continue to pay their rent in full until the tenancy ends and while any RTB dispute is ongoing.  Further information on the RTB's dispute resolution process can be found at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017.  They specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas, oil and electrical supply.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these Regulations. Responsibility for enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority.</p><p>Under Section 34 of Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, any person who by act or omission contravenes the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017, fails to comply with an improvement notice, or re-lets a house in breach of a prohibition notice, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both.  If the contravention, failure to comply or re-letting is continued after conviction, the person shall be guilty of a further offence on every day on which the contravention, failure to comply or re-letting continues and for each such offence shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;400 per day.  </p><p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is underpinned by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.  Under section 41 of the 2014 Act, local authorities are required to commence the inspection process within 8 months of the commencement of HAP support being provided in relation to a particular dwelling, if not already inspected within the previous 12 months.  HAP may be provided on a property which is the subject of a subsisting improvement notice under section 18A of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  HAP shall not be, or shall cease to be, provided on a property which is the subject of proceedings or a prohibition notice under section 18B of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  Where a prohibition notice has come into effect, HAP may continue to be paid for 13 weeks from the date of HAP commencing or the notice coming into force, as appropriate.</p></reply>

As is the case for any private company, their operations are a matter for the management and Board of Directors. I have no function in this regard.</p>  <p>  In general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved: the homeowner, the builder, the developer and/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme.  It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.</p>  <p>   Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014 primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the Building Regulations, rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings.  Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers.</p></reply>

A specific budgetary allocation is not made on a county by county basis under these schemes; rather, in order to ensure that the maximum output can be achieved, funding is available on the basis of performance and capacity to deliver new social homes using these schemes.</p><p>SHCEP supports the delivery of social housing by providing financial support to local authorities for the long term leasing of houses and apartments from private owners, developers and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).  Properties made available under the programme are used to accommodate households from local authority waiting lists.  Leased properties are allocated to tenants in accordance with the relevant local authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.  My Department recoups the cost of the agreements that are made with private property owners, including AHBs, to the local authorities.  Expenditure includes the ongoing cost of contractual arrangements and relevant cost of new contracts made within the year.</p><p>Total Exchequer funding for SHCEP in 2017 was &euro;83.947m; of this amount, a total of  &euro;1,714,383 was recouped to Westmeath County Council.  This supported the ongoing contractual commitments of 341 dwellings, operational at end 2017.</p><p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a flexible and immediate housing support that is now available to all eligible households throughout the State.  There are currently over 33,000 households in receipt of HAP and over 20,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme.  HAP commenced in Westmeath County Council on 1 December 2016 and the total numbers of active HAP tenancies at end 2017 was 366.  The 2017 average monthly rent paid to landlords under the HAP scheme in Westmeath was &euro;540.</p><p>In respect of the provision of HAP funding, Limerick City and County Council provides a highly effective HAP transactional shared service on behalf of all local authorities.  This HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord.  Accordingly, my Department does not recoup individual local authorities in respect of HAP rental payments in their administrative areas but rather recoups all landlord costs via the HAP SSC. </p><p>My Department has, since 2015, provided local authorities with a HAP administrative payment of &euro;150 per HAP household on the basis of the cumulative number of new households supported through HAP in each year.  This administrative payment recognises the resources required to manage the HAP process by local authorities.  Westmeath County Council has received a HAP administrative payment of &euro;24,150 in respect of households supported by them at mid-year 2017.</p><p>RAS was established in 2004 and placed responsibility on local authorities to meet the accommodation needs of people in receipt of Rent Supplement for 18 months or longer, and who are assessed as having a long-term housing need.  RAS provides a more structured, accommodation-based approach to the use of the private rented sector to meet long-term housing need, thereby eliminating dependence on temporary income support payments, i.e. rent supplement.  On a phased basis, long-term Rent Supplement recipients will transfer to social housing and have their longterm housing need met by local authorities under the RAS.  </p><p>At 31 December 2017, 60,338 households with a long-term housing need have been transferred from Rent Supplement to RAS and other social housing solutions nationally.  Of these, 34,493 were housed directly under RAS and a further 25,895 were accommodated under other social housing options, excluding HAP.  Since the first transfers commenced in 2005 to end of December 2017, Westmeath County Council has transferred 1,105 Rent Supplement recipients directly to RAS and a further 341 to other social housing options, excluding HAP. </p><p>A total of &euro;134.338 million was allocated to RAS in 2017.  Of this, the total RAS expenditure in 2017 for Westmeath County Council was &euro;3,902,877.  This funding supported the continuing cost of Westmeath County Council&rsquo;s 575 existing RAS contracts at the beginning of 2017, as well as the transfer of an additional 100 tenancies from Rent Supplement to RAS during 2017.</p></reply>

Under section 16(h) of the Residential Tenancies Act, a tenant shall not engage, nor allow their visitors to engage, in anti-social behaviour.  Section 17 of the Act defines anti-social behaviour to include behaviour that: constitutes the commission of an offence reasonably likely to affect directly the well-being or welfare of others; could cause fear, danger, injury, damage or loss to certain persons; or persistently prevents or interferes with the peaceful occupation of others in the property or neighbourhood.  </p><p>Under section 15 of the Act, a landlord owes to each person who could be potentially affected a duty to enforce the tenant&rsquo;s obligations and section 77 provides that third parties who are directly and adversely affected by tenants engaging in anti-social behaviour may, subject to certain conditions, refer a complaint to the RTB for resolution, where a landlord has failed to enforce their tenant&rsquo;s obligations.  Further information can be obtained on the RTB&rsquo;s website at <i></i>.</p><p>In relation to tenants engaging in anti-social behaviour in a local authority dwelling, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 provides for a court order on application by the tenant, tenant purchaser or the housing authority or approved body concerned, which has the effect of excluding a household member engaged in anti-social behaviour from the dwelling and, if appropriate, from the estate in question for a maximum period of 3 years.  The Act also empowers a housing authority to refuse to allocate or sell a dwelling to a person engaged in anti-social behaviour or in the interest of good estate management.  </p><p>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 strengthened the powers of housing authorities in relation to securing excluding orders where there is anti-social behaviour in their housing stock.  Part 2 of the 2014 Act prescribes procedures to deal with serious breaches of the tenancy agreements for their dwellings, including anti-social behaviour and strengthens the power of housing authorities to recover possession of their dwellings from households in serious breach of their tenancy agreements, including engaging in anti-social behaviour.</p><p>Section 35 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 requires each housing authority, by reserved function, to adopt an &lsquo;&lsquo;anti-social behaviour strategy&rsquo;&rsquo; for the prevention and reduction of anti-social behaviour in its housing stock.  </p><p>Such strategies apply to dwellings let under the Housing Acts 1966 to 2009 and dwellings let under Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) Availability Agreements (Chapter 4), as defined in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  The tenancy agreement and legislation, which forms an integral part of the anti-social behaviour strategy, allows for a more targeted approach in dealing with persons engaged in anti-social behaviour and to avoid, if possible, the eviction of an entire household.</p><p>In respect of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, under section 45(6) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, local authorities may refuse to provide, or cease providing, housing assistance in respect of a qualified household where the local authority considers that any household member is or has been engaged in anti-social behaviour.  Under this section, the local authority may also refuse to permit a person who proposes to take up or resume residence or enter or be in a dwelling the subject of housing assistance where the local authority considers that the person is or has been engaged in anti-social behaviour.  As they are private rental tenancies, the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Acts also apply to tenancies in the RAS and HAP schemes.  It is a matter for local authorities to assess whether housing applicants are engaging in anti-social behaviour.</p></reply>

Furthermore, Article 10 of the Regulations provides that certain changes of use, with regard to particular classes of use, are also exempted from the requirement to obtain permission.  Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations.</p>  <p>  Article 10(4) of the 2001 Regulations provides that:</p>  <p>  &lsquo;Development consisting of the use of not more than 4 bedrooms in a house, where each bedroom is used for the accommodation of not more than 4 persons as overnight guest accommodation, shall be exempted development for the purposes of the Act, provided that such development would not contravene a condition attached to a permission under the Act or be inconsistent with any use specified or included in such a permission.&rsquo;</p>  <p>  It is important to note that, for the purposes of Article 10(4), the Regulations provide that &ldquo;house&rdquo; does not &ldquo;include a building designed for use or used as 2 or more dwellings or a flat, an apartment or other dwelling within such a building&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Part (f) of Class 14 of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the 2001 Regulations provides an exemption for development consisting of a change of use from use as a house, to use as a residence for persons with an intellectual or physical disability or mental illness and persons providing care for such persons, subject to conditions and limitations.</p>  <p>  The exemptions provided for in the 2001 Regulations are kept under regular review.  Exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission in respect of specific forms of development are provided for when they are considered to be consistent with proper planning and sustainable development.  If an exemption is not provided for in the Act or associated Regulations, planning permission is required, under which a number of public notifications are made during the consideration of the application.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current arrangements for the consideration of planning applications allow for extensive public participation in the decision-making process and I have no proposals to amend the legislation in this regard.</p></reply>

Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers.</p><p>In general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, the homeowner, the builder, the developer and/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme.  It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.</p><p>In August 2017, I published a Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings, where concerns arise.  The Framework is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern.  The Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations.</p><p>In response to the many building failures that have emerged over the past decade, my Department introduced the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, which require greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.</p><p>A Certificate of Compliance on Completion is jointly signed by the builder and the assigned certifier.  This must be accompanied by plans and documentation to show how the constructed building complies with the building regulations and also the inspection plan, as implemented.</p><p>In parallel with the 2014 Regulations, a project is in place in the Local Government Management Agency to improve the effectiveness of the Building Control System.  A number of enhancements have been delivered to date and others are in progress, including: </p><p>1. To facilitate the consistent implementation of the changes introduced by the 2014 Regulations, the electronic administration of building control functions and to provide a common platform for clear and consistent administration of building control matters across the local authority sector, the Building Control Management System (BCMS) IT system was developed. </p><p>2. To standardise work practices, systems, procedures and decision-making in relation to oversight of building control activity across the sector, a &ldquo;Framework for Building Control Authorities&rdquo; was developed and first published in September 2014 and revised in June 2016.</p><p>3. To further support local building control authorities in their daily activities, a compliance support work stream has been developed.  A number of frequently asked questions have been answered through this system. </p><p>4. To support staff in building control authorities to carry out their work effectively, training programmes have been developed. </p><p>5. To increase the level of meaningful inspections of building activity, a BCMS module is currently being developed to collect data at commencement, which will further inform building control staff in planning risk based targeted inspections.</p><p>The Local Government Management Agency is working towards encapsulating all these work streams into a centralised structure for the governance and oversight of Building Control.  This structure will ultimately be a shared service embedded in a lead local authority. </p><p>At the end of May 2017, the Government approved the draft heads of a Bill to place the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) on a statutory footing and the Bill was referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny.  I received the Committee&rsquo;s report on 14 December 2017 and I am considering its recommendations, with a view to progressing the drafting as soon as possible.</p><p>Once it is enacted, the Bill will provide consumers who engage a registered builder with the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator and will complement the reforms which have been made through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations and contribute to the development of a culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector.</p><p>With regard to timber framed construction, in accordance with the recommendations of the , a standard in relation to timber frame construction was developed. Irish Standard 440: 2009/A1:2014 Timber Frame Construction, Dwellings and other Buildings (I.S. 440) specifies requirements for materials, design, manufacture, construction details, site work and quality control for platform timber frame construction.  It requires that the responsibilities for the tasks involved in the planning, structural design, site erection and inspection be agreed and recorded prior to the commencement of each project.  I.S. 440 also gives specific details relating to fire, including the construction of separating walls, horizontal and vertical fire stopping, cavity barriers and detailed fire stopping junctions for walls and floors and service penetrations.</p><p>I understand that I.S. 440 is currently under review, and it is intended that both external and party wall new constructions and methods will be included in the next revision of the document.  Manufacturers of timber frame buildings are assessed under an approval scheme operated by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) for compliance with I.S. 440 requirements including Factory Production Control (FPC) and a register of compliant manufacturers is available on the NSAI website at <i>.</i></p><p>It should also be noted that my Department has recently issued guidance on Timber Frame Walls, which have been tested to the European fire test standard and meet the performance set down in Technical Guidance Document B (TGD B) for external and separating walls in dwellings.  This has been transmitted to all registered users of the Building Control Management System and to all Building Control Authorities.</p><p>In relation to fire safety, work has been on-going to review TGD B &ndash; Fire Safety (2006) and a new Part B/ TGD B Volume 2 (2017) came into force on 1 July 2017.  This Volume 2 applies to dwelling houses only.  Important revisions in the TGD B Volume 2 include enhanced provision for fire detection and alarm systems in dwelling houses, guidance on fire safety in community dwelling houses, guidance on timber frame construction, including new provisions in respect of timber frame party walls, enhanced provisions in respect of loft conversions, new provisions for galleries in dwelling houses and other general updates.  A revised Volume 1 is being prepared for public consultation.</p></reply>

I have no plans to change this at this time, given the fact that the sector is successfully delivering social housing in support of the targets set down under Rebuilding Ireland.  This was evident in the Social Housing Output indicative figures published last month, showing that nearly 26,000 households had their social housing need met in 2017. </p>  <p>  I expect 2018 to be another strong year for the delivery of social homes, while the introduction this year of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, the Affordable Purchase Scheme and the Affordable Rental Scheme will see important advances in these areas.  The Affordable Purchase Scheme will see affordable homes built initially on State land, in co-operation with local authorities.  With the Affordable Rental Scheme, a pilot project is being undertaken with Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, in conjunction with the Housing Agency and an Approved Housing Body (AHB), using publicly-owned land.  To further assist in this work, I announced following my review of Rebuilding Ireland, that Minister of State Damien English will lead a new delivery team in my Department working with local authorities and AHBs on social housing delivery.  This will further add to the impetus already in place for the delivery of much needed social housing homes across the country, by local authorities and AHBs.</p>  <p>  These initiatives being advanced with local authorities as well as AHBs further illustrate that the model we now have is delivering across the key thematic areas of social and affordable housing in line with the objectives under Rebuilding Ireland.  Accordingly, the establishment of a new delivery structure is unnecessary.</p>  <p>  There remains further significant potential for the delivery of social and affordable homes from the State's land bank.  While I am continuing to work with the local authority Chief Executives on this, I have established a dedicated Residential Land Management and Development Group to oversee this important work.  </p>  <p>  From a longer-term strategic perspective, as part of Project Ireland 2040, the Government announced on 16 February its intention to establish a new National Regeneration and Development Agency, which will have a role in managing the State's wider publicly-owned land bank to ensure that overall development needs, including housing, are met.  The new Agency will work closely with local authorities, Government Departments, and other State and semi-State bodies to secure the best use of public lands and ensure the delivery on the objectives of the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to supporting households in long-term mortgage arrears to remain in their homes where possible.  There are currently two Mortgage to Rent schemes funded by my Department.  One of the schemes provides that a local authority can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant.  The second scheme provides that an approved housing body can acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage from a lender, while also allowing the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant.  Both schemes are part of the overall suite of social housing options and an important part of the mortgage arrears resolution process.  These schemes target only the most acute arrears cases where a mortgage is clearly unsustainable.</p>  <p>  Where households do end up residing in emergency accommodation, for whatever reason, there are a range of services available to families during the duration of their stay, as well as supports to assist such households secure new independent tenancies.  Long-term housing needs will be met through a range of social housing supports, including the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme and general social housing allocations.  Progress is being made in this regard and during 2017, over 4,000 adults that were homeless, or at risk of homelessness, entered into sustainable independent tenancies.</p>  <p>  In this regard, I recently notified housing authorities of the availability of exchequer funding to support a new initiative to exit homeless individuals and households from emergency accommodation.  It is now open to housing authorities to implement a &lsquo;place-finder&rsquo; service, similar to that which has been operating successfully in Cork and Dublin.  This service will provide assistance to homeless households to secure a HAP tenancy.  Place-finder services will assist such households to seek out properties in the rented sector that are suited to the household&rsquo;s particular needs and will provide access to deposits and advance rental payments. </p></reply>

Security of tenure provisions under the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2016 apply once a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months, with no notice of termination having been served during that time.  Section 34 provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination in any notice served, in line with those set out in section 34 of the Act.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Acts to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.  Section 56 of the Act provides that, where there is an abuse of the termination procedure in section 34, a tenant may bring a complaint to the RTB on the basis that they have been unjustly deprived of possession of a dwelling by their landlord.  Further information from the RTB is available at and through the RTB helpline - Lo-call on 0818 30 30 37 (mobile operators may charge a premium rate to the Lo-call number) or 01 702 8100 - available from Monday to Friday, 8:30am to 6.30pm. </p><p>The so-called &lsquo;Tyrrelstown amendment', included in the 2016 Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act, already limits the ability of landlords to use the grounds of sale to terminate tenancies, provided for in section 34 of the Residential Tenancies Act.  Where a landlord proposes to sell 10 or more units within a single development at the same time, that sale will now be subject to the existing tenants remaining in situ, other than in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, enacted on 4 December 2015, provided that notice periods for the termination of further Part 4 tenancies, i.e. tenancies that extended beyond 4 years, be extended <i>pro rata</i>in line with the length of the tenancy, subject to caps of 224 days for termination by landlords and 112 days for terminations by tenants (previously 112 days for landlords and 56 days for tenants). </p><p>Furthermore, the Strategy for the Rental Sector, published in December 2016, recognises rapidly increasing rent prices as the most significant challenge to security of tenure in the rental sector at present.  Where tenants cannot afford their rents, their tenancies are not secure and evictions for non-payment of rent may ensue.  </p><p>To address this, the Government introduced, through the 2016 Act, the concept of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) to moderate the rate of rent increases in those areas of the country where rents are highest and rising quickly.  The 2016 Act also gave effect to other actions to address tenants&rsquo; security, including the abolition of a landlord&rsquo;s right, during the first 6 months of a further Part 4 tenancy, to end that tenancy for no stated ground, and the extension of the term of Part 4 tenancies from 4 to 6 years.</p><p>In September 2017, as part of the review of the Rent Predictability Measures, I announced a series of further measures in relation to the rental sector, including a two-year change plan to develop and strengthen the role of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), particularly with regard to enforcement.</p><p>With regard to social housing supply, the Government has made housing a top priority and, through the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan, has a framework in place to deliver an increase and acceleration in the supply of high quality housing, including social and affordable homes, particularly in the major urban areas where demand is greatest.</p><p>Rebuilding Ireland contains a suite of actions that will increase housing construction and refurbishment.  Under Pillar 2 of the Action Plan, 50,000 new social homes will be delivered by 2021, supported by &euro;6 billion in exchequer funding.  Of these, 33,500 homes will be provided through direct construction and refurbishment and as of Quarter 3 of 2017, there were over 12,000 new homes in the social housing construction pipeline, including those on site or recently completed, and this is being added to on a weekly basis.  I expect to provide a further update on social housing construction activity in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

It provides that the Housing Agency, in consultation with the relevant housing authority, may make a written proposal to the Minister that an identified area be prescribed as a Rent Pressure Zone.  Within 1 week of receipt of such a proposal, the Minister shall request the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to furnish him, within 2 weeks, with a report on whether the proposed area satisfies the criteria specified in subsection 24A(4) for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone.</p><p>The criteria to be satisfied by an area under section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Acts for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone are as follows:</p><p>(a) the information relating to the area, as determined by reference to the information used to compile each quarterly RTB Rent Index report, shows that the annual rate of increase in the average amount of rent for that area is more than 7% in each of at least 4 of the 6 quarters, preceding the period immediately prior to the date of the Housing Agency's proposal. </p><p>(b) the average rent for the area in the last quarter, as determined by reference to the information used to compile the RTB Rent Index<i>,</i>is above the average national rent (commonly referred to as the Rent Index national standardised rent) in the last quarter.</p><p>The Housing Agency will continue to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation.  Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones.  </p><p>The RTB's news page link in relation to its Rent Index - - provides access to the most recent RTB Rent Index quarterly report (for Q3 2017) and summarises its key findings.  Information is also provided as part of the RTB's education and awareness campaign relating to Rent Pressure Zones. </p><p>Table 9 in the RTB Rent Index report illustrates the recent rent changes at Local Electoral Area (LEA) level.  The table outlines for each LEA the number of quarters within the last 6 Quarters where the annualised rent increases have been greater than or equal to 7% and how rent levels in each LEA compares to the Rent Index national standardised rent.</p><p>In September 2017, as part of the review of the Rent Predictability Measures, I announced a series of measures in relation to the rental sector, including a two-year change plan to develop and strengthen the role of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), particularly with regard to enforcement.</p><p>Charging rents above those permitted by the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2016 will become an offence and the RTB will be provided with the required powers of enforcement so that it will no longer be solely up to the tenant to initiate a dispute.  A landlord will be required to notify the RTB of any exemption claimed from the rent increase limits and the RTB will be empowered to take follow up enforcement action, if required.  These changes will strengthen the impact of the Rent Predictability Measure and will further slow the growth in rents.  These enhanced enforcement procedures to be introduced in 2018 will reform the Rent Pressure Zone mechanism to deliver a more effective and transparent approach to its operation. </p><p>The Government has given priority to the drafting and early publication of a Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill to address this and other urgent issues in the rental sector. </p></reply>

Under Pillar 2 of the Action Plan, 50,000 new social homes will be delivered by 2021, supported by &euro;6 billion in exchequer funding.  Of these, 33,500 homes will be provided through direct construction and refurbishment.  Significant progress has been made in increasing the build programmes of local authorities and approved housing bodies and there are over 12,000 new homes in the social housing construction pipeline, including those on site or recently completed, and this is being added to on a weekly basis. </p><p>With the funding made available in Budget 2018, the aim is to meet the housing needs of almost 25,500 households during 2018.  Central to this delivery will be the construction of 3,800 new homes by local authorities and approved housing bodies, through direct build, turnkey developments and rapid delivery projects.  This construction programme, underpinned by a multi-faceted Action Plan, is the correct way to make a fast and sustainable response to the housing crisis. </p><p>All local authorities are undertaking social housing construction including on publicly owned lands.  This can be seen in the Social Housing Construction Status Reports which my Department publishes quarterly.  These reports provide information on the construction programme underway for each local authority area, including Kildare and other counties adjacent to Dublin.  The last published report sets out the position at the end of quarter 3 of 2017 when there were over 3,600 new social homes on site and under construction and a further 2,000 new homes with approval to appoint contractors and move onto the construction phase.  That report is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: </p><p>.  </p><p>It will be these schemes that will form the bulk of the housing starts and delivery of the 3,800 homes targeted through new builds in 2018.  The precise timing for the advancement of each of these projects, including completion dates and tenanting, is a matter in the first instance for the relevant local authorities.  However, my Department is working closely on delivery issues with all local authorities, including with Kildare County Council.  This includes the work of a new housing delivery team under Minister of State Damien English and through quarterly meetings to address challenges that might arise with individual projects.</p><p>Kildare County Council, along with all other local authorities, is being funded to significantly increase its delivery of social housing as part of Rebuilding Ireland.  Additional social homes being brought on stream in Kildare are allocated by the Council in accordance with section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated Regulations.  Such allocations are a matter for the Council and my Department does not hold detailed information on allocations.</p></reply>

The NPF is a national plan, with a high level ambition of creating a single vision, a shared set of goals for every community across the country, and to deliver on these in a way that makes sense for our communities, rural and urban alike. </p>  <p>  The Framework recognises the need for sustainable and coordinated development of our towns, villages and rural communities.  To this end, Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies will also be developed, which will link strategic national planning and investment with regional-scale physical planning and the local economic and community development functions of local authorities. </p>  <p>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the Action Plan for Rural Development, published on 23 January 2017, takes a whole-of-Government approach, led by my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, to the economic and social development of rural Ireland and will act as an overarching structure for the co-ordination and implementation of rural initiatives across Government Departments and other public bodies.</p>  <p>  A high proportion of overall national house-building taking place in rural areas points to the degree to which indigenous communities in rural areas are being facilitated in meeting their housing needs locally, with a degree of overspill development from cities and towns as well.</p>  <p>In addition, my Department&rsquo;s 2005 Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing are designed to ensure that planning authorities strike a balance between managing the future of rural areas from a development perspective and at the same time enabling housing requirements of rural communities to be met.  The Guidelines set out how planning authorities should frame their development plan policies for the different types of rural areas which may exist within the development plan area.  These types of areas range from rural areas close to cities and towns at risk of overspill development and more remote areas with low levels of development pressure and consistent patterns of population decline.  The Guidelines also set out policy advice on issues such as access to appropriate wastewater treatment facilities, potential impacts of the development on groundwater, landscape, natural and cultural heritage and addressing road safety issues (e.g. frontage onto national roads). </p>  <p>I am satisfied that a sufficiently flexible and robust policy framework is in place to ensure that rural communities can meet their housing needs and that the National Planning Framework   reinforces this. </p></reply>

Last year, I secured an additional &euro;500 million during Budget 2018 negotiations, to increase the social housing delivery ambition from 47,000 to 50,000 social housing homes by end 2021. Combined with the target to deliver just under 88,000 tenancies under the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Schemes, this means that we will meet the needs of just under 138,000 individuals and families over the lifetime of the Rebuilding Ireland plan.</p><p>It should be noted that we are making good progress, with just under 45,000 households having  their social housing need met since Rebuilding Ireland was initiated. Indeed, I recently published details of the social housing delivery ambition to 2021 against the delivery achieved at end 2017 and this information can be accessed at the following web link:</p><p>.</p><p>The Government is committed to addressing the use of hotels for emergency accommodation and we are working closely with the local authorities to secure the necessary alternative accommodation.  The delivery of family hubs has been an important response and there are now almost 500 units of family accommodation in these hubs.  These facilities offer a greater level of stability than is possible in hotels, with the capacity to provide appropriate play space, cooking and laundry facilities.  My Department will fund and work with local authorities in relation to the delivery of further hubs. </p><p>During the course of 2017, a total of 1,263 families in the Dublin Region were moved on from hotel and B and B accommodation arrangements into either independent tenancies or more appropriate hub accommodation. Nationally last year, over 4,000 exits from homelessness were achieved into sustainable tenancies in local authority and Approved Housing Body housing  and HAP supported accommodation. Every effort will continue to be made to achieve the maximum number of exits from homelessness this year, assisted by the recent extension to all local authorities of the Homeless HAP placefinders service, which has been a key response in Dublin and in Cork since its introduction there last year. </p><p>In relation to the rental market and the particular pressures faced by tenants, the Government has also prioritised a range of actions to ensure that existing rent predictability measures, such as the Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) and increased security of tenure, are fully respected and enforced.</p><p>With well over half of all tenancies now covered by RPZs, we are making sure that all landlords comply with the 4% maximum annual rent increases and we are bringing forward legislation to give the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) increased enforcement powers to act where these new rules are not being applied.  This legislation will also make it an offence to break the RPZ rules. In addition, the RTB published a guidance note in late November on the &ldquo;substantial change&rdquo; exemption in RPZ areas which will make it clearer for landlords and tenants.</p><p>Another key policy that will help to deliver more new properties for rent, and more affordable rental properties, is the finalisation of new apartment planning and design guidelines (which issued for consultation in December 2017), which will facilitate more cost-effective and flexible design to meet different rental market segments. The new guidelines also facilitate the development of specific build-to-rent developments as well as shared accommodation rental models, which are suited to city centre development at scale and which will help to boost the supply of urban core rental accommodation at more affordable levels, in line with the National Planning Framework principle of delivering compact city centre living as opposed to continued outward sprawl.</p></reply>

The new loan will enable credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.  The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not otherwise be able to afford at a higher interest rate.</p><p>Single applicants for the loan must not be earning greater than &euro;50,000 gross per annum.  The combined income of joint applicants must not be greater than &euro;75,000 per annum.  There are no set minimum income limits; however, applicants do need to have sufficient borrowing and repayment capacity and must be capable of repaying the mortgage in accordance with the statutory credit policy underpinning the loan.  These income limits are unchanged from the previous local authority loan offerings.</p><p>Full details of the loan's eligibility criteria and other information is available from the dedicated Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan website: .  Any person who meets the eligibility criteria may apply for a loan regardless of whether or not they are on the local authority housing list or qualified for social housing support.</p></reply>

However, all capital-funded new social housing construction projects, irrespective of the nature of the development, are subject to the Capital Works Management Framework and the Public Spending Code. Therefore, I am satisfied that appropriate value for money scrutiny is in place to assess all delivery proposals.</p>  <p>  Following from the review I undertook of Rebuilding Ireland last September, my Department established a new delivery team to work with Minister of State English and with all local authorities and approved housing bodies in exploring all options for early social housing delivery.</p></reply>

Individuals with a housing need who in the past were reluctant to avail of full time work as they would lose their rent supplement support, can now move to HAP, avail of full-time work and retain their housing support, with an adjustment in their differential rent.</p><p>HAP is available to all eligible households in all local authority areas across the State. HAP has been rolled out on a statutory phased basis since September 2014 with seven local authorities delivering the scheme initially, 11 more authorities added in 2015, ten added in 2016 and the final three Dublin authorities providing HAP from 1 March 2017. The phased nature of the HAP roll-out has allowed for significant learning in the operation of the scheme. In this way, new HAP authorities have benefited from the experience of those authorities where the scheme has been previously operational.  On average in 2017, 350 additional tenancies were being supported by HAP each week, with over 33,000 households currently having their housing needs met under the scheme, and some 20,000 separate landlords and agents currently in receipt of monthly HAP payments.</p><p>As HAP is a social housing support and consequently households are not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list. With the completion of the HAP roll-out and the ending of the scheme&rsquo;s pilot phase, a Ministerial Direction was issued instructing local authorities to continue to offer HAP tenants access to other forms of social housing through the transfer list. To date, more than 800 HAP recipients have transferred to other forms of social housing support this way.</p><p>Since April 2017, following the national roll out of the scheme, in cases where a tenant currently on a local authority waiting list wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area, such requests can now be facilitated under inter-authority movement. In order to maintain the equitable treatment of all housing applicants, inter-authority movement for HAP applicants is based on the current social housing eligibility income bands, i.e. movement will only be facilitated across local authorities with income bands that are equal or higher; or where shared areas of choice are already operated.</p><p>A new HAP website, , was launched in Q1 2017 and provides prospective HAP tenants and landlords with the information that they need to better understand how HAP works.</p><p>In relation to specific HAP supports available to homeless households, the homeless HAP place finder service operating in the Dublin local authorities, and in Cork City Council, is a targeted support for homeless households who are finding it difficult to secure HAP tenancies. The place finder service has been successfully utilised by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE, across the Dublin local authorities since February 2015, with more than 2,000 households currently being supported by the Homeless HAP scheme. A similar service began operating in Cork City in 2017. In order to further assist homeless households in exiting emergency accommodation the homeless HAP place finder service, with effect from 19 January 2018, can now be made available in each of the 31 local authority areas.  All local authorities are now being provided with the options to pay deposits and advance rental payments for any households in emergency homeless accommodation, in order to secure accommodation via the HAP Scheme.</p><p>I continue to keep the operation of HAP under review but I am currently satisfied with how the scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme committed to under Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

This represents a decrease of 5,801 households, or 6.3%, on the previous assessment, completed just over nine months previously in September 2016.</p><p>However, there will be no let up in the Government's focus on this issue and the resources provided through Rebuilding Ireland are allowing us to respond in a significant manner.  Over &euro;1.4 billion was provided for investment in housing in 2017 and this is being increased significantly to &euro;1.9 billion this year.</p><p>This investment will yield substantial delivery activity and ensure that we make further significant progress towards meeting the overall target of delivering 50,000 social homes in the period to 2021, through new build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing. That number is alongside an accelerated roll-out of the housing assistance payment scheme, meeting the needs of some 80,000 households.</p><p>My Department now publishes social housing construction status reports on a quarterly basis. These reports provide information on the construction programme underway in each local authority area. The last published report sets out the position at the end of quarter 3 of 2017 when there were over 3,600 new social homes on site and under construction and a further 2,000 new homes with approval to appoint contractors and move onto the construction phase. That report is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: </p><p>.</p><p>I am confident that the actions, targets and resources available under Rebuilding Ireland provide a strong platform for meeting our challenges in the housing sector and I am satisfied that delivery of the plan remains firmly on track.</p></reply>

All landlords, including those in receipt of Housing Assistance Payment, HAP, have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations and responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority.</p><p>HAP is underpinned by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014. Under section 41 of the 2014 Act, local authorities are required to commence the inspection process within 8 months of the commencement of HAP support being provided in relation to a particular dwelling if not already inspected within the previous 12 months. HAP may be provided on a property which is the subject of a subsisting improvement notice under section 18A of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. HAP shall not be, or shall cease to be, provided on a property which is the subject of proceedings or a prohibition notice under section 18B of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. Where a prohibition notice has come into effect, HAP may continue to be paid for 13 weeks from the date of HAP commencing or the notice coming into force, as appropriate. </p><p>Following the completion of the statutory phased roll-out of the HAP scheme in March 2017, the HAP Shared Services Centre, SSC, which provides a central transactional service for all local authorities and is operated by Limerick City and County Council, updated the ICT system used for HAP supported tenancies in order to assist local authorities in recording their compliance with their legislative obligations in 2017. Local authorities are currently recording inspection activity across a range of data systems, and the SSC is working closely with local authorities to ensure that data in relation to HAP related inspections is recorded on the new HAP module. This involves the migration of some historic data and the refinement of existing data management practices to ensure that overall, the data is being managed efficiently. I have asked local authorities and the SSC to prioritise this piece of work, and I expect the use of the HAP specific reporting module, and the work to align it with the other reporting systems, will be completed speedily.</p><p>Data in relation to all private rental inspections carried out by local authorities is available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p>.</p></reply>

These actions are focused on encouraging those in mortgage distress who have not been able to engage, to reach a long term debt resolution and avoid repossession if possible.</p><p>One of the measures that has been introduced is a national mortgage arrears resolution service, known as Abhaile, which is provided free of charge to the borrower and its aim is to help mortgage holders in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, wherever possible, in their own homes.  The unique element of Abhaile is that it brings together, for the first time, the full range of supports and services required by borrowers in home mortgage arrears.  The Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgetary Service, MABS, acts as the gateway for the service and can be contacted by telephoning 0761072000 or by accessing their website at the following link  </p><p>The mortgage to rent, MTR, scheme introduced in 2012 and administered by the Housing Agency on behalf of my Department is targeted at those households in arrears who are eligible for social housing support, whose mortgage is unsustainable.  Under the scheme an eligible household with an unsustainable mortgage goes from being a homeowner to becoming a social housing tenant of an approved housing body, AHB.  The borrower voluntarily surrenders their property to their lender who in turn sells the property to an AHB.  The AHB becomes the landlord and the household gets to remain in the family home as social housing tenants.  The tenants pay a differential rent to the AHB, based on their income, which is designed to be affordable.  The MTR scheme is an established part of the overall suite of social housing options and an important part of the mortgage arrears resolution process.  </p><p>A review of the mortgage to rent, MTR, scheme, published on 8 February 2017, introduced a range of amendments to the eligibility criteria and administration of the MTR scheme in order for it to work better for borrowers.  The review, available at the following link: , explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme and recommended a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.  My Department and the Housing Agency are working with all stakeholders to ensure that the actions set out in the review are being effectively implemented to benefit a greater number of households.  I am providing an additional &euro;5 million for the MTR scheme in 2018, which will support at least 250 additional MTR cases to be completed by AHBs working together with lenders using the MTR scheme.</p><p>The MTR Review also concluded that the current financial model of the scheme may not, in its current configuration, be capable of delivering the scale of successful cases that could benefit from the scheme over time.  In order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency has been working with a number of financial entities who have expressed an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a number of alternative long-term lease arrangements.  A call for expressions of interest from bodies interested in pursuing pilot operating models was initiated by the Housing Agency on 26 October 2017.  The Housing Agency is currently reviewing the submissions received and will make recommendations to my Department as to the make-up of the pilots, which can then be initiated.</p><p>For those borrowers in danger of losing their home who are ineligible for the MTR scheme but qualify for social housing support, it is recommended that they engage as early as possible with their local authority regarding their housing needs. A household may be determined by their housing authority to be in need of housing if it has a mortgage that is deemed to be unsustainable under the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, even though the household may, at that time, remain the legal owners of the dwelling concerned.  Any household assessed as eligible for social housing support is immediately eligible for support through the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme. Once a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household in the administrative area of that local authority. </p></reply>

In addition, my Department takes on approximately 70 seasonal staff at the National Parks during the busy tourist season. </p>  <p>  Officials of my Department monitor compliance with the Wildlife Acts across the country on an ongoing basis and carry out patrols and site visits to enforce the various provisions of the Acts, as required. As well as more senior regionally based officers, there are 72 conservation rangers stationed around the country who deal with enforcement matters under the Wildlife Acts. Where resources allow, local NPWS conservation rangers attend coursing meetings on a spot check basis, to monitor compliance with licences issued to the Irish Coursing Club and its affiliated clubs. It is my understanding that some twenty six coursing events have been monitored by officials of my Department to date during the current 2017/18 season. In the 2016/2017 season there were a total of 17 coursing events monitored by my Department.</p></reply>

It was the easternmost point of the Transatlantic Cable that provided a permanent connection between Europe and North America through its counterpart in Heart's Content, Canada, for one hundred years between 1866 and 1966.  The Cable Station is also an important architectural feature in its own right, having been designed by leading architects of the nineteenth century.</p><p>Late in 2017, the Canadian authorities announced that the Heart's Content Cable Station had been placed on its Tentative List of World Heritage Sites.  This is a significant development in the creation of a potential transboundary bid for UNESCO World Heritage status involving both Cable Stations.</p><p>As a precursor to being nominated to UNESCO, a site must first go through a comprehensive assessment process at national level that would lead, with UNESCO's agreement, to its placement on Ireland&rsquo;s World Heritage Tentative List.  Later this year, my Department will be inviting applications from candidate sites for inclusion on the upcoming 2020 Tentative List.  Inclusion on the list will ultimately be determined by whether a site meets relevant criteria relating, <i>inter alia</i>, to outstanding universal value, availability of adequate site management and protection resources, and the extent of stakeholder engagement and support for the bid.</p><p>My Department is in ongoing contact with Kerry County Council and its Canadian counterpart in relation to the potential World Heritage application and has informed both parties that Ireland will support the Valentia bid once it meets the qualifying criteria. There is specific reference too to the Cable Station in the National Development Plan and my Department will engage with all the key stakeholders with a view to agreeing an appropriate investment programme for its refurbishment.</p><p>I understand that a considerable amount of preparatory work has already been done locally on the Valentia proposal, including essential repairs to the buildings which were grant aided by my Department. The Department will continue to assist with the preparation of the Tentative List bid, including providing as much advice, guidance and support as possible to Kerry County Council as the lead organisation at local level.</p></reply>
