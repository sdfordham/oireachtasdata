The document itself has been subject to a public consultation process, the deadline for submissions was the 30<sup>th</sup>   April 2013. Submissions received are now being studied by my Department and DARD and therefore it is somewhat premature to make a statement on what new measures might arise from this process. </p><p>  After comprehensive discussions and a number of meetings, the All-Ireland Chalara Control Strategy was drafted by officials in both Department of Rural Development Northern Ireland and my Department.  The document deals with many areas and outlines strategies on four key objectives.</p><p>  Objective 1 is in relation to reducing the risk of the disease becoming established in the wider environment.  This is obviously the key objective and centres around the maintenance of legal measures to restrict the entry of ash plants and wood, surveillance for the disease, destruction of the disease where it occurs and destruction of the associated batches.</p><p>  Objective 2 is to support research efforts.  The strategy document outlines the concrete steps Ireland has already taken in relation to collaborating with our partners in the UK in relation to breeding ash trees for resistance to the disease.  </p><p>  Objective 3 outlines the benefits that can be drawn by involving industry, landowners, voluntary organisations and the general public as partners in the strategy to assist the surveillance and destruction effort.</p><p>  Objective 4 aims to build resilience in woodland and to support industries associated with ash.  Within this objective it is recognised that there is a risk that ash dieback will become established here in the long term.  In response to this risk and the long timeframe associated with managing woodland, action to consider how to adapt to the disease's possible impact and minimise its effect on our trees and woodlands, whether for timber production, for their biodiversity benefits, or for access and recreation, needs to be taken now.</p><p>  My Department's officials continue to meet representative groups and individuals in relation to the disease on a regular basis.  Both my Department and DARD have each received many submissions on the draft All Ireland Chalara Control Strategy document.  The Pest Risk Analysis for <i>Chalara fraxinea</i>   is also being completed in the coming weeks and it is important that this document will also feed into the Strategy document. My Department expects further dialogue with our counterparts in Northern Ireland within the coming weeks after which the finalised Strategy will be published in a month's time.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-08a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013050800044#WRA00900"><p>As I have previously advised, the financial and other implications of a potential sale of the harvesting rights to Coillte's forests have been examined by NewERA, Coillte, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department.  As part of the process, a number of detailed financial, technical and other specialist reports were prepared for Coillte, by external specialist consultancy bodies, in full consultation with the Board of Coillte and its executive management.</p><p>  This work encompassed the identification of forests for inclusion in a possible sale.  I understand this identification process was based on a number of criteria including usage, ownership status, yield class and accessibility.  An estimate was then made of the possible returns from the sale of the forests so identified.  The calculation of an estimate is complex given the potential length of time of any contract and the associated forecasting involved.  As Coillte is a commercial company trading in a competitive environment, such forecasting of yields, timber prices and future revenue is commercially sensitive, and it is therefore not appropriate, to make public the analysis conducted to date.</p><p>  Aside from the valuation of the forestry assets, a number of issues are being considered in relation to the possible harvesting rights concession. These include, <i>inter alia</i>, the consequential implications for the company, its existing liabilities and its human resources.  These issues each require detailed consideration.  As I previously advised, as some of the issues identified and the possible ways in which they may be addressed, have the potential of impacting on investor interest, my preference is to await the outcome of that analysis.</p><p>  In their meeting with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture last October, the then CEO of Coillte outlined the company's involvement in the valuation process and informed the Committee that employee issues including the pension fund liabilities were being discussed as part of the consideration process.  At that meeting, he added that the Coillte pension fund deficit is detailed in the company's Annual Report and that this was one of the work streams the company was looking at in partnership with NewERA. Therefore, I want to reassure the Deputy, that all concerned are aware of the pension fund deficit and that it does form part of the overall analysis.</p><p>  I want to reiterate that substantial work has been undertaken on the identification of the forestry assets involved, the determination of their value and the consideration of a number of issues associated with the proposed sale of the harvesting rights. This process is a very complex one and it is not possible at this stage to pre-empt the outcome of the analysis or to give an estimate of the possible net proceeds.  As I have said previously, the Government will proceed with caution in relation to this matter and no final decision has been taken, as yet.</p></reply>

As such it forms part of the General Approach of the Council agreed at that meeting.  </p><p>  This issue is now the subject of further negotiations between the three EU institutions in the trilogues process.  In this regard both the EU Commission and the European Parliament have their own views and the reality is that the final outcome will be somewhere between the original Commission proposal and the Irish proposal. However, the important point is that the Irish model is at the centre of the negotiations, and I will be working to ensure that the final outcome is as close as possible to this model.</p></reply>

I recently announced that the transport fodder scheme will now run until Friday 10th May and clarified that maize silage is eligible under this scheme.  The weather has improved which in turn has led to improved grass growing conditions.  However, there are farmers in parts of the country who are still finding it difficult to locate enough forage for their animals. </p><p>  This will ensure farmers have access to fodder for the foreseeable future and will reassure farmers that fodder supply will not be an issue until grass growth improves.  While access to fodder is a priority, grass growth in the months ahead will be the key to ensuring that this problem is overcome.  The latest initiatives agreed by the dairy co-ops build on the measures I have already introduced which were designed to deal with immediate challenges.</p><p>  Since the scheme was announced over 900 loads of fodder have been received or ordered.  I am satisfied that this volume of imports is making a real difference on farms and assisting farmers through the shortage.  The extension of the scheme of a further week will build on this and ensure that further supplies are imported with the benefit of the transport subsidy. The amounts of such supplies will require notification to my Department prior to 10<sup>th</sup>   May and approval for coverage under the scheme.</p><p>  My Department has been working with the industry on this.  I want to commend the Dairy co-ops and farm organisations for their work over the past two weeks.  I am delighted that the co-ops have introduced a number of extremely helpful initiatives such as interest free credit for fertiliser purchased during the month of May and reduced prices in respect of feed supplies of meal.  The Irish Dairy Board, IFA and Agri - business launched more than &euro;3 million of extra fodder aid for farmers last week.</p><p>  In parallel with the introduction of the scheme the other issues taken include requesting the banks to take a flexible approach towards extending credit to farmer customers at this difficult time.  The co-ops responded already with the introduction of interest free credit to farmers for the purchase of fertiliser in the month of May, which will be a key component in addressing this year's fodder problem.</p><p>  I have asked the advisory service to prioritise advice to farmers in the period ahead and to focus on the optimum use of fertiliser in generating feed for the national herd.   To assist cash flow issues, outstanding farm scheme payments are being processed with urgency.  <font color="#FF0000"> </font>  Approximately 1,500 payments under the Agriculture Environmental Options Scheme issued during the last 10 days and close to a further 600 AEOS payments will issue within the next week. Together these payments are valued at approximately &euro;3m. </p><p>  My Department's emergency animal welfare helpline is still receiving calls from herdowners.  Over 550 calls have been received to date through the system.  The vast majority of calls are being adequately supported through fodder being made available under the transport subsidy scheme but a small portion of farmers, in need of more substantial support have been assisted directly by the Department.  The Department's Veterinary Inspectors continue to be actively engaged in providing emergency assistance under the Department's early warning system to farmers whose animals are currently experiencing serious welfare issues and where the farmer him/herself is unable to cope with the situation.</p><p>  I want to remind farmers that the animal welfare emergency assistance continues to operate where animal welfare is seriously at risk at the emergency helpline number - 1850 21 19 90 (Low-call).  I want to reiterate that no animal should die of starvation in this country and help is available to those farmers who cannot cope.  I believe this comprehensive set of measures outlined here will assist farmers.  I will continue to work with all stakeholders in the sector to get through this difficult period caused by very unusual weather patterns.</p></reply>

The plants in question were B&amp;F Meats in Carrick-on-Suir, Co.Tipperary, and Ossory Meats, Banagher, Co Offaly. Both plants have since been allowed to resume activities, subject to an increased level of official controls.  B&amp;F Meats, a small scale plant approved to debone beef and horsemeat, was found to be involved in mislabelling of a limited quantity of horsemeat for export to the Czech Republic. The Department suspended all operations at the plant on 22nd February, served a Legal Notice on the company and the plant was included in the wider Department and Garda investigation. While fraudulent intent was denied by the company the use of what was known to be a wrong label designation is not acceptable practice and the question of instituting legal proceedings in this respect remains under consideration. Details of the findings were provided to the UK and Czech authorities. Following the plant&rsquo;s compliance with the Legal Notice, it was in a position to resume deboning on 28th February.</p><p>  As the equine mislabelling investigation progressed a separate but parallel investigation was conducted on horse slaughter plants and associated horse traceability. It was decided in that context to introduce more robust controls and it was agreed with the County Managers concerned that my Department would take direct control over the two local authority equine slaughter plants, including Ossory Meats. On Friday 8th March, the Department carried out identification checks on horses presented for slaughter at Ossory Meats. 25 of the horses presented had irregularities, related to passport and microchip identifiers. These animals were humanely slaughtered and destroyed. The company was suspended from operations on 13th March and allowed resume on 8th   April following compliance with the terms of the Legal Notice which had been served. The ongoing investigation of this matter involves an examination to determine how and where the irregularities occurred and a focus on the respective roles played by the implicated Passport Issuing Agencies, the veterinarian(s) whose signatures appear on the irregular passports, the persons who registered the horses and to whom the passports were issued, the traders who supplied the horses for slaughter and of course the conduct and management oversight at Ossory Meats.  Operations in two other plants were suspended on a voluntary basis during the course of the investigation and one of these plants remains closed.</p></reply>

The FSAI is an independent body under the aegis of the Minister for Health. </p><p>   The FSAI carries out its enforcement function through &#8220;service contracts&#8221; with official agencies. These official agencies include the Sea Fishery Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p><p>   The SFPA is an independent body under the aegis of my Department. It carries out, on an ongoing basis, a range of official controls on seafood in accordance with its contract with the FSAI and the relevant EU and national legislation, from harvesting stage up to, but excluding, retail level.  Comprehensive labelling and traceability checks are carried out as part of routine inspections by authorised SFPA officers. </p><p>   The HSE has responsibility for official controls, including labelling, at the retail stage, including catering.  </p><p>   In Ireland, genetic analysis of fishery products is not done as part of routine official controls but it is available as a tool if necessary to detect mislabelling of food products.  Currently under the EU Food Hygiene Regulations there is not a requirement to carry out genetic testing of fishery products as part of official controls. </p><p>   However, the Irish seafood industry comes under a range of food labelling and traceability legislation. A key principle in labelling is that consumers should not be misled.</p><p>   Seafood is covered by general food labelling legislation, including Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 (General Food Law) and Directive 2000/13/EC (labelling requirements for pre-packaged foods), which prohibit the misleading of consumers with food labels.  These rules have been enhanced with the recent adoption of Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers.  The new Regulation extends explicit compulsory origin labelling requirements to meats other than beef and adopts rules on compulsory labelling where the origin or place of provenance of a food is given and where it is not the same as its primary ingredient.  </p><p><font color="#FF0000"> </font>  There are additional labelling requirements for fishery and aquaculture products set down in Council Regulation (EC) No. 104/2000 (on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products) and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2065/2001 (laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No. 104/2000 as regards informing consumers about fishery and aquaculture products). These regulations were transposed by the European Communities (Labelling of Fishery and Aquaculture Products) Regulations, 2003 (S.I. No. 320 of 2003). The Common organisation of the markets is being reviewed in the context of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p><p>   There has been an extensive review of labelling legislation at EU level which has resulted in a number of additional labelling and traceability requirements coming into place during 2012.  These include traceability and labelling requirements under Council Regulation (EC) No. 1224/2009, enhanced traceability record requirements for food business operators in respect of food of animal origin (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 931/2011), and additional labelling and traceability requirements for frozen food of animal origin (Commission Regulation (EU) No 16/2012).</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-08a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013050800044#WRA01900"><p>Commonage lands form an important part of the farming enterprises of many farmers, particularly along the West Coast. They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism. However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. </p><p>  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission. It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC. It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.</p><p>  I readily acknowledge that it will not be an easy task, but it is achievable if all stakeholders work in a co-operative basis. If action is not taken now, the areas will continue to deteriorate and will lead to more land abandonment. If this is allowed to happen, Ireland will lose a valuable resource from the point of view of farming, rural economy, bio-diversity and wildlife. While grazing is the only method of managing these lands, the task facing us is how to ensure that these grazing levels are appropriate to the individual commonages.</p><p>  In order to ensure that the achievement of this objective, as already stated, we need the input of individual shareholders. Grazing plans, at the level of each commonage, will allow for greater flexibility for shareholders and will enable the active farmers to increase their stock to cater for dormant and inactive persons. It will be matter for agreement between the shareholders &ndash; as was always the case &ndash; to decide how best to reach the stocking levels. Professional assistance will be required, in particular where the commonage has been damaged by under-grazing.     </p><p>  The Grazing Plan will have to cater the traditional farming methods for the area, with provision made for sheep and other animals, such as cattle, providing that they are appropriate to the habitat. An appropriate time-scale will have to be put in place but the Plan should include the incremental steps to achieve GAEC. The whole concept will be output driven, in that the assessment of the Plans will be based on whether the commonage is in GAEC or not or whether the appropriate progress has been achieved.  </p><p>  Apart from ensuring that the Grazing Plan is valid, there are a number of other complications, including:</p><p>- Dormant shareholders &ndash; in the majority of cases, these persons are no longer farming;</p><p>- Current claimants on the commonages, who do not farm or manage the lands. The issue of whether the latter claimants will continue to be eligible for payment will have to be examined.   </p><p>  There are other issues that will need to be considered. These include the fact that many commonage habitats have been significantly damaged by under-grazing, with resulting problems that must be addressed including land abandonment, spread of scrub and invasive species.</p><p>  While it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed in the near future.</p></reply>

In any event, as demonstrated below, no undue delay currently exists in processing cases and payments continue to issue twice weekly, as individual cases are confirmed eligible.  </p><p>  A major factor impacting on processing of 2012 Scheme applications arose from the changes made to better focus the Scheme in light of budgetary realities and, in particular, ensuring that affected applicants could have access to robust and fair derogation and appeal processes.  In this context, my Department wrote to in excess of 10,000 beneficiaries under the 2011 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme whose holdings had not achieved the minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare, as required under the Terms and Conditions of the 2012 Scheme. </p><p>  In response, my Department received a total of 9,829 derogation applications of which 7,414 were successful. Those, whose applications were unsuccessful, were informed of their right of appeal to the independently chaired DAS Appeals Committee, on foot of which 1,574 appeals were received. On the basis of additional information which had not previously been submitted, my Department was in a position to overturn the original decision on 614 cases, without the need to refer the cases to the DAS Appeals Committee, </p><p>  Of the appeals submitted to the Committee, decisions have been taken in respect of 960 cases, of which 343 were allowed, 506 disallowed and 111 requested to submit additional information. Processing of the outstanding appeals remains ongoing. </p><p>  On a more general note, the overall position is that those who have not received payment under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme are not yet confirmed eligible for payment. Of the 7,401 cases in question, 3,435 have not, as yet, shown that their holdings satisfied the Scheme minimum stocking density requirements in 2012. The holdings of a further 2,790 did not achieve the minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units in 2011; 444 cases relate to applicants being deceased or change of ownership where my Department must await legal formalities to be completed. A further 47 cases relate to cases where it has not been demonstrated that equines are eligible. The remaining 685 cases in the main relate to outstanding area-related issues.  </p><p>  It will be recalled that, faced with budgetary realities, rather than simply apply an across the board cut to the rates payable or reduce the maximum payable area as a means to achieving these savings, I decided that real efforts should be made to focus the Scheme on those farmers who are most actively contributing to achieving the aims of the Scheme. These are ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of viable rural communities, maintaining the countryside and promoting sustainable farming systems, which take account of environmental enhancement measures.</p><p>  A table outlining the current county breakdown in relation to unsuccessful derogation applications will be provided directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department has been working with the industry on this and in a collaborative effort, a comprehensive range of measures has been put in place to assist the sector during this difficult period. The Deputy will be aware that my Department has put in place a &euro;1m fund to contribute to the transport costs of importing fodder to the country, which has reduced the cost of purchasing fodder for farmers by approximately a third.  More recently I announced an extension in the duration of the Imported Fodder Transport Scheme to Friday 10th May, and a broadening of its scope to include maize silage.  All fodder ordered in advance of that date will be supported by this scheme. The amounts of such supplies will require notification to my Department prior to 10<sup>th</sup>   May and approval for coverage under the scheme.</p><p>  The co-ops have introduced a number of extremely helpful initiatives such as interest free credit for fertiliser purchased during the month of May and reduced prices in respect of feed supplies of meal. In addition, The Irish Dairy Board has announced the establishment of a &euro;2 million emergency fund for its dairy farmers to be operated through the Board's supplier co-op members.  I have also asked the banks to take a flexible approach towards extending credit to farmer customers at this difficult time. </p><p>  For people in particularly acute situations, my Department's animal welfare emergency assistance continues to operate, and where animal welfare is seriously at risk at the emergency helpline number - 1850 21 19 90 (Low-call).</p><p>  I should also pay tribute to farm organisations that have been pro-active in their efforts to provide assistance for the importation and distribution of fodder for hard pressed farmers. </p><p>  These measures will ensure farmers have access to fodder for the foreseeable future and will reassure farmers that fodder supply will not be an issue until grass growth improves.  At this point, over 900 loads of hay, haylage and maize silage has been received or ordered.  I am satisfied that this volume of imports is making a real difference on farms and assisting farmers through the shortage.  The recent extension of the scheme will build on this and ensure that further supplies are imported with the benefit of the transport subsidy.</p><p>  While access to fodder is an immediate priority, grass growth in the months ahead will be the key to ensuring that this problem is overcome.  In this regard I have asked Teagasc's advisory service to prioritise advice to farmers in the period ahead and to focus on the optimum use of fertiliser in generating feed for the national herd.   </p><p>It is of course entirely appropriate that in circumstances such as these, the stakeholders in this critically important sector should pull together to overcome the difficulties being experienced by farmers. For my part, I will continue to work with all stakeholders in the sector to get through this difficult period caused by very unusual weather patterns.  <i></i></p></reply>

As most aquaculture activity takes place in 'Natura 2000' areas it is necessary to undertake an 'Appropriate Assessment' of the effects of aquaculture activity on these areas before any new licences can be issued or any existing licences can be renewed.</p><p>  In the negotiations to address the ECJ judgement a process was agreed with the European Commission.  This process includes the following steps:</p><p>- Data Collection in 91 Bays/Estuaries</p><p>- Detailed analysis of the raw data collected</p><p>- Setting of Conservation Objectives by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in respect of each site</p><p>- Carrying out Appropriate Assessments (AA) - by the Marine Institute -  of aquaculture/fishery activities against the detailed Conservation Objectives set, and</p><p>- Determination of Licences/Fisheries on the basis of the Appropriate Assessment and other relevant factors</p><p>  Conservation Objectives have now been set for a significant number of bays.  The appropriate assessments are being carried out by the Marine Institute on behalf of the Department and to date four bays have been assessed - Castlemaine, Dundalk, Roaringwater and Lough Swilly.  </p><p>  As outlined my Department has been working closely with the Marine Institute, BIM and NPWS to achieve full compliance through a multi-annual work programme.  A key factor of this Work Programme is the identification of prioritised bays, based on the number of aquaculture sites, the ready availability of scientific data and other factors. The prioritised list of bays is kept under continuous review by my Department so as to facilitate the use of scientific and other resources on a flexible basis across the full range of bays, if deemed necessary.  This approach is consistent with the maintenance of a prioritised list which includes Bannow Bay and the Waterford Estuary. </p><p>  It is important for all involved in the aquaculture industry to understand that the sustainable development of the industry and the creation of long term employment from aquaculture into the future can only take place if there is full compliance with all EU and national legislation on environmental protection.  Ireland's reputation as a producer of top quality seafood is predicated on the implementation of a sound regulatory system which has the confidence of the public in general and also the EU Commission<i>.</i></p><p>  My Department continues to make every effort to expedite the determination of aquaculture licence applications including those in Bannow Bay and Waterford Estuary having regard to the need to comply with all relevant national and EU legislation.    </p><p>  The Above information has previously been conveyed to the individual referred to by the Deputy, both directly and indirectly. In addition officials from my Department would be available to meet with the individual in question to discuss the matter if this is considered helpful.</p></reply>

Under comitology procedures, it is now a matter for the European Commission to legislate on the matter. It is likely that a ban on the three substances under consideration will now come into effect later this year. </p><p>  At the Appeals Committee meeting on 29 April, Ireland engaged with the Commission and the Member States in a constructive and helpful way and actively supported efforts to find a workable and meaningful compromise on the proposals to restrict the use of neonicotinoid insecticides. These efforts aimed to find solutions that allowed suitably controlled use of the compounds without presenting unacceptable risks to bee populations. </p><p>  Ireland initially opposed the Commission proposal to allow time for further consideration of the scientific evidence (e.g. UK bee study) and to create the space for consideration of a compromise. Hungary and Germany drafted compromise texts which Ireland could support if they were broadly supported by Member States and by the Commission.  </p><p>  Ireland recognised the importance of the precautionary principle in relation to this matter, and fully bore this in mind in discussions aimed at achieving an approach that would enjoy broad support among EU Member States and be acceptable to the Commission. </p><p>  However, the Hungarian and German proposals were not acceptable to the Commission and efforts to find a compromise failed and Ireland decided not to oppose the Commission proposal.</p></reply>

I must emphasise that at this stage all applicants that were eligible for payment under the 2012 Scheme have received their payment under the Scheme. Therefore, it is clear that no undue delay currently exists in processing cases and payments continue to issue twice weekly, as individual cases are confirmed eligible.</p><p>  Many applicants, who declare land situated in a Disadvantaged Areas are not eligible for payment under the Scheme. Many of these applicants do not maintain any animals and those that do maintain animals do not keep sufficient livestock to meet the minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per hectare. This is a normal feature of the Disadvantaged Area Scheme. For example, in excess of 2,100 applicants under the 2011 DAS Scheme were found to be non-compliant, as they had insufficient stocking density on their holdings. The figure for 2012 is over 5,000, which is accounted for by the more focused requirements for establishing the minimum stocking density introduced under the 2012 Scheme.  In addition, there are in excess of 3,000 applicants who held no stock during 2012.</p><p>  As is illustrated by these figures, the vast majority of applicants, who were eligible for payment under the 2012 DAS Scheme, have been paid. Bearing in mind the new provisions introduced in 2012 and the need to process almost 10,000 cases under the Derogation measure, I am satisfied with the efficiency of the payments. It should be borne in mind that payments commenced on 21 September 2012, which is much earlier that in the vast majority of Member States across the European Union.</p><p>  Turning to the 2013 DAS Scheme, I would like to remind farmers that the deadline for receipt of applications in 15th May 2013. I would urge all farmers to submit their applications as quickly as possible. I would also urge them to use the on-line filing facility. This reduces the number of errors that an applicant can make and, therefore, reduces the risk of payments being delayed in what has been a very difficult year to date for farmers in view of the weather conditions.</p><p>  A Table outlining the county breakdown in relation to payments will be provided directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Irish Presidency therefore proposed amendments to the Commission text which reflected the balance of opinion among Member States that they should be allowed to decide whether to apply reductions to payments exceeding &euro;150,000. In addition, the scale of any reductions, together with the tranches of payments to which reductions might apply, would be a matter for Member States to decide. These provisions were included in the Council General Approach agreed on 19 March.</p><p>  The European Parliament position is close to that of the EU Commission and this issue will now be the subject of further negotiations between the three EU institutions in the trilogues process.</p></reply>

Funding for operating, management and development costs in the fishery harbours is ringfenced in the Fishery Harbour Centres Fund, which is the only source of revenue available for that purpose.  Capital investment in the Fishery Harbour Centres in recent years has underpinned both fisheries activities and their expanding use for leisure and marine tourism and other maritime enterprises.  The House will appreciate that, in the current economic climate, the State must be fully committed to maximising the return on that investment.  Moreover, my Department is required to ensure that the Fishery Harbour Centres are run on a financially-sound basis.  The 500+ parking spaces within the boundaries of the Harbour would assist in balancing the books, and in providing funding for re-investment that would not otherwise be available.</p><p>  A wide range of groups use the parking facilities of Howth Fishery Harbour &ndash; harbour business customers, yacht club members, sport fishermen, Dart users, tourists, walkers and many others.  This combination of uses and the range of users of the Harbour brings its own inherent dangers and safety must be a paramount consideration.  There have been a number of occasions - indeed as recently as last Saturday week when the Dublin Bay Prawn Festival coincided with the seasonal re-launch of leisure craft - where the volume of cars in the Harbour and the resultant pressure on parking has led to a situation where emergency access has been seriously compromised.  The Harbour authorities have in the past received specific complaints from elements of the emergency services in that regard - fortunately no serious incident has arisen yet.</p><p>   There was widespread public consultation when pay parking at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre was originally examined in detail in 2007 in conjunction with Fingal County Council.  All of the various views that were expressed and submissions that were made then are still available and I am well aware of and acknowledge their concerns.  I have been getting new correspondence on this matter from a wide range of harbour users.  More recently, my officials have consulted with officials of Fingal Council, and with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about this and other related matters, and my Department&rsquo;s engineers have met some of the Harbour&rsquo;s business tenants individually about new traffic management and road markings etc.  My officials also attended the Harbour Users Forum in February where pay parking was on the agenda and heard the views of the harbour users at first hand.</p><p>  I am reviewing all aspects of the matter at present.  I can assure the House that the views of the various harbour users, the potential earnings, the possible impact on the harbour businesses and recreational users, the impact on the local economy and local jobs, and the impact on overall traffic management within the Fishery Harbour, are all matters that I will take into account in coming to a decision.  I can also assure the House and all of the Harbour users in Howth that I am committed to continuing investment in and development of Howth for the future.</p></reply>

I decided on a maximum payment of &euro;4,000 per annum for individual applicants which, on the basis of previous experience in implementing the scheme, indicated that approximately 6,000 new participants could be accepted into the scheme.</p><p>  The Agri-environment Options Scheme (AEOS III) will build on the success of the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and both AEOS 1 and 2 in delivering an annual payment to farmers in return for farming to high environmental standards.  The closing date for receipt of AEOS III applications was Friday December 7 and 9,689 applications have been received by my Department. The initial processing of the applications has been completed and acknowledgement letters have issued to all applicants.  The detailed actions listed in each application are currently being recorded and the approval of applicants will be determined by the following priority selection criteria:</p><p> - applicants within a targeted area of the Boora region of Co. Offaly who select Wild Bird Cover Option B (Grey Partridge) will get first access,</p><p> - Applicants with eligible Natura land will get access next,</p><p> - Applicants with at least 0.5 hectares of Utilisable Agricultural Non-Natura Commonage land rank next,</p><p> - Farm Partnerships,</p><p> - Previous Participation in REPS,</p><p> - Farm Size (Favouring smaller holding) based on the utilisable agricultural area,</p><p> - Location of farms in Less Favoured Areas.</p><p>  This process is well advanced and will be completed shortly. During this data entry process it has been noted that a number of applications either do not contain all the necessary information or the information submitted contains errors. Because the number of applications exceed the number that can be accepted into the scheme, it is absolutely essential that decisions are made on accurate data. For that reason, my Department has taken time to contact the applicants where queries arise to obtain the required information in order for the application to be appropriately assessed. My intention is to complete the selection process shortly and to notify all applicants of the outcome and of the commencement dates under the scheme in the case of successful applicants.</p><p>  Based on the initial processing of applications approximately 4,500 applications have been submitted under the Commonage/Natura option. In the event that these applications fulfil all eligibility requirements of the scheme, these applicants will gain priority access to the scheme. I also now expect that a further 1,500 farmers without designated land will be admitted to the scheme.  Applicants should note that they should not undertake any actions listed in their application until approved for participation in the scheme as actions undertaken or expense incurred prior to formal approval will not be eligible for reimbursement.</p></reply>

The proposal of the EU Commission is that these quotas should be abolished with effect from 30 September 2015.  In discussions at the EU Council of Ministers, differing views emerged on the Commission proposal with some Member States in favour of retention of quotas until 2020 and beyond and others supporting abolition.  As President of the Council, I proposed a compromise at the March meeting of Agriculture Ministers for abolition of sugar quotas from 30 September 2017.  This compromise was accepted as part of the General Approach of the Council on CAP reform.  The position taken by the European Parliament is that the quota system should be extended to 30 September 2020, with provision made for reallocation of quota to those Member States who had relinquished their entire quotas in 2006.  This issue will now be the subject of further negotiations between the three EU institutions in the trilogues process.  </p></reply>

Substantial work has been undertaken on the identification of the forestry assets involved, the determination of their value and the consideration of a number of issues associated with the proposed sale of the harvesting rights. These include, <i>inter alia</i>  , the possible impact on the timber industry, public access to recreational land, environmental and social impacts and consequential implications for the company.</p><p>  As part of the process, a number of detailed financial, technical and other specialist reports were prepared for Coillte, by external specialist consultancy bodies, in full consultation with the Board of Coillte and its executive management. Drafts of the reports from all of the bodies were received at the end of November 2012. The consideration of those reports is ongoing.  </p><p>I am aware that studies have also been undertaken on behalf of other interested parties groups namely, one by Peter Bacon and Associates, for IMPACT, the outcome of which was the report &#8220;<i>Assessment of the Consequences of the proposed Sale of Coillte's Timber Harvesting Rights - 10 January 2013</i>&#8221; and another by EPS Consulting, for the Irish Timber Council, on &#8220;<i>The impacts on the sawmill sector arising from the proposed sale of Coillte's harvesting rights</i>  &#8221;.

First put in place in 1983, it has been subject to reviews every 10 years, and is currently undergoing a reform process the important elements of which are expected to be concluded during the Irish Presidency.</p><p>  The CFP reform proposal essentially involves three separate pieces of legislation, a basic policy regulation, a regulation on the Common Organisation of the Market (CMO) both of which are supported and underpinned by a separate financial instrument, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF).  Achieving agreement on a reformed CFP is a priority for the Irish Presidency and currently Council have a General Approach on the Basic Regulation &amp;amp; the CMO and a partial general approach on the EMFF.  The European Parliament has a 1st   reading position on the Basic Regulation and the CMO.  At February&rsquo;s EU Fisheries Council, I was successful in brokering a political agreement on the outstanding issues from June 2012 including for the introduction of an EU wide discards ban.</p><p>  February&rsquo;s decision in reaching a common Council approach on all aspects of a reformed basic policy regulation is important in that it allowed the Irish Presidency, on behalf of the Council, to engage directly with the European Parliament and Commission with a view to reaching overall political agreement on the reformed Common Fisheries Policy during the Irish Presidency.   However, it is worth noting that what was agreed in February is the Councils approach, the European Parliament has also published its&rsquo; position which differs in many respects. Some of the differences are minor and progress has been made on the non-contentious aspects. However there are significant differences of emphasis and a more demanding approach expressed by the Parliament on some key issues such as the discards ban and achieving Maximum Sustainable Yield. Achieving a political agreement between the Council and Parliament on these issues is proving to be a major challenge.</p><p>  Turning to the process from here, Ireland in its role of Presidency of the Council was given a clear negotiating mandate by Council for discussions with the European Parliament. A first round of informal trilogues with Parliament (and European Commission) has taken place on the Common organisation of the market and a draft negotiation mandate has been prepared for a second round. The Permanent Representative Committee (COREPER) adopted a mandate to open negotiations on 13 March 2013. Since then the three institutions have had 5 informal trilogue meetings and further meetings are planned as necessary.</p><p>  The &quot;Agriculture and Fisheries&quot; Council of 22 April 2013 held an orientation debate on the four key political areas of divergence, namely Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), landing obligation, regionalisation and capacity management.  This debate had been preceded by an informal meeting of the Directors-General for fisheries in Cork on 15 to 17 April, dedicated to the same topics where EU Member States committed themselves to working towards an agreement by end June.  The Presidency has now prepared a revised version of the initial mandate, based on the emerging positions resulting from the complex trilogue process. This will now form the basis for further discussion within Council, with a view to obtaining a mandate to conclude the negotiations in the coming weeks and achieving an agreed reform package under the Irish Presidency.</p><p>  COREPER met on the 2 May to discuss the current text and are due to meet again this week to consider a further revised text. It is then hoped to put the revised text to the Council of Fisheries Ministers on 13-14 May to seek political support and a new mandate for further discussions with the Parliament.  We are now in a very sensitive stage of this reform process. The Presidency and Ministers have made it clear that they want an agreement to be concluded by the end of May. Assuming that the revised text receives their support, only weeks remain for a final agreement to be concluded with the European Parliament.  I believe that the text for the reform which we are now proposing provides the basis to broker that final agreement with Parliament.</p></reply>

To date, payments worth in excess of &euro;207 million have issued to 94,671 of the total of 102,072 who applied. </p><p>  Many applicants, who declare land situated in a Disadvantaged Areas, are found not to be eligible for payment under the Scheme. Many of these applicants do not maintain any animals and those that do maintain animals do not keep sufficient livestock to meet the minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per hectare. This is a normal feature of the Disadvantaged Area Scheme. For example, in excess of 2,100 applicants under the 2011 DAS Scheme were found to be non-compliant, as they had insufficient stocking density on their holdings. The figure for 2012 is over 5,000, which is accounted for by the more focused requirements for establishing the minimum stocking density introduced under the 2012 Scheme.  In addition, there are in excess of 3,000 applicants who held no stock during 2012.   </p><p>  The revised stocking-density provisions introduced in 2012 necessitated processing almost 10,000 cases under the derogation measure in order to give applicants access to a robust and fair appeal process.  The small number of outstanding cases relate in the main to those for which additional substantiating material is awaited. </p><p>  It will be seen, therefore, that all applicants, whose eligibility for payment under the 2012 DAS Scheme has been established, have been paid and payments continue to be made twice weekly as individual cases are confirmed eligible. </p><p>  A tabular breakdown of the position by county will be provided directly to the Deputy.</p><p>Turning to the 2013 DAS Scheme, which, as already announced, is focussed on the protection of the smaller and most disadvantaged, I would like to remind farmers that the deadline for receipt of applications in 15th   May 2013. I would urge all farmers to submit their applications as quickly as possible. I would also urge them to use the on-line filing facility. This reduces the number of errors that an applicant can make and, therefore, reduces the risk of payments being delayed in what has been, despite the mitigating measures taken, a very difficult year to date for farmers in view particularly of the weather conditions.   The terms and conditions of the 2013 DAS Scheme remain as previously announced. Farmers with fodder related stocking difficulties may avail of the force majeure provisions in the Scheme. </p></reply>

Thus, it does not capture the effects of reductions proposed to payments arising from reductions in the overall CAP budget or the cessation of modulation. Neither does it capture the effects of other changes proposed to the Direct Payments Scheme e.g. to fund the national reserve, the payment to young farmers, the crisis fund and coupled payments.  These proposed reductions are still the subject of negotiations and there is no certainty as to the final outcome.  </p><p>  While the European Council reached agreement on the new Multiannual Financial Framework for the EU budget in February last, this agreement has yet to be endorsed by the European Parliament.  The agreement envisages a reduction in the Direct Payments budget of just over 3% together with a redistribution of payments between Member States or external convergence as it is known. Ireland is largely protected from the latter with an overall cut in direct payments of some 3.3%. </p><p>  The Commission proposals envisage a number of other changes to the basic payment scheme that need to be taken into account to conduct meaningful modelling. These include proposed reductions to all payments to fund the national reserve and to provide top-up payments for young farmers. The percentages currently proposed are for maximum deductions of 3% and 2% respectively.  However, the final deductions may be less &ndash; depending on the funding needs for these schemes.</p><p>  There is also provision for a crisis fund &ndash; to be financed from cuts to direct payments &ndash; and refunded to farmers if not used to address a crisis in the market.  There is an additional complication in regard to this fund in that there is a disagreement between the Commission, Council and European Parliament as to whether annual payments below &euro;5,000 should be exempt from deductions to finance this.  The Commission has proposed a franchise of &euro;5,000.  The European Parliament has proposed no franchise and the Council has suggested a limit of &euro;2,000.  This will have to be resolved before any meaningful modelling can be carried out on the impact.</p><p>  Equally, there is disagreement between the three institutions on the level of coupling that should be allowed with the Commission arguing for a 5% limit in the case of Member States such as Ireland who have fully decoupled payments, the Council advocating a maximum level of 7% for these Member States and the European Parliament seeking a maximum of 15%.  And of course, coupled payments are proposed as an option for Member States.  I do not intend to take a decision whether to proceed with a deduction for coupled payments until the deal is finalised and the full outcome known.</p><p>  Given the extent of variables, it would be premature, in my view, to attempt an exercise that would superimpose the impact of internal convergence and variable greening on the other factors playing out in these negotiations.</p></reply>

I have had innumerable discussions with the EU Commission on the content and impact of the proposals, both before they were formally adopted by the Commission and presented to Member States in October 2011 and since. </p><p>  The Commission proposals envisage a strong future CAP based on two complementary pillars with three strategic aims of preserving food production potential in the EU, sustainable management of natural resources and maintaining viable rural areas.  Ensuring price stability and a fair return to primary producers are central tenets of the reform in that the Commission proposals envisage maintaining direct payments to farmers and market support tools at safety-net level.  </p><p>  Since the beginning of the year, negotiations have made considerable progress across a number of fronts. Following the agreement by the European Council on the Multiannual Financial Framework in early February, the European Parliament agreed its position on the CAP reform package in March. This was followed, also in March, by the successful adoption by the Council of Agriculture Ministers - by a strong qualified majority - of its General Approach on CAP Reform. The latter, in particular, marked a considerable achievement, taking place as it did against a background of lengthy, intensive negotiations with my Member State colleagues across a range of complex and sensitive issues. </p><p>  The negotiations have now moved to discussions between the EU institutions and an intensive schedule of trilogue discussions with the European Parliament and EU Commission commenced on 11th   April 2013.  The first trilogues have taken place in a very constructive and positive atmosphere, with working methods agreed, technical issues identified for further examination and initial discussions taking place on more difficult political points.

The CSO figures categorise cows according to whether they are kept for beef or dairy production. The results of the December 2012 Livestock Survey show that beef cow numbers stood at 1,127,900 head, which was an increase of 4.1% relative to 2011 as high cattle prices in recent years have encouraged producers to restock and expand their herds.</p><p>  My Department does not keep records of the annual cost of keeping a suckler cow. Teagasc data, however shows there is a considerable variation in this figure depending on the level of efficiency of production on individual farms. Teagasc has indicated that the variable cost of maintaining a suckler cow and calf to weanling stage is between &euro;400 on the more efficient farms to &euro;550 on the less efficient ones. A further &euro;350 to &euro;450 per cow need to be added for fixed costs.</p><p>  Under the National Farm Survey series Teagasc gave, in 2011, the average direct cost of production per hectare for Single Suckling enterprises ranged from &euro;350 per hectare on those farms with the lowest average gross margin to &euro;463 per hectare on the most profitable farms. The most profitable third of Single Suckling farms earned an average gross output of &euro;1,013 per hectare compared with an average gross output of &euro;451 per hectare on the least profitable one third of Single Suckling enterprises. This variability in average gross output is in large part due to the higher average stocking on the more profitable farms. These farms had an average stocking rate of 1.57 livestock units (LU) per hectare compared with only 1.03 LU per hectare for those farms with the lowest profitability.</p><p>  In this context the primary focus of measures introduced by my Department is on improving the efficiency on farms through direct support and with the assistance of other agencies. These include initiatives such as the Beef Technology Adoption Programme (BTAP), which is designed to equip beef farmers with the knowledge to improve efficiency at farm level. Some &euro;4.5 million was paid in 2012 to 4,800 farmers under the programme. </p><p>  Also this year my Department recently launched the Beef Data Programme for which &euro;10 million has been allocated in 2013. This new programme will assist farmers in improving the genetic quality of Irish cattle and will maintain the data flow into ICBF in order to build further knowledge and more rapid progress in breeding and ultimately in profitability for farmers. In addition my Department continues to support the work of ICBF in improving genetic quality in the beef herd. On the advisory side Teagasc provides a best practice model for suckler farmers with the expanded BETTER Beef Farm Programme and Bord Bia assists with the marketing of quality beef through their Beef Quality Assurance Scheme.</p><p>  My Department and its agencies will continue to make every effort to assist the development of the beef sector in line with the Food Harvest 2020 Strategy.</p></reply>

They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism.  However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. </p><p>  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission.  It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC.  It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.</p><p>  I readily acknowledge that it will not be an easy task, but it is achievable if all stakeholders work in a co-operative basis.  If action is not taken now, the areas will continue to deteriorate and will lead to more land abandonment.  If this is allowed to happen, Ireland will lose a valuable resource from the point of view of farming, rural economy, bio-diversity and wildlife. While grazing is the only method of managing these lands, the task facing us is how to ensure that these grazing levels are appropriate to the individual commonages.</p><p>  In order to ensure that the achievement of this objective, as already stated, we need the input of individual shareholders.  Grazing plans, at the level of each commonage, will allow for greater flexibility for shareholders and will enable the active farmers to increase their stock to cater for dormant and inactive persons. It will be matter for agreement between the shareholders &ndash; as was always the case &ndash; to decide how best to reach the stocking levels.  Professional assistance will be required, in particular where the commonage has been damaged by under-grazing.</p><p>  The Grazing Plan will have to cater the traditional farming methods for the area, with provision made for sheep and other animals, such as cattle, providing that they are appropriate to the habitat.  An appropriate time-scale will have to be put in place but the Plan should include the incremental steps to achieve GAEC.  The whole concept will be output driven, in that the assessment of the Plans will be based on whether the commonage is in GAEC or not or whether the appropriate progress has been achieved.</p><p>  Apart from ensuring that the Grazing Plan is valid, there are a number of other complications, including:</p><p>Dormant shareholders &ndash; in the majority of cases, these persons are no longer farming;</p><p>Current claimants on the commonages, who do not farm or manage the lands.  The issue of whether the latter claimants will continue to be eligible for payment will have to be examined.</p><p>  There are other issues that will need to be considered.  These include the fact that many commonage habitats have been significantly damaged by under-grazing, with resulting problems that must be addressed including land abandonment, spread of scrub and invasive species.</p><p>  While it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed in the near future.</p></reply>

Because the number of applications exceed the number that can be accepted into the scheme, it is absolutely essential that decisions are made on accurate data.  For that reason, my Department has taken time to contact the applicants where queries arise to obtain the required information in order for the application to be appropriately assessed.</p><p>  Unfortunately, given budgetary constraints, it will not be possible to allocate additional funding to AEOS III in order to extend the number of available places in the Scheme.</p></reply>

We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for both elections and constitutional referendums. Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  However, they have also been involved in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre.   When a request for electoral observation is received, the Department seeks expressions of interest from all observers on the election roster.  A list of suitably qualified observers is drawn up, taking into account the specific criteria for the mission, including language proficiency.  Gender balance and length of time since serving on a mission are also key factors in the selection process.  Following completion of the internal selection process, a draft list of nominees is submitted for Ministerial approval.  </p><p>  In the case of European Union election observation missions, the final selection of observers from the list of approved nominees submitted by the Department rests with the European Commission.  In the case of OSCE election observation missions, all the observers nominated by the Department are usually selected.</p><p>  Last year, I asked that the Department carry out a review of the election observation roster.  Following a call for applications and a subsequent appraisal process against published criteria, 200 individuals with a strong mix of skills and experience have now been selected to serve on a new roster, which will come into effect on 15 May 2013.  I am satisfied that the recruitment and selection process has been carried out in a fair and transparent manner. </p><p>  I am confident that the establishment of this new roster will ensure that Ireland can consistently nominate the best qualified people for election monitoring missions.  At this point, I do not envisage changes to the procedure by which members of the new roster will be nominated for missions.</p><p>  The costs to the Department of Foreign Affairs of each observation mission relate exclusively to the costs of sending the individuals selected for the mission.  In the case of EU missions, all costs are covered by the European Commission with the exception of a pre-departure grant of &euro;600, which observers who participate in missions are entitled to in every twelve month period.  For OSCE missions, the costs of Irish observers, over and above the pre-departure grant are fully met by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  </p><p>  A list in tabular form of persons sent on election observation missions between 2007 and to date in 2013 is set out as follows.  In the time available, it is not possible to provide a detailed breakdown of costs per mission for the years 2007, 2008 and 2009. For these years, the total annual cost of all election observation missions is provided.

The event featured some sixty 15 year olds and representatives of civil society and was interactive in nature with lively and interesting questions from the young audience. The event underlined the progress achieved in Northern Ireland since the Good Friday Agreement and the continuing challenges ahead to achieve a reconciled, prosperous and shared society in Northern Ireland.</p><p>  In a separate meeting with Secretary of State Villiers we discussed the British Government&rsquo;s recent initiative involving economic support for Northern Ireland, the challenges ahead in delivering a reconciled, prosperous and shared society in Northern Ireland and the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement that have yet to be implemented. We discussed the EU PEACE IV programme and the continuing role of the International Fund for Ireland. We also discussed prisoner issues and the security situation in the light of the upcoming parading season.</p><p>  The Secretary of State and I also met the First and Deputy Minister. We discussed community relations, economic matters including corporation tax issues, EU budget discussions, the opportunities for Ireland North and South of EU trade talks with the United States and Canada, the EU PEACE programme, the forthcoming parades season, and the Narrow Water Bridge project.  </p><p>  I also had a meeting on North South Institutional matters with the First Minister and deputy First Minister. We discussed issues concerning youth employment, the North West Gateway Initiative, economic and EU matters and the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement Review.</p><p>  As I noted previously, these meetings were part of an ongoing schedule of close contact with the Secretary of State, and with the First Minister and deputy First Minister, which I fully intend to continue.</p></reply>

Against the background of escalating violence and a deepening crisis not just within Syria but the wider region, discussions focussed on how the EU can best promote a peaceful resolution and alleviate the sufferings of the Syrian people, more than 70,000 of whom have been killed since March 2011.  We will continue this discussion at the next Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on 27 May which I will attend and where Syria will again figure prominently on the agenda. UN/Arab League Joint Special Envoy Brahimi briefed the UN Security Council on 19 April and reiterated his view that a negotiated settlement alone can salvage what is left of Syria and offer the hope of an end to the conflict. Given the reciprocal deep mistrust between both sides to the conflict, he has long insisted that only concerted action by the Security Council will carry sufficient weight to bring both parties to the negotiation table.   Special Envoy Brahimi's task is extremely challenging and, together with our European colleagues, we have pledged on numerous occasions our fullest support to his work. We hope he will keep his resolve in conducting this essential mission.</p><p>Similarly, our attention has been increasingly devoted to the worsening humanitarian situation in and around Syria. I was personally able to witness first-hand the ravages of the war on the civilian population when I visited the refugee camp of Nizip in Southern Turkey in early April. As UN High Commissioner for Refugees Guterres vividly explained to the UN Security Council on 18 April, the situation in Syria and in surrounding countries risks becoming simply unsustainable. This prompted the Council to issue a unanimous Statement on 18 April, calling all parties to ensure safe and unimpeded access to those in need in all areas of Syria<font color="#004080"> </font>  and urging the Syrian authorities, in particular, to facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance, including across borders. It also called upon all countries that pledged financial support at the UN pledging conference held in Kuwait last January to honour these pledges as a matter of urgency. </p><p>  Ireland and its EU partners are making a major contribution to the UN-led humanitarian relief operations.   The EU is collectively the largest donor to such efforts, having contributed some &euro;600 million in aid to date.  Ireland's humanitarian assistance to Syria over the past year now amounts to &euro;8.15 million which include the additional &euro;1 million pledge I announced when visiting the Nizip camp.</p><p>  Considerable attention has also been devoted at EU level recently to reviewing the current EU sanctions which apply against Syria.   We want to ensure through these measures that pressure remains on the Assad regime to stop its repression and to engage in a process of political dialogue with the opposition.  At the 18 February Foreign Affairs Council, we agreed to renew the full range of existing sanctions for a further period of three months, until 1 June.  We also agreed at the last FAC meeting in Luxembourg to ease some of restrictions currently in place, so to allow a limited amount of trade to take place to the benefit of the moderate Syrian opposition and to improve the plight of civilians in newly-liberated areas.</p><p>  We will continue our discussion at the next Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on 27 May with a view to reaching a common position ahead of the 1 June renewal date.</p><p>  There is also a need to ensure full accountability in relation to the many gross human rights violations and war crimes which have been committed by all sides to this conflict, including the latest reported massacre at Baida only last week.  Ireland has been to the forefront within the EU in supporting calls for the situation in Syria to be referred by the UN Security Council to the International Criminal Court. Discussions are currently underway at the UN in New York about a possible adoption by the UN General Assembly of a Resolution on the situation in Syria. Together with our EU and Arab partners, we are working towards ensuring that the Resolution contains strong accountability messages. We are also encouraging the sponsors to seek as wide a measure of support for the Resolution as possible within the General Assembly so as to demonstrate the extent of international concern over the current situation. </p><p>  The conflict in Syria has been a major priority for Ireland and the EU over the last two years and will remain at the top of our foreign policy agenda during the remainder of Ireland's EU Presidency. We will continue to use whatever influence we have in our Presidency role and at all levels of our international engagement to support and promote European and UN efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict. </p></reply>

The levy therefore applies to individuals both resident and non-resident who meet the criteria set out in the legislation.   It is important to note that an Irish domiciled individual, resident in Ireland, who is otherwise liable to the Domicile Levy for a tax year, and who pays Irish Income Tax for that year, is entitled to credit the Irish Income Tax paid against her/his liability to the Domicile Levy.  This means that such a person who pays &euro;200,000 or more in Irish Income Tax for a tax year will have no liability to Domicile Levy for that year.  However, to the extent that such a liable person pays less that &euro;200,000 in Irish income tax for a tax year he or she will be liable to the Domicile Levy whether a resident of Ireland or not, and will also be entitled to a credit for whatever Irish Income Tax s/he paid for that year. </p><p>  This treatment was always intended as it ensures that such high wealth individuals with a substantial connection to Ireland, whether they are Irish tax resident or not, make a tax contribution to this country in a year of at least &euro;200,000, either by way of Domicile Levy or Income Tax.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of persons who filed a Domicile Levy return for 2010, paid a Domicile Levy liability in relation to 2010 and who filed an Income Tax return showing that they were resident in Ireland in that year was four.</p><p>  The number of persons who filed a domicile levy return for 2011, paid a Domicile Levy liability in relation to 2011 and who filed an Income Tax return showing that they were resident in Ireland in that year was two.</p></reply>

To date, demand has been confirmed by the relevant local authorities/Housing Agency for just over 1,500 of these properties; another 2,000 are no longer under consideration for a number of reasons including a lack of demand or because they have been deemed by the local authorities to be unsuitable. The rest of the identified properties are in the process of being assessed.  Once demand for a property has been confirmed by a local authority/Housing Agency, NAMA facilitates contact and negotiation between its debtor or receiver and the local authority or Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire or lease the property. To help streamline delivery, NAMA established a special purpose vehicle, National Asset Residential Property Services Limited, to take ownership of properties for which demand has been established.

This represents about 1.6% of the total issue, and is lower than Revenue would have expected at the outset.  A sizeable proportion of these seem to have occurred because the persons in question did not notify Revenue of a change of address, which resulted in an incorrect match between the person and his/her previous property.  To date about 9,000 of the returned forms have been reissued to the relevant customers at alternative addresses, and the process of reissue is ongoing.  While it is regretted that any correspondence was issued to incorrect addresses or returned &lsquo;undelivered&rsquo; by An Post, it was inevitable that there would be some given the scale of the operation involved.  I am very satisfied that as part of Revenue&rsquo;s communications on the general issue of LPT Returns, the Commissioners sought to forewarn taxpayers and they have provided clear guidance on the steps that should be taken in these cases. </p><p>  The LPT is a self-assessed tax and individuals who are not in receipt of a return are still obliged to file returns and make payments using the on-line option.  The online service is such that a Personal Public Service Number (PPSN) can be used to file and pay and therefore it is not actually necessary to receive a paper return in order to adhere to LPT obligations.</p></reply>

I am advised that there are a small number of pension funds that were placed on deposit with IBRC that may not be entitled to compensation under the deposit guarantee scheme, DGS, or the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme, ELG, due to the nature of the products or deposit options in which those account holders invested.  It is important to note that at the time the products were offered to customers there was no additional guarantee provided by the State in respect of those products.  </p><p>  It was always the case that the ELG scheme covered only those liabilities which were entered into during the issuance window.  In relation to the DGS Scheme, I am advised that the DGS Regulations explicitly specify which deposits are excluded from coverage under that Scheme. Deposits held by pension funds and retirement funds fall within the category of excluded deposits, though small self-administered pension schemes are included.  The decision to include SSAPs and exclude ARFs, AMRFs and other pension funds/instruments was based on the fact that SSAPs are usually small schemes administered by the member(s) of the scheme whilst ARFs are managed by a qualified fund manager through a credit or investment institution. </p><p>  Through the liquidation process, the proceeds from the disposal of IBRC&rsquo;s assets will be used to repay creditors in accordance with normal Companies Acts priorities and consequently, preferred creditors will be paid first and then debt purchased by NAMA from the Central Bank will be paid.  If there are proceeds available after repayment in full of the NAMA debt, these proceeds will be applied to remaining unsecured creditors.  This would include depositors to the extent that their deposits are unguaranteed.</p><p>  There are standard rules which apply to the distribution of the assets of companies in liquidation and it would not be appropriate for me to interfere with these rules.  Such interference could have the impact of diverting the assets of IBRC from one category of creditor to another outside the normal Companies Acts priorities and would be open to challenges in the Irish Courts by unsecured creditors.</p></reply>

Estimating the extent of any illicit activity is, of course inherently problematic and must be approached with caution. It follows that unless a credible methodology is specified for estimates of illicit trade and the associated tax loss, they must be regarded as speculative. Reflecting these difficulties, the report acknowledges that there are a wide variety of estimates, ranging between &euro;418 million and &euro;937 million, for the loss of revenue to the Exchequer from illicit activity in the sectors concerned.</p><p>  All interested parties are agreed, nevertheless, that illicit trade in the sectors addressed by the report, and shadow economy activities in general, pose a threat to legitimate and compliant businesses, as well as depriving the Government of tax revenues. Tackling the illegal activities in those sectors, and broader black economy activities, is therefore a key priority.</p><p>  I am informed that the report estimates the tax losses in the tobacco sector due to illicit trade in 2012 at &euro;569m.  This appears to be a tobacco industry figure, with which the Revenue Commissioners and other commentators would not agree.  A survey is carried out annually on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners and the National Tobacco Control office of the Health Services Executive on the extent of consumption of illicit cigarettes in the State.  This survey is carried out annually across a representative group of the public in a consistent, comprehensive, reliable and robust manner and the survey results distinguish the non-Irish duty paid product between product legally purchased abroad and product that is illegal.   The survey for 2012 indicates that 13 per cent of cigarettes consumed were illegal; this corresponds to an Exchequer loss, in excise duty and VAT, of &euro;240m.  I am assured that the annual survey of the Revenue Commissioners is a good indicator of the extent of the penetration of the Irish market by the illegal trade.  </p><p>  Extensive enforcement action by the Revenue Commissioners against the smuggling and sale of illicit cigarettes and other tobacco products resulted, during 2012, in the seizure of 95.6 million cigarettes and 5,276 kilograms of tobacco. There were 22 convictions on indictment and 110 summary convictions during the year for offences related to the smuggling or sale of illicit cigarettes and tobacco.</p><p>  I am advised that the report says, in relation to illicit activity in the fuel sector, that little progress has been made to tackle this important issue. This is not true.  Recognising the threat that this illegal activity poses to the exchequer and to legitimate business, the Revenue Commissioners adopted a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem. This strategy encompasses the following elements:  </p><p>- A strengthening of the licensing regime for auto fuel traders with effect from September 2011. </p><p>- A new licensing regime for marked fuel traders with effect from October 2012. </p><p>- The introduction by Regulation of new requirements in relation to fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries to ensure data are available to assist in supply chain analysis.</p><p>- The introduction of new supply chain controls from January 2013 that require all licensed fuel traders to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.  The first returns were received by Revenue in February.  I understand that the Revenue Commissioners have instituted a process of rigorous analysis of these returns.  This will support the development of a comprehensive overview of supply patterns and the identification of suspicious or anomalous transactions, and facilitate robust follow-up enforcement action where necessary. </p><p>  - An intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of fuel laundering.</p><p>  - An intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of the illicit sale of laundered products.  This involved a concentration on building intelligence, gaining an understanding of the supply chain, applying analytics to available data, embarking on a strategy of closing down stations that were in breach of legislation and/or regulations and working collaboratively .with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border.  One of the objectives is to cause maximum disruption to laundering plants and networks and to prevent the trading by stations that are operating outside the law.  </p><p>  - The Revenue Commissioners held discussions with HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs in the UK on regulatory measures to tackle the laundering of fuel and the two administrations signed a Memorandum of Understanding in May 2012 on a joint approach to finding a more effective marker for use in both jurisdictions.  An Invitation to Make Submissions was published in June 2012. The twelve submissions received by the deadline in November 2012, are currently being evaluated. </p><p>  Revenue's enforcement strategy in the fuel sector has yielded significant results. In the period 2011 to 2012, over 2 million litres of fuel was seized, 20 fuel laundries were detected and product and ancillary equipment seized, and 89 filling stations which were found to be unlicensed, or in breach of licensing conditions, were closed.  </p><p>  In the case of counterfeit goods, the role of the Revenue Commissioners is to prevent the entry of such goods into the State from outside the EU, and this has resulted in significant seizures of counterfeit goods in recent years. In 2012, there were 5,580 seizures involving 142,100 items, with an estimated value of &euro;5.45m. The range of items seized includes clothing, personal effects, electronic goods, cosmetics and medicines. </p><p>  Enforcement action in relation to the national sale and distribution<b></b>  of such goods is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I understand that there is close cooperation between the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling the counterfeit trade, and that there is also ongoing international cooperation on the matter.</p><p>  I am advised also that the Revenue Commissioners are conscious that the persons responsible for illegal activities in the sectors with which the report is primarily concerned are constantly looking for new ways to circumvent legal requirements and avoid detection and that Revenue's approach must, therefore, be flexible and adaptable.

The April tax receipts reported that some &euro;22m has already been paid to the Exchequer in respect of LPT.  The high volumes of filers and payments received suggest that most people are successfully interacting with the payments systems and meeting their obligations in a timely fashion.  </p><p>  To ensure continued high compliance rates Revenue is providing a dedicated LPT helpline at 1890 200 255 to assist any person that might be experiencing some difficulties in navigating the various payment or filing options and this service is proving to be very beneficial in supporting people in meeting their LPT obligations.  Revenue has confirmed to me that the LPT helpline is currently experiencing heavy volumes of phone calls from the public ranging from 9,000 calls on 24 April to 15,000 calls on 1 May.  I am assured that the vast majority of callers are very satisfied with the service being provided. </p><p>  In regard to the specific case highlighted by the Deputy, it seems that the issue relates to confirmation of a payment of LPT, which was made via the Revenue on-line system.  That being the case, the person in question can personally view his/her payment record.  The person can view his/her LPT balance, via Revenue.ie, once the payment is fully processed and available to Revenue.  Debit/Credit card payments for instance can take up to one week to be cleared by the card service providers.  Revenue has no influence on the duration of the clearance period for card payments.  A payment confirmation number is generated as a receipt of payment for the customer.  Once the payment is cleared and updated to the person&rsquo;s LPT (Revenue) account then he/she will be able to view the balance online. </p><p>  Revenue very carefully monitors the LPT Helpline to ensure the quality of service is of the highest order.  The call centre operations are supervised at all times and are subject to ongoing scrutiny through call evaluation and &lsquo;mystery shopper&rsquo; campaigns.  Unfortunately it is not possible for Revenue to isolate the call to which the Deputy has referred to from the information supplied.  However, all the calls to the helpline are recorded.  Therefore if the Deputy could provide additional information such as the name and address of the person, the date and time of call, name of operator if available and phone number from which the call was made, Revenue will fully investigate the complaint.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the rights of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I announced at the recent Teacher Union Conferences that I will shortly bring to Government draft heads of a bill &ndash; the Education (Admission to School) Bill 2013.  I will seek to publish the Bill in draft form to allow a full public discussion, including inputs from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection and the education partners.  I also intend to publish draft regulations that I plan to make when the Bill is enacted.  In bringing forward these proposals, it is not my intention to unnecessarily intrude into how schools do their business.  My policy objective is to ensure that every child is treated fairly and that the way in which schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent.  As the Bill and the Regulations will be published in draft form, they will also be subject to a lot of detailed scrutiny before becoming law.  I will be reflecting carefully on the views expressed in the consultation process to ensure they strike the right balance between school autonomy and fairness in our education system.</p></reply>

The current status of all projects on the school building programme, including the school in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at www.education.ie. and this is being updated regularly throughout the year.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the school is currently in temporary accommodation on lands controlled by South Dublin County Council. At a recent meeting with the Council, my Department raised the issue of the land holding.  The Council advised that they are endeavouring to rectify title issues in regard to a portion of the site on which the school resides.  Once the Council is in a position to dispose of the land, it is my Department's intention to acquire same.</p><p>  In light of the need to prioritise available funding for the provision of additional school accommodation, the delivery of major school projects required to meet future demographic demand will be the main focus for capital investment in the coming years.  The 5 Year Construction Plan that I announced in March 2012 outlines the major school projects that will commence construction over the duration of the Plan.  It is not possible therefore at this point to indicate when a project for the school in question will be progressed.</p></reply>

It appears to be affording real opportunities in the area of alternative finance for SMEs.  Use of the mechanism appears to have seen substantial growth globally in the recent past and it is seen by many sponsors as a means of &ldquo;democratising&rdquo; access to funds and supply of capital and moving the model away from venture capitalists and angel investors.  </p><p>  However, as an industry, crowdfunding is in its infancy and financial returns on capital will dictate its overall success. Data is not yet readily available with which to analyse its impact. </p><p>  I have no immediate plans to introduce legislation. The industry needs time to &ldquo;find itself&rdquo; and should not be over burdened by regulation before the required platforms have been given the time to grow and develop.  I will keep the matter under review.  It is certainly too early to provide a specific regulatory mechanism for the concept, but my officials, along with the Department of Finance will continue to monitor the issue.  </p><p>  I am also fully aware that crowdfunding is being discussed seriously within the European institutions and the OECD as an alternative for SME financing.  We will continue to actively engage with the relevant Institutions in these deliberations and are fully committed to providing an appropriate policy response with regard to the emerging need to establish a European framework and ecosystem for best practices.</p></reply>

The Steering Group has met twice, on 12th March and 29th April, with Minister Perry as chair, and detailed discussions have taken place between Forf&aacute;s, the licensing authorities and relevant Departments.</p><p>  Detailed analysis has been undertaken, examining a range of information submitted by the licensing authorities in relation to the processes and underpinning legislative requirements for the core set of retail licenses to be incorporated into the integrated licensing application system.   The outputs of this audit process will inform the definition of the integrated licence management system.   </p><p>  It is expected that a request for tender for the service provision of an integrated licensing application system will be issued in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

The Directors set the interest rate to be charged on loans under the Scheme 8.8% taking into account a number of factors including: prevailing market interest rates, the economic environment, specific risk factors and administrative overheads.</p><p>  The Deputy will know that lending to microenterprises is high risk due to the high failure rates with business start-ups, little or no track record and no security available. Therefore, pricing of loans tends to strike a balance between the support of new start-ups and the erosion of the taxpayers investment in the Scheme. </p><p>  With regard to the term length of the loan, the standard term is 3 years but may be extended up to 6 years maximum.  Applications are assessed on their individual merits and in tandem with the on-going commercial viability of the business.   This maximum term is a condition of the European Investment Fund (EIF) which is providing a guarantee for Microfinance Ireland to assist with the risk tolerance levels.   The support and involvement of the EIF guarantee was a critical factor in the establishment of this loan scheme which otherwise would not make this new avenue available to such businesses that have difficulty accessing credit.  </p><p>  In its first half year of operation, MFI have not received feedback and have not been made aware of issues with regards to applicants being deterred from applying for loans due to the interest rate or term length, as having been previously declined by a bank, access to credit is the priority in seeking support for their new or existing business.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am keeping all aspects of the Scheme under on-going assessment and that I am obliged under section 22 of the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act 2012 to commence a review of the operation of the Act not later than 2 years after the date of its passing.  </p></reply>

In the meantime, there have been many changes to the social, economic and technological landscape of Ireland. It is incumbent on Government to ensure that State supports are delivered in the most integrated, focussed and seamless way possible. The proposed reform is a major commitment in the Programme for Government and a core part of the Action Plan for Jobs. </p><p>  This reform will bring about a new level of engagement and interaction at both national and local level in relation to enterprise support and stimulation and economic recovery and growth. The proposed reforms offer a huge opportunity to leverage the skills, resources and experience of the CEBs, Local Authorities and local business community to create a national approach to the sector allowing for seamless progression, innovative performance, streamlined delivery and increased employment. </p><p>  The creation of a First-Stop-Shop at local level for the support of small and micro business will bring local enterprise support into an integrated national network of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) delivering enterprise policy to the highest standards, offering seamless progression for small business with potential to the existing national programmes run by Enterprise Ireland (EI). The LEOs will deliver the combined functions of CEBs and the Local Authority business support functions as well as developing an enhanced service to business at local level. The new Centre of Excellence within EI will be responsible for developing an improved environment for small and micro business and bringing this sector into the heart of national enterprise policy. As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation I will retain responsibility for policy, and a key feature of this new structure will be the consistent application of policy across all LEOs, from the evaluation of applications for funding support, to the spending of budgets allocated. </p><p>  In relation to the formal dissolution of the CEBs, officials of my Department are continuing, in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, to develop draft legislation with a view to enactment before summer recess. In addition, a Framework Service Level Agreement (SLA) between EI and the Local Authorities has been finalised and the LEO branding and associated logo has been designed.  Within the next couple of weeks, I will publish the SLA and launch the branding and logo, both of which are tangible steps to the full roll out of the new infrastructure.</p></reply>

In 2012 the corresponding allocation was &euro;46.8 million and &euro;18.3 million respectively. </p><p>  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service is made up of a network of 53 companies, which includes 51 local companies and 2 national companies MABS National Development Limited and National Traveller MABS.

With the assistance of an approved intermediary, a person may apply for a Debt Relief Notice which will allow for the full write-off of qualifying unsecured debt after a three year supervision period. The Citizens Information Board (CIB), which has the statutory responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) has agreed to my request that MABS be an approved intermediary for the purpose of processing applications for Debt Relief Notices. Those who can avail of Debt Relief Notices are typically part of the MABS core client cohort of people on low incomes in debt or in danger of falling into debt. </p><p>  Sanction has been given for 16 temporary staff to be assigned to MABS for up to 2 years, to establish an Approved Intermediary Service as part of the new Insolvency Service. The CIB and MABS National Development Limited are working closely to ensure that the appropriate structures are in place within MABS to implement this new and important statutory role. They have also engaged proactively with the Insolvency Service to ensure that the Approved Intermediary Service is fully operational in time for the establishment of the Insolvency Service. </p><p>  I am satisfied that MABS will play an important role in the new arrangements for dealing with debt and will continue to provide a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 86,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013.</p><p>  A person who claims a one-parent family payment is required to seek maintenance from her/his spouse or the other parent of the child. Maintenance payments are assessed as means for the purpose of determining entitlement to one-parent family payment. However, vouched housing costs of up to &euro;95.23 per week in respect of rent or mortgage are disregarded in establishing the rate of one-parent family payment payable.</p><p>  For rent supplement, maintenance payments of up to &euro;95.23 per week are assessed in determining the appropriate rate payable. Where a person has weekly maintenance payments of more than &euro;95.23, the first &euro;75 a week together with 25% of any additional maintenance above &euro;75 can be disregarded for means assessment purposes. This ensures that the family benefits from any maintenance payments received in excess of &euro;95.23.</p><p>  The treatment of maintenance payments when assessing an entitlement to rent supplement is contained in the Third Schedule, Part 4 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. </p></reply>

In order to increase activation capacity the Department is considering the contracting of employment services to complement the existing capacity of the department.  In that regard, the Department engaged the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion (CESI) in November 2012 to provide expert advice and assistance with the design and delivery of a contracted employment service model. The consultants recently produced a report and this is currently being evaluated. I expect the evaluation to be completed in the near future. The question of tendering for the provision of additional activation services will be then considered by Government and will be subject to the normal procurement requirements.</p><p>  As part of its current employment service provision, the Department already contracts with external providers for the delivery of both the Local Employment Service (LES) and Job Clubs.  Employment services, including career planning, engagement with employers and job search assistance, are provided under contract by these organisations to clients who are activated by the Department.  The Department funds this contracted provision to the value of approximately &euro;25m per annum and these organisations employ approximately 390 staff, who are engaged in the provision of these services.</p></reply>

Likewise, the disability allowance (DA) represents an important income support to people who are unfit for work.</p><p>  DCA is now in payment in respect of 26,000 children, an increase of over 3,000 since the Department took over responsibility for the scheme from the HSE in April 2009.  Spending on the scheme and the respite care grant, which is automatically paid to all recipients, has increased from &euro;138 million to &euro;145 million between 2010 and 2012.  In 2012, DA was in payment in respect of 120,000 customers at a cost of &euro;1.09 billion.</p><p>  The Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare was established in line with commitments contained in the Programme for Government, with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience to examine a number of specific issues relating to the tax and social welfare systems. Following Budget 2012, I requested the Advisory Group to examine and report on the policy objectives underpinning the budgetary proposals relating to disability allowance (DA) and domiciliary care allowance (DCA), which included a measure to increase the minimum age for new DA claimants from 16 to 18 years of age with a corresponding extension in the age of entitlement for DCA from 16 to 18 years of age. The Group's report on this issue was published on 10 April 2013.</p><p>  At the same time, the report of the Review Group on the operation of the DCA scheme was published.  Both of these reports make a number of policy recommendations, which make a valuable contribution to the policy debate in relation to young people with disabilities.  My colleagues in Government and I will consider these  findings, taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation as well as other work underway.  </p><p>  The administrative recommendations made in the report of the Review Group on the operation of the DCA scheme will result in an improvement in the level of service provided to our customers and will assist in ensuring that those people who meet the qualifying conditions for the payment receive it in a timely manner.  It is my intention that the administrative improvements will be implemented quickly.</p></reply>

It is a lump sum and in most cases is paid automatically, but some people need to claim. The total amount of winter fuel payment can vary from &pound;100 - &pound;300 sterling having regard to age and household composition. Most payments are made between mid- November and December in a given year.    The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that people living outside the UK may be paid the winter fuel payment where they can demonstrate a &ldquo;genuine and sufficient link&rdquo; to the UK&rsquo;s social security system.</p><p>  My Department pays a fuel allowance of &euro;20 per week to qualified households who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or HSE payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full. The fuel allowance season runs for 26 weeks from October to April each year.  </p><p>  The implications of this ECJ judgment are currently being examined, in particular the implications for eligibility for the fuel allowance in Ireland, which is paid on the basis that an applicant is unable to provide for his or her own heating needs.</p></reply>

The Gender Recognition Advisory Group (GRAG) was established in 2010 to advise the Government on the legislation required to give legal recognition to the acquired gender of transgender persons.  The Group engaged in a public consultation exercise which provided organisations and individuals with the opportunity to contribute their comments and proposals.  The Report of the Group, which recommended a scheme for the legal recognition of transgender persons, was approved by the Government on 12 July 2011, and was subsequently published on 14 July 2011.  Since the publication of the Report, the Department has been working on developing draft Heads of a Gender Recognition Bill. In this context, it has engaged in discussions with the relevant medical health professionals and with representatives from interested NGOs.</p><p>  Given the legal complexities involved in relation to some of the GRAG recommendations relating to the marital and civil partnership status of individuals, in March 2012 the Department sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General, which in turn sought the legal opinion of external counsel on these issues.  The formal opinion of the Attorney General was received in December 2012 and is currently under consideration by officials in this Department with a view to progressing the draft Heads of the Bill.  There are a range of complex and sensitive issues involved in this proposed legislation to give legal recognition to the acquired gender of transgender persons.  I have requested the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection to consider the provisional draft Heads of Bill once they are completed.  I feel that the Committee can make a very positive contribution to the preparation of the legislation and I hope that the appearance before the Committee can be scheduled before the summer.  I believe this approach should greatly assist the drafting of the legislation and its progress through the Oireachtas.  When the Oireachtas Committee has discussed the provisional draft Heads of Bill, I will be in a better position to give a timeframe for the introduction of the legislation.</p></reply>

The use of worms as bait has already been banned for a number of years.  On foot of these representations, I requested Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) to conduct a public consultation processes to canvass as wide a view as possible from stakeholders.  The outcome was that the significant majority of anglers and fishery owners on the River Suir were in favour of banning these baits.  Local Public representatives were advised of the consultation process and its outcomes.  The banning of prawn/shrimp as bait simply supports the proposal put forward by a local angling federation which was widely supported by the majority of anglers on the Suir.  Alternative fishing methods, such as the use of spinners are not affected by the bye law and remain available where waters are not suitable for fly fishing.  I have asked IFI to review the impact of the bye law and advise further in advance of the 2014 season.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to those that are vulnerable to energy poverty and who live in privately-owned dwellings.  The scheme is delivered through a combination of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.  Measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation.</p><p>  In 2012 the Warmer Homes Scheme delivered over 12,000 energy efficiency measures to energy poor homes under the scheme, including 624 homes in County Tipperary.  Last year, CBOs delivered upgrades to almost 7,000 homes in local communities around the country.  I am informed by SEAI that under this scheme, the CBO concerned submitted a request for funding to the SEAI in January 2012.  The CBO proposed that they would retrofit 204 homes at an average cost of &euro;1,224.15 per home, giving a total funding envelop of &euro;249,725.85.  This was agreed and a contract was signed on that basis.  When the final request for payment was made in November 2012, it became apparent that the CBO had in fact completed 183 homes (rather than the 204 homes agreed) at an average cost of &euro;1,364 (rather than the agreed average cost of &euro;1,224.15 per home).  Furthermore, the CBO has informed the SEAI that they completed 34 homes where the cost of delivery was significantly above their agreed contract price.  As a formal contract was in place, the SEAI was required to pay the CBO in accordance with the rates agreed and so they were paid for 183 homes at a rate of &euro;1,224.15 per home, giving a total payment of &euro;224,019.45.  Any shortfall is therefore a matter for the CBO to resolve as they operated outside of the terms of their contract.</p><p>  The SEAI did not give the CBO approval to divert from the standard contract conditions, which were issued to all CBOs in 2012.  There was no agreement that a 10% variation was available to this, or to any other, CBO.  Moreover, I am informed that the SEAI did not instruct the CBO to complete larger homes and incur higher costs beyond the parameters of the contract.  In fact, in order to assist CBOs and to avoid penalising eligible homeowners with large homes, CBOs were expressly requested to pass larger homes to the SEAI for delivery under the private contractor model under the Scheme.  I understand the CBO is now proposing to charge vulnerable home owners in order to recoup their overspend, even though the SEAI contract stipulates that these services must be delivered free of charge.  SEAI has emphasised to me that under no circumstances should the CBO charge or propose to charge vulnerable home owners for these services to make up a contract shortfall which the company incurred.</p><p>  The SEAI is required to ensure that all CBOs operate within their contract conditions to ensure good governance and consistency of service delivery nationwide.  The SEAI gave clear guidance on the contracts for 2012 and CBOs were advised on numerous occasions that they were required to work within the budget price agreed in their contract and to contact the SEAI at the earliest opportunity if they were having difficulty meeting these requirements.  CBOs are responsible for managing their own budgets within the requirements of the contract, which is supported by the SEAI who have put in place a resource to assist CBOs with budget management.  Within the confines of the rules of the scheme, the SEAI would very much welcome the continued participation of the CBO in question.  I would also like to reassure Deputy that coverage of vulnerable homes in the county will continue to be provided through private contractors should the services of the CBO be withdrawn pending resolution of this issue.</p></reply>

Many of the measures have already been implemented through legislation enacted in the last two years. Legislation enacted in 2011 provides for a reduction in the number of TDs, reduced spending limits at Presidential elections and time limits for the holding of bye elections. Legislation enacted in 2012 strengthens the political funding regime in Ireland and provides for the payment of state funding to political parties being conditional on parties having at least 30% women and 30% men candidates at the next general election.

Also in the legislation programme the Electoral (Amendment) (Referendum Spending and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, to be progressed later this year, will implement more commitments in the Programme for Government. Arising from the Action Programme for Effective Local Government I established a Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee in November 2012 to review and make recommendations on local electoral area boundaries in time for the 2014 local elections and my Department is providing administrative support to that committee.</p><p>  Following these tasks, I will be addressing the Programme for Government commitment to establish an Electoral Commission to subsume functions of existing bodies and my Department. Establishment of an Electoral Commission will be a major body of work. Issues for consideration include international best practice, the Commission's structure and functions, who it reports to, its relationship with other bodies currently involved in electoral administration, and the approach to be followed in relation to the extensive legislation that will be required, as well as practical matters including staffing and funding arrangements.</p></reply>

These studies, based on levels of dioxins found in cows' milk, have shown that concentrations of dioxins and other pollutants remain at a consistently low level in the Irish environment. The report is available to download from the EPA's website  .   </p><p>The levels of dioxins found in the 2011 surveys are well below the EU limit for dioxins in milk and milk products and the results are also in line with earlier similar EPA surveys. In addition, all dioxin levels recorded in the 2011 survey compare favourably with those taken from a random selection of similar studies in EU and other countries.     Furthermore , the dioxin levels were in line with a 2010 Food Safety Authority of Ireland breast milk study which confirmed low   levels of exposure to the Irish population.  The 2011 report indicated that the dominant sources of dioxin emissions in Ireland are from non-industrial activities , which in relation to waste would comprise the open burning of waste , also known as backyard burning. Considerable efforts have been made in recent times to address the issue   . </p><p>  In general terms, any burning of waste that gives rise to pollution is in breach of both Waste Management and Air Pollution legislation. Section 32 of the Waste Management Act 1996 sets out the general duty of a holder of waste not to hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste &#8220;in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution.&#8221; </p><p>  The Waste Management (Prohibition of Waste Disposal by Burning) Regulations 2009 make it an offence to dispose of waste by uncontrolled burning and various actions are prohibited by the regulations, including burning within the curtilage of a dwelling. Local authorities are empowered to take legal action against offenders and fines of up to &euro;3,000 are applicable for summary convictions of offences. </p></reply>

The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts, 1995 and 1997 provide a mechanism whereby non-nationals serving sentences in Ireland may apply to serve the remainder of their sentences in their own countries and, similarly, Irish persons who are imprisoned overseas may apply to serve the remainder of their sentences in Ireland.  Transfer requests under the Convention are normally made by a prisoner through the governor of the prison in which he or she is detained.</p><p>  To be considered eligible for a transfer to the prisoner's home country, the prisoner must meet the criteria as set out as follows:</p><p>i) the prisoner must be a national of the country to which they want to be transferred, (there are some circumstances where a period of permanent residency may be sufficient rather than being that nationality)</p><p>ii) the sentence imposed is final, therefore remand prisoners, or prisoners who have an appeal against the conviction are not considered for such transfers</p><p>iii) there is at least 6 months left to serve on the sentence imposed</p><p>iv) the offence that the prisoner has been convicted of is considered to be a crime in their home country too.</p><p>I decide on all such requests following the collation of a number of reports from various agencies setting out the consequences of such a transfer.  For any such transfer to take place, the consent of all three parties in the process is required i.e. the sentencing state, the receiving state and the sentenced person.</p></reply>

This compared with 18,727 applications in 2011 which was a decrease of approximately 10%.  Overall however, there has been a significant increase in demand for civil legal aid services in recent years, as the number of applications in 2006 was 9,689 which the Deputy will note from last year's figure was almost 74% ahead of the demand six years earlier.  On the asylum side the trend has been consistently downwards for a number of years.  Last year there were 725 new applications to the Board for asylum related matters.  This compares to a figure of 979 in 2011 and 2,980 in 2006.  Adjusting the numbers overall there were 17,595 new applications in 2012 compared to 19,706 in 2011 and 12,669 in 2006.  The drop in demand in 2012 on 2011 was just under 11% while demand in 2012 was still 39% ahead of what it was six years previously.  From this year we are recording a single figure for demand for services.</p><p>  Having regard to the significantly increased demand for services from the Legal Aid Board in recent years, it was decided to maintain the Board's grant-in-aid for 2013 at the same level as last year.  The Board, in common with all public service organisations, has to manage the delivery of their services in the most cost effective and efficient manner possible having regard to ongoing pressure on the public finances.  Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, I have further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery.  The Public Appointments Service is currently running a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board from which appointments, both temporary and permanent, will be made in the coming months.</p><p>  The Deputy should also note that prior to 2012 the Board received a grant-in-aid for its general civil legal aid services and a separate grant for its asylum services.  The 2012 allocation was however, a single grant-in-aid which included funding in respect of the Family Mediation Service, for which the Board assumed responsibility in late 2011.  This has facilitated the integration of the asylum area into the general service delivery area with consequent efficiencies in terms of use of resources.  I am confident that this measure combined with the extra staffing resources will meet the demands that are placed on the civil legal aid system generally and will not be specific to any particular problem type.</p></reply>

The case referred to by the Deputy is currently the subject of an ongoing judicial review case.  Two judgment mortgages were lodged with the Property Registration Authority by a firm of solicitors in 2003.  Due to a perceived error on behalf of the lodging party, two fresh judgment mortgage affidavits were lodged for registration by the same firm of solicitors in March 2004.</p><p>  On 6 May 2004, the title holder applied to the Land Registry to remove the judgment mortgages.  As indicated, registration of judgment mortgages is purely an administrative process.  In the absence of a release by the owner of the judgment, a decision was made by the Property Registration Authority to refuse the application and an order of refusal issued on 9 August 2007.  The title holder subsequently applied for Judicial Review in the High Court against the refusal order issued by the Authority.  I am advised by the Property Registration Authority that prior to the hearing, the original two judgment mortgages were cancelled from the folio on foot of legal advice and on notice to the solicitor for the judgment mortgagee, since the interest was still protected by the second two judgment mortgages.  The High Court found in April 2009 that the Authority was obliged by law to register the judgments in question.

This compared with 18,727 applications in 2011 which was a decrease of approximately 10%.  Overall however, there has been a significant increase in demand for civil legal aid services in recent years, as the number of applications in 2006 was 9,689 which the Deputy will note from last year's figure was almost 74% ahead of the demand six years earlier.  On the asylum side the trend has been consistently downwards for a number of years.  Last year there were 725 new applications to the Board for asylum related matters.  This compares to a figure of 979 in 2011 and 2,980 in 2006.  Adjusting the numbers overall there were 17,595 new applications in 2012 compared to 19,706 in 2011 and 12,669 in 2006. The drop in demand in 2012 on 2011 was just under 11% while demand in 2012 was still 39% ahead of what it was six years previously.  From this year we are recording a single figure for demand for services. </p><p>  Having regard to the significantly increased demand for services from the Legal Aid Board in recent years, it was decided to maintain the Board's grant-in-aid for 2013 at the same level as last year.  The Board, in common with all public service organisations, has to manage the delivery of their services in the most cost effective and efficient manner possible having regard to ongoing pressure on the public finances.  Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, I have further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery.  The Public Appointments Service is currently running a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board from which appointments, both temporary and permanent, will be made in the coming months. </p><p>  The Deputy should also note that prior to 2012 the Board received a grant-in-aid for its general civil legal aid services and a separate grant for its asylum services.  The 2012 allocation was however, a single grant-in-aid which included funding in respect of the Family Mediation Service, for which the Board assumed responsibility in late 2011.  This has facilitated the integration of the asylum area into the general service delivery area with consequent efficiencies in terms of use of resources.  I am confident that this measure combined with the extra staffing resources will meet the demands that are placed on the civil legal aid system generally and will not be specific to any particular problem type.</p></reply>

The case referred to by the Deputy is currently the subject of an ongoing judicial review case.  Two judgment mortgages were lodged with the Property Registration Authority by a firm of solicitors in 2003.  Due to a perceived error on behalf of the lodging party, two fresh judgment mortgage affidavits were lodged for registration by the same firm of solicitors in March 2004. </p><p>  On 6 May 2004, the title holder applied to the Land Registry to remove the judgment mortgages.  As indicated, registration of judgment mortgages is purely an administrative process.  In the absence of a release by the owner of the judgment, a decision was made by the Property Registration Authority to refuse the application and an order of refusal issued on 9 August 2007.</p><p>  The title holder subsequently applied for Judicial Review in the High Court against the refusal order issued by the Authority.  I am advised by the Property Registration Authority that prior to the hearing, the original two judgment mortgages were cancelled from the folio on foot of legal advice and on notice to the solicitor for the judgment mortgagee, since the interest was still protected by the second two judgment mortgages.  The High Court found in April 2009 that the Authority was obliged by law to register the judgments in question.  It was also held that the Authority had ample power to cancel the duplicated judgment mortgages.  The Court refused the reliefs sought in the judicial review proceedings.  The matter is currently on appeal to the Supreme Court and on 3 May 2013 the appellant was granted further time to file a Book of Appeal.</p><p>  It would not be appropriate for me to comment any further in relation to matters which are subject to ongoing legal proceedings.</p></reply>

Persons who engage in money lending and who do not hold the necessary licence granted by the Central Bank are committing an offence under section 98 of the Act.  </p><p>  The regulation of licensed money lending is a matter primarily for my colleague the Minister for Finance.  Under the provisions of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003 the Central Bank of Ireland is designated the competent authority in this jurisdiction with regard to licensed money lending activity.</p><p>  There are also a number of provisions in the criminal law which may be of relevance in particular circumstances, for example, sections 10 and 11 of the Non-fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 and section 17 the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 provide for offences relating to harassment, extortion and demanding money with menaces.  </p><p>  While consideration of any proposed legislative change in relation to the regulation of money lending would primarily be a matter for my colleague Minister Bruton, insofar as my Department has a role in this area and in the context of the investigation of illegal money lending, I have previously indicated to the House that I will consider any proposals which might be made in aid of the investigation of such offences. </p><p>  My Department has also written to the Garda Commissioner to ascertain if there are any  further improvements that could be made to the legislative framework in this area which might be of assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the investigation of such offences. </p><p>  Of course, I would also encourage those who may have information concerning the operation of unlicensed money lenders in particular circumstances to make that information available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who will take all measures open to them to enforce the law in this area. </p></reply>

I do not consider civil partnership to be an appropriate means of addressing the possible needs of the very disparate range of "non-conjugal" cohabitants as it imposes a very high level of mutual responsibility and obligation on the parties to it.  The redress scheme, for instance, separately provided for in part 15 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, allows a qualified cohabitant, at the end of the relationship, to seek maintenance from the other, or a pension adjustment order or property adjustment order.  Where the relationship ends on death, a qualified cohabitant may seek provision from the estate of the deceased cohabitant.  Imposing such a default scheme on relationships based on family ties or friendship would be an unwarranted interference in those relationships and into the autonomy of each of the parties.</p></reply>

Section 18 of the 2011 Act requires OMCs to establish and maintain a scheme of annual service charges from which they may discharge expenditure incurred on the provision of common or shared services to the owners and occupiers of residential units in the development, including insurance, waste management and security services. The service charge must be calculated on a transparent basis and be equitably apportioned between the residential unit owners. In order to ensure transparency and accountability, both the annual service charge and the services to be provided must be approved by a general meeting of the members of the OMC.  Section 18 also provides that the owner of each residential unit is under an obligation to pay all service charges levied under the Act.  As regards the recovery of unpaid service charges, section 22 of the Act provides that they may be recovered by the OMC as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction, i.e normally the District Court.  <b><font color="#000080">   </font></b></p></reply>

The position is unchanged since then.<blockquote>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Parliamentary Questions No. 54456 of 4 December 2012, No. 2999 of 22 January 2013, No. 4077 of 5 February 2013 and No. 10664 of 27 February 2013.  As I explained in response to these previous questions, the Government has undertaken in its Programme for Government to ensure that people of non-faith or minority religious backgrounds and publically identified lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people should not be deterred from training or taking up employment as teachers in the State.  I have previously expressed concern about the potential impact of section 37 of the Employment Equality Acts on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons. This section is designed to allow schools and other institutions to maintain their religious ethos. It was examined by the Supreme Court in 1996 when the Employment Equality Bill of 1996 was referred to it under Article 26 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court found that it is a reasonable balancing in legislation of the different rights involved, including chiefly the right to earn a living and the rights to freedom of religion and association. I am concerned however that, in practice, the balance is not a fair one and that in practice this provision can operate in a way that is unfair to LGBT persons. I consider that an extensive consultative process and formal assessment of the options should be undertaken.  On 16 April, I announced the names of 14 new members designate of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. In advance of legislation to establish the new Commission, the members designate will take up their positions on the two existing bodies that are being merged, the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission. I will be meeting the Commissioners shortly. As I have previously explained, I intend to ask them to examine this issue as a priority. I hope they will complete this consultation process quickly and report on their views and recommendations to the two Ministers centrally concerned, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn and myself as the Minister for Justice and Equality and to the House.  I am committed, once this necessary consultation process is completed, to bringing forward Government proposals for any necessary anti-discrimination amendment to this provision. In this context, the Government has welcomed the Private Members' Employment Equality (Amendment) (No.2) Bill which has passed Second Stage in the Seanad. During the Second Stage reading of the Bill, my colleague Minister of State Kathleen Lynch signalled to the House the Government's intention to take forward this Bill, with any amendments that might be needed, with Government support for enactment.</blockquote></p></reply>

This review, arising from a Government commitment that such be undertaken, commenced in 2010 and was undertaken by a group consisting of representatives of the forestry sector.

It is anticipated that the process will be concluded by the end of July after which it is planned to issue the report, taking account of any further inputs received during the SEA process.  A review of Coillte was also undertaken as part of the process.

NewERA, Coillte, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department have worked to examine the financial and other implications of a potential transaction, with NewERA liaising with the bodies engaged to undertake specific aspects of that examination.

There has been an increase of over 20% this Spring when compared to the same period in 2012.  While access to fodder is an immediate priority, grass growth in the months ahead will be the key to ensuring that this problem is overcome.  In this regards I have asked Teagasc's advisory service to prioritise advice to farmers in the period ahead and to focus on the optimum use of fertiliser in generating feed for the national herd.</p><p>An Early Warning System, which is overseen by the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council (FAWAC) and operated from my Department, has been in place for some time to respond <i>to </i>queries from farmers who are facing emergency animal welfare situations and are in need of support. Feed is being sourced and provided to any farmer who is dealing with an animal welfare crisis and is in need of assistance.  <i></i></p><p>Over 500 calls have been received to date through the system.  The vast majority of calls are being adequately supported through fodder being made available under the transport subsidy scheme but a small portion of farmers, in need of more substantial support have been assisted directly by the Department.  In excess of 100 farmers have received emergency financial assistance to the value of &euro;180 - &euro;1,000 under this system<i>.  </i></p><p>  My Department's Veterinary Inspectors continue to be actively engaged in providing emergency assistance under the Department's early warning system to farmers whose animals are currently experiencing serious welfare issues and where the farmer him/herself is unable to cope with the situation.</p><p>  I want to remind farmers that the animal welfare emergency assistance helpline continues to operate where animal welfare is seriously at risk. The emergency helpline number - 1850 21 19 90 (Low-call).  No animal should die of starvation in this country and help is available to those farmers who cannot cope<i>.  </i> I will continue to work with all stakeholders in the sector to get through this difficult period caused by very unusual weather patterns. </p><p>The onus of compliance with EU food safety regulations, including traceability requirements, rests in the first instance with food business operators. My Department maintains a permanent presence in approved slaughter plants. Regular visits are made to other Department approved meat plants.  The frequency of these inspections in plants other than slaughter plants, which focus primarily on food safety requirements, is determined by a risk assessment, as required under EU legislation, which is conducted for each plant. My Department has been able to reduce the number of inspections at non-slaughter meat plants, where there is no permanent supervisory presence, by moving to a more robust and rigorous targeted system of official controls, based on the risk assessments mentioned above. Official controls and inspections levels are monitored independently by the EU Food and Veterinary Office and by the FSAI under service contract. </p><p>  Food business operators in Ireland are responsible inter alia for carrying out checks to ensure that their ingredients come from approved plants. In meat plants that operate under the supervision of the Department, official controls are conducted on these checks to verify their effectiveness. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant. Labelling and documentary checks also form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. </p><p>  Under the Department&rsquo;s National Residue Programme, and including tests on bovine samples carried out by processors, up to 30,000 samples taken at farm and factory level and covering a wide range of food stuffs are tested annually. These tests relate to microbiological and chemical standards, their primary focus being on food safety and are fully in accordance with EU testing requirements.  In addition the Product Official Sampling and Testing (POST) programme is a microbiological testing programme on samples taken from Department approved ready-to-eat food, meat product, minced meat and meat preparation plants i.e. added value plants. This is part of the official verification of food safety controls in the plants concerned as provided for in Regulations (EC) 852/2004, 854/2004 and 2073/2005. A total of 1,600 samples are taken annually and the sampling and testing is risk based.</p><p>  Compliance with existing food safety and food hygiene requirements was not an issue in relation to the mislabelling of meat products uncovered by the recent FSAI survey. It is clear however that the focus of checks henceforth will also need to include food authenticity. The ongoing national programme and recent EU wide programme of DNA testing provides further reassurance to Irish consumers and consumers of Irish food abroad about the authenticity of ingredients in our beef based products</p></reply>

Teagasc advisors are working with farmers on the ground to provide advice as to how to stretch existing fodder supplies and are available to support farmers in need of assistance.  </p><p>  Farm organisations are also working at a local level with farmers, disseminating information through text messages, advising farmers with surplus fodder to make it available on a commercial basis to their neighbours who have fodder shortages and sourcing fodder abroad. The Irish Diary Board, IFA and agri-businesses launched more than &euro;3m of extra fodder aid for farmers this week.  The co-ops have also agreed to consider the introduction of interest free credit, within limits, to farmers for the purchase of fertiliser, limited to the month of May.  A number of co-ops have confirmed participation in this initiative.  This is aimed at ensuring farmers are supported in driving grass production in the months ahead providing fodder for next winter. Grass is the cheapest fodder source on all farms.  In this regard I have asked Teagasc&rsquo;s advisory service to prioritise advice to farmers in the period ahead.</p><p>  While access to fodder is a priority, grass growth in the months ahead will be the key to ensuring that this problem is overcome.  I have been in regular contact with the banks, co-ops and feed merchants and I have urged the greatest degree of flexibility, co&ndash;operation and support for farmers at this challenging time given the difficult conditions being experienced by many farmers.  Both banks and co-ops have asked farmers to contact them to discuss the terms that are available and have indicated that they will show flexibility on the basis that the longer term outlook for farming is positive and prices are strong across most areas.</p></reply>

Where a small variation occurs between the approved dimensions and the completed structure, the applicant is required to get confirmation from the relevant local authority that the completed structure is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the planning permission.  As both Schemes are now closed for applications, I have no plans to amend with retroactive effect the provisions of either Scheme.</p></reply>

These include a programme of DNA testing of beef products and testing of horse meat for the presence of phenylbutazone. Meat traders/agents will be required to register as food business operators. Controls relating to horse identification are being strengthened and my Department is taking responsibility for the supervision of all horse abattoirs in Ireland. </p><p>  The report clearly detailed the outcome of the comprehensive investigation which involved my Department's special investigation unit and the Garda authorities. Information in relation to activities by traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain outside of the jurisdiction has been passed to Europol and other Member States to facilitate continuing investigations in other Member States. The Irish authorities remain fully open to assisting any other Member State or entity with regard to ongoing investigations in other jurisdictions and will continue to do so in a transparent manner, as has been the practice throughout the equine DNA investigation.</p><p>  On 16 April results were published of the EU wide testing programme for equine DNA in beef products and phenylbutazone (bute) in horse carcases. The results showed that, across the EU, there were 4,144 tests under the equine DNA programme of which 193 were positive. In Ireland, all of the results of the 50 DNA tests on Irish beef products under the EU programme were negative. In addition there were 7,951 tests reported for equine DNA carried out by food business operators across the EU, of which 110 were positive. Under the Irish national DNA testing regime the results of 2185 DNA tests published by the FSAI to date showed only a small number of positives (32 representing 9 products), all of which were published previously and related to products withdrawn from the market.</p><p>  In relation to the EU programme for bute testing there were 16 positives from 3,115 tests. In Ireland of the 840 tests carried out on horse carcases for bute, only one was positive. The carcase concerned was destroyed and the case is under investigation.</p><p>  The EU Commission is also pursuing an action plan over the remainder of 2013 and into 2014 which includes specific actions and measures on the following basic elements: fighting food fraud, testing programmes, horse passports, official controls and origin labelling. It is important that controls in this area are strengthened on a pan European basis, not just at national level, and as stated in the report some of the measures envisaged will require legislative change at EU level.  The fact that our<i></i>control regime here uncovered this problem shows our commitment to maintaining the worldwide reputation of Irish food<i>. </i> Ireland will continue to show leadership on this issue, both nationally and in Europe.</p></reply>

In this context the new EU food information regulations Food Information for the Consumer (FIC) Regulation (1169/2011EC) were adopted by the Council of Health Ministers in December 2011. The Principle of the Food Labelling Directive is that the consumer shall rightly expect not to be misled by inaccurate labelling and must have confidence in knowing what they are eating.  The FIC extend explicit compulsory origin labelling requirements to meats other than beef, with the detailed rules to be adopted in implementing acts by 13 December 2013, following an impact assessment by the Commission. </p><p>  The FIC regulation also adopts rules on compulsory labelling where the origin or place of provenance of a food is given and where it is not the same as its primary ingredient.  Insofar as meat as an ingredient is concerned, these rules are subject to the adoption of implementing acts, which must take account of an impact assessment to be carried out by the Commission. As a result of the recent incidents of horsemeat being discovered in beef burgers and other beef products the Commission have now agreed to bring forward their work on this aspect of the regulation to September this year.</p><p><i>General Beef labelling Rules</i></p><p>  Country of origin labelling was initially implemented in respect of beef and certain beef products. In general, all fresh, frozen or minced beef marketed in the EU (with the exception of offal) is subject to a mandatory system of origin traceability and origin labelling. The purpose of these rules is to ensure that beef on sale can be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it came. </p><p>  There are two elements to the  beef labelling regime which apply to all parts of the supply chain: the compulsory system, which requires food business operators to label their beef products (unless cooked or processed) with certain prescribed information up to and including the point of sale to the consumer; and the voluntary system, which covers any other labelling claim that processors or retailers wish to make concerning the origin, characteristics or production methods of the beef they are supplying. The claims made on product labels, marketing material or point of sale notices must be clear and cannot be misleading. </p><p><i>Formed meat</i></p><p>  Also in the FIC regulation (Annex VI) in the case of meat products, meat preparations which may give the impression that they are made of a whole piece of meat, but actually consist of different pieces combined together by other ingredients, including food additives and food enzymes or by other means, shall bear the words &#8220;formed meat&#8221; on the label.</p></reply>

My Department maintains a permanent presence in approved slaughter plants. Regular visits are made to other Department approved meat plants.  The frequency of these inspections in plants other than slaughter plants, which focus primarily on food safety requirements, is determined by a risk assessment, as required under EU legislation, which is conducted for each plant. My Department has been able to reduce the number of inspections at non-slaughter meat plants, where there is no permanent supervisory presence, by moving to a more robust and rigorous targeted system of official controls, based on the risk assessments mentioned above. Official controls and inspections levels are monitored independently by the EU Food and Veterinary Office and by the FSAI under service contract. </p><p>  Food business operators in Ireland are responsible inter alia for carrying out checks to ensure that their ingredients come from approved plants. In meat plants that operate under the supervision of the Department, official controls are conducted on these checks to verify their effectiveness. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant. Labelling and documentary checks also form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. </p><p>  Under the Department&rsquo;s National Residue Programme, and including tests on bovine samples carried out by processors, up to 30,000 samples taken at farm and factory level and covering a wide range of food stuffs are tested annually. These tests relate to microbiological and chemical standards, their primary focus being on food safety and are fully in accordance with EU testing requirements.  In addition the Product Official Sampling and Testing (POST) programme is a microbiological testing programme on samples taken from Department approved ready-to-eat food, meat product, minced meat and meat preparation plants i.e. added value plants. This is part of the official verification of food safety controls in the plants concerned as provided for in Regulations (EC) 852/2004, 854/2004 and 2073/2005. A total of 1,600 samples are taken annually and the sampling and testing is risk based.</p><p>  Compliance with existing food safety and food hygiene requirements was not an issue in relation to the mislabelling of meat products uncovered by the recent FSAI survey. It is clear however that the focus of checks henceforth will also need to include food authenticity. The ongoing national programme and recent EU wide programme of DNA testing provides further reassurance to Irish consumers and consumers of Irish food abroad about the authenticity of ingredients in our beef based products</p></reply>

The publication also contains important up to date scientific advice on the state of fisheries resources which informs fishing opportunities for the following year. The Stock Book contains impartial scientific advice developed by the Marine Institute working with other international scientists and is developed using the latest available research, assessments and advice on the fisheries resource. The Stock Book is available to download electronically on the Marine Institute's web site at www.marine.ie. The information provided helps to form the policy and positions adopted when negotiating annual fishing opportunities each December.</p><p>  Ireland manages and enforces its Fishing quotas in accordance with the specifications of the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Our existing quota management system involves regular consultation with fishing industry interests and is designed to ensure the rational management of the available quotas, having regard to fishing patterns and market conditions, the best possible spread both between fishermen and also in terms of take up of quota during the year. </p><p>  The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority is the national body for the control and enforcement of sea fisheries law and works with the Irish Naval Service to control and enforce compliance with quota management arrangements and accurate reporting of landings. In common with procedures which operate here in Ireland individual EU Member States have similar responsibilities for the management of fisheries quotas. Inevitably the precise nature of these enforcement procedures may vary from one Member State to another. Any issues which may emerge in terms of management by individual member states are a matter for the EU Commission in terms of its responsibility to ensure the rules of the CFP are fully respected.</p><p>  The seas around Ireland (ICES Sub Areas VII and VI) are among the most productive and biologically sensitive areas in EU waters. Most of the fisheries resource within the area comes under the remit of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). In June 2012, the European Commission reported that fish stocks in European waters are improving (EC COM(2012) 278 final). The proportion of overfished stocks in the Atlantic declined from around 90% of all stocks between 2005-2009 to 47% in 2012. Several stocks in the west of Scotland, Irish Sea and Celtic sea have suffered from being over fished in the past and remain at relatively low levels (i.e. Cod in Divisions VIa and VIIa, Sole in Division VIIa, Whiting in Divisions VIa and VIIa).  </p><p>  Optimum levels of biological and economic productivity are in part management decisions, but though considerable progress has been made in recent years in terms of addressing sustainability issues it is clear that for many stocks there is still room for further improvement. </p><p>  Proposals for a significant reform of the existing CFP are currently under consideration and have been prioritised for action under the Irish EU Presidency. In particular, a range of innovative proposals for the conservation of fish stocks are under consideration such as the eliminating the practice of discards, achieving appropriate maximum long term sustainable yields (MSYs) and the introduction of effective fair transparent regionalisation mechanisms.  It is my belief that the introduction and implementation of these necessary and timely reforms (which must be adopted under co-decision jointly by the EU Fisheries Council and the EU Parliament) will support the ongoing development of a sustainable and thriving Irish and European fishing industry for the future. </p><p>  If as I hope, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament reach final agreement on these measures in the coming weeks, the reform process should help support the ongoing development of a sustainable and thriving Irish and European fishing industry into the future. </p></reply>

This survey since been extended to cover ash plantations established since 1992 as well as trees planted under AEOS and REPS. </p><p>In order to mitigate the risk of further infected ash stock entering the country and causing further outbreaks of the disease, the Department introduced legislation on 26<sup>th</sup> October 2012 to prohibit the importation of plant material from areas known to be infected with the disease.  On 6th November 2012, further legislation was introduced to limit the movement of ash wood into the country.</p><p>  Similar legislation has been introduced in Northern Ireland in order to implement an all-island approach to tackling the disease. </p><p>  My Department is liaising closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland and Great Britain to update the Pest Risk Analysis (PRA) for <i>Chalara fraxinea.</i>  This document will address the issue of wood as a possible pathway for the disease and examine the appropriateness of the current legislation. The PRA is currently undergoing external peer review. In addition, the two Departments are working to finalise an all-island Chalara Control Strategy.</p><p>  To date, 36 forestry plantations have tested positive for the disease at various locations across the country. The disease has also been confirmed at 15 horticultural nurseries, 8 roadside landscaping projects, 3 garden centres, 2 private gardens and 10 farms. All findings to date have been associated with imported plants.</p><p>  Arrangements have been put in place to remove all ash trees from sites where the disease has been confirmed and from associated sites where trees from the same infected batch has also been planted.  Approximately 535 hectares of ash woodlands have been identified for removal so far. </p><p>  A grant scheme has been introduced to support forest owners in the removal and destruction of infected, and potentially infected, trees and to replant with alternative species.</p><p>  In the coming weeks our efforts from an awareness point of view will be focussed on the relevant Divisions within my Department working closely with Teagasc to deliver a series of Chalara Information Meetings around the country.  The Department will send a text alert out to 90,000 farmers about the events.</p><p>  These 22 meetings will focus on the background to Ash Dieback, how to recognise the ash tree and ash leaves, how to recognise symptoms of ash dieback and to give farmers information on what steps they should take if they spot the disease as part of their young forestry plantation or AEOS planting.  This is all in an effort to seek out and eradicate the disease.</p></reply>

The EU legislation has been transposed into national legislation via S.I. No. 357 of 2011 - European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011 (as amended).  Regulation 504/2008, which came into effect on 1 July 2009, provides that if an equine animal has not been identified within six months of the date of its birth, or by the 31<sup>st</sup> of December in the year of its birth, whichever date occurs later, it cannot be admitted to the food chain.  It also provides that <i>all</i> equine animals registered after that date must be identified with a passport and a microchip. </p><p>  With regard to the issuing of passports, Regulation 504/2008 provides that, in the case of equidae which qualify for registration with a breed society, the passport must be issued by the relevant breed society. At present, 9 Passport Issuing organisations are approved to issue passports in Ireland.</p><p>  I made an announcement in March that I would like to see the establishment of a single Passport Issuing Organisation which would necessitate an amendment to EU legislation.  Subsequently, the EU Commission published an Action Plan for dealing with the fall-out from the horsemeat issue, indicating that it intended to submit a proposal to the Agriculture Council of Ministers and the European Parliament to amend existing legislation to provide that competent authorities take over responsibility for issuing passports. A formal Commission proposal is expected in the second half of 2013. My Department is awaiting these proposals. I will move to the final stage in the establishment of a single Passport Issuing Agency once EU legislation provides me with the overarching legal base to put this into effect. In the meantime, my Department is engaged in discussions with the PIOs with a view to enhancing the controls on passports at all stages of the process, including veterinary certification, quality of the paper used, security features etc.</p><p>  In line with a commitment I gave earlier in the year, my Department has taken significant steps to establish a central equine database on the Animal Identification and Movement [AIM] system.  Data for over 70% of equine animals registered with the Passport Issuing Organisations since 1 January 1980 were downloaded onto the central database in recent days. The central database will include information from records obtained at slaughter plants, knackeries, sales and live exports. The information on the central equine database will be used by my Department veterinary staff to supplement the current checks at slaughterhouses, in particular to check that any horses presented for slaughter have been correctly identified and are eligible for slaughter for the human food chain. </p><p>  In conclusion, I am satisfied that I have acted swiftly, as I promised to do, to deal with the issues arising from the equine DNA issue. </p></reply>

Funding of some &euro;53.498m is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.  These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>The savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in respect of 2013 amounted to &euro;5.393m.  Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department has tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding.</p><p>In 2013, youth funding amounting to almost &euro;1.5 million has been allocated to services in the Clondalkin and Lucan area.  This includes:</p><p><b>Youth Affairs Funding 2013</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Special Projects for Youth</th><th><div>&euro;363,219</div></th></tr><tr><td>Young Peoples Facilities Services Fund 1</td><td><div>&euro;479,965</div></td></tr><tr><td>Young Peoples Facilities Services Fund 2</td><td><div>&euro;666,373</div></td></tr><tr><td>Youth Information Centre</td><td><div>&euro;49,001</div></td></tr><tr><td>Traveller Development</td><td><div>&euro;33,545</div></td></tr></table></p><p>The funding allocated for the provision of youth services in Co. Dublin including the Lucan and Clondalkin areas is administered by Co. Dublin VEC on behalf of my Department.  I understand that Co. Dublin VEC has consulted with the projects in the Clondalkin/Lucan area and assured them of their continued support for the projects in managing the resources available in the most effective and efficient way.</p><p>In addition, Co. Dublin VEC disperses small grant support, funded by my Department, to local voluntary youth clubs in the Lucan &amp;amp; Clondalkin areas.  The Deputy should note that under the Comprehensive Review of expenditure, I have ensured that there has been no cut to the total national funding being provided by my Department to support the local voluntary youth club grant schemes as this funding plays an important role in supporting volunteer-led youth groups and in promoting and leveraging valuable voluntary activity in youth work.</p><p>My Department administers a range of measures to support vulnerable young people and it works closely with the youth sector, the Departments of Education and Skills, Health, Social Protection, Justice and Equality on shared policy objectives to promote healthy behaviours among young people, prevent early school leaving and to promote positive outcomes for them.    These measures include the <i>National Youth Health Programme</i> which provides a broad-based, flexible health promotion/education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings.  These youth services are often first point of contact for young people and can be important reference points for them in matters to do with care, health and welfare.  My Department provides funding, under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, for the Late Night League Programme which supports soccer leagues at various locations across Dublin to encourage young people to become involved in local activities thus reducing anti-social behaviour involving young people in selected areas.  The programme focuses on young people aged 13-21, promotes healthy lifestyles and takes place in disadvantaged areas during prime anti-social hours such as Friday nights.  The initiative uses football as a tool for social inclusion and learning and has proved to be very successful in communities.</p><p>The National Educational Welfare Board, under my Department, provides a range of measures to promote attendance at school and to support families where children are experiencing difficulty in attending school.  Over &euro;26m has been provided nationally in 2013 for the School Completion Programme, which is administered by my Department and operates as a key support within the Department of Education and Skills DEIS action plan.  Four local school completion projects are funded in the Clondalkin Lucan area with over &euro;1m being invested in 2013 to support students attending the 22 schools participating in these programmes.</p><p>My colleague, Minister Shatter, has overall responsibility in the area of crime and anti-social behaviour and his Department funds a range of youth services, in particular Garda Youth Diversion Projects and Young Person Probation Projects, in areas of greatest need with a specific youth crime intervention approach, targeting those involved in or at risk of offending behaviour through early intervention work.  These services are linking with other youth services provided by my Department to support effective crime prevention approaches.</p><p>The new youth policy framework which my Department is developing for completion later this year will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and it will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between government departments and the youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.</p></reply>

Funding of some &euro;53.498m is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.  These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>  The savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in respect of 2013 amounted to &euro;5.393m which equated to almost a 10% reduction on 2012 funding available for the provision of youth services.  Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department has tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any necessary reductions in funding. </p><p>  My Department has tried to be as equitable as possible in achieving these savings.  In considering how best to manage within the reduced budgets available, organisations are being asked to consider the scope for reducing administration costs and overheads, if this is at all possible, in order to maintain the front line youth services for young people.  I have met, and continue to meet with, many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to minimise the impact of these necessary savings in order to ensure that the provision of quality youth services to young people is sustained in these challenging times.</p><p>  A comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding has been commenced in my Department and it is anticipated that the findings of this report will inform the future development of  youth programmes and services. </p><p>  My Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year.  The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years. </p></reply>

The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children published its report in July 2012.</p><p>  As part of the Joint Committees consultation process a number of submissions were received.  Overall there was a welcome that the legislation would increase the focus on child protection.  The contributions in the main came from organisations already implementing Children First. </p><p>  Submissions were not all in agreement and many points emerging needed to be considered and reconciled.  This involves consideration of policy and operational issues, including those pertaining to childminders, as well as the best legal approach to achieving Children First objectives.  In this regard, officials within my Department have consulted with a number of organisations and individuals and I recently met with a number of key stakeholders to discuss the complex issues that have arisen.  I have also taken the opportunity to consult with a number of experts in relation to the development of the policy in this area.  These discussions will inform the preparation of enhanced policy proposals that is currently underway.  </p><p>  The framework is now focused on the safety and protection of children generally, the provision of safe services for children, co-operation amongst professionals and organisations where children are at risk of neglect and abuse and finally mandating key individuals to report child abuse known to them.  The latter objective is aimed at removing ambivalence, reluctance or refusal by people and organisations in positions of trust and authority to report child abuse and co-operate with the relevant authorities.  The Bill will create a range of responsibilities and duties on organisations and individuals and these will be detailed in the legislation.  The precise requirements on varying sectors, organisations and individual professions, including inter alia child care providers, is currently under consideration and part of an ongoing process.</p><p>  A further reason for reviewing the policy is to ensure that the related and relevant legislation will be compatible with and will complement the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act and the Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Crimes Against Children and Intellectually Disabled Persons) Act. </p><p>  It is my intention to submit further proposals to Government as soon as possible with a view to the drafting of the Children First Bill as a priority.</p></reply>

Through the framework of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016, the Department of Health is working in collaboration with the relevant statutory agencies to monitor the availability of controlled drugs, including prescription medicines, through illicit channels.</p><p>  Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription medicine except in accordance with a prescription, and the supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist.  A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioner's Customs Service and the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) have shared competency in relation to the prevention and detection at importation of illicit medicines. In addition the IMB and the Customs Service have a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) under which both organisations work closely to detain and prohibit prescription medicines purchased on-line from being imported.</p><p>  The IMB and the Customs Service deploy operational resources in a targeted and risk-based manner and as a result of specific intelligence. These approaches are reviewed and adjusted based on analysis and evaluation of national and international seizure trends, traffic frequency, routes and other risk indicators.</p><p>  Revenue's Customs Service also has Memoranda of Understanding with a number of express mail courier service providers and work very closely with these companies, the IMB and the Garda&iacute; to combat the importation of illicit medicines.</p><p>  In September 2012 the IMB, Revenue Customs Services and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na took part in an international week long operation &lsquo;Pangea V&rsquo; which led to the detention of capsules and tablets with an estimated value in excess of &euro;375,000.</p><p>  The IMB has published an on-line leaflet warning of the dangers from purchasing medicines online.</p><p>  The enforcement of the law relating to the sale of drugs, including prescription drugs, continues to be a priority in the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling the issue of drug misuse in this jurisdiction.</p><p>  My Department is reviewing the Misuse of Drugs Regulations with a view to introducing additional controls on certain prescription drugs being traded illicitly, for example benzodiazepine medicines. These additional controls include introducing import and export controls as well as an offence of possession, thereby assisting the law enforcement roles of Customs and of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

The aim of the SDU is to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  As set out in <i>Future Health</i>, a key goal is to deliver faster more equitable access to hospital services. The implementation of the SDU Performance Improvement Programme in Scheduled Care is a key driver of reducing waiting times for scheduled (elective) care in hospitals.</p><p>  The SDU Scheduled Care Team focused initially on  waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.  For 2012, a target was set that no adult should wait longer than 9 months for inpatient or daycase treatment. By the end of December 2012, the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months for inpatient and day case surgery nationally had fallen to 86. This was down from 3,706 in December 2011, representing a 98% decrease. I am determined that the progress made in 2012 be maintained and improved upon. For 2013, the target is that no adult should be waiting longer than 8 months for inpatient or daycase treatment. It is important to recognise that the progress made in 2012 does not mean the problem is solved, and 2013 will of course be extremely challenging. For example, winter pressures in Emergency Departments have impacted on scheduled care waiting times. However, in the coming months, as winter pressures ease, the SDU will work towards re-balancing scheduled care  to maintain the improvements seen in 2012 and to achieve the new 2013 target. Also in 2013, the SDU will focus on improving access to outpatient services and a maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment.. </p><p>In July 2011 I announced changes to the remit of the NTPF, namely that its role would be changed to support the mission of the SDU.  The NTPF is now fully aligned with the SDU and is targeting waiting lists strategically and assisting in the performance management of hospitals to reduce waiting times for patients. The NTPF capability is a core part of the SDU's performance improvement role in holding public hospitals to account. The NTPF future role is under consideration in the context of the structural reforms set out in<b><i></i></b><i>Future Health-A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 -2015</i><b><i>.</i></b></p></reply>

I met with the Irish Epilepsy Association in January and explained this position.</p><p>  It is also important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine.

Under UHI, everyone will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy. </p><p>The Department is currently preparing a <i>White Paper on Universal Health Insurance</i> which will provide further detail on the UHI model for Ireland in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of universal health insurance. Broadly, this involves the development of detailed policy proposals covering issues such as the design of the UHI model, the scope and composition of the UHI basket of services and funding and financial support mechanisms for UHI.  More detail in relation to the overall process for producing the White Paper, including the projects, studies and policy appraisals that need to be undertaken, is set out in the preliminary document on UHI,  <i>The Path to Universal Healthcare,</i>  published by the  Department in February 2013 and available on its website, www.doh.gov.ie.  </p><p>A special UHI Design Team has recently been set up to oversee and support the work involved in the design of the UHI model and the preparation of the <i>White Paper on Universal Health Insurance.</i>  The membership of the UHI Design Team is as follows:</p><p>- Laura McGarrigle, Principal Officer, Universal Health Insurance Unit, Department of Health (Chair);</p><p>- Emer Brady, Assistant Principal Officer, Universal Health Insurance Unit, Department of Health;</p><p>- Aine Carroll, National Director for Clinical Strategy and Programmes, Health Service Executive;</p><p>- Matt Collins, Principal Officer, Eligibility Unit, Department of Health;</p><p>- Tom Heffernan, Principal Officer, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform;</p><p>- Jean Long, Head of Evidence Generation and Knowledge Brokering Unit, Health Research Board; </p><p>- Hugh Magee, Senior Statistician and Principal Officer, Information Unit, Department of Health;</p><p>- Mark Moran, Former CEO of the Mater Private Hospital and former Chairman of the DoH/ HSE Working Group on Reference Pricing and Generic Substitution;</p><p>- Deirdre Mulholland, Office of the Chief Medical Officer, Department of Health;</p><p>- Robert Murphy, Assistant Principal Officer, Universal Health Insurance Unit, Department of Health;</p><p>- Dermot Ryan, Principal Officer, Private Health Insurance Unit, Department of Health;</p><p>- David Smith, Principal Officer, Finance Unit, Department of Health, and</p><p>- Valerie Walshe, Economist, Health Service Executive.</p><p>  The work involved in UHI design is both complex and technical and demands a wide-range of legal and financial expertise. Accordingly, it is envisaged that the Design Team will be supported by specialised expertise at appropriate junctures. To this end, the Department has recently engaged legal expertise to support deliberations in relation to the design of the UHI model. </p><p>  Work on the development of detailed policy proposals is proceeding with a view to publishing the White Paper as early as possible. </p></reply>

This involves changing from the current inefficient system of block grant budgets to a new approach where hospitals are paid for the actual level of activity they undertake.  The new approach will be facilitated through the introduction of a prospective case-based payment system using Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) and effectively means that hospitals will be funded on the basis of the quantity and quality of the services they deliver to patients and not the size of last year&rsquo;s budget.</p><p>  It is proposed that &lsquo;Money Follows the Patient&rsquo; will begin in shadow form in 2013.  Under shadow funding, hospitals will continue to receive their existing base budget under a vote cashing system.  However, a process will be put in place to compare on a systematic basis, (i) actual hospital activity against pre-agreed baseline activity targets and (ii) hospital expenditure against pre-agreed DRG prices.  In this way funding variances and potential impacts will be highlighted although no changes would be made to a hospital&rsquo;s budget on foot of the exercise.  It is my intention to announce the composition of the Hospital Groups shortly, subject to Government approval, and it is proposed that shadow funding will be rolled out to the Hub hospital of each Group.  This approach allows Hospital Groups time to develop while still facilitating shared learning across the entire Group.  It also enables the health system to leverage maximum efficiencies and economies of scale when investing in necessary resources, thereby reinforcing the optimally efficient service delivery model envisaged in the creation of Hospital Groups.  </p><p>  It is proposed that the system will then move from shadow funding to full phased implementation of &lsquo;Money Follows the Patient&rsquo; from 1 January 2014, subject to fully developed hospital groups and central financial management systems being in place. </p></reply>

Where blood tests form part of the investigation and necessary treatment of patients' symptoms or conditions, these should be provided free of charge to medical card and GP visit card holders.  The HSE also points out that, in many GP surgeries, it is the practice nurse who takes blood samples.  The HSE significantly subsidises the cost of employing practice nurses.  The GMS contract does not make provision for charging medical card or GP visit card patients an administrative fee for phlebotomy services.  The HSE is continuing to advise eligible patients who believe they have been inappropriately charged by a GP for routine phlebotomy services to seek a refund from the GP in question.  It is appreciated that because of the nature of the GP-patient relationship, it may be difficult for patients to make such complaints.  Where public representatives are made aware of GPs charging GMS patients in error, they may wish to notify the HSE directly.</p></reply>

The principles behind it will apply to all smaller hospitals, regardless of whether they are specifically referenced.  In developing the framework, the Government is clear that there is an important future role for smaller hospitals, in which they will provide services for more patients, not fewer; that no acute hospital will close; and that safety issues in all acute hospitals, large or small, must be fully addressed by providing the right type of service for the right patient in the right setting.  This framework demonstrates clearly that the future of smaller hospitals is secure.  It outlines the need for smaller hospitals and larger hospitals to operate together.  Therefore, it is intrinsically linked to the ongoing work regarding the development of hospital groups. </p><p>  We know that the traditional practice of providing as many services as possible in every hospital is neither sustainable nor safe.  The formation of Irish acute hospitals into a small number of groups, each with its own governance and management, will provide an optimum opportunity for hospital services to be configured to deliver high-quality, safe patient care in a cost-effective manner.  It was with this in mind that I appointed Professor John Higgins in June of last year to chair a strategic board on the establishment of hospital groups.  I have received Professor Higgins's report, which is based on a comprehensive consultation process and contains almost 60 recommendations on the formation, management and governance of hospital groups, all of which are strongly endorsed by the strategic board.  </p><p>  I will shortly submit this report to the Government to consider and decide on the final formation of each hospital group.  I appreciate that this report and the related Government decision are anxiously awaited.  As this is the most radical and most fundamental modernisation of our health system infrastructure since the State's foundation, I take very seriously my obligation to consider the report closely and to assure myself and my Cabinet colleagues that it provides a robust basis to enable timely access to a high-quality and sustainable hospital service for those who need it.  The Government will decide on the initial make-up of hospital groups which will be established on an administrative basis, pending the legislation required to set up hospital trusts by 2015.  Before those trusts are established, the composition and functioning of the groups will be reviewed.  If changes prove necessary, they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed.  It is my intention to bring both of these reports to the Government in the near future for approval and to publish them shortly thereafter.</p></reply>
