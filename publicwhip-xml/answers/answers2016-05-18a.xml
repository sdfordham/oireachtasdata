As is the case when any such information comes to their attention, it is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to examine this information.</p>  <p>  It would be a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to decide whether Irish tax has been avoided and, if so, whether the arrangements should be challenged either under specific sections in the tax code or by using the general anti-avoidance legislation.  If it is found that the Irish tax base has been eroded, then action would be taken as appropriate.  The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has assured me that Revenue will make the fullest possible use of any relevant information in pursuing any cases where it appears that tax liabilites have not been addressed.  I have written to the Chairman assuring him of my support for any legislative measures that may be needed to tackle any issues which are identified by this work.</p>  <p>  International tax evasion is a worldwide problem which can only be tackled effectively when countries work together.  Ireland continues to support the OECD "Base Erosion and Profit Shifting" process and supports the work at EU level to increase fiscal transparency through initiatives like Country by Country Reporting to tax authorities.  In this regard, I am delighted that Ireland was one of the first countries to legislate for Country by Country reporting in the most recent Finance Act.</p>  <p>  The Panama Papers has also led to an increased focus on the benefical ownership of companies.  Ireland, along with the majority of EU Member States, has committed to a pilot project for the automatic exchange of information on the ultimate beneficial owners of companies.  The G20 has also mandated the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes to make initial proposals by October 2016 on ways to improve the availability, and exchange, of information about the beneficial ownership of entities.  As a member of the Global Forum, Ireland will be actively involved in this work. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also working on transposing the latest Anti-Money Laundering Directive which includes a requirement for Member States to establish a register of beneficial owners.  The Directive is currently being transposed by the Department of Justice and Equality with the assistance of my Department. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-18a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051800060#WRA01300"><p>I would clarify, for the Deputy, that my statement at the Housing and Homelessness Committee, was stating the fact that such sales, regardless of the ultimate purchaser, are conducted on the open market, thus allowing all interested parties to bid. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that it is a decision for NAMA, in line with its independent statutory commercial mandate, to determine the value maximising sales strategy for each of its assets.  It is also NAMA's established policy to sell assets, be they individual units or property portfolios, on the open market.  So, while a transaction such as the one referred to by the Deputy would, naturally, attract investors who wish to purchase a certain class of asset, this does not impact the capacity for similar market participants to bid for those assets.</p>  <p>  I would also wish to refer the Deputy to the NAMA Chairman and CEO's appearance at the Housing and Homelessness Committee on 11th May 2016. NAMA's opening statements and presentation to the Committee are available on NAMA's website.  During his opening statement, the NAMA Chairman pointed out that 88% (or 11,219) of the 12,781 residential property units sold from NAMA's portfolio were sold on the open market by NAMA debtors and receivers in individual sales transactions to individual house buyers. </p>  <p>  The relatively small number of remaining units, 1,562 units, (12% of the total) were sold on the open market by NAMA debtors and receivers as part of larger group or portfolio sales.  The properties that were sold in groups or portfolios were typically already tenanted and vacant possession was not sought prior to the sale. </p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA that the property referenced by the Deputy is in keeping with this trend as it was fully occupied by rental tenants at the time of the sale and vacant possession of the units was not sought.  It is not surprising that the sale of these rental units would be attractive to institutional landlords rather than aspiring owner occupiers.  Portfolios like this are generally acquired by investors, such as REITs, who are seeking long-term stable rental income rather than seeking to sell the properties in the short-term.  Existing tenancy arrangements tend not to be impacted by such sales.  Contrary to the Deputy's contention, a sale of these units on an individual basis to owner occupiers could be more likely to lead to the displacement of existing tenants.</p>  <p>  With this in mind, I am firmly of the belief that REITs participation in Irish market is a positive step for many reasons.  This is why I, through the Finance Act 2013, established the REIT framework which allows for modern collective investment ownership structure of real estate that provides benefits to both small and large real estate investors, provides benefits to the Irish property market and to the broader economy.</p>  <p>  In particular, REITs support the rental sector through the professional management of both commercial and residential property.  The long term return expectations of REIT investment capital ensures a proper focus on investment, enhancement, maintenance and efficiency of rental properties.  Over the long term investment capital from REITs is expected to provide a greater and much improved stock of professionally managed rental accommodation in the Irish market ultimately contributing to greater security of supply and tenure for tenants.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-18a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051800060#WRA01500"><p>In general, recent indicators have been very positive, indicating the economic recovery is strengthening in a sustainable manner.  In the Stability Programme Update, published at the end of April, my Department forecast that the economy would grow by 4.9 per cent in 2016, by 3.9 per cent in 2017, and by 3.25 per cent on average over the remainder of the forecast horizon out to 2021. </p>  <p>  Importantly, domestic demand made a strong positive contribution to growth in 2015 with consumption increasing by 3.5 per cent in 2015 and investment up by 28 per cent.  This is crucial as domestic sectors are both jobs-rich and tax-rich.  The external sector is also showing continuing signs of growth, with exports increasing by 13.8 per cent in 2015.</p>  <p>  The economic recovery is also clearly evident in the labour market where we have now had thirteen successive quarters of employment growth.  Last year, employment increased by 2.6 per cent, equivalent to 50,000 new jobs.  The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 8.4 per cent in April, down from almost 10 per cent a year earlier.  This is the lowest rate of unemployment since December 2008.</p>  <p>  However, there are several sources of uncertainty. Weaker than expected trading partner growth would negatively impact on Irish growth through reduced exports.  Growth in Emerging Market Economies disappointed in 2015, and while Ireland's direct trade exposure remains relatively small, we would be exposed to a more generalised slowdown in the world economy. Brexit is another downside risk facing the Irish economy with Ireland potentially more exposed than most to a UK exit. </p>  <p>  Domestically, the high level of private debt, while falling, remains a concern, and any deterioration in the external environment could prompt households and firms to raise the pace of deleveraging, with adverse implications for domestic demand. </p>  <p>  This uncertainty highlights the importance of prudent management of the public finances and of competitiveness-oriented policies that would help the Irish economy to weather any global economic downturn that may emerge.</p>  <p>  In summary, I am confident that significant economic progress can be made in the years ahead.  However, this is critically contingent upon implementing appropriate polices and that is what the Government intends to do. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-18a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051800060#WRA01700"><p>The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that each borrower who is experiencing genuine difficulty in meeting the repayments on a mortgage secured on a primary home is treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner by lenders.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and lenders to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  </p>  <p>  The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing, or in, arrears on a mortgage which is secured on a primary residence.  Furthermore, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 now provides for the regulation of credit servicing firms and accordingly the CCMA also applies to such firms who are servicing primary home mortgages held by non-regulated entities.  An addendum to the CCMA was published during 2015 to reflect this fact. </p>  <p>  The CCMA was issued by the Central Bank pursuant to the provisions of Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 and regulated entities are required to comply with the provisions of the Code as a matter of law.  The CCMA is therefore issued under statute and, as stated by the Supreme Court, it forms part of the law.  The Central Bank has the power to administer sanctions for a contravention of this Code, under Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942. </p>  <p>  As recognised by the Programme for Government it is important to keep the provisions of the Code, and indeed the wider statutory framework for the protection of consumers of financial services, under review to ensure they remain appropriate to the evolving position of the mortgage market.  As the Deputy is aware the Code has already been reviewed and updated over time and the Government will continue to liaise and work with the Central Bank to ensure that the CCMA continues to be monitored and further updated as necessary in a way that is fair to the legitimate interests of debtors and creditors and, taking account also of appropriate wider public policy considerations, that sustainable solutions will be available to address genuine mortgage difficulty.</p></reply>

The Act modified the qualifying criteria to include properties where:</p>  <p>  1. a certificate of damage has been completed by a competent person as set down in the relevant Regulations or,</p>  <p>  2. the property has been accepted into the pyrite remediation scheme operated by the Pyrite Resolution Board or,</p>  <p>  3. an insurance company has remediated the property or provided sufficient funds to carry out the remediation or,</p>  <p>  4. the person who built the property has remediated it or provided sufficient funds to carry put the remediation.</p>  <p>  The relaxation of the certification requirement was one of the recommendations made by Dr. Don Thornhill in his review of the operation of the Local Property Tax on behalf of the Government in 2015.  The changes are significant in that where a property has been included in the pyrite remediation scheme by the Pyrite Resolution Board (PRB) without testing, or a property has been remediated by a guarantee company or by a builder or developer or where a party is compensated in lieu of remediation, without testing, Revenue will now accept confirmation of remediation or compensation from the either the PRB or the relevant party for the purposes of exemption without testing or NSAI certification. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that since the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 changed the LPT exemption criteria in respect of properties with significant pyritic damage, in excess of 1,300 cases have been identified that may now qualify for the relief.</p>  <p>  Of these, 104 properties have already received the exemption while more than 500 property owners have been contacted by Revenue and are in the process of providing the necessary supporting documentation.  Revenue expects to complete the reviews of the remaining 700 properties in the coming weeks and will make direct contact with property owners as required.</p></reply>

These measures include: </p>  <p>  - the establishment of the Commission on Credit Unions;- the publication of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012;- the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board   ReBo;- the establishment of a stabilisation levy to support credit unions that are undercapitalised but are otherwise viable;- the availability of &euro;250 million for voluntary restructuring of credit unions facilitated by ReBo; and- the availability of &euro;250 million for resolution purposes.</p>  <p>  These measures stemmed from recommendations made by the Commission on Credit Unions in its final Report and have been implemented over the last five years to acknowledge the increasing role for a strengthened and revitalised credit union sector, thus putting credit unions in a position to play an increasing role in the retail financial landscape of the future in this country.</p>  <p>  Following on from this, in December 2015  I invited the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) to carry out a review of the Implementation of the Recommendations set out in the Report of the Commission on Credit Unions. </p>  <p>  Work on the review has commenced.  I have been informed that as part of the review the CUAC has had discussions with all credit union stakeholders to date.  Those discussions will inform the final report, the findings of which, including any recommendations is expected to  be presented to me as Minister for Finance by 30 June 2016 for publication thereafter.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in this country.  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is determined to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.</p></reply>

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which comes into operation on 1 July 2016.</p>  <p>  The Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears provides protections for borrowers who endeavour to meet their commitments in relation to their mortgages and the 2015 Act ensures that these protections apply when a loan has been sold. </p>  <p>  Our commitment on this issue is underlined by the Programme for a Partnership Government provides that "To reflect the growing public concern regarding credit servicing firms and other property firms we will ask the Central Bank and the Oireachtas Committee on Housing to examine the legislation introduced last year that ensured that borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale.  We will provide greater protection for mortgage holders and tenants and SMEs whose loans have been transferred to non-regulated entities ( vulture funds )."  This is a Year 1 Action in the programme.  The Government is very conscious of the difficulties faced by borrowers and the efforts that they are making to meet their commitments.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-18a.36.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051800060#WRA02500"><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Programme for Government makes it clear that it is not ethically acceptable for Irish banks to charge excessive interest rates on standard variable rate customers.  The Government has committed to take all necessary action to tackle high variable interest rates; including through establishing a new code of conduct for switching mortgage provider, administered by the Central Bank and the development of a new, easy-to-use standardised and dedicated switching form.  We will also request the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to work with the Central Bank to set out the options for the Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and improve the degree of competition and consumer protection.  These are Year 1 Actions in the programme. </p>  <p>  I do accept that variable rates remain above Euro area norms and I think that it clear that there is broad agreement in this House that we would like to see rates reduced. Central Bank research on the influences on standard Variable Mortgage Pricing in Ireland published last year identified three main reasons for higher rates in Ireland.  First, the pricing of loans needs to reflect credit risks.  In Ireland these risks are elevated due to high levels of non-performing loans and the lengthy and uncertain process around collateral recovery.  Second, competition is weak.  This is not unrelated to credit risks since high credit risk deters new players from entering the market.  Third, bank profitability is still constrained by legacy issues.  Profitability is essential to ensure banks build up adequate capital buffers to meet increasing regulatory requirements and to withstand future adverse shocks.</p>  <p>  I think that it is fair to say that there have been considerable movements in the mortgage offerings of the Irish banks in the last twelve months since my meetings with the banks.  As recently as last week, two banks made additional reductions to their mortgage offerings.  There has also been media speculation on the entry of another new mortgage provider into the market and the additional competition should help to put further pressure on the existing banks to reduce their rates.  This is a vivid illustration of the effectiveness of the Government's policy, that competition is the best way to put pressure on the banks to reduce rates.</p></reply>

Within the expenditure benchmark pillar of the fiscal rules, capital investment in respect of capital formation is granted favourable treatment.  Thanks to capital smoothing, only one quarter of the increase in public capital formation investment must be funded in the first year from within the fiscal space permitted by the expenditure banchmark.  This provision means capital spending for housing and other purposes can be leveraged within the EU rules. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, Ireland's medium-term budgetary objective or MTO was loosened in the Stability Programme Update to 0.5% of GDP in structural terms.  As I have already communicated, this loosening will result in an additional &euro;1&frac12; billion in fiscal space becoming available under the EU rules once the MTO is reached.  Taking account of this development and capital smoothing, we will, as set out in the Programme for Government, be bringing forward proposals for an additional cumulative &euro;4 billion in Exchequer capital in the context of the mid-term capital review in 2017. </p>  <p>  Having said that the Government is very conscious of the housing crisis and in this context Ireland's Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) have established a joint venture fund Activate Capital which will invest in the development and construction of housing.  The venture will provide approximately &euro;500 million in financing for the housing sector.   By recycling this funding, the joint venture aims to develop 11,000 units over the medium term.</p>  <p>  Similarly NAMA has stated that in accordance with its independent commercial mandate it will target the delivery of 20,000 additional residential units before the end of 2020. 90% of these residential units will be in the greater Dublin Area, where the demand for housing is greatest. Approximately 75% of these units will be houses, primarily starter homes.  The overall cost of the programme will be approximately &euro;4.5 Billion. NAMA will utilise its own cash resources to fund this necessary expenditure.</p>  <p>  The Government has also outlined its commitment in the Programme for Government to accelerate the delivery of the &euro;3.8 billion Social Housing Strategy.  There will be a mid-term review of the Capital Programme in mid-2017 where the allocation of additional exchequer capital investment to priorities will be determined.  In addition, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will set out the new Government Action Plan for Housing within the first 100 days. Once complete the action plan will be subject to target actions and specific deadlines. </p>  <p>  In summary, I wish to assure the Deputy that ending the Housing shortage and Homelessness is a priority for this Government.</p></reply>

I also had an opportunity to discuss the situation in broad terms with the person concerned as one of my  constituents in 2015.  As far as I am aware, it concerns complex legal issues around a long-running dispute in relation to a probate matter.  I understand that these are matters which have also given rise to allegations of misconduct by solicitors that have been the subject of complaints by the person concerned to the Law Society. Moreover, and while it is desirable that such situations be resolved effectively, I also have to respect the fact that any unresolved matters arising could give rise to future legal proceedings. </p>  <p>  Under current law, and as previously conveyed to the person concerned, including in an e-mail reply from my Private Secretary in April 2014, it is not open to me as Minister, nor indeed to any member of the Government, to determine or to otherwise intervene in disputes or difficulties between practising solicitors and their clients or in relation to matters which are properly for determination by the Courts.  Rather, these are matters to be dealt with by the designated statutory bodies or, as may be the case, through the courts.  Pending the planned commencement this Autumn of the relevant provisions of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, it remains a matter of law that the Law Society of Ireland, the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal (to which an aggrieved client may complain directly) and the Office of the Independent Adjudicator remain the statutory bodies charged with investigating or resolving complaints against solicitors under the Solicitors Acts. </p>  <p>  In addition to the remedies available under the current statutory complaints framework that I have just outlined, aggrieved clients of solicitors may also choose to seek redress through the courts.  As with any court proceedings, it would be considered prudent that persons considering taking such legal action seek independent legal advice on the strength or otherwise of their case and its possible cost implications.  It will then be a matter for the aggrieved client concerned to decide which course of action might be best suited to their particular case. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also wish to be aware that, under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, preparations are already underway for the establishment of the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority which will have responsibility for the oversight of both solicitors and barristers.  There will be a new framework to deal with complaints about alleged professional misconduct independent of both the Law Society and the Bar Council that will apply from the date of its commencement.  This, in turn, will be backed up by the establishment of a new and independent Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal dealing with both legal professions. Members of the public who wish to make complaints will, therefore, no longer do so through the Law Society or the Bar Council as they do at present, but through the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  This and other reforms being made under the 2015 Act will continue to be rolled out on a phased basis between now and the end of this year.</p></reply>

The Early Childhood Care and Education Programme, which is operated by my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Dr. Katherine Zappone T.D., provides a free pre-school programme for children.  This programme was extended in Budget 2016 to apply to children from the age of 3.  In addition to the learning and development opportunities for the children, this scheme also reduces childcare costs for parents, facilitating greater workforce participation.</p>  <p>  In the Programme for a Partnership Government there are a number of measures aimed to support parents and children.  These include supporting the introduction of a robust model for subsidised high quality childcare for children aged 9-36 months in order for children and families to truly reap the benefits of greater investment, in line with the OECD recommendation that the best way to achieve affordability and quality at the same time is through subsidised childcare places.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to developing targeted supports to reduce childcare costs, broaden parental choice and increase supports for stay at home parents.</p></reply>

The Government has committed to take all necessary action to tackle high variable interest rates; including through establishing a new code of conduct for switching mortgage provider, administered by the Central Bank and the development of a new, easy-to-use standardised and dedicated switching form.  We will also request the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to work with the Central Bank to set out the options for the Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and improve the degree of competition and consumer protection.  These are Year 1 Actions in the programme. </p>  <p>  I do accept that variable mortgage rates remain above Euro area norms and I think that it clear that there is broad agreement in this House that we would like to see these rates reduced.  Central Bank research on the influences on Standard Variable Mortgage Pricing in Ireland published last year identified three main reasons for higher rates in Ireland.  First, the pricing of loans needs to reflect credit risks.  In Ireland these risks are elevated due to high levels of non-performing loans and the lengthy and uncertain process around collateral recovery.  Second, competition is weak.  This is not unrelated to credit risks since high credit risk deters new players from entering the market.  Third, bank profitability is still constrained by legacy issues. Profitability is essential to ensure banks build up adequate capital buffers to meet increasing regulatory requirements and to withstand future adverse shocks.</p>  <p>  I think that it is fair to say that there have been considerable movements in the mortgage offerings of the Irish banks in the last twelve months since my meetings with the banks.  As recently as last week, two banks made additional reductions to their mortgage offerings.  There has also been media speculation on the entry of another new mortgage provider into the market and the additional competition should help to put further pressure on the existing banks to reduce their rates.  This is a vivid illustration of the effectiveness of the Government's policy, that competition is the best way to put pressure on the banks to reduce rates.</p>  <p>   In relation to other charges, under Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 (as amended), credit institutions must submit a notification to the Central Bank for approval if they wish to introduce any new customer charge or increase any existing customer charge, for certain services.  A notification made under Section 149 may include multiple charges and, having considered and robustly challenged the proposed charge(s) under the assessment criteria, the proposed charges may be rejected, approved at lower levels than requested by the credit institution or approved in full.  Credit institutions are legally bound to comply with Letters of Direction, which set out the maximum amount the credit institution is allowed to charge for the relevant service.  Credit institutions are free to impose any pricing differentials for the service up to the permitted maximum and are free to waive fees at their discretion.</p>  <p>  My Department published a report on the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges in December 2013.  This contains a detailed description of the process by which the Central Bank makes decisions on whether or not to approve proposed charges.

Among the key findings of the review was that while fee and commission income has become a more important source of income to the banks in recent years, net fee and commission income in Irish banks was well below the average of their European peers.</p></reply>

This new marked mineral oil licensing requirement was introduced in response to the threat posed to the exchequer and to legitimate business by fuel laundering and is part of a range of supply-chain control measures designed to address this problem.  At the time of their introduction there was extensive consultation with industry representatives and they remain very supportive of the measures implemented to tackle fraud and protect compliant business from unfair competition from illicit operators.

Where such an individual is under the age of 75 at the time of exercising this option and does not meet the condition of having a minimum guaranteed pension income for life of &euro;12,700 per annum, he or she is required to  set aside  an amount of &euro;63,500 (or the remainder of the pension fund if less than &euro;63,500 after taking a retirement lump sum).  These funds are set aside by investing in an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF) or by the purchase of an annuity.</p>  <p>  An AMRF owner has the option of using some, or all, of the funds in AMRF to purchase an annuity at any time prior to attaining the age of 75.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual, without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life, has a  nest-egg  to provide for the latter years of his or her retirement.</p>  <p>  With effect from 2015, an AMRF owner may draw down up to 4% of the value of the fund assets on one occasion annually until he or she either meets the guaranteed pension income requirement or attains the age of 75, at which point, the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF and any remaining funds can be drawn down at the beneficial owner s discretion. </p>  <p>  In general, drawdowns from AMRFs (and ARFs) are subject to income tax, PRSI (up to age 66) and USC.</p>  <p>  The 4% annual draw down arrangement was introduced by Finance Act 2014 and replaced the facility that existed previously, whereby an AMRF owner could draw down the accrued income and gains of the AMRF (subject to tax) as and when they wished.  This change was prompted by a concern to give all AMRF owners access to a more certain level of annual income from their AMRF, rather than the uncertainty that dependence on investment performance had given rise to heretofore.  This is particularly important for those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under the  trivial pension  rules, full commutation of a pension under an occupational pension scheme may take place if the aggregate benefits payable to an employee under the scheme (and any other scheme linked to the same employment) do not exceed the value of a pension of &euro;330 per annum.  This treatment is also available to holders of small retirement annuity contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs). </p>  <p>  I am further advised that, as an alternative to the above, where, after taking the retirement lump sum, the remaining fund available to an individual for the provision of pension benefits is less than &euro;20,000, the Commissioners have no objection to the payment of a once-off pension.  The amount of retirement benefits from all sources must be taken into account for the purposes of calculating the &euro;20,000 limit, and this option applies equally to the holders of RACs and PRSAs. </p>  <p>  In effect, this means that those with relatively small pension pots at retirement who do not satisfy the guaranteed pension income condition required for ARF access, are not required to invest the pension pot in an AMRF or purchase an annuity with it, but can instead draw it down in full, subject to appropriate tax.   </p></reply>

My Department expects the economy to grow by 4.9 per cent this year, by 3.9 per cent next year and by 3.25 per cent on average over the remainder of the forecast horizon out to 2021.</p>  <p>  The SPU also notes that, while the outlook for the next 18 months is relatively benign, internationally the level of uncertainty is higher than at any stage since the height of the financial crisis</p>  <p>  There is, in particular, heightened uncertainty regarding the near-term prospects for many Emerging Market Economies (EMEs), including China. EMEs have been an important growth engine in recent years, and while Ireland's direct trade exposure remains relatively small, the Irish economy would be exposed to a more generalised slowdown in the world economy.</p>  <p>  A more disruptive international environment could generate significant headwinds for the Irish economy.  This underlines the need to maintain prudent fiscal policies, keep expenditure under control, remain competitive and it is why I have consistently reiterated my commitment to Ireland's corporate tax regime.</p>  <p>  On the upcoming UK referendum on EU membership, as has been clearly articulated, the UK's continued membership of the Union is a matter of strategic importance for the Government. In this regard, Government Departments, including my own, have been working on this matter for some time.  Under the Department of Finance/Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) research programme agreement, my Department commissioned research to be undertaken on scoping the potential economic implications on Ireland of a change in the EU/UK relationship.  The research was published on 5 November 2015 and is an important contribution to understanding the potential issues arising. My Department, and other Government Departments, are continuing our assessment of all the issues involved in protecting Ireland's interests and we are continuing to explore the potential risks and to plan accordingly in the period up to 23 June 2016.</p></reply>

Changes since then have given people more choices for what to do with their pension savings.  This is called the flexible options at retirement regime.  These choices include taking a cash payment, subject to income tax, investing in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or investing in an approved minimum retirement fund (AMRF).</p>  <p>  Until he or she is 75, a person can only take the whole amount of their savings as cash or put it in an ARF if he or she has a guaranteed pension income of &euro;12,700 or more.  If these conditions are not met then he or she can buy an annuity or put a certain amount of the funds, called the "set aside" amount into an AMRF.  The maximum "set-aside" is &euro;63,500 or the remaining value of the pension funds, after taking the tax-free retirement lump sum, if less than &euro;63,500.</p>  <p>  The funds in an AMRF can be used at any time, in full or in part, to buy an annuity.  This includes the option to buy an annuity which is large enough to give the owner a guaranteed income of more than &euro;12,700.  If the owner does this he or she will then have access to the rest of the funds, as their AMRF then converts into and ARF with discretionary access to the funds, subject to tax at their marginal rate.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that a person without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension "safety net" to provide for the latter years of his or her retirement.  However, every year to age 75, the owner of an AMRF can access 4% of the funds in the AMRF.</p>  <p>  If an individual meets the requirements to be able to access the full amount of the funds in an AMRF and chooses to do so then it is taxable in the hands of the recipient as income for the tax year in which it is paid.</p>  <p>  I do not currently have any plans to remove the requirements which apply before a person can have increased access to the funds in an AMRF or transfer them to an ARF.  These provisions, along with other taxation measures, are however kept under review.</p></reply>

Ireland's recovery is now firmly established and the Irish economy is growing at the fastest rate in Europe - with growth of 7.8 per cent recorded in 2015.  In the Stability Programme Update or SPU, published at the end of April, my Department forecast that the economy would grow by 4.9 per cent in 2016, by 3.9 per cent in 2017, and by 3.25 per cent on average over the remainder of the forecast horizon out to 2021.</p>  <p>  Crucially, domestic demand made a strong positive contribution to growth in 2015 with consumption increasing by 3.5 per cent in 2015 and investment up by 28 per cent.  This is important as domestic sectors are both jobs-rich and tax-rich.  The external sector is also showing continuing signs of growth, with exports increasing by 13.8 per cent in 2015.  The competitiveness gains achieved since 2008 have been the result of productivity improvements and wage and price moderation.  It is important that these gains are maintained through active policy management, to support continued growth through both foreign direct and indigenous investment.</p>  <p>  The recovery is most clearly evident in the labour market where we have now seen thirteen successive quarters of employment growth. Employment grew by 2.6 per cent in 2015, equivalent to 50,000 new jobs.  The monthly unemployment rate fell to 8.4 per cent in April, down from almost 10 per cent a year earlier.  The unemployment rate is now at the lowest level since 2008.</p>  <p>  The positive outlook for Ireland's economic prospects is shared by the 3 major credit ratings agencies.  Following Moody's upgrade to an A rating, all 3 have now given an A-Grade to Ireland's sovereign debt.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the SPU highlights that there are several sources of uncertainty at present.  In particular, a more disruptive international environment could generate significant headwinds for the Irish economy. </p>  <p>  This uncertainty highlights the importance of prudent management of the public finances and of competitiveness-oriented policies that would help the Irish economy to weather any global economic downturn that may emerge.</p>  <p>  In summary, subject to a supportive external environment, I am confident that the positive economic performance will be maintained over the medium term.  However, this is critically contingent upon implementing appropriate polices.  That is what the Government intends to do. </p></reply>

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which comes into operation on 1 July 2016.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.  In addition to compliance with Central Bank codes of conduct, credit servicing firms will have to demonstrate to the Central Bank that they have robust governance and adequate resources to ensure compliance, agreements with loan owners that enable the credit servicing firm to fully comply with its obligations under Irish financial services legislation and adequate and effective control of loan servicing in the State to enable Central Bank oversight. </p></reply>

From my perspective, a number of measures have been implemented to help address the underlying problems, either directly by myself or by some of the agencies that come under the auspices of my Department.  One example is the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) &euro;500 million joint venture (Activate Capital) to make funding available to the house building sector.  I also introduced an increased deduction for mortgage interest relief for landlords that commit to the provision of rental accommodation, for a minimum of three year, for tenants receiving social housing supports. NAMA has also committed to support the delivery of up to 20,000 residential units by the end of 2020. </p>  <p>  However, more needs to be done given the housing supply shortage.</p>  <p>  To restore the housing market to a sustainable equilibrium, this Government has set an ambitious target, in the Programme for Government, of ensuring that 25,000 additional new houses are built each year by 2020.  To achieve this target the Government has committed to implement a number of policy actions designed to help address the outstanding bottlenecks in the housing and construction sector and restore supply to the optimal level.  </p>  <p>  As regards first time buyers, the Government is cognisant of the particular difficulties facing this group.  The Programme for Government, therefore, contains a number of policy proposals designed to support first time buyers such as the proposal to work with the Central Bank, as part of its review of the mortgage lending rules, to develop a new "Help to Buy" scheme. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-18a.125.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051800061#WRB03900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 55 together.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, small and medium sized businesses play a central role in the sustainable recovery of the Irish economy.  To facilitate this, Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs from every sector have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.  Officials from my Department regularly meet representatives from the Small Firms Association, Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association and Chambers Ireland to discuss issues around access to finance and these engagements help inform the development of policy on SME credit and lending. </p>  <p>  Having completed a process of deleveraging, both AIB and Bank of Ireland are now concentrating on growing their balance sheets.  In this context, both banks recognise the need to increase business lending, including lending to the SME sector.  My Department collates and examines, on a monthly basis, granular data on the funding of the activities of SMEs from both AIB and Bank of Ireland, the wider banking sector and increasingly the non-bank funding sector.  In addition, AIB and Bank of Ireland meet my officials, and those of the Credit Review Office, on a quarterly basis to keep them abreast of issues pertaining to the SME sector.  This facilitates the Department and the Credit Review Office in monitoring progress against agreed annual SME lending plans and ensuring that new lending to SMEs continues to increase as a percentage of total sanctioned lending.  </p>  <p>  My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small and medium sized businesses.  The SME State Bodies Group provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance.</p>  <p>  Some of the main policies introduced to encourage access to credit for small and medium businesses include:</p>  <p>  - The Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014. On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at www.supportingsmes.ie.</p>  <p>  - The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been established as a means of ensuring that SMEs are provided with sufficient finance for growth.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is an initiative designed to increase the availability of funding to SMEs at a lower cost and on more flexible terms than have recently been available on the Irish Market.  The SBCI does not lend directly to SMEs. It uses a network of lending partners known as 'on lenders' to make its funds available to SMEs.  More information on the SBCI can be found on www.sbci.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  - The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.</p>  <p>  - The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides support in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions.  Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund (www.microfinanceireland.ie).</p>  <p>  - The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  They also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank.  The Credit Reviewer and his team have overturned more than 50% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.  Further details are available at www.creditreview.ie.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector, as reflected in the recently published Programme for a Partnership Government, and sees it as a key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently, my Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate participants in the SME sector to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.  In this context, the Action Plan for Jobs 2016 includes a dedicated chapter and associated integrated set of actions to support the financing for growth in the SME sector.</p>  <p>  In terms of monitoring the requirements for SMEs, the Department of Finance facilitates the biannual SME Credit Demand Survey.  The most recent survey, covering the period April-September 2015, shows that 85% of SME credit applications, excluding pending applications, were approved.  Working capital requirements were provided as the main reason for applying for bank finance with 48% of respondents stating that they required finance for working capital.  When asked about sources of finance for working capital, internal funds/retained earnings were the main finance source of working capital with 63% of working capital coming from this source.  Further results from the survey can be found at www.finance.gov.ie.  Results from October 2015 to March 2016 are expected shortly.</p></reply>

This is evidenced by the range of commitments contained in the Programme for A Partnership Government which will provide renewed impetus for dealing with the issue particularly for those borrowers in long-term arrears.  </p>  <p>  The most recent Central Bank figures show that to date over 120,000 restructures have been put in place which reinforces the fact that engagement between borrowers and lenders works.  At end 2015, 86.4% of restructured PDH accounts were deemed to be meeting the terms of their arrangement.  In addition the most recent figures published by my Department for end March 2016 show that PDH mortgage accounts in arrears are down 20% since March 2015.</p>  <p>  As part of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) framework the completion of affordability assessments is a key step.  In this regard a lender must examine each case on its individual merits and it must base its assessment on the full circumstances of the borrower, including, inter alia, the borrower's current repayment capacity.  In order to determine which options for alternative repayment arrangements are viable in each particular case, a lender must explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements that they offer.  The Code also requires lenders to review an alternative repayment arrangement at appropriate intervals for the type and duration of the arrangement.  The lender must also carry out a review of an alternative repayment arrangement at any time, if requested by the borrower.</p>  <p>  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) is a key part of the Central Bank's mortgage arrears framework.  It is designed to provide appropriate and effective consumer protection measures and to ensure that borrowers are treated in a fair and transparent manner.  The CCMA sets out requirements for all mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears.  It provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent way by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.</p>  <p>  The CCMA also requires lenders to have an appeals process in place to enable a borrower appeal a decision by a lender, including where the borrower is not willing to enter into an alternative repayment arrangement or where the lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement.  The appeals procedure must inform the borrower of his/her right to refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The CCMA also provides that, at the borrower's request and with the borrower's written consent, the lender must liaise with a third party to act on his/her behalf in relation to his/her arrears situation.  </p></reply>

I have no statutory function in relation to the banking decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time; these are taken by the board and management of the relevant institution.  This includes decisions in relation to products as determined by the banks.</p>  <p>  All viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy.  As the Deputy will be aware, Chapter 7 (Finance for Growth) of this year's Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) sets out a range of commitments to ensure viable SME's can access appropriate finance at a reasonable cost from both bank and non-bank sources.</p>  <p>  In line with Action 144 of the APJ, officials from my Department continue to collate and examine data from AIB and Bank of Ireland on a monthly basis, including data pertaining to overdraft facilitates.  Furthermore, my officials meet the banks on a quarterly basis to ensure an informed understanding of the wider SME bank lending environment which assists the development and implementation of policies aimed at ensuring SME access to finance and increased competition in the SME lending sector.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the restoration of overdraft facilities, both AIB and Bank of Ireland saw an increase in overdraft sanctions in 2015 compared to 2014.  It is noted, however, that overdraft utilisations have declined and this is in line with findings from the Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey and an indicator of increasing reliance on retained profits to meet working capital needs.

His central recommendation is for a revised system whereby a minimum level of LPT revenues in each local authority area would be determined by Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield.  This in turn would allow for the estimation of LPT rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue.  Local authorities could adjust this rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%.  This new system was recommended by Dr Thornhill with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019.</p>  <p>  In my Budget 2016 statement, I announced that I would be proposing to Government that the revaluation date for the LPT be postponed from 2016 to 2019.  This postponement means that home owners will not be faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values.  The postponement also gave sufficient time for the other recommendations in Dr Thornhill's report to be considered fully by the next Government.</p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 gives effect to the postponement of the revaluation date of residential property for LPT purposes, and also to two of the recommendations in Dr Thornhill's report, involving LPT relief for properties affected by pyrite and relief for properties occupied by persons with disabilities (recommendations numbers 11 and 12 respectively).</p>  <p>  My Department will be considering issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Report in due course in line with the 2019 timeline.  I also note that the Programme for a Partnership Government provides for the preparation of a report by mid-2017 for Government and for the Oireachtas, on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability. </p></reply>

My understanding is that references to firms operating in Ireland make up a very small percentage of the Papers.

You should be aware that discussions are ongoing between my officials and those in Revenue in relation to Revenue powers in the context of the next Finance Bill.

Depending on the nature of these activities, they may already be in scope under a range of national and European financial services regulations which have been put in place to regulate such activities.  The following regulations, for which the Central Bank is the competent authority, may apply to all or part of the activities undertaken: Prospectus Directive, Transparency Directive, European Market Infrastructure Regulation, Anti Money Laundering Directives, Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive, ECB Reporting Regulations, Central Bank SPV Reporting Regulations, Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015.  This list is not exhaustive and further regulatory measures to deal with shadow banking are regularly considered at national, EU and other international fora.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Finance Dublin Yearbook 2016 states that the value of IFSC financial services exports in 2015 was &euro;30,951m.</p></reply>

These costings, in the following table, were provided to the Department of an Taoiseach, which had overall responsibility for coordinating this exercise. <table><tr><th><b>INCOME TAX</b></th><th><b>Full-Year cost</b></th><th><b>Comments &ndash; Revenue &amp;amp; DoF</b></th></tr><tr><td>A new provision whereby any landlord accepting rent supplement from tenants are given a USC exemption on the rental income. </td><td>Aggregate costing requires further information.</td><td>The benefit to a landlord from the proposal would equate to 3%, 5.5%, 8% or 11% of the rent supplement income, or a blend of these rates, where income crosses the relevant thresholds. To estimate of an overall likely cost, plausible projections would need to be generated for the potential uptake. In addition, to operate the proposal, Revenue would need landlords to provide a breakdown between rent received from residential and other types of property and between rent income arising from rent supplement and other sources of rental income.  Such a level of detail is not currently required in tax returns to Revenue.  It should also be noted that Finance Act 2015 increased mortgage interest relief to 100% for this cohort of landlord.</td></tr><tr><td>Abolishing USC on all new construction workers earning under &euro;40,000 per annum.</td><td>Department of Finance estimates that this would cost &euro;7.5m for every 5,000 workers earning &euro;40,000. Actual cost would depend on uptake and salary levels.</td><td>As an illustrative example for an individual at certain incomes, the average cost in terms of USC foregone under this proposal is as follows:<br /><br />Gross Income &euro;20,000 (USC loss &euro;393)  - &euro;2.0m per 5,000 workers<br /><br />Gross Income &euro;30,000 (USC loss &euro;943) - &euro;4.7m per 5,000 workers<br /><br />Gross Income &euro;40,000 (USC loss &euro;1,493) - &euro;7.5m per 5,000 workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <br /><br />It is important to note that the proposal would also impose a step effect of &euro;1,493 where income exceeds &euro;40,000.<br /><br />This would be a State aid that requires the approval of the European Commission.  It should also be noted that a system treating groups of similar taxpayers differently for tax purposes would present administrative challenges for Revenue to police and may lead to distorted incentives. <br /><br />It is not possible to accurately cost this proposal as the potential number of new construction workers is not available.</td></tr><tr><td>Introducing an income tax exemption on income received from the alternative use of farmland for renewable projects, where such income is used for the purposes of re-investment in farm businesses</td><td>Aggregate costing requires further information</td><td>Additional information on the expected level of uptake and the total amount of income that would be exempted under this proposal would be required before Revenue could attempt to cost it.  It is not clear why re-investment would not qualify as a business cost.</td></tr><tr><td>Exempting Income tax on income received from the alternative use of farmland for renewable projects, where such income is used for the purposes of re-investment in farm businesses. </td><td>As per immediately above</td><td>Please see immediately above</td></tr><tr><td>Introducing a tax credit of &euro;12,000 p.a. if rented to a family on the housing list whereby the family going into occupation would be paying no rent but the Local Authority would pay &euro;1,000 p.a. towards maintenance. </td><td>DoF estimates that the cost  would be &euro;13m per 1,000 units. Actual cost would depend on uptake.</td><td>A standard rated tax credit of &euro;12,000 would shield &euro;60,000 of income. Given the large numbers on housing lists, this could be of significant cost. However, the nature of the proposal is not fully clear. Further information concerning the number of landlords who might avail of such a scheme, the level of  uptake by families and the types of income against which the credit could be used, would be required before Revenue could attempt to cost the proposal.  The cost of the Local Authority payment of &euro;1,000 per annum towards maintenance also depends on the uptake.</td></tr><tr><td>Introducing a Disability tax credit, similar to the Blind Persons tax credit. </td><td>&euro;172m (illustrative Rev. Comm. estimate)</td><td>The latest data held by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) regarding statistics on disability are based on the Census 2011 indicates that 112,502 persons with disability were working. This figure includes 8,312 persons who are blind or have vision impairment. Consequently 104,190 persons could be eligible for the new credit (assuming that those eligible for Blind Persons Credit could not additionally avail of the proposed disability credit). If all were to fully avail of a credit of &euro;1,650, the cost would be &euro;172m. However, it should be noted, while the Census 2011 shows 8,312 persons who are blind or have vision impairment, only 18.5% or 1,540 availed of the Blind Persons Credit in 2013 and this may indicate that not all cases may avail of a similar disability credit.</td></tr><tr><td>Introducing a new housing scheme for people at risk of homelessness whereby landlords with unoccupied properties would be exempted from property tax , exempted from any income tax liable from the tenancy up to &euro;10,000 and given 100% mortgage interest relief </td><td>DoF illustrative estimate of &euro;45m for LPT element only, if it concerned 10% of LPT liable properties.</td><td>Further information on the likely uptake would be required to provide a potential cost.  However, for illustrative purposes regarding the LPT element only, if an assumption is made that 10% of LPT liable properties are vacant, with an average  LPT payment of &euro;241 applies, then the Department of Finance estimates that cost would be c.&euro;45m per annum based on analysis of CSO vacancy rates. This also assumes that all vacant properties would be rented rather than owner-occupied. It should also be noted that the 100% mortgage interest deduction introduced in Finance Act 2015 could benefit such landlords.</td></tr><tr><td>Reducing employer levies for rural town centre employers. </td><td>A 50% reduction in Employers PRSI (excluding NTF levy) would save relevant employers just over 5% on salary costs. Aggregate costing requires further information.</td><td>The Department of Finance has made an assumption that this proposal refers to Employers PRSI, which is the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection. In order to fully cost the proposals it would be necessary to identify the numbers of 'Rural town centre employers' and their associated employees along with individual salary levels and the level of reduction envisaged.</td></tr><tr><td>Expanding the Employment and Investment Incentive Scheme to that investment in farm-scale renewable energy initiatives qualify. </td><td>Potentially already qualify/ Costing of changes would require further information.</td><td>At present, the Department of Finance notes that renewable energy production by farmers who meet the qualifying conditions of EII are eligible under the scheme. It should be noted that the relevant trade must be undertaken by a company that meets the qualifying conditions regarding age and connection to the grid.  Should the proposal involve changing those conditions, additional information concerning the level of investments would be required before Revenue could attempt to cost the proposal.</td></tr><tr><td>Introducing a similar scheme to the &lsquo;Living City Initiative&rsquo; to regenerate town centres throughout Ireland.</td><td>DoF estimates that, if all towns qualify, the potential cost could be greater than &euro;100 m. Aggregate Costing Requires further information.</td><td>The Living City Initiative was estimated to cost &euro;20m in respect of 6 cities. Its expansion to towns throughout Ireland would be likely to cost significantly more. Additional information in relation to the potential investments in the regeneration of qualifying towns would be required before Revenue could attempt to cost the proposal. </td></tr><tr><td>Extending the SEAI accelerated capital allowances for investment in energy efficient equipment to sole traders. </td><td>DoF: Cost of circa. &euro;1m.</td><td>The current scheme costs in the region of &euro;350,000 per annum. Assuming that an equivalent number of sole traders were to avail of it, the additional cost could be approximately &euro;1 million per annum. This would be a cashflow cost. Additional information on the level of investments made by sole traders in the relevant energy efficient equipment would be required before Revenue could attempt to cost the proposal. </td></tr><tr><td>Extending the Rent a room relief to cover lodger agreements where the licensees are providing a room in their primary private residence for a tenant who is homeless, (as defined by the Housing Act 1988 Section 2) or a refugee. The licensees would be exempted from any income tax arising from the solidarity lodging scheme up to &euro;14,000 per annum.</td><td>DoF Assumption: - less than &euro;0.4 million</td><td>At present, there is no restriction barring the taking in of tenants who are homeless or refugees. It is assumed that this proposal would provide for a different cap on the rent-a-room relief for certain tenants. Increasing the cap on the rent-a-room relief from &euro;10,000 to &euro;12,000 for all applicants in Budget 2015 was estimated to cost &euro;0.4m in a full year, so it could be expected that the cost would be less than that, if uptake were unchanged. Additional information concerning the potential number of landlords who might avail of such a scheme or what amount of income tax would become exempt under the proposal, along with an estimate of the potential uptake of this scheme by those defined under the Housing Act 1988 Section 2, would be required before Revenue could attempt to cost the proposal.</td></tr><tr><td>Develop a voluntary PRSI Scheme for the self-employed</td><td></td><td>There are differences in the PRSI treatment of the self-employed as compared to employees.  <br /><br />The self-employed pay Class S PRSI which generates the same entitlement to the State Pension as an employee&rsquo;s Class A contributions, but does not provide access to certain other benefits such as Jobseekers Benefit or Illness Benefit.  <br /><br />Both cohorts pay 4% PRSI in their own right, but in the case of employees a further employer&rsquo;s PRSI charge of 8.5% or 10.75% is also payable, resulting in a significantly higher contribution to the Social Insurance Fund in respect of an employee&rsquo;s earnings.<br /><br />Ways to further extend the PRSI system on a voluntary basis can be examined (but care will be needed to ensure that costs are manageable).<br /><br />Costing of options for such a scheme would need to be completed by the Department of Social Protection.</td></tr><tr><td>Equalise the tax treatment of the self-employed.</td><td>To increase the earned income credit from &euro;550 to &euro;1,650 to match the PAYE credit would cost &euro;123 million.<br /><br />To abolish the 3% surcharge on self-assessed income in excess of &euro;100,000 for the self-employed would <i>cost</i> &euro;144 million.<br /><br />Or<br /><br />To extend the 3% surcharge to PAYE income in excess of &euro;100,000 would <i>yield</i> &euro;108 million.</td><td>Full equalisation of the tax treatment of the self-assessed and the employed would require a review of the expenses regime, as that available to the self-employed is more beneficial than that available to employees. In addition, the self-employed can also have significant timing advantages with regard to the payment of income tax liabilities, depending on the accounting year chosen. </td></tr><tr><td>A tax credit worth &euro;2,000 for average income households to help them deal with childcare costs. Low income households to benefit up to &euro;5,000.</td><td>Tentative costings, depending on take-up and eligibility considerations, indicate that such a tax credit could cost in the range of &euro;290m. to &euro;590m. per annum. The specific proposal, as outlined, would be likely to cost at the upper end of the range above.</td><td>The report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Future Investment in Childcare in Ireland was recently published, which considered future policy options for increasing the quality, accessibility and affordability of early years and school age (out of school) care and education services. The group did not recommend the introduction of a childcare tax credit.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The benefit of such a credit would be unlikely to accrue to parents and would be more likely to be absorbed by childcare providers in the form of higher prices.<br /><br />Tentative costings, depending on take-up and eligibility considerations, indicate that such a tax credit could cost in the range of &euro;290 million to &euro;590 million per annum.</td></tr><tr><td>Approximate costing for a tax credit for people at work equivalent to the blind tax credit.</td><td>If intended to be a <i>disability tax credit</i>, then the potential cots estimated by the Revenue Commissioners is &euro;172m. This estimate is based on census figures of those who declared themselves to be disabled and working</td><td>There could be difficulties in specifying and verifying the level of disability required to be eligible for such a tax credit.<br /><br />The credit, depending on how it was designed, could be available to high income earners, who may not necessarily need additional net income after taxation. </td></tr><tr><td><b>CAPITAL TAXES</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Reducing the tax on the sale of land with residential planning (shovel ready) from 33% to 20%.</td><td>&euro;12m (Rev. Comm. estimate)</td><td>It is tentatively estimated that the cost of reducing the capital gains tax rate from 33% to 20% on all development land could be in the region of &euro;12m. This is based on information in respect of disposal consideration associated with development land from 2013 tax returns. It is not possible to separately identify the element of the cost associated with &ldquo;shovel ready&rdquo; residential land.</td></tr><tr><td>Amending Capital Acquisitions Tax for farmers so that the 90% reduction currently applying to full time farmers applies to part time farmers who lease their land to whole time farmers for five years. </td><td>-</td><td>As agricultural relief is currently available to farmers who spend less than half their working time farming but who lease their inherited or gifted land to qualifying farmers (including those who qualify on the basis of spending at least half their working time farming), and in a range of other circumstances, further clarity is required on the problem the proposal is seeking to address. This could help in determining what effect the measure might have and whether it would be possible to estimate its cost. In this context, some indication of the numbers affected would be useful.</td></tr><tr><td>Raising Inheritance tax threshold to &euro;400,000 for farm holdings, where the person inheriting the property does not have a green cert or equivalent qualification. </td><td>-</td><td>Inheritors of farmland can qualify for CAT agricultural relief, which reduces the value of farm assets by 90% for CAT purposes, in a number of ways. They are not necessarily required to hold an agricultural qualification to obtain the relief. This relief is considerably more generous than a simple &euro;400,000 tax-free threshold. Further clarity is required on the problem the proposal is seeking to address. This could help in determining what effect the measure might have and whether it would be possible to estimate its cost. In this context, some indication of the numbers affected would be useful.</td></tr><tr><td>Establishing a new Tax Incentivised Savings Scheme for purchasers of new first homes whereby the State contribute 25% of every euro in a special savings account for first time buyers</td><td>DoF: Minimum estimate of &euro;75m per annum. </td><td>Large band of uncertainty around this estimate. Currently not possible to establish the potential pool of First Time Buyers that are saving. Question arises as to whether the portion of FTBs who are cash buyers should be included in the scheme.   Estimated cost based on average deposit and current sales levels.</td></tr><tr><td>Replacing the current development levy contributions, payable under S48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended, with property tax. </td><td>DoF Estimate: Additional &euro;5 in LPT per household to replace each &euro;10m of development levies, e.g. &euro;50m additional LPT equals &euro;25 per household on average.</td><td>Development levies are payable in respect of residential development under both S.48 and S.49 of the 2000 Act.  Approximately &euro;78m was collected in 2012 under s.48 and S.49 (no split is immediately available between S.48 and S.49).  However, the comparable figures for 2006 and 2007 are &euro;670m and &euro;630m.   The Department of Finance estimates that each &euro;10m of additional LPT will increase the cost per household by &euro;5 on average.                                                                                                                                               So, for example, &euro;50m in foregone development levies would increase LPT by &euro;25 per household and &euro;200m would increase LPT by &euro;100 per household.                                                                            Detailed costings would require plausible projections on the likely level of development in the coming years.</td></tr><tr><td>Replacing Part V with a 1% levy on sales of all residential units, both new and second hand.<br /><br /></td><td>&euro;130m (Rev. Comm. Estimate)</td><td>The introduction of a 1% levy on the sale of all residential units, both new and second hand, is estimated to yield approximately &euro;130 million. This estimate does not take account of the revenue that would be foregone by removing the current levy in Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).</td></tr><tr><td><b>BUSINESS TAX</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Doubling tax relief on rental expenditure for new business start-ups to encourage businesses to locate in villages and town centres<br /><br /></td><td>-</td><td>Revenue is unable to provide a cost for this proposal as there is no basis on which to estimate the extent to which new businesses might start up in these locations and the amount of associated rental costs.  This looks like an operating aid, which is illegal under State aid rules. <br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><b>INDIRECT TAXES</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Reducing the V.A.T. Rate on new builds to 0% for 3 years and then increasing it gradually. </td><td>-</td><td>VAT is governed by the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  As new builds were not subject to 0% VAT on 1 January 1991, the derogation available to goods and services at the 0% rate does not apply and Ireland cannot make new builds subject to a 0% VAT rate now.</td></tr><tr><td>Implementing a temporary targeted reduction of the rate of VAT from 13.5% to 9% on new, affordable houses and apartments timed to generate the maximum impact on supply. </td><td>&euro;205m (Rev. Comm. Estimate)</td><td>It is possible to apply the 9% VAT rate to the construction of new residential properties, but this would involve having separate VAT rates appyling to construction services. It would be difficult to administer and could lead to underpayment of VAT. The cost to the Exchequer of the reduced rate of 9% VAT for new build residential construction is estimated by Revenue to be in the region of &euro;205m in 2016. New residential completions are forecast to gradually increase to match the medium-term demand of 25,000 units by 2020. Therefore, the cost of providing a reduced rate of VAT for residential construction could be more than &euro;400m by 2020.  Furthermore, under EU VAT law, it is not possible to differentiate between &quot;affordable new builds&quot; and &quot;new builds&quot;.</td></tr><tr><td>Introducing a new Scrappage Scheme for Heavy Goods Vehicles, along the lines of previous schemes.</td><td>-</td><td>Previous scrappage schemes were based on relief from VRT. As VRT on heavy goods vehicles is only charged at a flat rate of &euro;200, this would not appear to a major incentive. Please note that the VAT on HGVs is already deductible by businesses.</td></tr><tr><td>Introducing a tax on sugary sweetened drinks as a measure to address childhood obesity and use income to introduce measures to subsidise healthy food and school meals programme.</td><td>DoF estimate is a range of yields from &euro;12m to &euro;240m</td><td>The Department of Finance estimates the yield from a levy of between 1 cent and 20 cent in a price increase of a 330ml soda ranges from &euro;12m to &euro;243m. Refining this estimate would demand a range of policy decisions on the exact application of such a levy.</td></tr><tr><td>Retain mortgage interest relief beyond the current end date of December 2017.</td><td>Tentative estimates for costs are &euro;166 million in 2018 and &euro;148 million in 2019</td><td>Existing mortgage interest recipients are those who borrowed to purchase or renovate their home in the years 2004 to 2012. <br /><br />This includes those who bought at the peak of the market and those who bought at the bottom (circa early 2013).<br /><br />It is difficult to be definitive about a cost for extending mortgage interest relief for existing recipients as it will depend on the extent of mortgage redemptions, interest arrears and interest rates among other factors. </td></tr><tr><td>Abolish Irish Water and abolish water charges.</td><td></td><td>Based on initial cost and revenue estimates provided by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLG), and on the IW business plan, it is projected that the abolition of Irish Water could add about 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points of GDP to the headline General Government deficit each year over the 2016 &ndash; 2021 period.  The abolition of water charges, one-off wind up costs, loss of potential efficiency gains and possible provision of group water subsidies would be partially offset through an assumed policy decision to cease the water conservation grant and metering programme. See detailed note of 7 April 2016 prepared by DECLG.</td></tr><tr><td><b>OTHER</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Reform the role of SBCI by fully licencing it as a state enterprise bank similar to the former ICC.</td><td>Estimated costs of establishment &euro;130m, annual operating cost &euro;80m and capital requirement of &euro;550m based on &euro;5bn loan book.</td><td>The SBCI serves as an on lending financial institution, providing low cost wholesale finance to both bank and non-bank on-lending partners in the SME market. Central to the business model is the ability to make credit providers&rsquo; products more competitive, by lowering their funding cost.<br /><br />Turning the SBCI into a direct lender would necessitate a completely different business model with the need to build a distribution, credit assessment and back office capability and as a State guaranteed direct lender in competition with the banks would require clearance under EU State aid rules.<br /><br />In this manner rather than being a competitor to the existing institutions, the role of the SBCI can be more impactful by being an enabler of competition allowing it to concentrate funding as needed on a general, a product or sector specific basis.<br /><br />The release of long-term funds by promotional (or state-backed) financial institutions, through frontline (or traditional) finance providers, is a successful and effective model for funding SMEs throughout Europe.</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These include obligations imposed under Section 14(1) of the National Treasury Management Agency Act 1990 and under Section 202 of the NAMA Act 2009.  Staff assigned to NAMA are also subject to the provisions of the Official Secrets Act 1963.  Contravention of these statutory obligations constitutes criminal offences and, under Section 7 of the NAMA Act, a person who commits such offences may be liable to a substantial fine or term of imprisonment or both.</p>  <p>  Under Section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011, any party with evidence of criminal wrongdoing is legally obliged to bring such evidence to the attention of An Garda Sioch&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  In September 2012, evidence emerged that confidential NAMA data may have been unlawfully disclosed by a former NAMA Officer.  NAMA informed the Garda&iacute; and the Data Protection Commissioner of their concerns and the matter was brought to my attention at the time.  Last week, the former Officer was found guilty by the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court of the unlawful disclosure of confidential NAMA information.  The case follows an extensive investigation of the matter by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation (GBFI) since Autumn 2012.</p>  <p>  In September 2012, NAMA launched a major review of data security and of data access within the Agency and of data transmission to external parties which had a business need to receive data from it.  The review found that the security processes in place in NAMA (which were derived from those of the NTMA) were very robust, a number of additional measures were proposed and adopted in order to reduce further the scope for unauthorised transmission of data to external parties. </p>  <p>  I am advised that NAMA employs a wide range of measures to prevent unauthorised disclosure of confidential data.  These include practical measures such as the deployment of email monitoring technology to prevent email attachments from being forwarded to personal and non-corporate email accounts.  IT controls also ensure that data cannot be saved from the NTMA network onto external storage devices, such as USB keys and compact discs.  I am advised, however, that no organisation, short of installing system and process restrictions which would seriously compromise its ability to conduct its day to day business effectively, can absolutely protect itself against data theft.  In the case of the unlawful disclosure of confidential NAMA information which was the subject of the recent prosecution in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, it was noted that despite NAMA's robust data security infrastructure the ex-employee, who was subject of the case, acted in a determined fashion to circumvent the security measures in place by distributing the information through his spouse who at that time was employed by a firm engaged in providing services to NAMA.</p></reply>

While the Deloitte review found that the security processes in place in NAMA (which were derived from those of the NTMA) were very robust, a number of additional measures were proposed and adopted in order to reduce further the scope for unauthorised transmission of data to external parties. </p>  <p>  I am advised that NAMA employs a wide range of measures to prevent unauthorised disclosure of confidential data.  These include practical measures such as the deployment of email monitoring technology to prevent email attachments from being forwarded to personal and non-corporate email accounts.  IT controls also ensure that data cannot be saved from the NTMA network onto external storage devices, such as USB keys and compact discs.  I am advised, however, that no organisation, short of installing system and process restrictions which would seriously compromise its ability to conduct its day to day business effectively, can absolutely protect itself against data theft.  However, the standards employed by NAMA are to the highest professional available and implemented elsewhere.</p></reply>

I am advised that it was not part of the DPP's case that NAMA's ability to conduct its business had been compromised by the disclosure.</p>  <p>  I am advised that there is no evidence to suggest that there are connections between the recipients of the unlawful disclosures and bidders for assets that may have been offered for sale by NAMA debtors.  In any event, I am advised that, as part of NAMA asset and loan sales, the information provided to potential bidders is much more comprehensive than the unlawfully disclosed 2009 information which was the subject of the recent Circuit Criminal Court case.  Accordingly, I am advised that no advantage would accrue to the recipients of the unlawfully disclosed information in any competitive bidding process as it is market value as determined at the time of sale that is the basis for NAMA's assessment of any bids.</p>  <p>  I am advised that NAMA's policy is that the sale of all loans and the sale of properties by debtors and receivers should be openly marketed wherever possible to ensure that the best price available in the market is achieved in all instances.  NAMA enjoys a strong reputation in the market for the quality of information it provides as part of its property portfolio and loan sale processes and for the transparent and professional manner in which such transactions are executed.  Both its property portfolio and loan sales processes are built on international best practice and NAMA uses experienced advisers to ensure that transactions are executed to the highest market standards and that bidders are treated equally by mapping out a clear and rigorous process to be followed in each sale. </p>  <p>  Prior to the launch of a property portfolio or a loan sale, all relevant data, including loan agreements, security and title documentation, data tapes, lease information and tenancy schedules, is assembled in a data room by NAMA in conjunction with its legal and loan sale advisors.  An initial high-level summary of the property or loan portfolio is then issued to potential purchasers so as to generate as much interest as possible.</p>  <p>  Bidders are required to submit binding unconditional bids, proof of funding and marked-up contracts for sale.  The final bids are assessed by NAMA with advice and recommendations from the portfolio sales agents or loan sales brokers, and a recommendation is made to the appropriate decision-making authority in NAMA.  The successful and unsuccessful parties are advised of the outcome with the successful party also being notified of the timescale for completing the transaction.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p><p>Recent years have seen an increase in the number of SNAs from 10,575 posts in 2011 to 12,040 in June 2016.

A further 168 ASD special classes are due to open in 2016.</p><p>The NCSE has advised that there are currently 2 autism specific classes at post primary level in the area referred to by the Deputy. Each special class for autism has a 6:1.5 pupil teacher ratio at post primary level as well as Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 SNAs for a class of 6 children.</p><p>The NCSE continues to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas and has capacity to establish such new special classes where necessary subject to the willingness of schools to open classes. Full details of all of the special classes that are currently provided is available at www.ncse.ie.</p><p>I have arranged for the Deputy's request for specific detail in relation to placement availability in the area referred to, to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p><p>Children with autism may also be eligible for home tuition if a school placement is not available for them and/or where a determination is awaited in respect of an expulsion or refusal to enrol taken under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998. Details in relation to the Home Tuition schemes are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</p></reply>

While a small number of these staff remain in schools, the schemes are being phased out and have been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme.  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme now receive capitation grant assistance to provide for secretarial (and/or caretaking) services.  Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs and the Department does not stipulate how secretarial services are to be obtained.  Where a school uses the grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools.  My Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged.  These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, in 2015 my Department agreed to engage with the union side in relation to the pay of School Secretaries and Caretakers who are employed using grant funding and to enter an arbitration process if necessary.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for School Secretaries and Caretakers comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.</p><p>  The Arbitrator's recommendations were accepted by both sides. My Department issued Circulars to schools which gave effect to the measures which applied from 1 January 2016 (i.e. an increase of 2.5% in the hourly pay rate and the introduction of a minimum hourly rate of &euro;10.25) and revised grant rates.</p></reply>

Lower thresholds apply for DEIS Band 1 schools, ranging from 20:1 to 24:1 depending on the type of school.

The Scheme applies to candidates who have a physical or medical disability, including visual and hearing impairments, or a specific learning difficulty.  All applications for reasonable accommodations are considered within a published Framework of Principles established by an Expert Advisory Group.</p><p>Reasonable accommodations are not intended to compensate for a possible lack of achievement arising from a disability or to compensate for difficulties arising from a candidate's general intellectual functioning.  Reasonable accommodations are intended to;</p><p>(a) to remove, as far as possible, the impact of the disability on the candidate's performance and thus enable the candidate to demonstrate his or her level of attainment and</p><p>(b) to ensure that, whilst giving candidates every opportunity to demonstrate their level of attainment, the special arrangements will not give the candidate an unfair advantage over other candidates in the same examination.</p><p>The range of accommodations includes, inter alia, provision of modified, brailled and enlarged papers for visually impaired students; access to readers, scribes, word-processor, tape or voice recorder for student with physical conditions or dyslexia or other types of SLD; exemptions from components of the examinations such as the oral or aural or the waiver from spelling and grammar in language subjects.  Some students may apply for and be granted more than one type of accommodation.</p><p>  In cases where a school/parent or student is dissatisfied with any aspect of the SEC's decision, they have access to an Independent Appeals Committee.  All members of the Appeals Committee are drawn from outside the SEC.  The remit of the Appeals Committee covers appeals against all elements of a decision taken by the SEC.  Appeals must be lodged in writing and all appeals are considered in light of the Framework of Principles established by the Expert Advisory Group.</p></reply>

The Strategy remains in force and as a result of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010, its statutory role and influence has been strengthened by new requirements for local authority and regional plans to align with the NSS.  Bearing in mind the interval of time that has elapsed, changed circumstances and new challenges that have emerged in the planning arena, the previous Government approved the preparation of a successor to the NSS - the <i>National Planning Framework</i>- and in December 2015 published a roadmap for its preparation, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link; .</p><p>The commitment to preparing the <i>National Planning Framework</i>was reaffirmed in <i>A Programme for a Partnership Government</i>, published earlier this month.</p><p>I intend that the <i>National Planning Framework</i>will be a high-level nationally focused document, developed to ensure the optimal development of the country as a whole while maximising Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery and on-going growth at national, regional and local level, thus further contributing to sustainable national recovery through an inclusive and participative approach with all relevant national, regional and local interests.</p><p>Furthermore, the <i>National Planning Framework</i>will act as the strategic planning context for relevant Government policies and investment in housing, water services, transport, communications, energy, health and education infrastructure, development, by the three new regional assemblies, of their new regional spatial and economic strategies, and the functions of planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>In line with the Programme for Government commitment, it is anticipated that the National Planning Framework will be finalised by the first quarter of 2017, taking account of all relevant in puts and statutory requirements and it would be inappropriate at this early stage to comment on the likely content of the framework until sufficient preparatory and consultative work is undertaken.</p></reply>

The Programme further provides that we will investigate with all stakeholders how credit unions can support the delivery of social housing.  The Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) has set out a proposed means by which funding could be provided to Approved Housing Bodies, by credit unions, for the development of social housing.  My Department has met with the ILCU on a number of occasions to address technical aspects of its proposal.  The most recent meeting was on 13 April 2016.</p><p>The Central Bank commenced a number of new regulations for credit unions on 1 January 2016.  Prior to their commencement, following careful consideration, the Central Bank made a number of modifications including to Regulation 25(2) which makes reference to the fact that the Central Bank may prescribe, in accordance with section 43 of the Credit Union Act 1997, further classes of investments for credit unions which may include investments in projects of a public nature.  The effect of these modifications is that regulation 25(2) now provides that investment in projects of a public nature can include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.</p><p>I acknowledge the modifications made by the Central Bank and the willingness of credit unions to actively seek a role in financing the delivery of social housing.</p><p>Conscious of the independence of the Central Bank in its regulatory role in respect of credit unions, bilateral engagement has taken place between my Department and the Department of Finance to consider the potential regulatory and legislative implications of credit union involvement in the social housing sector.</p><p>My Department and the Department of Finance met with the Central Bank on 21 April 2016 to provide information of a technical nature in relation to social housing funding arrangements.  This was with a view to assisting the Central Bank in understanding how these arrangements operate, as it deals with issues arising from proposals put forward for credit union investment in social housing.</p><p>Ultimately, the funding mechanisms will have to be put in place in the first instance by the ILCU with the support of its members, and with the agreement of the Central Bank.  I and my Department are happy to continue to contribute to this process by providing necessary technical advice and support.</p></reply>

It is a matter in the first instance for the Council to identify projects, across all approaches, to deliver social housing as soon as possible.  I am keen that all local authorities, including Kildare County Council, advance these projects as soon as possible and I have assured them that funding is available to fully support their efforts in this regard, including construction and acquisition projects.</p><p>Following the notification of targets to Kildare County Council and other local authorities in April 2015, approvals for a substantial number of new social housing projects were announced in May 2015, July 2015 and January 2016. Between these three announcements, almost &euro;680 million has been allocated for over 3,900 social housing new builds, turnkey developments and acquisitions.

In addition to the funding provided by my Department, Kildare County Council also contributes significant levels of funding from their own resources for the delivery of these units.</p><p>In addition, under the Social Housing Strategy the delivery of new social housing units through a public private partnership (PPP) model is being pursued.  The PPP programme will have an investment of &euro;300 million to deliver 1,500 social housing units and it is being rolled-out in three bundles.  The first bundle of PPP sites, to provide over 500 new housing units, was announced in October 2015 and covers six sites, one of which is to deliver some 75 units at Craddockstown, Naas, County Kildare.</p></reply>

The payment has its origins in the disability benefit scheme.  The scheme is intended to provide income replacement for insured persons during short spells of incapacity or illness.  Other payments, such as invalidity pension or disability allowance, are available to people who are unable to work long-term because of a disability or a medical condition.  The illness benefit budget for 2016 is &euro;595.9m.</p>  <p>  The Department keeps all of its scheme under review and, where necessary, it updates the schemes to achieve the best outcomes for recipients.

First, to see this citizen released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland as soon as possible, and, second, to provide every possible consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention.</p>  <p>  The Egyptian Government is fully aware of the priority the Irish Government attaches to the welfare and interests of our citizen.  There has been sustained engagement at all levels with the Egyptian authorities.  I have been in regular contact with my Egyptian counterpart, Minister Shoukry, and the Taoiseach has twice met with President el-Sisi, making clear the Irish Government&rsquo;s concerns and objectives in this case.</p>  <p>  In addition to this dialogue with the Egyptian authorities, the Government has also been engaging on an ongoing basis with European and international partners and with the European Union.</p>  <p>  Irish Government representatives have worked with this citizen&rsquo;s legal team in Egypt and supported petitions to the court when asked to do so, including providing formal Government support for an application under Decree 140 and an application for release on bail.  Representatives of the Embassy have attended each of the court hearings to date and will be present at the next scheduled hearing on 29 June.  Officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin also remain in regular contact with his family and Irish-based lawyers.</p>  <p>  Significant resources continue to be deployed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both in Cairo and in Dublin, in the provision of comprehensive consular assistance to both the detained citizen and his family.  The Department has arranged numerous consular visits to this individual in prison since his arrest, the most recent undertaken by Ambassador Damien Cole on 17 April.</p>  <p>  Another visit will be arranged in the coming weeks.  Such visits provide significant practical benefit for the citizen.  These visits also allow regular contact with the prison authorities who are aware of the Irish Government&rsquo;s strong and sustained interest in this Irish citizen&rsquo;s welfare.</p>  <p>  Given that the trial is ongoing, the Government must remain measured and responsible in its public comment.  This is entirely consistent with our approach in other consular cases, with our clear objectives in this case and with what we firmly believe to offer the best prospect for a positive outcome for this young man.</p></reply>

This policy, which has been adopted by the Health Service Executive, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p><p>In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.</p><p>The Government currently provides funding of &euro;1.56 billion to the Disability Services Programme.  The quantum of service to be provided, together with key deliverables and priorities, are outlined in the Health Service Executive's (HSE's) National Service Plan for 2016 and includes provision of the following specialist disability services:<table><tr><th>Disability Services Programme &euro;1.56 billion 2016</th><th>Quantum of Services</th></tr><tr><td>Residential services</td><td>9,000 people</td></tr><tr><td>Day services</td><td>Over 22,000 people</td></tr><tr><td>Respite residential support</td><td>190,000 overnights</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Assistant services</td><td>1.3 million hours </td></tr><tr><td>Home Support services</td><td>2.6 million hours</td></tr><tr><td>Move from institutions to homes in the community</td><td>165 people</td></tr></table></p><p>The HSE is committed to protecting front-line services for people with disabilities, with targeted improvement in priority areas:</p><p>-  the reconfiguration of children's therapy services, for which an additional &euro;4 million has been provided;</p><p>-  the provision of services for 1,500 young people leaving school and rehabilitative training, which has been allocated an additional &euro;7.25 million;</p><p>-  the development of alternative respite models, with &euro;1 million targeted funding;</p><p>-  the reconfiguration of residential services, supported by &euro;20 million in capital funding; and</p><p>-  quality improvements to increase compliance with  <i>National Standards for Residential Centres for Children and Adults with Disabilities.</i></p><p>Disability service provision is moving towards a community-based and inclusive model of person-centred day and residential supports, as recommended in the <i>Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in Ireland</i>, and is being implemented through the<i>Transforming Lives</i>programme.  This transformation programme means that person-centred and individually chosen community based supports are progressively becoming the norm, and is a distinct move away from the group-based, often segregated approach of the past.  This new approach will be underpinned by a more effective method of assessing need, allocating resources and monitoring resource use.</p><p>A key element of <i>Transforming Lives</i>is the implementation of national policy on supporting people who live in congregated settings, defined as residential settings where ten or more people with disabilities live together, to move to the community.  This policy is described in the HSE&rsquo;s report on <i>Time to Move on from Congregated Settings &ndash; A Strategy for Community Inclusion, and is </i>underpinned by the<i>National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability 2011 &ndash; 2016,</i>published jointly by the Department of Health (DoH) and the then, Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLG).</p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s Social Care Directorate has prioritized the accelerated implementation of the de-congregation policy in 2016.  The HSE's 2016 National Service Plan has set a target of 165 people to move from institutions into suitable accommodation this year.  This is being supported by &euro;20 million in capital funding from the Department of Health in respect of acquiring and renovating properties to support the de-congregation process.  In addition, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will provide &euro;10 million under the Capital Assistance Scheme to provide suitable accommodation for people transitioning from institutions in 2016.  The HSE estimate that a further 100 people could benefit from this initiative. &euro;1 million in ring-fenced leasing funding is also being made available by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in 2016 to support people moving from institutions into suitable social housing in the community.</p><p>In total, this represents a significant investment and commitment by Government to ensure that citizens with disabilities are given the opportunity to live as ordinary a life as possible, in suitable accommodation in the community, in line with their own choices and preferences.</p><p>I have referred the Deputy's question to the HSE to provide a reply detailing the provision of Disability Services in Co. Donegal.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, he can contact my Private Office and they will follow the matter up with the HSE.</p></reply>

The HSE has reported an average increase of 6.4% compared with the same period last year.</p>  <p>  My predecessor convened the ED Taskforce in December 2014 to provide focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by ED overcrowding.  In April 2015, the HSE published the Taskforce action plan and significant progress has been made to date on implementing the plan.  The ED Taskforce Implementation Group continues to meet on a regular basis to oversee progress in this regard and I look forward to meeting with this group shortly.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the impact that long wait times in Emergency Departments can have on patients and their families.  Pressures on EDs have been rising, as the population is both growing and ageing, while investment was constrained during the recession.  However, the 2015 and 2016 Budgets have seen increases in the Health Budget, investments in capital expansion and the implementation of measures designed to tackle overcrowding in EDs.</p>  <p>  In June 2015, &euro;18m of additional funding was made available to the HSE under the Winter Additional Capacity Initiative to facilitate the opening of new hospital beds and the reopening of previously closed beds.  A total of 364 new or re-opened beds have been made available to date, which has enabled ED attendance figures similar to last year's, despite a sustained increase in attendances.</p>  <p>  New EDs are already open at the Mater Hospital in Dublin and in Wexford General Hospital.  The Programme for Government has committed to progress new ED facilities for University Hospital Galway and Beaumont Hospital, Dublin.</p>  <p>  A review of bed capacity in our health service, coupled with the review of the hours of service of Medical Assessment Units are key commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government intended to alleviate ED overcrowding.</p>  <p>  Increases in the health budget, measures to increase bed capacity for ED patients, along with new ED facilities and maximising the potential of units and services to treat patients outside of the hospital setting, will all contribute to reducing the time patients have to spend waiting in our EDs.</p></reply>

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33m  from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18th November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with the full support of both Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people and disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the Health Services executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability services to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited and specific cases at local level, disability services have in the past also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing additional supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such additional supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants, who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post primary school settings.</p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the issue he raised.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.

The Scheme has been used to assist forestry owners who have been affected by Ash dieback disease.  The objective of the Scheme is to eradicate/contain ash dieback in forests by supporting the removal and destruction of trees and leaf litter and to reconstitute the forest by replanting with alternative species.  The Scheme provides funding in respect of costs necessarily incurred in clearing the site and reconstituting the forest, subject to the maximum limits laid down.</p>  <p>  Due to financial pressures and Departmental budgetary constraints, grant aid was confined to individual forestry owners.  Accordingly forestry or hedgerow associations have not been funded. </p>  <p>  The Scheme is therefore targeted at the forestry sector and there are currently no plans to either broaden the scope of the Scheme or to introduce any other Scheme for individuals or nurseries that have been affected by outbreaks of plant diseases including ash dieback. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to provide funding for the development of the horticultural industry including commercial nurseries through the Horticultural Grant scheme.</p></reply>

Among these was the making available of more flexible state aid support.  It will now be possible for farmers (SMEs) to access temporary finance up to a maximum amount of &euro;15,000 per farm per year in circumstances where they either:</p><p>(i) make a commitment to freeze or reduce production compared to a given reference period, or</p><p>(ii) use the funds to bridge a liquidity gap.</p><p>Aid as provisionally envisaged would be granted in the form of direct grants, loans or guarantees in the case of freezing/reducing production, and in the form of loans or guarantees in the case of liquidity assistance (remunerated in the form of an interest payment).  The latter could also be provided in grant form if accompanied by a commitment to freeze or reduce production.  Interaction and discussion with the Commission is ongoing in respect of finalising the details of such provisions.</p><p>The Department is continuing to monitor market developments very closely, and will continue to work with the Commission and with other Member States in developing appropriate responses.</p><p>Member States now have a suite of measures that have been made available since September 2015, and will respond in accordance with their domestic circumstances.  To date Ireland has used the targeted aid package of &euro;27.4m (&euro;13.7m EU and &euro;13.7m national funding) to support producers in the dairy and pigmeat sectors, and has pushed for appropriate changes in the operation of market support measures such as aids to private storage.</p><p><i></i>There are no plans to avail of the option to provide national funding to freeze or reduce milk supply compared to a given reference period.  On the question of liquidity, the Department is at present commissioning an ex ante appraisal to examine the merits of including a provision for financial  instruments in its Rural Development Programme, and is continuing to  engage with banks and with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland on the provision of flexible finance to farmers.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the a facility to phase the final superlevy payment over three years was introduced by the EU Commission last year at Ireland&rsquo;s request.  Farmers availing of the facility must pay at least one third of the bill in each of the first two years (2015 and 2016) with the balance to be paid in 2017.  The Department implemented the scheme nationally and 3,741 farmers (out of a total of 6,109 farmers who incurred the levy) deferred repayments of &euro;35.6m in superlevy liability, (out of a total national levy liability of &euro;71.2m). </p><p>The mechanism required the Exchequer to pay the superlevy liability to the EU in full in 2015, and to recover the levy from farmers over the three years from 2015 to 2017.  A wide process of consultation in the design of the scheme was undertaken with farm organisations and co-ops and it was agreed that once the initial farmer instalment was paid in 2015, the optimum repayment model for the balancing payments would involve ten equal instalments from the months of May-September in 2016 and 2017.</p><p>These amounts will be deducted by co-ops from a farmer&rsquo;s monthly milk cheques to coincide with the peak milk supply months of April to August.  The co-ops will then forward the money each month to the Department. This approach was also agreed as part of the sanction given by the Minister for Public Expenditure Reform.</p><p>As part of the discussions in the run-up to the March Council of Agriculture Ministers, Ireland proposed a further deferral of the payment to 2017 and 2018, to ease the financial burden on liable farmers in 2016.  However the European Commission advised that the legal basis for the Regulations under-pinning the scheme are no longer in existence and therefore further amendments were not possible.  While Ireland suggested a possible alternative legal approach, it was clear that the proposal enjoyed very little support from other Member States and was therefore unlikely to succeed. </p><p>On that basis the focus turned to other measures in the package which can be of assistance to Irish dairy farmers to help them through current difficulties, including the doubling of intervention fixed price buying-in thresholds.  I did however raise the matter with Commissioner Phil Hogan, in our recent bilateral meeting, as well as at yesterday&rsquo;s Council of Ministers meeting and encouraged him to reflect again on whether a legal basis could be found to facilitate a further deferral in superlevy repayments for farmers.</p></reply>

Farmers availing of the facility must pay at least one third of the bill in each of the first two years (2015 and 2016) with the balance to be paid in 2017.</p>  <p>  The Department implemented the scheme nationally and 3,741 farmers (out of a total of 6,109 farmers who incurred the levy) deferred repayments of &euro;35.6m in superlevy liability, (out of a total national levy liability of &euro;71.2m). </p>  <p>  The mechanism required the Exchequer to pay the superlevy liability to the EU in full in 2015, and to recover the levy from farmers over the three years from 2015 to 2017.  A wide process of consultation in the design of the scheme was undertaken with farm organisations and co-ops and it was agreed that once the initial farmer instalment was paid in 2015, the optimum repayment model for the balancing payments would involve ten equal instalments from the months of May-September in 2016 and 2017.</p>  <p>  These amounts will be deducted by co-ops from a farmer&rsquo;s monthly milk cheques to coincide with the peak milk supply months of April to August.  The co-ops will then forward the money each month to the Department.  This approach was also agreed as part of the sanction given by the Minister for Public Expenditure Reform.   </p>  <p>  As part of the discussions in the run-up to the March Council of Agriculture Ministers, Ireland proposed a further deferral of the payment to 2017 and 2018, to ease the financial burden on liable farmers in 2016.  However the European Commission advised that the legal basis for the Regulations under-pinning the scheme are no longer in existence and therefore further amendments were not possible.  While Ireland suggested a possible alternative legal approach, it was clear that the proposal enjoyed very little support from other Member States and was therefore unlikely to succeed. </p>  <p>  On that basis the focus turned to other measures in the package which can be of assistance to Irish dairy farmers to help them through current difficulties, including the doubling of intervention fixed price buying-in thresholds.  I did however raise the matter with Commissioner Phil Hogan in our recent bilateral meeting, as well as at yesterday&rsquo;s Council of Minister&rsquo;s meeting, and encouraged the Commission to reflect again on whether a legal basis could be found to facilitate a further deferral in superlevy repayments for farmers. </p></reply>

Specifically in relation to the Dublin region, the Policy acknowledges the opportunity to develop Dublin Airport as a secondary hub.  This will entail utilising the airport assets as efficiently as possible, including optimising existing capacity at the airport.  It also envisages the provision of additional infrastructure to exploit emerging opportunities to expand air service connections for business, tourism, cultural and educational purposes, thereby delivering economic benefits at national level.  In this regard, the development of a second runway at Dublin Airport is one of the goals outlined in the Policy.  In April this year, daa announced that it was commencing the second runway project which should be completed by 2020.  This new runway along with the two existing terminals will provide capacity for the predicted growth in the coming years.</p>  <p>  The National Aviation Policy also takes account of the need to plan for the long term future, and outlines the Department's intention to commission a high level strategic capacity review in 2018 as well as mandating the State airports to carry out reviews of capacity constraints and infrastructure needs at five yearly intervals commencing in 2018.  Given the accelerated growth in passenger numbers and future projections, these reviews may need to be undertaken earlier than was envisaged.  The need for any additional infrastructure, whether they be additional terminals or airports, would be addressed as part of these reviews.</p></reply>

It is up to those two parties to reach a resolution with each other.</p>  <p>  I firmly believe that any intervention by me, or indeed others without a legal function or role in this dispute, is not helpful.  The State has industrial relations institutions which are ready to assist the relevant parties in reaching a mutually acceptable agreement.</p>  <p>  I am clear however that whatever resolution is arrived at between Transdev and its employees must be delivered within the overall contractual framework Transdev has with the State.  There cannot be, and there will not be, any change to that contract which runs until November 2019. I will not be opening the chequebook on behalf of the taxpayer in this matter.</p>  <p>  My focus is to protect the interests of the travelling public, and to encourage the parties to work to resolve their differences.  Any agreement must deliver sustainable wage rates that don't involve higher fares for the travelling public.</p></reply>

It has resulted in significant disruption and losses on all sides.  As the Deputy will be aware significant efforts were made by the Workplace Relations Commission to assist the parties come to a resolution and protracted and intensive negotiations resulted in a set of proposals that were ultimately rejected.</p>  <p>  The Labour Court is closely monitoring this dispute and is available to provide assistance to the parties at a time when it considers it appropriate to do so.  For this reason I do not consider it would be appropriate or necessary to consider exercising powers under section 38 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.</p></reply>
