Previous applications have been refused for reasons provided to the person concerned, the most recent in a letter issued on 7 October 2013 advising of the decision.</p>  <p>  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended.  The fact that a person may have had an application refused does not preclude or disqualify them from submitting a fresh application in the future, however when considering making such a re-application, the person should give due regard to the reasons for the refusal which were contained in the submission attached to the refusal letter.  Any further application will be considered taking into account all statutory and administrative conditions applicable at the time of application.  Detailed information on Irish citizenship and naturalisation is available on the INIS website at www.inis.gov.ie.  The website also contains an on-line naturalisation residency calculator which individuals may find of assistance in establishing if the residency requirements are met. </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-12a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016101200059#WRA01100"><p>I am informed by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) that its shareholdings in companies outside Ireland are held in the global portfolio.  The global portfolio has been restructured and is being sold over time to fund Irish investment commitments as they arise, in keeping with ISIF's mandate to invest on a commercial basis to support economic activity and employment in Ireland.</p><p>In terms of Fossil Fuel exposure, ISIF's equity holdings in the Energy sector are valued at &euro;11 million (0.14% of ISIF's assets under management).  ISIF is also invested in circa. &euro;97 million of short term fixed income investments in energy corporations representing just over 1% of the ISIF's assets.</p><p>Such investments should be considered in the context of ISIF's Irish portfolio and its significant commitment to renewables.  ISIF's investment strategy is aligned with government policy and the State's commitment to make the transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and sustainable economy.  The strategy states that ISIF's &euro;800m energy allocation will include a significant element of renewables investment.  To date such investment commitments include: </p><p>-  &euro;44 million for the &euro;500 million Dublin Waste to Energy project. </p><p>-  &euro;35 million commitment to NTR's onshore wind fund. </p><p>-  Investment in Bluebay SME credit fund which has made loans to Gaelectric and Mainstream, Irish headquartered renewable energy developers.</p><p>-  Being a cornerstone investor in the Irish Infrastructure Fund (IIF) which holds a number of Irish onshore wind assets, forestry, and a designer/manufacturer of high power density high efficiency power supplies. </p><p>As part of its on-going commitment to operate to high international standards ISIF has recently published its Sustainability and Responsible Investment Policy which is available online at:</p><p><i>. </i></p><p>The Policy emphasises climate change as part of the integration of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) into its investment decision making. </p><p>Many major funds internationally have made significant divestments from fossil fuels such as coal, while other such funds have adopted an approach of engagement with energy companies to establish their strategy and positioning for the transition to a low carbon economy.  ISIF continually reviews its carbon exposure and the investment case for companies that may not be aligned with the long term transition to a low-carbon economy.</p><p>The National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, which established ISIF on a statutory basis provides that ISIF shall review its investment strategy after 18 months of operation and that in reviewing its investment strategy shall consult with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and that the Minister for Finance may consult with other Government Ministers, as appropriate.  This review will be completed in Q4 2016 and the issues of decarbonisation and Ireland's long term transition towards a low carbon economy are being considered as part of this process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-12a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016101200059#WRA01400"><p>The Report of the Commission on Credit Unions, published in 2012, made a number of recommendations, including in relation to governance requirements for credit unions.  Recommendations made were agreed by all stakeholders including credit union representative bodies.  These governance requirements set out the role and responsibilities of two key positions within the credit union - those of chair of the board and the manager of the credit union.  Section 64 of the Credit Union Act 1997 (1997 Act) identifies the treasurer as the 'managing director' of the credit union and his/her responsibilities included executive responsibilities such as submitting financial statements to the board.  In order to ensure that the role and responsibilities of board and management do not overlap and that board members have governance rather than executive responsibilities, the Commission recommended that the 1997 Act be amended to remove the role of treasurer and assign executive responsibilities to the management of the credit union.  This recommendation is reflected in section 21 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 (2012 Act). </p>  <p>  More generally, in terms of board composition and competence and capability, under the 1997 Act, board of directors of a credit union must be of sufficient number and expertise to adequately oversee the operations of the credit union while the nomination committee must review the composition of the board for the purpose of identifying any deficiencies in composition of the board.  In addition, under the Fitness and Probity Regime for credit unions, a credit union must not permit a person to perform a Controlled Function (which includes all members of the board) unless it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the person is, amongst other things, competent and capable to perform their role. </p>  <p>  The governance requirements emphasise the importance of, and provide a framework to implement in practice, a separation between the two distinct sets of roles in a credit union, i.e. the executive or operational roles, and the non-executive or governance roles.  This separation allows the respective roles to be clearly defined and for their responsibilities to be distinct.  The executive or operational roles are performed by the manager, the management team, staff and voluntary assistants.  The non-executive or governance roles are performed by the board of directors. </p>  <p>  The governance requirements also require a credit union to have a board oversight committee, an internal audit function, a risk management officer and a compliance officer.</p>  <p>  Under section 63A(4) of the 1997 Act functions of the manager of a credit union include:</p>  <p>  -  updating the board of directors on the financial position of the credit union, including submitting to the board of directors on a monthly basis unaudited financial statements that set out the financial position of the credit union; and</p>  <p>  -  preparing or causing to be prepared such financial reports and returns as may be required by the auditor of the credit union.</p>  <p>  Under section 55(1) of the 1997 Act, one of the function of the board of directors is to review and consider any update of financial statements provided to the board by the manager under section 63A(4)(c). </p>  <p>  Section 111 of the 1997 Act further provides for the preparation of annual accounts in a credit union and requires that the income and expenditure account, balance sheet or statement cannot be published until it has been audited by an auditor, signed by a member of the supervisory committee and a member of the board acting on behalf of the board of directors. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Central Bank that where matters arise in relation to a credit union's accounts the board should ensure that it obtains the necessary clarification to inform it in carrying out its functions in relation to the accounts of the credit union.  In the event that such matters are not addressed to the satisfaction of the board, the board must determine whether it is appropriate for a member of the board to sign the annual accounts on its behalf.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that there is an appropriate framework in place to adequately oversee and manage the preparation and publication of accounts in a credit union.</p></reply>

The Plan was developed in close collaboration with industry.  The plan sets out a collaborative, system-wide response, across Departments, agencies and the education and enterprise sectors aimed at building the domestic supply of graduates from the education system and ensuring Ireland maintains a strong ICT talent pool and promoting Ireland internationally as a centre for high-level ICT skills.  Implementation of the Plan is underway, with oversight of a high level steering group comprising DES, DJEI and representatives from industry and the education sector.</p><p>A number of significant developments have taken place since the ICT Action Plan was published in 2014.  In 2015, my Department published the Digital Strategy for Schools and commenced work on the development of the Regional Skills Fora.  The Department has also commenced funding for the Associate Profession ICT and new Apprenticeship models are now being developed.  The National Skills Strategy 2025 was published in January 2016, which includes a range of relevant actions.</p><p>In this context, the Action Plan for Education includes an action related to the review of the existing ICT Action Plan and publication of a new Plan.  This review has already commenced and it is expected to be completed by Q4 2016.</p><p>Updated data on progress in increasing the supply of ICT graduates levels 8 to 10 and updated projections for the period to 2018 are set out in the following table.  The updated figures show that the actual number of graduates on mainstream programmes at levels 8 to 10 was higher than previously projected for 2014.  The First Destinations Report for the 2014 graduate cohort also shows that a higher proportion of graduates entered the labour market as opposed to pursuing further studies compared to the 2013 cohort.</p><p>These new projections include data for graduate output from publicly funded programmes (publicly funded HEI mainstream programmes at levels 8 to 10 and all Springboard+ programmes) and output from private colleges.</p><p><b>ICT Action Plan target update</b><table><tr><th>Source</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td>L 8/9/10 mainstream net graduate supply</td><td>2,699</td><td>2,669</td><td>2,984</td><td>3,035</td><td>3,435</td></tr><tr><td>L8 ICT Conversion Graduate Supply (1-year full-time)</td><td>523</td><td>633</td><td>852</td><td>888</td><td>888</td></tr><tr><td>L8 ICT Conversion Graduate Supply (2-year part-time)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>499</td></tr><tr><td>Total L8/9  Springboard part-time graduate supply</td><td>574</td><td>674</td><td>436</td><td>203</td><td>203</td></tr><tr><td>Private Colleges (excluding Springboard) L8/9/10 graduate output</td><td>225</td><td>225</td><td>225</td><td>225</td><td>225</td></tr><tr><td>Total Irish-based Level 8+ graduate supply</td><td>4,021</td><td>4,201</td><td>4,497</td><td>4,351</td><td>5,250</td></tr><tr><td>Projected Level 8+ Job Openings</td><td>5,849</td><td>6,512</td><td>6,891</td><td>7,114</td><td>7,284</td></tr><tr><td>74% Target </td><td>4,328</td><td>4,819</td><td>5,099</td><td>5,264</td><td>5,390</td></tr><tr><td>Total NFQ Level 8 - 10 graduates supply as % of job openings</td><td>70%</td><td>66%</td><td>66%</td><td>62%</td><td>73%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Report of the Expert Group, published in July, clearly outlines the funding challenges in the higher education sector and offers a number of approaches and recommendations for consideration.  As committed to in the Programme for Government, I have referred the report to the Education Committee as part of the process for formulating a plan for the future of the sector.  This will ensure that all views can be heard and considered. </p>  <p>  We will require reasonable consensus to enable us to move forward with a realistic and achievable strategy for funding the system into the future.  I shall work with the Education Committee as it analyses all of the options put forward by the Expert Group and hears the voice of all stakeholders.</p>  <p>  While Cassells deals with the medium and long term funding needs of higher education we also have to consider the immediate challenges and these are the subject of discussions currently in the context of Budget 2017.</p></reply>

These networks identify their own common training needs, typically on a regional or sectoral basis.  They also source their own training providers and develop their own learning solutions.  This ensures projects remain enterprise-led and aligned with their needs.  Last year, employer participation in Skillnets training grew by 15% resulting in almost 12,000 businesses collaborating with Skillnets to deliver training provision to almost 40,000 employees.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, an increase of &euro;2 million has been provided under the National Training Funding for Skillnets.</p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers.  25 proposals have been prioritised by the Council for development.  The Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship, the first of the new programmes developed, launched in September.  Further new apprenticeships are due to launch in the coming months in various sectors including medical devices, polymer processing and financial services.  The last number of years have also seen a marked increase in new registrations in the 27 existing apprenticeships.  As a result an additional &euro;20 million is being made available from within the National Training Fund to provide for increased apprenticeship activity in 2017.  This is being funded through savings arising from reduced demand for training for unemployed people in line with the strong growth in employment.</p>  <p>  A new career traineeship initiative, instigated by SOLAS in collaboration with the Education and Training Boards and Enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, is currently being piloted within the Hospitality and Engineering sectors.  Based on the model further programmes are being developed.  A target has been set to achieve 5,000 traineeship registrations by 2019.</p>  <p>   SOLAS is working on the development of a policy framework for employee development within further education and training with reference to the actions and targets as set out in the National Skills Strategy to 2025.  Progress is well advanced and it is planned that the framework will be complete by the end of the year.</p></reply>

Legal advice provided to my Department indicates that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to &ndash; </p><p>-  an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs. </p><p>-  consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).</p><p>-  the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.</p><p>-an independent appeals process. </p><p>Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who might qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The NCSE published a Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act in 2006.  This report concluded that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.</p><p>My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. </p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement remaining sectors of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted.  The level of additional expenditure required would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis.  Accordingly it is not possible to provide an accurate breakdown of the areas in which these costs would be incurred. </p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>These reports include the NCSE policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools, published in 2013, and the Report of the Working Group on a Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for pupils with Special Educational Needs, published in 2014. </p><p>The alternative model was piloted in 47 schools during 2015/16 school year and the effectiveness of the pilot is currently being reviewed.  This review will allow us to take into account the learning experiences of schools, principals, pupils and the views of parents over the course of the pilot. </p><p>It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, I have also committed to consulting with stakeholders to see how best to progress sections of the EPSEN Act that were introduced on a non-statutory basis.</p></reply>

The overall policy of my Department is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with technical solutions available in the market and within required financial parameters.  My Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises. </p>  <p>  A framework involving 14 providers was put in place in 2012 which has ensured improved solutions are available to primary schools.  A recent drawdown off the framework saw approximately 90% of school connections retendered, with over 1,100 schools awarded connections of 30Mbit/s or greater.</p>  <p>  In the case of the school referred to by the Deputy, the provider, who was awarded a contract under the framework, has been unable to provide the broadband service as anticipated due to issues outside of its control.  My Department is currently working with this broadband provider to investigate alternative solutions to put the service in place.</p>  <p>  In general terms, the need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the new Digital Strategy for Schools and my Department will collaborate with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to address this as a priority action.  Work on the implementation of the Strategy is now underway.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic analyses to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.

The review is looking at all aspects of DEIS, including the range and impact of different elements of the School Support Programme, particularly the scope for increased integration of services provided by other Departments and Agencies, in order to improve effectiveness.  </p><p>As I have already announced, among the measures to be included in the plan are a series of pilot schemes aimed at introducing measures which have been shown to work well in improving results for disadvantaged children and students.  The plan is expected to include targeted measures in the areas of:</p><p>-  Supporting school leadership.  We are lucky in Ireland to have exceptionally strong school principals in disadvantaged schools &ndash; even small improvements in supports for and retention and performance of school leaders in these schools can have a dramatic impact on outcomes</p><p>-  Networks and clusters for DEIS teachers and schools &ndash; including greater supported self-evaluation.  Stronger networks of peer groups for teachers can help develop new methods and improve outcomes</p><p>-  Teaching methodologies.  There is evidence that, for example, changing the way literacy is taught to children who struggle can achieve major improvements in results</p><p>-  Explore ways in which the work of schools could be better integrated with other state supports within the community</p><p>The results of pilot programmes will be carefully monitored before any decisions around mainstreaming are considered.</p><p>Also under consideration is the development of a new assessment framework using centrally held CSO and DES data for the identification of schools for inclusion in a new programme to tackle educational disadvantage.  The number of schools to be included in the programme will be determined by this proposed new identification process which will assess all schools in the country, including the two schools in question. </p><p>The Review process has included extensive stakeholder consultation, in particular engagement with relevant education partners. </p><p>The work undertaken by the Technical and Advisory Group is ongoing and its outcome will form part of the Action Plan, when published.  </p><p>It is envisaged that actions arising from a new Action Plan for Educational Inclusion plan will be implemented in the 2017 /2018 school year.</p><p>Further details on the Review Process and the groups involved are available at www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-/.</p></reply>

The summary is now well advanced and will provide updated data on the level of social housing need across all local authorities, broken down in to a wide range of categories including household composition.  Using this data will ensure that new social housing targets are set and funding provided in line with housing need in each local authority area.</p><p>Some 13,800 households are currently being supported by the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme across the 19 local authority areas where the scheme is operational, including eligible homeless households under the HAP Pilot scheme managed by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) for all four local authorities in the Dublin region.  Some 9,500 separate landlords and agents are providing accommodation to those households supported by HAP.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>committed to extending the capacity of local authorities to make discretionary payments, while providing a framework for the review of both Rent Supplement and Ho using Assistance Payment (HAP)  rent limits taking account of geographic variations in market rents.  The Government delivered on this commitment with the introduction of revised HAP and Rent Supplement rent limits with effect from 1 July 2016.  Furthermore, additional flexibility above the existing HAP rent limits was made available to all HAP local authorities from the same date.  Local authorities have been advised by my Department to utilise the 20% discretion where required to meet the needs of any household types, including single or couples without children, to access accommodation in the local rental market.  Since the introduction of the increased HAP rent limits in July 2016, more than 2,500 pre-existing HAP households have received an increase in their level of support.</p><p>At Quarter 2 of this year, 38% of the households who are having their housing need met by HAP were made up of single persons or couples without children.  Furthermore, as indicated above, the HAP scheme permits sharing arrangements, subject to a local authority&rsquo;s agreement, which provides eligible single person and couple households with greater access to sourcing affordable housing.</p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of the scheme, including the effectiveness of rent limits for each household type, under review.  In general, I am very satisfied with how the HAP scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under <i>Rebuilding Ireland: An Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness</i>.</p></reply>

To this end, the Housing Agency, which has lead responsibility for co-ordinating the development of the Strategy, has established a working group to inform the Strategy, with senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself.  Its first meeting was held on 30 September.</p><p>My Department and the Housing Agency are liaising with local authorities and with the Central Statistics Office in order to obtain a better understanding of the numbers, characteristics and reasons why homes are vacant.  A number of local authorities have commenced, or are planning to commence, pilot programmes to identify vacant homes and bring them back into use; these pilot programmes will inform the Strategy.  In addition, the Strategy will be informed by international best practice and experience, and research is also being undertaken in this area.</p><p>Furthermore, a new Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) has recently been announced to assist private property owners and local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to bring vacant houses into social housing use as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists.  The new Scheme will operate initially in Waterford and Carlow and my Department will work closely with other local authorities to roll it out around the country over the course of the next six months.</p><p>I have secured &euro;140m for the successful implementation of this Scheme over the next five years.  This Scheme has significant potential and I am hopeful that it can bring at least 3,500 vacant houses back into productive use between now and 2021.</p><p>In addition, under a new &ldquo;Buy and Renew&rdquo; initiative, my Department will support local authorities and approved housing bodies to purchase private housing units in need of remediation, renew them and make them available for social housing use.  An initial capital provision of &euro;25 million will be available for this initiative in 2017.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  </p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the State pension (contributory) is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.</p>  <p>   Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim.</p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years after that date spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension. </p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  The position of women who were home-makers is being given specific and careful consideration in developing detailed proposals.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from around 2020.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical components to be put in place prior its implementation.  The position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons will be considered very carefully in developing this reform. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

During that time they receive intensive individual support to help them to overcome barriers to employment and are also provided with a range of training and development supports including online modules, career advice, CV preparation and interview skills.  During the year if a person is placed into a job they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to an additional twelve months while in employment.  People who have completed their year long engagement with JobPath may, if eligible, apply to partake in a CE Scheme after they have been assessed by my Department&rsquo;s Case Officers.  </p><p>The following table shows the number of people referred to JobPath per month to September 2016 and the numbers of participants on CE Schemes per month for counties Galway and Roscommon.

These figures do not suggest that there are major problems in these counties in finding CE participants.  While there may be some individual CE schemes experiencing difficulties from time to time, which is to be expected given the significant drop in the Live Register, it does not necessarily follow that such difficulties would not have arisen if JobPath did not exist.  Moreover, in the same period, over 3,500 jobseekers have been supported by the JobPath service.  If there is a CE scheme experiencing particular difficulties in recruitment, the sponsor should contact their local DSP office so that the matter may be reviewed. <table><tr><th colspan="2"><div>Galway</div></th><th>-</th><th colspan="2"><div>Roscommon</div></th></tr><tr><td>JobPath</td><td>CE</td><td>Month</td><td>JobPath</td><td>CE</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>1,525</td><td>Jul-15</td><td></td><td>331</td></tr><tr><td>63</td><td>1,522</td><td>Aug-15</td><td></td><td>326</td></tr><tr><td>127</td><td>1,513</td><td>Sep-15</td><td></td><td>335</td></tr><tr><td>149</td><td>1,436</td><td>Oct-15</td><td></td><td>353</td></tr><tr><td>230</td><td>1,493</td><td>Nov-15</td><td></td><td>349</td></tr><tr><td>72</td><td>1,492</td><td>Dec-15</td><td></td><td>346</td></tr><tr><td>239</td><td>1,477</td><td>Jan-16</td><td></td><td>348</td></tr><tr><td>257</td><td>1,481</td><td>Feb-16</td><td></td><td>352</td></tr><tr><td>209</td><td>1,475</td><td>Mar-16</td><td></td><td>349</td></tr><tr><td>205</td><td>1,487</td><td>Apr-16</td><td></td><td>349</td></tr><tr><td>284</td><td>1,476</td><td>May-16</td><td>30</td><td>354</td></tr><tr><td>323</td><td>1,485</td><td>Jun-16</td><td>60</td><td>353</td></tr><tr><td>323</td><td>1,492</td><td>Jul-16</td><td>72</td><td>353</td></tr><tr><td>400</td><td>1,482</td><td>Aug-16</td><td>99</td><td>349</td></tr><tr><td>324</td><td>1,476</td><td>Sep-16</td><td>68</td><td>346</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>3,205</td><td></td><td>329</td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>JobPath column shows the number of clients referred in the monthJobPath clients exit the services after 12 months.</p><p>CE column shows the number of participants in the month.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame.  Any application received will be considered in accordance with the scheme eligibility criteria, which comprise economic, social and environmental criteria including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management.

These are as follows:</p>  <p>  - During normal working hours i.e. 9am - 5pm Monday to Friday, the Community Mental Health Teams responsible for each age group (children and adolescents, working age adults and older persons) are available to respond to crises.  For existing patients of the service, the usual route is that they contact their community mental health nurse or health and social care professional as appropriate.  For those without previous contact, the route is through the person&rsquo;s GP who requests an urgent assessment.  All mental health teams keep slots for urgent referrals for a person who is acutely suicidal or severely depressed.  On occasion where there is no slot available, the cases booked for that day have to be rearranged to facilitate an urgent assessment. </p>  <p>  - During the above hours a person may present to the Emergency Department.  The Mental Health Division, arising from the Programme for Government investment since 2012, has now ensured that all Level 4 hospitals have a Liaison Psychiatry Service available on the site of the acute hospital.  This service provides prompt assessments in the Emergency Department.  Most Level 3 hospitals now have either a service in place or one is planned with the allocation from the Programme for Government in 2015.  For the latter, recruitment is taking place and where the liaison service is not yet in place the local service has an alternative arrangement whereby the person is assessed by a liaison nurse or NCHD and the consultant on duty for that day provides advice on management. </p>  <p>  - The National Clinical Programme (NCP) for the Assessment and Management of Self-Harm in Emergency Departments began in December 2014.  Under this programme 25 senior mental health nurses at Clinical Nurse Specialist level have been trained and deployed to Emergency Departments.  This facilitates an onsite, rapid response to those who have self-harmed and/or are suicidal.  It supplements and works with the Liaison Psychiatry Service to provide a bespoke response to those who are suicidal or have self-harmed. </p>  <p>  - During the on call period i.e. between 5pm and 9am Monday to Friday and throughout the weekend period, there is a Consultant Psychiatrist together with a Psychiatric Registrar or Senior House Officer on duty in acute hospitals.  This provides the urgent/crisis response to people presenting to Emergency Departments during the on call period.  Since December 2014, this has been supplemented by the development of the Self-Harm Clinical Programme such that where two nurses are available, extended hours are provided to the Emergency Department. </p>  <p>  - In addition, approximately half the areas within the country provide a seven day week contact point for existing patients within the mental health service.  This is provided for existing patients who are thought to require additional follow-up particularly during Saturday and Sunday when there are no clinics operating.  Such patients may attend a designated point such as a day hospital or alternatively the nurse may visit the patient at home.</p></reply>

A simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation scheme  for patients under six commenced in Temple Street in July 2014.  The hospital  had a two-year agreement (July 2014 - June 2016) in place with Beaumont Hospital for theatre access to facilitate an initiative on sequential cochlear implants treatments for previously unilateral implanted children under 6 years of age.  In June 2016, Temple St completed its commitment to accommodate the treatment of all the under 6s children requiring sequential treatment &ndash; 210 in total.</p>  <p>   In relation to the over 6s, this service is provided by Beaumont Hospital.  While Temple Street is willing to have all paediatric cochlear implant services transferred from Beaumont, but this needs to be done in a planned manner, and requires the development of the necessary infrastructure, including theatre capacity,  to support the service transfer to Temple Street.  Until such time as additional capacity is provided at Temple Street, the position is that service for older children continues to be under the remit of Beaumont Hospital, which has also experienced theatre capacity issues.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question relates to a service matter, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy  in relation action underway to address the theatre capacity issues.</p></reply>

However, since it does not have psychoactive properties it is not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  </p>  <p>  While I am aware that CBD oil is sometimes marketed as a nutritional or dietary supplement, it should be noted that it is not authorised as a medicinal product in Ireland.  Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market, the manufacturer must seek an authorisation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) or, in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency.  A determination on an application for authorisation of a medicinal product is based on a rigorous scientific assessment of the application against the criteria of safety, quality, efficacy, legal and regulatory requirements.</p>  <p>  Where a medicinal product is not authorised in Ireland, a licensed wholesaler may import it if it has been prescribed by a doctor for a patient under his/her care, on his/her direct responsibility and in order to meet the special needs of a patient.  Therefore, if a CBD oil preparation does not contain an ingredient which is a controlled substance, such as THC, it may be feasible to have that product imported and used in Ireland, in accordance with specific conditions, should a patient&rsquo;s doctor be of the opinion that this is an appropriate treatment.</p>  <p>  On the wider issue of medicinal cannabis, I am aware that cannabis has been legalised for medicinal use in certain countries.  The Deputy will be aware that a Private Members&rsquo; Bill on this issue was recently published.  My officials are considering the contents of this Bill</p></reply>

Immunisation not only protects individuals, but also others, by reducing the spread of disease.  Immunisation against infectious disease has saved more lives than any other public health intervention, apart from providing clean water.</p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to note the ongoing work by the Irish Cancer Society, NCCP, Health Service Executive and National Immunisation Office to encourage young women to take effective measures to prevent cervical cancer by their support of the HPV vaccine.  The HPV vaccine is safe and protects girls and women from developing certain cancers associated with the HPV.  The combination of a HPV vaccination programme, along with the effective screening programme, has the potential to reduce the incidence of cervical cancers by up to 90 per cent.</p>  <p>  My priority as Minister for Health is to encourage individuals and their families to be fully vaccinated and reduce the risk of cervical cancer.  In relation to HPV I would encourage all young women to receive this important vaccine.</p></reply>

This Committee comprised expertise in the areas of epidemiology, neurology, paediatrics and paediatric neurology.</p>  <p>  The study found that there was a 13 fold higher risk of narcolepsy in children/adolescents vaccinated with the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine compared with unvaccinated children/adolescents. </p>  <p>  The development of narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination is not a uniquely Irish issue.  The results from the Irish data concur with those observed in Finland and Sweden. </p>  <p>  As of 7 September 2016, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 81 reports with clinical information confirming a diagnosis of narcolepsy in individuals who were vaccinated with Pandemrix (80) and Celvapan (1).  The majority of these reports relate to children/adolescents.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills continue to work together to provide a wide range of services and supports for those affected by narcolepsy following the administration of pandemic influenza vaccine.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Advocacy Unit acts as liaison with service and support providers and other Government Departments to facilitate access to required services.  It is in regular contact with individuals affected and regularly meets with representatives of the SOUND (sufferers of unique narcolepsy disorder).  Regional co-ordinators have been appointed to assist individuals by providing advice, information and access to local services.</p>  <p>  The ex-gratia health supports include clinical care pathways to ensure access to rapid diagnosis and treatment, multi-disciplinary assessments led by clinical experts, counselling services for both the individuals and their families, discretionary medical cards for those who have been diagnosed have been provided to allow unlimited access to GP care and any prescribed medication, ex-gratia reimbursement of vouched expenses incurred in the process of diagnosis and treatment, including travel expenses for attending medical appointments; physiotherapy, occupational therapy assessments, dental  assessments and dietary services all on a needs basis. </p>  <p>  As of 10 October 2016, legal proceedings against the Minister, the Health Services Executive and GlaxoSmithKline Biological SA have been initiated by 51 individuals.  The plaintiffs allege personal injury in which they claim the development of narcolepsy (cataplexy) resulted from the administration of the H1N1 pandemic vaccine.</p></reply>

Under the standard means tested medical card scheme, allowance may be made for rent/mortgage, travel to work and child care costs.  Generally, for the over 70's, mortgages have been cleared, children have been catered for and they would not have travel to work related costs.  However, persons aged 70 or older who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds may also have their eligibility assessed under the means tested medical card scheme where they face particularly high expenses, e.g., nursing home or medication costs.  As I have outlined, this assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses and the qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over 70's gross income thresholds.  Furthermore, persons aged over 70 years may still be eligible for a medical card where discretion is exercised where they face undue hardship in arranging medical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.</p>  <p>  The gross income limit for an over 70's medical card was set in legislation at &euro;500 per week for a single person and &euro;900 per week for a couple from 1st January 2014.  Prior to that date, the limits were &euro;600 per week for a single person and &euro;1,200 per week for a couple.  The current gross income limit for an over 70's medical card is equivalent to an annual income of &euro;26,000 for a single person and &euro;48,000 for a couple.  There is a statutory obligation on the Minister for Health to review annually the gross income limits for medical cards and GP visit cards for persons aged 70 and over in light of changes in the Consumer Price Index.  The last review was conducted in September of this year.  No changes were made to the income limits on foot of the review.  All persons over 70 regardless of income,qualify for access to free GP care.</p>  <p>  The data required to calculate a definitive estimate is not held by the Primary Care Reimbursement section of the HSE, therefore it is not possible to provide an answer to the Deputy.  However, it should be noted that there are no proposals at present to amend the income guidelines for the granting of eligibility for medical cards for persons aged 70 and over.</p></reply>

Since bidders were invited to participate in dialogue with the Department, there have been approximately 150 hours of meetings, with considerable more interaction to follow over the coming months.</p>  <p>  The three bidders in the procurement process have formally indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to&ndash;the home solution for rural Ireland.  This means that householders and businesses can expect speeds of not just 30 Mbps but up to 1 Gbps with businesses availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds, in a solution that will endure for 25 years and beyond.  It will also effectively reverse the urban rural divide by giving rural businesses and homes access to a technology which is not widely available in our towns and cities at present.      </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process. </p>  <p>  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given the sensitivity of discussions in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. </p>  <p>  As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country. </p>  <p>  In line with commitments in the Programme for Government I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys in July 2016.  The Taskforce will recommend practical actions that can be taken in the short-term to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland, working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, ComReg, State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The work of the taskforce will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the rollout of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place.  I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the Taskforce's report.</p></reply>

The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of ComReg.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the independence of ComReg, I am critically aware of the frustration currently being experienced across Ireland, where mobile networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  The Programme for Government therefore committed to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  In July, I established the Taskforce, with my colleague, Heather Humphreys.  The Taskforce has already met 11 times and is considering immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Taskforce involves a number of Government Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with ComReg and telecommunications operators.  Measures arising from the Taskforce will be implemented by Government as a matter of priority.  I expect that we will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the Taskforce's report. </p>  <p>  Under the Programme for Government Minister Humphreys is also establishing two regional action groups.  Working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies these groups will help accelerate the rollout of broadband and mobile telecoms services at local level. </p>  <p>  These new structures at a national and local level, are designed to address as far as possible immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage. </p>  <p>  In addition, I intend to sign Regulations over the coming days, which will allow ComReg to proceed with an auction of the 3.6GHz spectrum band in early 2017.  This auction will provide an 86% increase in total harmonised spectrum available for mobile, nomadic and fixed wireless broadband services.  </p>  <p>  I have also secured &euro;8m in the Budget for RT&Eacute; which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to auction this spectrum, which will provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage &ndash; 4G and 5G.  My Department has already established a working group with ComReg and RT&Eacute;, to deliver this important project. </p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in significantly enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland, and particularly in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  In the meantime any customer, including those in County Tipperary and its environs, who experience service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance.  If this fails to resolve matters, customers can refer a complaint to ComReg, who will investigate the service provider&rsquo;s compliance with its contractual obligations.</p></reply>

This can be achieved through the use of State owned lands for such facilities but, in some instances, the purchase of land using compulsory purchase as a mechanism to do so, may also be pursued by the local authority leading the project.  Given the cost of these projects, permissive access is not usually an appropriate model as it does not protect the state's investment.  Most Greenways constructed to date and for which my Department has provided funding were built on state owned land.</p>  <p>  However, I am aware that land ownership issues have arisen in a number of greenways that are currently at planning and/or design stage so it becoming clear that a consistent approach will be required to deal with this in future.  My Department is currently working on developing a Greenways Strategy that will address this issue and many others, including consultation with landowners and possible compensation for land purchase and will be consulting all relevant stakeholders as this is progressed in the coming months.</p></reply>

It will end limitations in access to public contracts, open up markets for services and offer predictable conditions for investors.  I fully support and welcome CETA.  Ireland stands to gain substantially from this agreement and I am looking forward to Irish firms enjoying the benefits and new opportunities as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  CETA will save on duty costs as 99.6% of all industrial tariffs will be eliminated on entry into force.  Irish firms will also benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, thus saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic.  These are some of the benefits of the trade deal with Canada as well as providing new market opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms.</p>  <p>  Given the position taken by Ireland and other Member States, the Commission has submitted CETA to the Council for decision as a mixed agreement.  That is one requiring both EU and individual Member States ratification.  As this process may take a number of years to complete the agreement provides for provisional application.  </p>  <p>  Provisional application is a standard process in Free Trade Agreements.  This provides for the coming into effect of those areas over which the EU has competence.  It will be a matter for the Council and the European Parliament to decide on the signature and provisional application of CETA.</p>  <p>  Following concerns raised in a number of Member State parliaments and this House, the EU now proposes to exclude investment protection and investment dispute settlement from the provisional application of the Agreement.  The EU and Canada are also finalising a legally binding Joint Declaration to provide further assurances in relation to the provision of public services, labour rights, environmental protection and investment.</p>  <p>  The EU and Canada are working towards the signature of CETA at the EU-Canada Summit scheduled to take place on 27 October 2016.  Prior to this, the Council of EU Trade Ministers will meet in Luxembourg on 18 October 2016 to decide on the signature and provisional application of CETA.  </p>  <p>  In accordance with Article 218(8) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the full entering into force of CETA will be subject, in the first instance, to a decision by the EU, through a Council decision with the consent of the Parliament, and secondly by the approval of all Member States through the relevant national ratification procedures.  In this regard, D&aacute;il Eireann will be a part of the final decision to ratify CETA in accordance with Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution.</p>  <p>  In view of these recent developments including the exclusion of the Investment Protection provision from the provisional application of the Agreement and the proposed additional legal guarantee on public services, labour rights and environmental protection, I take the view that all the concerns raised by Deputies in this House have now been addressed.  However, I am available to discuss any remaining concerns with Deputies if required.</p></reply>

An export-led strategy creates a ripple effect in terms of job creation throughout the entire economy as well as an increase in skills and management development, technology adoption, innovation, standards and best practice overall.</p><p>The ambition set out in <i>Enterprise 2025</i>includes the potential for job creation supported by the work of the enterprise development agencies.  The enterprise development agencies are responsible for the attraction of foreign direct investment and for the support of start-ups and scaling enterprises that export, or have the potential to do so.  The exporting sector impacts on the wider economy through re-invested profits and expenditure of wages, materials and services.  It also generates significant downstream effects in areas such as sub-supply and secondary employment.  This impact can be calculated in terms of a multiplier.  The value of the multiplier depends upon the percentage of extra money that is spent within the domestic economy.</p><p>Analysis undertaken to inform the future potential set out in Enterprise 2025 included a review of the multiplier effect of export-led growth.  The multipliers are derived from the Supply and Use in the CSO Input Output Tables.  The employment multipliers used include <i>direct, indirect and induced impacts </i>of agency client firm activity (known as Type II Multipliers).  These take account of demand on the suppliers and so on down the supply chain as well as induced impacts arising through the additional consumption that takes place as a result of the additional employment incomes created through the indirect impacts. </p><p>Based on a robust methodology, sectoral employment multipliers were calculated and applied to the sectoral employment data of agency client firms.  The derived sectoral multipliers for employment were then applied to agency client firm employment data.  Type II Indicators should be interpreted with caution, as they assume that all additional income generated through indirect employment is spent.  It is important to note that employment multipliers are best estimates and may be subject to small changes over time based on structural adjustments in the economy and the composition of the agency client firm base. </p><p>The enterprise development agencies place a strong emphasis on promoting linkages with the domestic economy when they are negotiating with investors and in their assessments of proposals seeking state support.  The agencies have well developed methodologies for assessing the direct and indirect impacts of investments made.</p><p><b>Analysis of Employment Multiplier Impacts of enterprise agency-assisted firms&rsquo; export sales-employment</b><table><tr><th>Food, drink and tobacco</th><th><div>2.55</div></th></tr><tr><td>Chemicals &amp;amp; Pharmaceuticals</td><td><div>1.65</div></td></tr><tr><td>Medical device Mfg</td><td><div>1.88</div></td></tr><tr><td>Computer, Electronic&hellip;</td><td><div>1.40</div></td></tr><tr><td>Other Mfg</td><td><div>1.54</div></td></tr><tr><td>Computer Programming</td><td><div>1.99</div></td></tr><tr><td>Computer Consultancy</td><td><div>1.99</div></td></tr><tr><td>Business Services</td><td><div>1.64</div></td></tr><tr><td>Financial Services</td><td><div>2.42</div></td></tr><tr><td>Other Svcs</td><td><div>1.95</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td><div>1.88</div></td></tr></table></p><p>Based on Forf&aacute;s ABSEI and AES data (2013) [export sales employment] and CSO Input-Output and Supply and Use Tables (2011)  (Indecon analysis)</p><p>The employment multipliers are Type II and include both indirect and induced impacts</p><p>The overall multiplier is derived through the ratio of the addition of the individual sectoral economy-wide impacts to the total enterprise agency direct export sales-employment</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-12a.293.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016101200063#WRE05800"><p>My Department is committed to the provision of high quality and affordable childcare, with a number of initiatives being progressed.</p>  <p>  From September 2016, the extension of ECCE made free pre-school available, for 15 hours per week, for 38 weeks per annum, to all children from the time they turn three, until they go to school.  Children can enter at three points in the year: September, January and April.  On average, children will benefit from 61 weeks, up from the previous provision of 38 weeks.  Access to the average 61 weeks of ECCE can reduce the cost of childcare by &euro;4000 per child.  The previous ECCE programme accommodated 67,000 children and this figure will increase to 127,000 next year.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2017, my Department announced the introduction of the Single Affordable Childcare Scheme, a new national scheme of financial supports for parents towards the cost of their childcare.  The scheme will replace the existing targeted childcare subsidisation schemes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme.  The scheme will provide a system from which universal and targeted subsidies can be provided towards the cost of childcare.  </p>  <p>  It is intended that the new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme will 'wraparound' the ECCE programme so that the two schemes align seamlessly to support access to early childhood care and education.  The two schemes will not be mutually exclusive, in that it will be possible for a child to be simultaneously supported via the ECCE programme and the proposed Single Affordable Scheme, once they meet the qualifying criteria for each.</p>  <p>  The 2016 Programme for a Partnership Government contained two specific commitments in relation to School Age children.  The first was a commitment to introduce a new system to support and expand quality after school care, and the second was in relation to utilising primary school buildings for after school care provision.  In view of these commitments the Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs and for Education and Skills requested senior officials from their Departments to establish a group to consider how best the commitments could be delivered.  The Inter-Departmental Group on School Age Childcare was established in June 2016 and is due to report shortly.</p>  <p>  As part of its work, the Group has considered and assessed the many issues surrounding this commitment, and the funding implications of implementing an after-school scheme for school-aged children.</p>  <p>  Matters to be considered by the Inter-Departmental group included the demand for services and the capacity to provide these and the development of an appropriate quality and standards framework.  In addition, the group will gather data, including existing use of school buildings, and consider collaborative models with existing community or private service providers.</p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has also undertaken consultations with children to identify what children like and dislike about afterschool care and to identify the places where children most like to be cared for after school.  The Inter-Departmental group will consider the voice of the child as part of its deliberations.</p></reply>
