I believe that every institution, region and group can make a distinct and valuable contribution in relation to this important period of our history.  I continue to be impressed by the variety and quality of the proposals being formulated by all these interested parties.   </p><p>  The commemorative programme this year has placed particular emphasis on the centenary of the 1913 Lockout and I would like to acknowledge the achievements of the Lockout 1913 Committee in bringing forward a comprehensive programme that continues to be rolled out.  Supported by the State, and working with partners including Dublin City Council, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the national cultural institutions, universities and VECs, and active groups at community and local level, the Lockout programme attests to the enduring interest in our national history and sets an example for what can be achieved in the coming years. </p><p>I was pleased to be present along with other Ministerial colleagues and public representatives at the Jim Larkin statue in O'Connell Street in Dublin on 31<sup>st</sup>   August last for the National Commemoration of the Lockout, presided over by President Higgins, at what was a very community-oriented commemoration.  </p><p>  I was pleased also that my Department was able last year to provide financial assistance to enable work to commence on the Lockout Tapestry, which is being developed by a large group of volunteers under the supervision of the National College of Art and Design and artists Robert Ballagh and Cathy Henderson. Our partnership will continue with several panels from the Tapestry being exhibited at the National Ploughing Championships next week. The completed result of this tremendous collaborative effort will be displayed in the National Museum of Ireland, Collins Barracks, from 9 October next, when the Museum will also host an exhibition of banners of the labour movement.  I am also pleased to note the special exhibition on the Lockout which has been arranged in conjunction with ICTU at the National Library of Ireland.</p><p>  While official support to the Lockout programme has been largely provided through collaborative arrangements, the financial support to the tapestry project amounted to &euro;30,000 and I will also arrange assistance with the costs arising from the recent re-enactment of Bloody Sunday.</p><p>With projects like the Tenement Museum and through the literature of <i>Strumpet City</i>  , the Lockout 1913 Committee has illustrated for today's citizens the context and events of this troubled time.  Their programme continues, keeping pace with the historic timeline, with the next event marking the support received in Dublin from British workers. </p></reply>

The Easter Rising and the Proclamation of the Irish Republic will be at the centre of the programme and will be marked in 2016.  In keeping with the development of an authentic programme, I anticipate that all the principal sites relating to the Rising and subsequent events will feature in the commemorations.</p><p>  I am working with the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations and partners in government to bring forward projects such as the online release of the Military Service Pensions Archive, which will provide unprecedented public access to primary source material about the Rising. </p><p>  My Department is also working closely with Dublin City Council, which, in relation to the commemoration of the Easter Rising, has a special role in helping to achieve a balance of the various interests that exist in the city. As the national capital and the historic centre of the Rising, the city of Dublin will be the primary location of the centenary commemorations.  Alongside the commemorations, however, the life of the city continues and the disruption of business, transport and services must be kept to a minimum. I believe that the centenary commemorations will have the goodwill and support of all and I will seek to facilitate a consultation process for all parties is established to ensure the optimal outcome. In recognition of the special position of Dublin in the commemorations, I arranged some time ago that officials and a member of Dublin City Council can attend at the meetings of the Oireachtas Group on Commemorations. </p><p>It is my firm belief that the Rising can best be commemorated by placing it in historical context and I have brought forward projects such as the RTE <i>Century Ireland</i>   initiative, which is already charting the lives of the participants in the Rising from their first appearances in public life through to the Rising itself. The centenary of the founding of the Irish Volunteers will be commemorated in November next.  Initiatives next year will include the founding of the Irish Citizens' Army and Cumann na mBan and special commemorative arrangements are being prepared for these organisations. I am particularly keen that the programme would give special attention to the economic and social conditions of the time.  I am very grateful, therefore, for the support of the Women's History Association of Ireland in developing the arrangements for the centenary of Cumann na mBan and the wider issues of women in society at the time, including the campaign for electoral reform.</p><p>  The particular arrangements to be brought forward for Easter 2016 are still under development. I will be very happy to provide more details regarding these arrangements as they are put in place in the lead-in to this important commemoration. However, in this, as with all commemoration events, the guiding principles that will be applied to this event will be inclusion, tolerance and respect.  </p><p>  As always, I would very much welcome the Deputies' views on the commemoration of the Rising and would be happy to discuss any proposals they might have.</p></reply>

The National Parks and the State-owned Reserves are open to the public all year round and are free to visit.</p><p>  My Department's network of National Parks and Nature Reserves is also a major part of Ireland's tourism product. My Department is promoting the greater use of our parks and reserves in a manner which is compatible with conservation and protection of their biodiversity.</p><p>  My Department will continue to develop visitor facilities where resources allow, such as walking and cycling routes, enhanced signage and interpretation. In recent years, my Department has opened modern visitor centres at Ballycroy National Park, Co. Mayo, and Clara Bog Nature Reserve, Co. Offaly, as well as a visitor information point for the Burren National Park in Corofin, Co. Clare.</p><p>  Killarney House in Killarney National Park is currently undergoing a major refurbishment to transform it into the main visitor and interpretative centre for the National Park with a focus on interpreting the Park's natural wealth. This is a major project for my Department and involves collaboration with OPW as project managers and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which has committed funding of &euro;5.2 million towards the project, under its Tourism Investment Programme.</p><p>There are also approximately 750 national monuments in my ownership or guardianship, including Newgrange, the Rock of Cashel, and Kilmainham Gaol. The day-to-day operation of these national monuments is carried out by the Office of Public Works (OPW).  National monument sites are, in general, freely accessible to the public and in many cases, dedicated visitor services, interpretive facilities and guided tours are available.  Information about visitor services at national monuments is available on the OPW's heritage services website at   .  </p><p>  Finally, it should be noted that many areas identified as being of scientific interest, such as Special Protection Areas, Special Areas of Conservation and Natural Heritage Areas, are on private land. My Department works with many stakeholders in caring for, and raising awareness of, the importance of these areas. For example, the joint efforts of my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and local community interests were recognised last week in the presentation, by the Council of Europe, of Ireland's first European Diploma of Protected Areas to the Burren in County Clare. The Burren includes both State-owned and private lands.</p></reply>

Of the 2013 reports, damage has been found to have occurred to 24 monuments; an area surrounding a monument that may contain archaeology has been affected in 23 cases; and no damage has been found in 13 cases.  Investigations are ongoing in the remaining cases. In some cases, damage may be attributable to natural causes, e.g., flooding.</p><p>  All reports of damage to recorded monuments are fully investigated by my Department and, in cases of actual damage, appropriate action is taken to secure the best outcome for the particular site. Actions by my Department in such circumstances may include requiring remedial works by the landowner or occupier, advising the owner or occupier about proper management of the site, rescue excavation, submission of a formal complaint to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a view to a prosecution under the National Monuments Acts, or a combination of these options.</p><p>  All known archaeological monuments, of which there are in excess of 130,000, are entitled to protection under the National Monuments Acts. Generally this requires any person intending to carry out works at, or in the vicinity of, a protected monument to either provide my Department with two months advance notice or to secure my formal consent to the works, as appropriate. Failure to comply with these requirements is subject to severe penalties. The National Monuments Acts also allow me, as Minister, to make a preservation order where I consider a national monument to be at risk. Protection may be extended to previously unrecorded monuments by entering them in the Register of Historic Monuments or the Record of Monuments and Places.  </p><p>  Many monuments are located in the more remote parts of the country and the assistance of local communities is crucial in aiding my Department in their protection.  The vigilance of local people has proved to be of crucial assistance in identifying unlawful interference with archaeological monuments and objects and in their successful investigation and recovery. As I already referred to, prosecutions in respect of damage to recorded monuments are initiated where warranted. There has been a number of successful convictions in the recent past, while several other investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are ongoing. </p><p>  In relation to national monuments in my ownership or guardianship, the National Monuments Service of my Department and the Office of Public Works, which is responsible for care and maintenance of national monuments sites, continues to keep security measures for such sites under ongoing review.</p></reply>

In this capacity, officials from my Department participated in a recent conference on the Georgian Squares run by the Dublin Civic Trust, which was organised to consider the future of the Squares. </p><p>  My Department has also been involved in a number of other activities in relation to Dublin's Georgian Squares, including:</p><p>-participating in a study on the &lsquo;Future of the South Georgian Core&rsquo;, which sought to promote innovative ideas to encourage more people and families to start living in the area once again; and</p><p>-participating in the &lsquo;Merrion Square Innovation Network&rsquo;, a creative initiative, enabled by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and driven by the community and organisations on or around Merrion Square, which have come together to celebrate and promote the Square as a vibrant cultural tourism destination in the city.</p><p>  The importance of Dublin&rsquo;s historic core is also recognised by the inclusion of the Historic City of Dublin on Ireland&rsquo;s current Tentative List for World Heritage status, which was prepared by my Department.  Last week, I hosted a conference for local authorities and community groups to consider the interest in pursuing full nomination of World Heritage Status for these sites, including Dublin. My aim is to encourage consultation within local communities and support local effort for the nomination of world heritage status where that is sought.</p><p>  Fieldwork for the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage survey of Dublin City, being undertaken by my Department, is also in progress. In recognition of its historical neglect, the first area to be recorded includes Mountjoy and Parnell Squares.  I intend that this comprehensive survey of the City will be published in stages over the next few years.</p><p>  Finally, while funding for heritage related projects is currently constrained, I was pleased to be able to allocate some resources to a Structures at Risk Fund in 2011, 2012 and 2013 to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration and which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012.

To date, 1,753 payments have been made in respect of Year 1 of 15, 1,468 payments have been made in respect of Year 2 of 15 and 469 payments have been made in respect of Year 3 of 15. 264 deliveries of turf have also been made. </p><p>  Arrangements for the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs have been made as regards a group from Clara Bog special area of conservation in County Offaly and a group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog special areas of conservation in County Galway. The group from Clara Bog commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June 2012, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have now been accommodated. Turf cutting for the 2013 season took place on this site in April last. My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from the group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog will be able to commence turf cutting in the relocation sites from the 2014 turf cutting season.</p><p>  Progress has been made with a view to the relocation of 7 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation in County Kildare to Timahoe North, County Kildare, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na. My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season, provided that final agreement is reached with them.</p><p>  Progress has also been made with a view to the relocation of a small group of 3 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynamona Bog and Corkip Lough special area of conservation in County Roscommon to Togher, County Roscommon, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na. My Department envisages that this group of qualifying turf cutters will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season, provided that final agreement is reached with them.</p><p>  I am advised that of the remaining 49 raised bog special areas of conservation, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 32 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites. Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation due, for example, to the small number that had been cutting turf on these sites during the relevant five year period and would qualify for the relocation option available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.</p><p>  Relocation is a very complex process, in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, the infrastructure/drainage works required, establishing the number that can be accommodated on the site, the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements. In that regard, Bord na M&oacute;na has assessed in the region of 60 potential relocation sites at the request of my Department. Bord na M&oacute;na has also commenced negotiations with landowners in relation to the purchase or long-term lease of sites.</p><p>  There are 2 raised bog special areas of conservation in County Kildare affected by the cessation of turf cutting - Ballynafagh Bog and Mouds Bog. 57 applications for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme have been received and acknowledged by my Department in respect of Ballynafagh Bog and 106 applications have been received and acknowledged by my Department in respect of Mouds Bog. 28 and 40 of these groups of applicants, respectively, have expressed an interest in relocation to a non-designated bog. 55 payments and 9 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of the applications received from Ballynafagh Bog and 95 payments and 52 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of the applications received from Mouds Bog.</p><p>  Lattins Bog, also known as Mouds North Bog, in County Kildare has been identified as a potential relocation site for turf cutters from Mouds Bog.  Bord na M&oacute;na has produced a preliminary suitability assessment report and stratigraphy assessment report for the relocation site, which my Department has provided to the Secretary of the Committee of the Kildare Turf Cutters Association. Bord na M&oacute;na has undertaken a full assessment for the site and it is expected that the assessment report will be provided to my Department shortly. My Department intends to provide a copy of the report to the Kildare Turf Cutters Association.</p><p>  There are also 2 natural heritage area raised bogs in County Kildare designated under national law in accordance with the provisions of the Wildlife Acts - Carbury Bog and Hodgestown Bog. In May 2010, the previous Government decided that turf cutting should come to an end on all raised bog natural heritage areas at the end of 2013. However, as set out in the Programme for Government, the current Government undertook to review the situation with regard to raised bog natural heritage areas.</p><p>  This review is currently underway and the future of turf cutting on such sites is being considered as part of that review. It is my intention that the review will provide clarity for turf cutters and landowners in advance of the 2014 turf cutting season and my Department will be contacting individual landowners and turf cutters on these sites in due course.</p><p>  With regard to Coolrain Bog raised bog special area of conservation, Bord na M&oacute;na undertook a preliminary suitability assessment and a stratigraphy assessment of a potential relocation site for turf cutters from this bog, on behalf of my Department. On the basis of these assessments, contact has been made with the landowner with a view to purchase or long-term lease of the site for relocation.</p><p>  A payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf, per annum is available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to applicants while awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs. </p><p>  Following the D&aacute;il motion of 7 March 2012, which called on the Government to &ldquo;engage actively with the European Commission to seek a resolution within the terms of the Habitats Directive, and to prepare and submit a National Raised Bog Restoration Plan to the Commission as a matter of urgency&rdquo;, I secured the agreement of the European Commissioner for the Environment for the development of a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, in keeping with the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke. The approach of the national plan may unlock some flexibility, within the terms of the EU Habitats Directive, in regard to the most difficult of sites, where relocation options are limited.</p><p>  My Department has engaged a team of specialists who are undertaking the necessary scientific work to underpin the national plan and to inform the future restoration and management of each of the special areas of conservation. This work is being overseen by an independent steering group with input from the Peatlands Council.</p><p>  If it becomes apparent, following detailed analysis, that no relocation possibilities exist for a particular special area of conservation, then a case can be made to the European Commission for a more flexible approach, as provided for in the Habitats Directive. I hope that a draft of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan can be published by November.  It will be essential that the proposed approaches in the draft plan are discussed and agreed with turf cutting communities in advance of its submission to the European Commission. </p><p>  The clear majority of domestic turf-cutters on the raised bog special areas of conservation are now engaging with my Department in finding acceptable solutions within the law. The door is still open for others to engage in this process with me, my Department and with other stakeholders to address the needs of turf cutters and other interested parties. Such engagement would, I am sure, help to address the needs of turf cutters more speedily.</p></reply>

Since coming into office, I have placed a high priority on addressing the implications of a number of findings against Ireland by the European Court of Justice regarding deficiencies in implementation.</p><p>  Ireland has been found against in four separate cases relating to inadequate transposition or implementation of these Directives. While these cases have largely been resolved, a number of additional pre-court infringement cases are also being addressed by my Department and the European Commission.</p><p>  The European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, which I signed into law in September 2011, bring legal clarity in regard to obligations under these Directives in respect of a range of consent processes. These updated regulations, along with changes to the Planning and Development Acts, clarify the legal responsibilities of public authorities and of citizens in regard to the protection of endangered species and habitats. They also provide tools for relevant public authorities to pursue those who commit offences.</p><p>  A comprehensive designation programme being undertaken by my Department of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs), known collectively as the Natura 2000 network, is now almost complete.    Measures are being taken to ensure that particular pressures on protected birds, species and habitats are addressed in terms of regulation and practice. These include a wide range of activities, including, but not limited to, aquaculture and fishery licensing, planning and development, forestry consents, agricultural practices, recreational activities in certain areas, turf-cutting on certain sites and arterial drainage.</p><p>  Compensation or financial incentives may be payable in respect of land within Natura 2000 sites in a number of ways. Significant amounts of EU and Exchequer funding are provided through the rural development programme, operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which provides for a range of supports for farmers, including specific payments in respect of areas selected for designation under the Birds and Habitats Directives.</p><p>  My Department also administers a small-scale farm plan scheme, which supports farmers in adopting appropriate management practices in the Natura 2000 network. These include supports for sheep destocking on western hills, for managing land for corncrakes and hen harriers, and, separately, as part-contribution to schemes such as the Burren Farming for Conservation Programme. It should be noted that the main farm plan scheme operated by my Department is currently closed to new applicants.</p><p>  In addition, my Department has also put in place a comprehensive compensation scheme for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bogs selected as SACs under the Habitats Directive.</p><p>  Expenditure so far this year by my Department on these schemes amounts to some &euro;4.86 million.

This relocation interim legal agreement provides for the payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum, while these applicants are awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs. </p><p>-The third is a relocation final legal agreement. This agreement has been issued to qualifying turf cutters where a site has been assessed as suitable for relocation and is ready, or can be made ready, for use for domestic turf cutting. </p><p>  Turf cutters who sign and return the applicable legal agreement to my Department will also receive a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500. </p><p>  The interim legal agreement is required in the case of relocation sites because, for the majority of raised bog special areas of conservation, the relocation site and the terms and conditions applicable to those sites will take time to finalise. Turf cutters are being asked to sign the interim agreement on the understanding that when a relocation site is sourced, assessed and agreed, they will be asked to sign a final legal agreement at that time. If it is not possible to find a suitable relocation site, for example, for reasons of quality or quantity of turf, planning requirements, or issues in relation to the purchase or lease of a site, then my Department will consult with turf cutters as to the best option to take at that time.  </p><p>  I am satisfied that the legal agreements as set out above are appropriate to the circumstances in these cases.</p><p>  It is the aim of my Department to secure a relocation site for every person who has applied for one and progress is being made in that task. However, relocation is a complex process that does take some time to deliver. The agreements being issued reflect this reality. The interim agreement is designed to give all stakeholders the time to deliver relocation options that work for turf cutters. The clear directions that I have given my officials is to examine all relocation options with a view to securing alternative cutting locations for as many turf cutters as possible within the shortest timeframe.</p><p>  1,518 legal agreements have been issued and my Department is continuing to issue agreements to qualifying applicants. Applicants have been requested to return the completed legal agreements within four months of the date of issue. 920 legal agreements have been returned to my Department thus far. However, the numbers of legal agreements by type issued by and returned to my Department are not available at this time.</p></reply>

On the basis of that review and in line with many other areas of Government expenditure, considerable savings have been made in thus programme area in recent years. Under the Croke Park and Haddington Road reform programmes, we now gone beyond what was contemplated by the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure. Indeed, savings of the order of 20-25% in the Exchequer allocations to the Cultural Institutions have been made since 2010.</p><p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, the Government agreed a range of reforms under the Public Service Reform Plan 2011 for a number of the national cultural institutions under the aegis of my Department. I have previously advised the House of the shared services models that will be deployed across the National Museum, the National Library and the National Archives through my Department in relation to corporate support services and by formal inter-institutional agreement in relation to operational services.  Regular meetings have been taking place between my Department and senior management in the National Library, the National Museum and the National Archives to implement a human resource shared support service function, which will be provided by the Human Resource Unit of my Department and will cover all HR matters arising in the bodies.  The intention is that the Shared HR Support Services will be implemented on an administrative basis, pending enactment of enabling legislation.  In respect of the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Crawford Art Gallery Cork, the three Galleries are in the process of agreeing and implementing a range of corporate support and operational shared services.</p><p>  The focus within my Department and the National Cultural Institutions has been concentrated on the implementation of the Government's Reform Agenda.  There has been an intensive engagement by all in that process.  That engagement will continue, including a focus on what can be achieved across a range of shared services such as communications, procurement, security, retail services and marketing.  </p><p>  It is expected that operational and support savings in the region of approximately &euro;1 million will be initially realised from the reform programme across the institutions involved which are funded from my Department's Vote Group, with further savings to be identified as the various cost efficiencies are implemented.  Savings are also arising from the decision of Government to reduce the numbers serving on boards, advisory councils or similar structures at the cultural institutions and to bring an end to the payment of fees for these positions. A further benefit from the rationalisation of support and operational services will be a less crowded administrative landscape, resulting in greater democratic accountability, less duplication of effort and clearer lines of responsibility for the citizen.  It will also allow the institutions to focus on their core objectives of service to the public.</p></reply>

The then Government agreed to cover the full capital costs of the project, which were estimated at that time to be of the order of &euro;35m.</p><p>  It was always the intention that the Ulster Canal project would be funded from the Waterways Ireland annual allocations, as agreed through the annual estimates processes in this jurisdiction, as well as the deliberations of NSMC in relation to annual budgets.  It was a key consideration throughout the process that the Ulster Canal project would be supported by a significant level of projected income from the commercialisation of certain Waterways Ireland assets. However, as the Deputies will be aware, the economic downturn has had a negative impact on those plans.</p><p>  In the meantime, the Ulster Canal project is progressing on an incremental basis. Planning approvals have now been secured for the project in both jurisdictions.  I welcome these developments, which, I am sure both Deputies will agree, are a significant milestone for the project.</p><p>  I am continuing to explore all possible options to advance this project within the current fiscal constraints. In this regard, an Inter-Agency Group on the Ulster Canal has been established to explore and examine ways to advance the project and to examine possible funding options for it, including existing funding streams and the leveraging of funding from other sources, including EU funding options.</p></reply>

A range of the actions that have been taken to support The Gathering were outlined in my replies to Questions No. 16 of 28 November 2012, No. 13 of 30 January 2013, No. 120 of 13 March 2013 and Questions 16 and 163 (taken together) of 30 May 2013.  </p><p>  Throughout 2013, my Department has worked to encourage linkages between the cultural area and The Gathering initiative.  As outlined previously, Culture Ireland, as the section of my Department responsible for the promotion of Irish arts worldwide, has included as a grant condition for 2013 events that grantees, when presenting their work, should promote The Gathering and encourage their audiences to embrace the initiative.  </p><p>  In addition, national cultural institutions under the auspices of my Department have identified special exhibitions to link in with The Gathering.  I also understand that a great number of arts organisations funded by the Arts Council, particularly those involved in festivals, are participating in The Gathering.  </p><p>  The Deputy is also aware that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta developed a dedicated scheme to support events and festival in the Gaeltacht as part of The Gathering initiative.  </p><p>  I consider that my Department and its agencies have made a substantial contribution towards ensuring a strong linkage between the cultural area and The Gathering and that this will promote and enhance the artistic image of the country.</p></reply>

It provided records from 2011, building on collaboration between my own Department (National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service), the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine (Regional Veterinary Labs) and the Department of Finance (State Laboratory). </p><p>  Birds of prey, such as eagles and harriers, are an indicator of the state of Ireland&rsquo;s ecological health. They are also a key part of our heritage and of great benefit to tourism. I am, therefore, committed to pursuing the perpetrators of any deliberate poisoning and persecution incidents. </p><p>  However, the report also showed a substantial number of unintentional incidents, mostly through secondary poisoning where the birds appear to have eaten rats that had themselves been poisoned. Therefore, I welcome the setting up of an Irish Campaign for Responsible Rodenticide Use, which will be launched at the National Ploughing Championships next week. Officials of my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will sit on the advisory board of the Campaign.  I am hopeful that alerting people to the need for great care in the use of rodenticides will reduce the number of secondary poisoning incidents. </p><p>  The second annual report, detailing relevant incidents for 2012, is due to be published soon.</p></reply>

As Chair of the National Famine Commemoration Committee, I represented the Irish Government at the 2013 International Famine Commemoration ceremony at Hyde Park, Sydney, on Sunday 25<sup>th</sup>   August 2013 where over 450 people were in attendance. </p><p>  In addition to representing the Government at famine-related events, I attended a number of meetings to engage business/trade contacts and meet Enterprise Ireland clients. I also attended a Tourism Ireland networking event to promote Ireland's rich tourism product and engaged with a range of media, political, sports, cultural and Irish community contacts in Australia. I visited the Penrith Gaels Club and the Irish Australian Welfare Board, where I met with Irish emigrants and members of the local community. </p><p>  During my visit, I held a number of meetings and made contacts at Governmental level. These included meetings with Prof. Marie Bashir, Governor of NSW, Mr. Greg Smith, MP, NSW Attorney General/Minister for Justice, Mr. George Souris, MP, NSW Minister for the Arts, and Ms. Robyn Parker, MP, NSW Minister for Environment and Heritage. We discussed issues of common interest between the two countries, including the creation of jobs, emigration and the Irish economy.  </p><p>  I also had engagement with a range of practitioners in the culture, heritage and language sectors, including a visit to the University of Sydney's Department of Celtic Studies and a visit to the Royal National Park.  </p><p>  Throughout this official visit, I was very pleased to see the political goodwill to Ireland and the keen interest in Irish culture which exists in Australia and I believe that my visit will yield a number of important benefits over the period ahead. In this regard, I have asked officials in my Department to progress opportunities to deepen the artistic and cultural exchange between Ireland and Australia, with a view to also enhancing commercial and trade opportunities between both countries.</p><p>  In relation to the costs arising for the trip, these are itemised below. The delegation was small, consisting of myself, my private secretary and one accompanying official. The total cost for the trip was of the order of &euro;17,000 as follows: </p><p>-Flights - &euro;13,032</p><p>-Accommodation &amp;amp; subsistence - &euro;3,247</p><p>-Transport/car hire - &euro;635</p><p>-Incidental - &euro;165.</p></reply>

The Government's policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, to increase access to and participation in the arts, and to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life. </p><p>  The Government appreciates the importance of the arts, culture and the creative industries to both our society and to our economy.  The arts sector continue to offer vital opportunities for the provision of important cultural, social and employment benefits to communities throughout the country.  </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels, throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council.  The Council is funded by my Department and is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations, including funding decisions.  In 2013, the Arts Council will receive an allocation of over &euro;60.6 million in current, capital and EU Presidency funding.  Details of all funding provided by the Arts Council to arts practitioners, arts groups and venues, including arts centres, are available on the Council's website at . In a wider context, the Arts Council support of a range of arts forms is set out in its strategic overview document entitled <i>Developing the Arts in Ireland: Arts Council Strategic Overview 2011-2013</i>  . In this strategy document, which is available on the Council's website, its work and key strategic principles that inform its funding decisions are laid out.</p><p>  The nature of employment within the arts sector encompasses a very wide range of activities.  It can include those engaged in the arts practice within specific artistic genres and can also encompass areas which flow from such artistic pursuits.  It may also embody the whole industrial creative sectors, including the audiovisual production sector.</p><p>  The Government appreciates and values the contribution the arts sector makes to the internationally renowned artistic reputation of this country.  Within the current economic constraints, investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity of the sector. In October 2012, the Arts Council published its latest update of the Assessment of the Economic Impact of the Arts in Ireland and it is available on the Council's website.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">As the Deputy will be aware, in the Government's </font><i><font color="#2F2F2F">Action Plan for Jobs</font></i><font color="#2F2F2F">, there are 11 specific actions in the areas of arts, culture and creative enterprise which are to be undertaken by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the agencies under its remit. The relevant actions are set out in section 7 of the Plan and I look forward to continuing progress in relation to these actions in the period ahead.</font></p></reply>

They provide a clearly measurable way to track progress in the fight against global poverty.    The Goals are central to Ireland&rsquo;s development programme, and to our renewed policy on International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, which reaffirms our commitment to the fight against poverty and hunger as an integral part of our foreign policy. Next week, with the T&aacute;naiste, I will participate in a special international meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York which will review progress on the MDGs as 2015 target date approaches, and discuss ways to accelerate progress over the next two years.</p><p>  It is clear that while there have been very significant achievements under the MDGs since the turn of the century, progress on the Goals has been mixed.  As a result of the scaling up of development assistance, and the partnership which we and other donors have built with Governments and communities in the developing world, the targets set in some vital areas will be met by 2015.  For instance, the overall extreme poverty rate will be halved, as will the proportion of people without access to clean drinking water.  Considerable progress has been made in education, especially enrolment at primary level, and in addressing the HIV/ AIDS pandemic. However, less positively, some targets remain significantly off-track, notably in the areas of maternal health and maternal mortality, access to sanitation and the fight against extreme hunger, which is a central priority of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme.  We believe it is essential that the entire international community strengthens and accelerates its efforts to achieve the remaining targets by 2015. </p><p>  The Government is firmly committed to Ireland&rsquo;s overseas aid programme.  Our new Policy clearly restates our commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA) when economic circumstances permit. </p><p>  Over the past two years, the Government has broadly stabilised the budget for development assistance.  This is a very significant achievement in the context of the very difficult conditions facing the country.  </p></reply>

Projects administered by the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland must satisfy strict criteria to receive EU PEACE III funding and are monitored in this regard by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) and the relevant lead departments; the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government and the relevant Departments in Northern Ireland.  My Department&rsquo;s Reconciliation and Anti-Sectarianism funds have supported community and educational outreach activities by individual Orange lodges both in Northern Ireland and in this jurisdiction.  Each project application is assessed individually and the purpose of any funding is to support local initiatives aimed at tackling sectarianism. It is the responsibility of individual lodges in receipt of government funding to honour their obligations to address sectarianism.   Each project in receipt of funding is assessed and reviewed.   Only projects which have met the criteria of the Funds are considered for further funding.   I believe that funding has helped support progress towards greater reconciliation in Northern Ireland and on an all-island basis, built on meaningful dialogue based on the principle of respect.  In this context, I welcomed the decision by the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland to allow individual Orange lodges to engage in discussions with community and residents&rsquo; groups. </p><p>  More progress is required. The events of this Summer, and the ongoing protest parades in Ardoyne point to a need to progress meaningful dialogue further and I again urge the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, and all Loyal Orders, to promote and to engage in dialogue based on the principle of respect with residents&rsquo; groups.</p></reply>

This decrease in goods exports is largely explained by a sharp, but not unexpected, fall in chemical and pharmaceutical products, which account for 60% of our goods exports. In this connection, the patent cliff has been well signalled and is built into the Government's approach to encouraging export growth. </p><p>The Export Trade Council (ETC), which I chair and which includes representatives from the relevant Departments and state agencies, oversees the implementation of the targets in the Government's Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy; <i>'Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy, 2010 - 2015</i>  '. The Strategy does not provide a breakdown of goods exports targets on a yearly basis but does set out concrete targets in trade, tourism and investment to be met by 2015, as well as a programme of actions to achieve these targets. Relating specifically to exports, these targets include: increasing the value of exports by agency assisted indigenous companies by 33% and diversifying the destination of indigenous exports. Progress in meeting these targets is evaluated by Forf&aacute;s and is reviewed during the bi-annual ETC meetings.  In May of this year, I reported to Government that with close collaboration between the Embassy network, state agencies and relevant Departments, progress towards the 2015 targets is continuing and is on track.</p><p>  My Department and its Embassy network support Enterprise Ireland Ministerial led trade missions, which make a significant contribution to encouraging trade in our goods exports. In 2012, trade missions organised with the active support of the Embassy network and involving Enterprise Ireland client companies, secured over &euro;200 million in new and additional contracts. This year, I led a trade mission to Turkey during which contracts of over &euro;30 million were agreed. My colleague, the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Mr. Joe Costello TD., has led trade missions to Canada and Benelux; and will also lead a trade mission to South Africa &amp;amp; Nigeria in November.  </p><p>  Over the St. Patrick's Day period, I attended the IDA event, 'Invest in Ireland' Business Leaders Forum, organised in conjunction with our Consulate General in Atlanta, as well as holding a number of meetings with major US and Irish companies operating in the area. My programme for Washington DC included meetings with President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry, and a number of high level political meetings during which the Transatlantic Trade &amp;amp; Investment Partnership and Ireland's economic recovery were among the items discussed.</p><p>  My Department also co-ordinates Joint Economic Commissions (JECs) with a number of high growth and emerging countries: Republic of Korea, Russia, China, Saudi Arabia and Libya (currently in abeyance). The focus of JEC discussions with these countries is on key priority sectors for the Irish export sector and for inward investment into Ireland. In 2012, my Department, in close collaboration with the relevant Departments and state agencies, held JECs with China and the Republic of Korea and is in the process of organising JECs with Russia and Saudi Arabia.</p></reply>

According to reports received, an incident occurred on the afternoon of 9 July 2013 when seven Israeli Defence Force soldiers and an officer were involved in detaining a five-year-old Palestinian child.  The child was detained in Hebron after he reportedly threw a stone at a car belonging to a settler.  I understand that he was taken home and then transferred with his father to the Palestinian police. No charges were filed and both father and son were released.   Under Israeli military law the age of criminal responsibility is 12.Ireland has raised this incident in human rights discussions with EU partners in Israel, and it was agreed that the EU will include this incident in human rights concerns raised in the context of EU political dialogue with Israel.  The EU has developed agreed priority actions on the protection of children in armed conflict as part of the EU strategy on human rights in Israel.

While, as the IAEA report notes, certain activities at some of these facilities contravene resolutions of the IAEA Board of Governors and of the UN Security Council, the Agency nevertheless continues to verify the non-diversion of declared material at these facilities and LOFs.   However, the Agency also reports that, because Iran is not providing the necessary level of cooperation to the IAEA in the conduct of its verification activities, and by virtue of the fact that Iran has not implemented its Additional Protocol, which would facilitate enhanced verification, the Agency is simply unable to provide credible assurances to the international community regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran.  For this reason, it is unable to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is for exclusively peaceful activities.  This is not acceptable.</p><p>  To restore international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme, I believe it is now essential for Iran to move quickly to engage with the IAEA to resolve all outstanding issues which the Agency has raised on behalf of the international community regarding Iran's nuclear programme and activities.</p><p>  The Deputy knows that Ireland has chosen not to use nuclear power for the generation of electricity, but that we recognise the sovereign entitlement of each State to decide upon its own energy mix.  We support the entitlement of States, including Iran, to access nuclear energy for peaceful uses under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).  It is essential, however, that in claiming this entitlement under the NPT, all States, without exception, recognise that they are obliged to demonstrate the exclusively peaceful nature of their nuclear activities through the IAEA safeguards system.  Iran has not yet moved to fully meet this requirement and I call upon it to do so.</p><p>  The Deputy may be assured that Ireland will continue to support fully the NPT in all fora.

Our partnership with Non-Governmental Organisations represents a very important element in this effort.  Funding for small to medium-sized development projects is primarily allocated through the Irish Aid Civil Society Fund.  Applications are invited each year for new projects of up to three years in duration, with a maximum annual grant allocation of &euro;200,000.     The call for proposals for the 2013 funding round was issued to all eligible Irish NGOs in February 2013.  A limited number of international organisations were also invited to submit proposals, based on specific policy priority areas.   The particular priority areas for the funding round were the fight against global hunger, the promotion of human rights, gender inequality and the prevention of gender-based violence. Standard eligibility criteria applied, including confirmation of an organisation&rsquo;s charitable status, public availability of audited accounts and a dependency limit on Aid funding of below 60%.</p><p>It is a requirement that all projects funded have a strong focus on delivering results for communities in some of poorest regions of the world.  Irish Aid engages independent external professionals to carry out the technical appraisal of the project proposals and to make recommendations to an Approvals Committee in Irish Aid. All applications are appraised on the following criteria:</p><p>evidence that the organisation operates from a sound strategic policy and financial basis;</p><p>proven evidence of outcomes from previous projects;</p><p>logic of the intervention;</p><p>evidence of capacity to track results;</p><p>governance and financial oversight;</p><p>coherence with the policies of the aid programme.</p><p>In total, 23 applications were received for funding in the 2013 Civil Society Funding round and, of these, 17 were approved as set out in the following table:</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Name of Organisation</div></th><th><div>Total Amount Requested for Project</div></th><th><div>Total Amount Approved for Project</div></th><th><div>Project Duration<br />Years</div></th></tr><tr><td><blockquote>B&oacute;thar</blockquote></td><td><div>&euro;600,000</div></td><td><div>&euro;600,000</div></td><td><div>2013-2015</div></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Christina Noble Children's Foundation</blockquote></td><td><div>&euro;37,300</div></td><td><div>&euro;37,300</div></td><td><div>2013</div></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>ECPAT International</blockquote></td><td><div>&euro;450,000</div></td><td><div>&euro;450,000</div></td><td><div>2013-2015</div></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Edith Wilkins Street Children Foundation</blockquote></td><td><div>&euro;185,700</div></td><td><div>&euro;37,800</div></td><td><div>2013</div></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Global Witness Trust</blockquote></td><td><div>&euro;600,000</div></td><td><div>&euro;600,000</div></td><td><div>2013-2015</div></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>International Commission of Jurists</blockquote></td><td><div>&euro;316,400</div></td><td><div>&euro;316,400</div></td><td><div>2013-2014</div></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH)</blockquote></td><td><div>&euro;600,000</div></td><td><div>&euro;600,000</div></td><td><div>2013-2015</div></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Irish Family Planning Association</blockquote></td><td><div>&euro;600,000</div></td><td><div>&euro;250,000</div></td><td><div>2013-2014</div></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Irish National Teachers Organisation</blockquote></td><td><div>&euro;34,150</div></td><td><div>&euro;10,000</div></td><td><div>2013</div></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Martin Ennals Foundation </blockquote></td><td><div>&euro;120,000</div></td><td><div>&euro;105,000</div></td><td><div>2013-2015</div></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Nepal Leprosy Trust (NLT)</blockquote></td><td><div>&euro;83,300</div></td><td><div>&euro;75,800</div></td><td><div>2013-2015</div></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>The Social &amp;amp; Health Education Project</blockquote></td><td><div>&euro;386,840</div></td><td><div>&euro;386,400</div></td><td><div>2013-2015</div></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>The Spiritan Zambia Orphan Fund</blockquote></td><td><div>&euro;29,900</div></td><td><div>&euro;10,000</div></td><td><div>2013</div></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>The Support Africa Foundation</blockquote></td><td><div>&euro;517,200</div></td><td><div>&euro;100,000</div></td><td><div>2013</div></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>UCC - Department of Food Business &amp;amp; Development, UCC</blockquote></td><td><div>&euro;166,434</div></td><td><div>&euro;32,000</div></td><td><div>2013</div></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>UPR- INFO</blockquote></td><td><div>&euro;180,000</div></td><td><div>&euro;120,000</div></td><td><div>2013-2014</div></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Wateraid UK</blockquote></td><td><div>&euro;449,611</div></td><td><div>&euro;449,611</div></td><td><div>2013-2015</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Governor Brown and I had a very useful meeting on a range of issues.  We discussed the common economic issues facing both Ireland and California - the challenges in the global economic environment, tackling public finances and our shared interest in key sectors like technology and clean energy.Many Californian multinationals have operations and create jobs here in Ireland, which has been and remains enormously beneficial to our economy. Similarly California is a key centre for Irish companies with over 50 Irish companies having offices there and a further eight to ten new operations established in California by Irish companies each year, mostly technology companies.  The trend is increasing and Governor Brown and I were pleased to note that the economic relationship between Ireland and California is very strong. We spoke too about our strong cultural and community links. </p><p>The Governor and I also discussed the prospects for comprehensive US immigration reform, which is an important issue for California, as well as being of particular interest to us with regard to the undocumented Irish in the USA.</p></reply>

High Representative (HR) Ashton's opening remarks touched upon Water Diplomacy and the critical importance of water security for international peace and security, and an update on the situation in Myanmar/Burma. Council conclusions were adopted on both of these issues.</p><p>There followed a discussion on the latest developments in some of Africa's most troubled and conflict ravaged regions - the Great Lakes, Somalia and Mali.</p><p>On the Great Lakes, Ministers welcomed the Framework Agreement for Peace, Security and Cooperation and the appointment of Mary Robinson as the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy to oversee the implementation of the Agreement, which offers an important opportunity to bring a resolution to the crisis. On Somalia, we welcomed the announcement of details for the New Deal Conference in Brussels on 16 September. This event represents a concrete demonstration of the progress that Somalia has made towards re-establishing peace, stability and security. Ministers also acknowledged the significant positive progress that has been made since the French-led intervention in Mali   earlier this year, and underlined the importance of the elections as the next major step forward in the process of full restoration of constitutional order on the whole territory of Mali.</p><p>  In my intervention under this item, I emphasised the critical importance of breaking the cycle of violence in all three conflicts.  I particularly welcomed the Framework Agreement on the Great Lakes and articulated Ireland's strong support for the role of the UN Special Envoy Mary Robinson. On Somalia, I welcomed the holding of a Conference in September and recalled Ireland's ongoing commitment to the country, with over &euro;41million provided to aid agencies operating in Somalia since 2007. I also paid tribute to the important work being carried out by the EUTM Somalia. Finally, on Mali, I joined with other Ministerial colleagues in acknowledging the significant advances that have been made over the last few months.</p><p>Ministers engaged in an extensive discussion on the unfolding political crisis in Egypt  . HR Ashton briefed us on her recent trip to Cairo and her meetings with the interim Presidency, the Egyptian Army and representatives from the Muslim Brotherhood. I and other colleagues emphasised the importance of ending violence and starting a fully inclusive political dialogue as the only real way out of the crisis. I took the opportunity to thank HR Ashton and her team - notably the EU Special Representative Bernardino Le&oacute;n - for their work in Egypt.  We adopted Council Conclusions, which inter alia urged the interim authorities to act with restraint, and drew attention to the critical economic situation in the country. </p><p>In the human rights  area, the Council discussion focused on implementation of the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy as adopted in June 2012. Ministers expressed their full support for the implementation of the human rights package and the work done to date by the EU Special Representative in highlighting the EU's policies on human rights. In my intervention I drew particular attention to the increasing threat to civil society in many countries. In this regard, I informed partners of an Irish initiative for a resolution on space for civil society, that has been introduced at the current session of the Human Rights Council running until the end of September. </p><p>The discussion on Eastern Partnership preceded a meeting of EU and Eastern Partnership countries which took place directly after the Council. EU Foreign Ministers reviewed progress in relation to Associated Agreements and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTAs) with the Eastern partner countries in advance of the Vilnius Summit at the end of November. </p><p>On Syria, there was a short exchange of views over lunch on the state of play at that time. Clearly the situation has deteriorated dramatically since our July discussions, but at the Council meeting, I joined with my Ministerial colleagues in emphasising the importance of the 'Geneva II' process and repeating Ireland's commitment to do the maximum to alleviate the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>Ministers discussed the latest developments in the Middle East Peace Process.  The Council welcomed the resumption of direct negotiations between the two parties, paying tribute to US Secretary of State John Kerry's efforts in this regard, and discussed ways in which the EU could support the process. In my intervention, I highlighted ongoing concerns regarding Settlement activity and the viability of the Two-State solution, and welcomed the fact that Ministers would return to a discussion on the Peace Process in the autumn.  </p><p>Finally, the Council discussed issues relating to Lebanon and agreed to designate the Military Wing of Hezbollah   on the list of terrorist organisations. This decision does not prevent our ongoing dialogue with all political parties in Lebanon, or the delivery of EU assistance to the country. The position will be reviewed on a six monthly basis in keeping with the regular timeframe for reviewing such decisions.</p></reply>

When deployed, Corps members primarily fill specific skills gaps identified by four UN standby partner organisations: the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR); the World Food Programme (WFP); the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); and the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF). The roster currently comprises 192 individuals with specialised skills in areas such as child protection, gender, humanitarian coordination, information management, logistics, public health, and WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene). The 2013 recruitment exercise is intended to increase the number of experts on the roster and strengthen capacity in specific areas.   Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps is in high demand and members fill key skill gaps in humanitarian emergencies, a testament to the effectiveness of the recruitment and training process over the past number of years. Since the establishment of the Corps in 2007, members of the roster have deployed on 206 occasions to 42 countries. There are currently 13 members from the roster on deployment in 8 countries (Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Somalia and South Sudan) supporting the humanitarian relief operations of our UN partner agencies.</p><p>  Recruitment of Rapid Response Corps roster members is undertaken on an annual basis through a panel interview process. The 2013 recruitment notice was advertised on the Irish Aid website, the D&oacute;chas (Irish NGO umbrella body) website and through the communication channels of UN Standby Partner agencies.  My office received a total of 57 applications and following a short-listing process, 35 people were called for interview.</p><p>  Short-listing is based on an assessment of the quality of applications received. Roster members are required to hold an appropriate technical qualification and possess substantial relevant professional experience, preferably in a humanitarian context, demonstrate a commitment to humanitarian values, and be in a position to deploy at short notice for periods of 3 to 6 months.</p><p>The 2013 recruitment process is still ongoing.  Panel interviews were completed on Wednesday 11th September and the Interview Board report and decisions are currently being considered for approval by my officials.  Successful candidates will be invited for induction training, which will take place from the 14th to the 24th   of October 2013. This training course, which can cater for up to 20 people, is mandatory for deployment and is delivered in partnership with the Irish Defence Forces.</p><p>  The subsequent selection of roster members for deployment is undertaken by the UN agencies by matching skills, experience and competencies with the vacancy. When an Irish roster member is selected by the UN Partner, Irish Aid makes all the necessary travel and preparatory arrangements (visa, travel, insurance and medical) and provides ongoing support throughout the deployment.</p><p>  The Rapid Response Initiative was externally reviewed in 2011 and was highly praised as a practical example of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to delivering on the core humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, and independence. The review found that the Corps was effective in targeting Irish assistance at some of the most serious crisis situations in the world and alleviating suffering in a wide range of contexts -  both sudden onset as well as prolonged complex emergencies.</p></reply>

The new arrangements responded to the evolution of EU institutional structures and practices following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, in particular the increased role of the European Council. They also reflected the need to ensure effective coordination and strategic direction of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the EU across the whole of Government.  Almost two years on, I am pleased to state that the arrangement is working very well. Systems are in place to ensure effective coordination and communication between the two Departments and our EU Missions on matters of EU policy. Officials from both Departments maintained close and regular contact in the lead up to, and throughout, the successful EU Presidency in the first half of this year and this contact will be maintained into the future.  </p><p>  On the matter of diplomatic postings, the standard duration of assignments at First and Third Secretary and equivalent levels to posts at Missions abroad is about four years, although they can be for longer or shorter periods depending on location and a number of other considerations.  Posts at these levels are normally rotated in the months of July and August, in line with the Department&rsquo;s Planned Posting Policy.  No decisions regarding postings for next year have yet been made.</p></reply>

The Moroccan Embassy in Dublin was headed for some years by a Charg&eacute; d'Affaires, but since 2009 Morocco has been represented here at Ambassador level. The Irish Ambassador to Portugal is accredited to Morocco.  Ireland also has two Honorary Consuls in Morocco; in Agadir and Casablanca respectively. Agreements with Morocco are mostly negotiated and agreed at EU level, and co-operation is advanced within the framework of the EU-Morocco Association Agreement.  As regards bilateral agreements, the 'Convention between Ireland and Morocco for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income' entered into force on 10 September 2012. There have been several official bilateral visits between Ireland and Morocco.  Recent visits  include an Oireachtas delegation, led by Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator Paddy Burke, which visited Morocco from 4-8 November 2012.  The delegation met the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Presidents of the House of Representatives and Senate, and the President of the Consultative Royal Council for Sahara Affairs. The Moroccan Minister for Industry, Trade and New Technologies, Mr. Abdelkadir Aamara, visited Ireland to participate in the Africa-Ireland Economic Forum in October 2012.</p><p>Earlier, former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern made an official visit to Morocco in January 2001. </p><p>Ireland's stance on the issue of Western Sahara is a point of difficulty with Morocco, but both Governments have shown their determination that this should not dictate the tenor of our relations. Ireland's bilateral relations with Morocco are very good. Increasing numbers of Irish people visit Morocco, there are Moroccan citizens working here, trade is growing, and, more generally, Morocco is keen to develop cooperation and relations with the EU.

The Passport Service continues to work on a number of service enhancements and I would like to see this process completed before further consideration is given to any transfer.  There are security implications in the outsourcing of passport processing.  Best international practice, as advised by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, recommends that, at a minimum, the entitlement checking process be undertaken by a public service agency.  In this context, I do not envisage changes to the Passport Service operating arrangements at present.   The Passport Service maintains regular contact with the broad Justice sector, including weekly meetings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is critical in maintaining the high international regard given to the security of the Irish passport issuance processes.  I envisage that the close working relationship, already in place, will only be further enhanced over the coming months.</p></reply>

The purpose of my visit was to strengthen the high-level political engagement necessary to deliver on the Strategic Partnership Agreement between Ireland and China, to support Irish companies doing business in China, to promote Ireland as a tourist destination, and to promote Ireland as the best investment location for Chinese businesses looking to expand in Europe. The Strategic Partnership Agreement between China and Ireland was adopted in March last year during the visit of the Taoiseach to China, and extends to all areas of our bilateral relationship including political, diplomatic, trade, investment, agriculture and food, education and tourism. In the period since it was agreed, there has been impressive progress made in Irish-Chinese relations.  Eight Irish Government Ministers have visited China promoting trade and other links.  On the Chinese side, there have been visits to Ireland by ten Ministers or other senior figures in the Chinese administration.  </p><p>Irish trade with China is now worth over &euro;8 billion a year, with a strong trade surplus in Ireland's favour.</p><p>During my visit, I had a number of high-level political engagements, including with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Wang Yi; with a member of the State Council, Chairman Yu Zhengsheng; and with Minister Wang Jia Rui, Minister at the Communist Party International Department.  At these meetings, I stressed the potential for increased investment and economic co-operation, and took the opportunity to promote Ireland as an education destination.  I also raised the issue of access to the Chinese market for Irish beef.  I had the opportunity also to discuss wider political issues, including human rights issues, EU-China relations, and current international developments.</p><p>During my visit, I announced that Ireland has secured full market access to China for salmon exports, which represents a sizeable opportunity for Irish salmon exporters, with demand for high-end seafood in China growing substantially each year.  This followed intensive negotiations with the Chinese authorities by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) in conjunction with the Irish Embassy in Beijing.</p><p>Further, Dublin Airport Authority signed a twinning agreement during my visit to establish a Sister Airports partnership with Beijing Capital International Airport, which will allow the two companies to co-operate to further commercial and tourism links between the two cities.  The agreement aims to enable the two airports to engage in a joint marketing initiative to improve airline services between Dublin and Beijing. </p><p>I held a number of engagements pursuing key priorities, including exports, food and agribusiness, education, tourism, targeting of investment, and support for Irish companies doing business in China.  These included engagements organised by Tourism Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Bord Bia. </p><p>I had meetings with a number of Chinese companies interested in investing in Ireland and potential partners for Irish exporters.  These included Shanghai Bright, Huawei, Yanhua, the Bank of Communications and ChinaCache.  I addressed approximately one hundred Chinese and Irish partner company senior executives at a business event organised by Enterprise Ireland.  This allowed me to present Ireland's key strengths both as an investment destination and as a trading partner.  I also witnessed the signing of a number of significant memoranda of understanding, including one between IDA Ireland and the Shanghai Foreign Investment Development Board, which has responsibility for outbound investment.  </p><p>I attended networking events organised by the Irish Embassy in Beijing and the Consulate General in Shanghai, which provided the opportunity to meet a wide range of official, business and cultural contacts.  I addressed a promotional event organised by Tourism Ireland in Shanghai which was attended by over 100 representatives of the Chinese travel industry, including airlines, travel agents, tour operators and media.</p><p>While in Shanghai, I addressed the Shanghai Returned Scholars Association, a non-government network of influential senior academics, business people and officials, as well as the graduates of the Ireland-Shanghai Senior Officials Training Programme, which has improved awareness of Ireland and our influence, including on trade/investment-related issues, among key municipal government commissions. </p></reply>

We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level on international observation missions for elections and constitutional referendums.  Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but have also been involved in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre.    Election observations missions for the Presidential elections in Zimbabwe in July were limited to Zimbabwean and wider African organisations.  Ireland did not receive a request to participate in an election observation mission. The most significant missions undertaken were by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU) and the Zimbabwe Electoral Support Network (ZESN).</p><p>  In their preliminary assessments, both the SADC and AU observation missions emphasised the peaceful conduct of the elections. Both missions acknowledged weaknesses in the electoral process, particularly in regard to the late publication of the voters&rsquo; roll, the large numbers of voters being turned away, and the high number of assisted voters. In their preliminary report, the ZESN cited similar concerns and expressed the view that &ldquo;the election was seriously compromised by a systematic effort to disenfranchise an estimated million voters&rdquo;. A statement on 22 August by the EU High Representative, Catherine Ashton, on behalf of the European Union, commended the people of Zimbabwe on the conduct of peaceful elections. The EU welcomed the constructive role played by the SADC, the AU and domestic observers during the electoral process and shared the serious concerns raised in their initial assessments. </p><p>  On 2 September, the SADC observation mission published its final report, which broadly endorsed the election as &ldquo;free, peaceful and generally credible&rdquo;.  Ireland and our partners in the European Union are now considering our position on Zimbabwe, most notably in respect of the restrictive measures which were introduced by the EU in the aftermath of the political violence which surrounded the previous election in 2008. In doing so we will continue to consult with regional partners and organisations, particularly SADC and the AU. The EU has underlined the importance and need to continue strengthening reforms in Zimbabwe to ensure that future elections are fully transparent and credible as well as peaceful. Our goal is to support the Zimbabwean people in achieving a more prosperous and democratic Zimbabwe, and to work towards the full normalisation of relations between Zimbabwe and the EU.  I look forward to discussing this issue with my EU colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council in the near future.</p></reply>

This follows on from intensive negotiations with the Chinese authorities by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) in conjunction with the Irish Embassy in Beijing.  The conclusion of these negotiations represents an important step in the ongoing opening of the Chinese market for Irish seafood.  Negotiations will continue with the Chinese authorities with a view to expanding the diversity of Irish seafood available on the Chinese market.   With the support of the Irish Embassy in Beijing, the SFPA began discussions in 2009 with the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ), the Ministry responsible for import controls in China, with the objective of facilitating the expansion of trade of Irish seafood into China.  These discussions, and the visit of a Director from the AQSIQ to Ireland, resulted in agreement on health certificates, which opened up the Chinese market for live fishery products from Ireland as well as enhancing the basis for trade in other fishery products. </p><p>Since, the quantity of Irish fishery products certified for export to China by the SFPA in 2010, 2011 and 2012 was approximately 5,700 tonnes, 1,400 and 4, 400 tonnes respectively.  High volume frozen fishery products include Mackerel, Horse Mackerel and Blue Whiting. Emerging markets include both crab and boarfish.  According to the CSO, exports of seafood have grown from &euro;5.7m in 2010 to &euro;10m in 2012, which represents a 74% increase. </p><p>SFPA's relationship with Chinese authorities is an important underlying basis to the continued market access for Irish seafood to China.  International trade in food involves reciprocated trust in food control systems, and the SFPA works hard to maximise the benefit of the high standards to which Irish seafood companies adhere. </p></reply>

Through our Malawi Programme Ireland supported the Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS to host the Joint Nutrition review which was held from the 5<sup>th</sup>-7<sup>th</sup> of August 2013. This was the first such joint review bringing together the<font color="#004080"> </font>Ministries of Health, Agriculture, Education, Science and Technology, Local Government and Gender all of which are engaged in the national nutrition response. The objective of the review was to assess the performance of the nutrition programme and to identify challenges and resource gaps.</p><p>  The review noted very significant progress in a number of areas including an increase in the number of school going children benefitting from school meals, the establishment of Nutrition Rehabilitation Units at district level and strengthened coordination structures at community, district and national levels. The importance of addressing nutrition in a multi-sectoral way is being promoted especially through District Nutrition Committees. This is making a real difference in the lives of millions of Malawians.</p><p>  This review also offered the opportunity for participation of Ireland's Missions in Sierra Leone and Tanzania in sharing the experiences and progress made in their respective countries, as well as key issues and challenges encountered in addressing nutrition. This technical exchange provided good cross programme learning and will improve planning for future nutrition interventions in Malawi, Tanzania and Sierra Leone.</p><p>  While good progress has been made through Ireland's and other donor support, Malawi continues to face significant challenges. 80 per cent of the population depend on subsistence farming and the susceptibility of the country to droughts and flooding means that Malawi faces a continuing struggle to ensure that its people have enough food to survive. The extent of the problem of hunger in Malawi is reflected in its nutrition indicators; more than one in five children under five years old are under-weight; one in 20 suffers from acute severe malnutrition; stunted growth is widespread, particularly in rural areas. Continued investment in efficient and effective nutrition interventions will remain a key component of our support to the people of Malawi. </p><p>  Ireland's support to Malawi commenced during the food security crisis in 2002 when assistance was channeled through Irish and international aid agencies. The Embassy in Malawi opened in November 2007. Building on our own experience and analysis of the long term needs of Malawi and in consultation with the Government of Malawi, the current Country Programme was developed and approved in March 2010. The Programme will run to 2014 with a total anticipated budget of &euro;66 million over the five years. The goal of the Country Programme is to ensure households are better nourished, food secure and less vulnerable to poverty.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s position is that consensual, same-sex relationships should not be criminalised and we strongly support measures to ensure that the right to freedom of expression and association can be enjoyed effectively by all. </p><p>  Therefore, we strongly disagree with the recent Russian legislation and have made our position known to senior officials at the Russian Embassy in Ireland. As I have previously stated in the D&aacute;il, such legislation, while purporting to protect young people, is more likely to result in the further stigmatisation and, indeed, criminalisation of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI) young people. </p><p>  Legislation of this type is already the subject of discussion in international fora. Last year at the OSCE, for example, Ireland and twenty-six other participating States issued a joint statement deploring similar legislation which had been adopted by the St Petersburg legislature. </p><p>  I have made LGBTI rights a Human Rights priority.  Speaking as EU Presidency earlier this year at the Human Rights Council, I reiterated the EU&rsquo;s grave concern over incidents of discrimination and violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. I said this issue needs to remain on the agenda of the UN.</p><p>  The particular matter of legislation is also being addressed within the EU. I fully endorse the statement made by the EU&rsquo;s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, on 20 June in which she expressed concern over the recent Russian legislation including in the context of the ongoing pressure of civil society in Russia.  I strongly support her call on Russia to uphold its national and international commitments to non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of association and assembly, in particular in the framework of the Council of Europe, to protect the enjoyment of these rights by all individuals. </p><p>  Moreover during Ireland&rsquo;s recent Presidency of the European Union, the EU adopted Guidelines to Promote and Protect the Enjoyment of all Human Rights by LGBTI Persons. The Guidelines state unambiguously that legislative initiatives that criminalise public discussion and/or expression of homosexuality (including the prohibition of &ldquo;pride marches&rdquo;) violate the human rights of LGBTI persons.</p><p>  I have asked officials in my Department to engage actively on this issue and explore what avenues can most effectively be pursued in voicing our concerns, possibly together with our EU partners.  Discussions are already underway within the EU on how best to ensure that our concerns are kept firmly on the agenda of the Union&rsquo;s structured dialogue with Russia.  That dialogue includes specific consultations on Human Rights with Russian officials, the next round of which should take place this autumn.  Ireland will continue to participate actively in the EU&rsquo;s preparations for these and other senior-level meetings with Russian representatives.    </p><p>  For my part, I will express Irish concerns at my next meeting with a Russian minister.</p></reply>

In this context, we look forward to the outcome of the planned European Commission fact-finding mission to Gibraltar, which is likely to include an examination of questions which have arisen in the context of the dispute, including those relating to border controls and the free movement of people and goods.  Together with the European Commission and the Governments of other EU Member States whose citizens have been affected, Ireland will be anxious to ensure that the relevant EU legislation is fully respected.

The safety of both diplomatic and local staff has been a concern during this period, and access to the Embassy has sometimes been difficult, especially for local staff. My Department has monitored this position closely, in consultation with the Embassy, and we have not so far had to consider closure.    Deputies will be aware in recent weeks of the Embassy&rsquo;s work in relation to the case of four Irish-national siblings currently detained in Cairo. The Embassy has liaised closely with the family and visited the detained citizens on several occasions. This work continues and would obviously be impossible without a working Embassy in the country. </p><p>  From a political perspective, it is more important than ever to keep diplomatic relations and communications open. Our Embassy enables us to deliver strong and direct messages to the Egyptian authorities. It also allows us to remain fully up-to-date with developments on the ground.  Egypt remains in a state of transition and faces difficult choices.  Egyptians are anxious about the future of their country. In my discussions with EU partners at the extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council meeting on Egypt on 21 August, there was wide agreement that we needed to remain firmly engaged with Egypt, and to deliver clear messages, both of concern at some recent developments but also a great willingness to extend neighbourly assistance to Egypt at this time.   No EU partner has closed their Embassy in Cairo.</p></reply>

These accounts are detailed in the table below and are in addition to four Twitter accounts and one Facebook account operated centrally by my Department. As of last month, we had a combined total of almost 34,000 followers on Twitter alone.

The Council Decision which established the EEAS in 2010 stipulated that Member State diplomats should represent at least one third of all staff at Administrator (AD) level. On the whole, there has been good progress made towards achieving this &ldquo;one third&rdquo; target, with recent figures indicating that the percentage of EU Member State diplomats working in the Service stands at 32.9%. In terms of Irish representation at the EEAS, there are currently seven officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade serving with the EEAS. This represents 2.36% of the total number of EU diplomats working at the EEAS, which is slightly higher than Ireland&rsquo;s overall percentage of the EU&rsquo;s population. In addition, there are 37 Irish nationals working for the EEAS including, at the most senior level, David O&rsquo;Sullivan, who holds the post of Chief Operating Officer of the Service. An Irish national was also recently appointed to the position of Head of Mission in Rwanda.    Member State diplomats are free to apply for published posts, including at the level of Head of Mission. Those officers that meet the criteria for an individual post and are shortlisted based on their experience and expertise, are ultimately interviewed by the EU High Representative for the Foreign and Security Policy. The Department takes all reasonable steps to support the candidacies of Irish applicants for EEAS posts. Officers who are offered positions in the EEAS have been and will continue to be granted special leave for the duration of their assignments. </p><p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that Ireland is adequately represented in the EEAS and indeed in all EU structures. I can assure the Deputy that this subject is kept under regular review. </p></reply>

This facility is provided for the purposes of Presidential, General, European Parliament and Local Elections as well as bye-elections and Constitutional Referenda.

As this was an informal meeting, there are no council conclusions or formal decisions taken. However, we had some useful discussions on current foreign policy issues, not least the ongoing crisis in Syria. We began with a discussion on <b>Security and Defence</b> issues, which will be considered by the European Council in December. This followed a discussion by Defence Ministers the previous day. Ireland is engaging in these discussions at both official and ministerial level, which are focused on efforts to strengthen EU capabilities to improve the effectiveness, visibility and impact of the EU Common Security and Defence Policy.  We then went on to consider preparations for the <b>Eastern Partnership Summit</b>   which will take place in Vilnius on 28-29 November, and which will review progress by the six partner countries (Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Belarus) in the reforms necessary for the conclusion of Association Agreements with the EU. The EU will continue to do all it can to support these countries in the reform process in the lead up to and following the Summit meeting. </p><p>  We had detailed discussions on<b> Syria</b>  , in light of clear indications of the large-scale use of chemical weapons on 21 August.  EU Foreign Ministers agreed that the chemical weapons attack in Damascus represents an unacceptable violation of international law and that every effort should be made to prevent further recourse to such weapons; that the United Nations is the appropriate and legitimate forum for addressing these issues; that the Security Council must unite to agree a resolution; that there equally must be accountability for the perpetrators of this atrocity; and that only a political solution can ultimately bring peace to Syria. The EU also undertook to continue its strong support and leading role in international humanitarian relief efforts to assist Syria. </p><p>  We were joined by US Secretary of State John Kerry for our discussions on Syria and on the <b>Middle East Peace Process</b>  . In relation to the latter, Secretary of State Kerry updated EU Foreign Ministers on his successful efforts to re-launch peace negotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian sides, and on progress in relation to those talks. I and my EU colleagues, for our part, committed to doing all we can to support the process. </p><p>  The statement by the EU High Representative following the Gymnich meeting can be accessed at the below link:</p><p><i><font color="#0000FF">h</font></i></p></reply>

This commitment was strengthened by the publication earlier this year of our new Policy on International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo; which clearly sets out our vision for a sustainable and just world, and our goals and areas of focus for the coming years. It also reaffirms the centrality of the aid programme to our foreign policy.   </p><p>  The new policy clearly restates the commitment in the Programme for Government to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA) when economic circumstances permit. </p><p>  Over the past two years, the Government has broadly stabilised the budget for development assistance - a significant achievement in the context of the very difficult conditions facing the country. For 2012 Ireland contributed almost &euro;629 million to ODA, representing 0.47% of GNP.  For 2013 we have allocated a total of &euro;622 million to ODA. These represent very significant allocations of public funds and a genuine investment on behalf of the Irish people in assisting those less fortunate than ourselves. </p><p>  The Estimates process for Budget 2014 is now well under way. The Budget will be framed in the context of the Government&rsquo;s overall fiscal consolidation strategy. The  Departmental budget allocations for 2014 will be a matter for Government decision and will be announced in the Budget Statement. </p></reply>

These are: the Emigrant Services Advisory Committee; the Advisory Group of the Global Irish Network; the Ireland - United States Commission for Educational Exchange (The Fulbright Commission); the Irish Aid Expert Advisory Group; the NGO Standing Committee on Human Rights; the Standing Committee on Holocaust Education, Research and Remembrance; and the Monitoring Group on Ireland's National Action Plan for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325.</p><p>The primary role of the Emigrant Services Advisory Committee (ESAC)   is to provide advice on the allocation of grants to Irish community organisations in Britain under the Emigrant Support Programme. The Committee consists of thirteen members, including two officers from our Embassy in London who act as Chair and Secretary to the Committee. The external members serve in a voluntary capacity.  </p><p>  The members were appointed this year for a two-year term.</p><p>A key message taken from participants at the 2011 Global Irish Economic Forum was the desire for members to be involved in coordinating the work and future direction of the Network.  In response to this, I established the Advisory Group for the Global Irish Network  , which I chair.  The Group is charged with overseeing the implementation, where appropriate, of the initiatives which emerged from the Forum and coordinating the overall work programme for the Global Irish Network  The 19 members appointed to the Group represent the main geographic areas represented at the 2011 Forum in Dublin Castle.  It is serviced by the Irish Abroad Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in close cooperation with other Departments and State Agencies which also attend the meetings. The external members act in a voluntary capacity. </p><p>The members of the Advisory Group were appointed for two years in March 2012.  However, in advance of the next meeting of the Global Irish Economic Forum on 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup>   October, it is not possible to determine the number or nature of vacancies that may arise once this term concludes.</p><p>There are currently two vacancies on the Board of the Ireland - United States Commission for Educational Exchange (The Fulbright Commission)  . Both of these vacancies are for ordinary members of the committee. A call for expressions of interest has been issued on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. </p><p>  The Commission was established on the basis of the 1991 Educational Exchange (Ireland and the USA) Act and has eight members, four of whom are Irish citizens appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I made three appointments on 14 February 2013 and one position was left unfilled. One member of the board recently resigned their position due to changing circumstances which has resulted in the second vacancy. The members of the Fulbright Commission do not receive any remuneration.  </p><p>The Irish Aid Expert Advisory Group was established in 2010, following a recommendation in the 2008<i> Management Review of Irish Aid</i>  .  Its role is to offer independent expert advice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State for Trade and Development on the strategic direction of the aid programme. </p><p>  The group has seven members, including a Chairperson and an ex-officio member from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They are appointed by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on the basis of experience.  The ex-officio member is appointed following a nomination from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  There are currently three vacancies on the group (including the ex-officio position) and a process is already underway for filling these.  There are no other anticipated vacancies within the next six months. </p><p>  Members receive an allowance of &euro;2,000 per year for their work plus expenses. The Chairperson has waived her allowance of &euro;3,000 per year.  The ex-officio member does not receive an allowance. </p><p>The DFAT NGO Standing Committee on Human Rights   is an informal Committee compromising representatives of Irish human rights NGOs and experts who serve in a voluntary capacity, as well as officers of my Department. The purpose of the Committee is to provide a framework for a regular exchange of views between my Department and representatives of the NGO community on human rights issues. The Committee is chaired by the head of my Department's Human Rights Unit. There are no vacancies in the Committee's membership nor is any anticipated within the next six months. The Committee members are appointed by me and the members are not remunerated. </p><p>The DFAT Standing Committee on Holocaust Education, Research and Remembrance   is an informal Committee compromising representatives of the Holocaust Education Trust Ireland; the Irish Jewish Museum; the Herzog Centre; and Trinity College Dublin, all of whom serve in a voluntary capacity, and of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Education and Skills; and Justice and Equality. The purpose of the Committee is to provide a mechanism to help coordinate Ireland's engagement with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) which Ireland joined in 2011. The Committee is chaired by an official of my Department. There are no vacancies in the Committee's membership nor is any anticipated within the next six months. The Committee members are appointed by me and are not remunerated. </p><p>Arising from a commitment in Ireland's National Action Plan for the implementation of UNSCR 1325, in October 2012, I appointed Ms. Liz McManus as independent chair of the Monitoring Group   formed to oversee progress on the implementation of the Plan. This position is not remunerated and is not anticipated that it will become vacant in the next six months.</p></reply>

The general view of the Council, which I supported, was that the EU needed to show clearly that the violence that had occurred was unacceptable, while making it clear that we remained ready and willing to assist Egypt in this difficult and anxious period.   The Council adopted Conclusions which set out EU policies in response to recent events in Egypt. The Council stated clearly that the actions of the security forces were disproportionate;  it condemned all acts of terrorism and violence; called for an end to violence and for the relaxation of exceptional security measures; urged all parties to engage in dialogue and reconciliation for the restoration of Egyptian democracy; called for the protection of fundamental freedoms for all Egyptians; and agreed to review EU assistance to Egypt. Member States agreed to suspend export licences for equipment which might be used for internal repression, reassess export licences and review security cooperation with Egypt; and reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s willingness to support efforts towards an inclusive political dialogue.</p></reply>

On 28 August I issued the following statement:   &ldquo;I repeat my condemnation of the recent gas attacks in Syria. The horrific consequences of the illegal use of these armaments against a civilian population are appalling and an affront to the values of the United Nations. The use of these weapons has rightly been outlawed for almost a century. The deliberate use of chemical weapons against a civilian population is a very serious war crime. </p><p>  There are growing international concerns that the attacks were probably carried out by the Syrian Government. The evidence the inspectors find on the ground may also be critical in clarifying who was responsible.</p><p>  The UN Security Council is the appropriate forum for determining the response of the international community. I call on all members of the Security Council to fulfil their responsibilities under the UN Charter to reach agreement on the necessary measures to uphold international law and protect the fundamental rights of the Syrian population.  I also reiterate my call for the Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court to ensure that those who commit or order war crimes and crimes against humanity are held accountable.  I reiterate that only a political solution can bring peace to Syria.   </p><p>On 14 September I made a further statement:</p><p>&ldquo;I welcome the announcement of the agreement between the US and Russian negotiating teams on the elimination of Syrian chemical weapons.  The possession of chemical weapons is fundamentally unacceptable to the international community and their use under any circumstances is a crime under international law. The framework agreed for their elimination represents a significant advance in security in the  Middle East, particularly for the security of the Syrian population who have suffered the appalling consequences of their use.   Syria's compliance with the terms of this agreement is critical and must be immediately forthcoming.   Ireland will support all diplomatic efforts to ensure that Syria fulfils its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and the terms of this agreement.&quot;</p></reply>

It is important that citizens who engage peacefully in the political and social developments of their society can do so without fear of risks to their personal security. It is also, of course, important that all parties operate within the rules of law.    The challenging socio-economic conditions faced by some in Colombia are serious.  I note that Colombia&rsquo;s President has acknowledged the validity of some of these concerns and that he has called for the resolution of grievances through dialogue.  I understand that some progress has been made in discussions between Government and protestors, with roadblocks being lifted as dialogue is underway.  I hope that progress on the issues of concern can continue to be made through peaceful dialogue. </p></reply>

Unfortunately, many of these often small and vulnerable communities are coming under increasing pressure due to a range of factors including low birth rates, emigration and, in some cases, increased sectarian persecution and violence.  This has led to a significant reduction in their numbers in the region over recent years.  In Iraq for instance, it is estimated that more than half of the Christian community may have emigrated over the past decade.   The political turmoil which has overwhelmed many countries in the Middle East in recent years has led to increased international concerns about the safety of Christians first in Iraq and Egypt and now most pressingly in Syria.  The descent of Syria into violence and disarray has left small Christian communities very exposed and sometimes subject to direct attack.  Ireland raises the issue of the safety of Christians through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect minorities.</p><p>  In situations of general instability and insecurity, such as Iraq some years ago or Syria today, this is of course especially difficult.  Ireland also works with our partners in the EU to raise the issue in multilateral fora such as the UN Human Rights Council, as part of the EU&rsquo;s human rights policy.  The EU has taken a number of steps in recent years in support of Freedom of Religious Belief, including issuing Council Conclusions on the matter, most recently in February 2011.  I have raised the issue of protection of Christians in the Middle East in discussions at the Foreign Affairs Council, and supported stronger EU statements on the issue, for instance in the Council Conclusions on Egypt issued on 21 August last.</p><p>  Ireland attaches great importance to combating all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  Ireland was elected to the Human Rights Council in November 2012 and will serve for the 2013-2015 term.  Amongst our priorities as a member of the Council is the issue of freedom of religion or belief, and we have played a central role in the negotiation of two important resolutions on this issue in the past year.</p><p>  Officials from my Department have met frequently with local Christian leaders from the Middle East region, and discussed the issues affecting their communities.  It should be noted that many of these groups request that any efforts made on their behalf be carried out very discreetly, as any special attention from western countries might only increase their difficulties.  While some individuals from the region have found refuge in Ireland, asylum in Ireland or in Europe cannot provide the solution to this problem, because the numbers are too great, because there are others also at risk, and because this would spell the end for ancient Christian communities who have survived in the region since the earliest days of Christianity.</p></reply>

It is possible to register a number of different passports (e.g. all members of a family) using the one e-mail address with the reminder e-mail detailing which passport registered is about to expire.

These are awarded to suitable candidates who have undertaken relevant third-level studies or who have other relevant skills or experience.  Interns are recruited following a competitive process and are remunerated on the basis of the Executive Officer salary scale.  Up to twenty-five of the temporary recruits are assigned for periods of approximately 18-21 months as Junior Professional Interns in the Department&rsquo;s Development Cooperation Division and a small number of Missions.  That Division, which is partly headquartered in Limerick City, also hosts two University of Limerick students twice-yearly under an internship programme operated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The remaining nineteen posts are allocated to other Units of the Department dealing with other areas of foreign policy including human rights, disarmament, conflict resolution and international legal affairs and to a small number of multilateral Missions.  In these cases the internships are normally for periods of up-to 11 months.  The Department also facilitates an annual 7-week placement for a University of Notre Dame student, with all costs in that case borne by the University.  Some unpaid short-duration placements also occasionally arise at Missions abroad, as do paid short-term local staff positions.</p><p>Separately, the Department was given approval in 2012 to recruit a small number of Interns for the period leading up to and for the duration of the Irish Presidency of the European Union in the first half of this year.  As part of a management review of policy in this area, I have asked my Department to make renewed efforts to engage with the <i>JobBridge</i>   scheme with a view to making a number of placements during the remainder of 2013 and early next year. Despite our efforts to avail of this scheme, including the advertising of some vacancies, no placements have been made to-date.</p><p>As much as possible of the information requested by the Deputy is contained in the following table.

A group from the Museum visited New York in May 2012 in order to establish contacts and raise the profile of the Museum among New York's Jewish and Irish Communities.  The Deputy Consul General of Ireland in New York hosted a networking reception for the group, at their request, on 21 May 2012.  The reception took place at a cost of US$2,400 in the Consulate General premises.  It was attended by 100 guests drawn from the Irish and Jewish communities, including prominent members of several New York Jewish congregations, representatives from Jewish organisations in New York and a wide group of the Consulate's community, press and cultural contacts.

It outlines Irish Aid's work during 2012 and includes examples of how Irish Aid - the Irish people's overseas aid programme - works to reduce hunger and strengthen resilience, as part of Ireland's overall commitment to a renewed global effort to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger.  While the Government's absolute priority is to restore growth, jobs and prosperity in Ireland, we cannot ignore the plight of the over 800 million men, women and children in the world who go hungry every day.  Our commitment to tackling hunger is a long-standing one.  It continues to be at the heart of what we do.  The Report highlights examples of how we actually work to reduce hunger and improve nutrition both in our partner countries and at international level.  The Report also stresses the importance of strengthening resilience in our development and humanitarian work.  Resilience - ensuring that people are better able to cope with shocks - is an important part of our efforts to end poverty and hunger.  It is essential to ensure that the real improvements being achieved in people's lives are not eroded by adverse events such as illness, food price increases or natural disasters.</p><p>  Ireland's development programme is making a real difference to people's lives.  In the Ntcheu District of Malawi, for example, following the distribution of 263,000 bednets, suspected deaths from malaria among children under five have reduced by 95% since 2010.  In Ethiopia in 2012, 6.9 million people avoided hunger, through the Productive Safety Net Programme, which is supported by Ireland.  In exchange for public works, vulnerable people receive predictable cash or food transfers.  During my own visits to Ethiopia, I saw how people's lives have improved as they use the grants to access basic services like healthcare, education, and purchase better food and clothing for themselves and their family members.</p><p>  The Annual Report reaffirms our strong commitment to transparency and accountability.  It is vitally important that aid funding on behalf of the Irish people is spent effectively and that there is full accountability to taxpayers for public expenditure on development.  As well as ensuring that robust financial and risk management systems are in place internally, we will continue to work to strengthen systems and oversight mechanisms in our partner countries.  The Annual Report itself is part of our efforts to provide comprehensive information to the Irish public.  The Report also contains statistical annexes which set out Ireland's Official Development Assistance spend for 2012 and provide detailed breakdowns on how this money was spent.  In 2012, the Government provided a total of &euro;628.90 million in Official Development Assistance (ODA), which represented 0.47% of GNP.  The Report sets out in detail how this money was channelled to our partners in developing countries.</p></reply>

I have already welcomed in my statement on 14 September the outcome of the US-Russian negotiations on a framework agreement for the elimination of Syrian chemical weapons.  Syria&rsquo;s possession of chemical weapons is unacceptable, and the use of these weapons under any circumstances is illegal under international law as well as morally reprehensible. Syria must comply in full with the terms of the framework agreement and also with the international obligations which it will assume under the Chemical Weapons Convention.</p><p>  Ireland has consistently stressed that only a political solution can bring peace and democratic reform to Syria.  Recent events, including the atrocity of the mass gassing of the civilian population in Ghouta, have only reinforced that analysis.  This is also the broadly held view of the wider international community.  I welcome the participation of the UN-Arab League envoy Brahimi at the recent Geneva talks between the United States and Russia.  The overall objective for Ireland and its EU partners remains the achievement of a political solution in Syria.</p><p>  I discussed events in Syria with my EU counterparts at the recent Informal Foreign Ministers&rsquo; meeting in Vilnius on 6-7 September.  EU Foreign Ministers agreed that the chemical weapons attack in Damascus on 21 August represents an unacceptable violation of international law and that every effort should be made to prevent further recourse to such weapons; that the United Nations is the appropriate and legitimate forum for addressing these issues; that the Security Council must unite to agree a resolution; that there equally must be accountability for the perpetrators of this atrocity; and that only a political solution can ultimately bring peace to Syria.  The EU also undertook to continue its strong support and leading role in international humanitarian relief efforts to assist Syria.  While progress is being made on the issue of chemical weapons use in Syria, the need for a political process and an end to the fighting is more urgent than ever. </p></reply>

The EU is the largest donor of Official Development Assistance (ODA) in the world.  The proposed Year of Development 2015 will be a timely opportunity to raise awareness of development across Europe.  It will mark the target date for the Millennium Development Goals adopted by international leaders at the United Nations in 2000.  Already, significant international discussions are taking place on the framework for international development post-2015, in which Ireland has played a significant role, notably during our EU Presidency in the first half of this year.</p><p>  I believe that, if agreed by the Council and the European Parliament, the designation of a European Year of Development would help raise awareness of the fight to end extreme poverty and hunger among European citizens and policy makers.

The topic for the meeting was inter-institutional relations, and specifically the relationship between the Council and the European Parliament.  The first session, with the participation of representatives from the European Parliament, focused on preparations for the European Parliament elections in May 2014.  The discussions covered concerns about falling voter turnout in Member States, the impact of the economic crisis and the need to communicate actions taken at EU level more assertively to citizens.</p><p>  The second session, in traditional Council format, focused on post-Lisbon relations between the Council and the Parliament. Recent Presidencies, including Ireland, shared their experiences of managing this important relationship.  While there was consensus that co-decision with the Parliament works well, some practical suggestions for improvement were made including the early involvement of the incoming Presidency in trilogue negotiations with the Parliament.  The discussion also emphasised the importance of the Council&rsquo;s own institutional agenda in ensuring adherence to the Treaties.  It was agreed that the Lithuanian Presidency would follow up with recommendations based on the discussions.</p></reply>

The visit provided me with an opportunity to take soundings on the range of issues which will be dealt with in the context of the Haass process as well as to show my support for those living at interfaces following a particularly difficult summer.  Among those I met were men and women in Ardoyne, Carrick Hill, Short Strand and in East Belfast who have worked tirelessly at a community level over the past year urging restraint, sometimes in the face of explicit provocation or intimidation.  I commend all those who have shown constructive leadership within their communities in very difficult circumstances.</p><p>  I received a number of clear messages from those with whom I met.  Firstly, people do not want to lose all that has been gained over the past fifteen years of the peace process.  Secondly, there is a genuine fear of a return of sectarian violence and grassroots communities are aware that their work, on its own, cannot deliver reconciliation.  Thirdly, communities recognize how the two governments working both separately and jointly can bring helpful perspective and practical support, as can broader international focus.  My visit also provided an opportunity to hear from those whose businesses have been directly affected by the ongoing street unrest.  Retailers and those in the pub and restaurant trades said that the ongoing protests have caused a discernible drop-off in late-night and weekend shoppers and this is threatening the viability of many city-centre businesses.</p><p>  I welcome the opportunity of the current talks process being chaired by Dr Richard Haass to address contentious issues, specifically Parades, Flags and Emblems and the Past, which are having such a corrosive effect on community and political relations and on the local economy in Northern Ireland.  The Government is committed to supporting his work on each of these issues.  I also met with members of the Ulster Council of the GAA to discuss the pioneering work which they are doing in terms of community outreach.</p></reply>

I maintain contact on an ongoing and regular basis with the First and deputy First Ministers, with the party leaders within the Northern Ireland Executive and with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers MP.  In the light of the deterioration of the security situation after the 12th of July, I had direct contact with the Secretary of State and with the Minster for Justice David Ford to discuss the difficult situation which the Police Service of Northern Ireland were confronting in North Belfast.  Exceptionally, I issued a public statement calling for calm which my officials brought to the attention of all key stakeholders within the Cardiff talks process. In that statement I welcomed the talks which have begun this week under the independent Chairmanship of Richard Haass and the commitment by the Orange Order to engage with that talks process.</p><p>  I visited Belfast on 29 August 2013 and had detailed discussion with community leaders in Ardoyne, Carrick Hill, Short Strand and in East Belfast who have faced the brunt of parades related tension this summer.  I applauded them for their tireless leadership, restraint and support for a solution based on dialogue and respect, despite frequent explicit provocation or sectarian intimidation.  I commend all those who have shown constructive leadership within their communities in very difficult circumstances.</p><p>  Work must continue to ease tensions at interface areas and to support the rule of law and the Police Service of Northern Ireland charged with upholding the law.  The events of this Summer, and the ongoing parades in Ardoyne point to a need to progress meaningful dialogue further and I again urge the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, and all Loyal Orders, to promote and to engage in dialogue based on the principle of respect with residents&rsquo; groups as a matter of urgency.</p></reply>

With the number of fatalities surpassing 100,000, there are now close to 7 million people who are in need of immediate life saving support. In addition to more than 4 million people who are displaced within Syria, there are in excess of 2 million Syrians who have fled the violence to take refuge in neighbouring countries, one million of whom are children. In the face of this terrible suffering, it is imperative that the international community is united in demanding greater protection for Syria&rsquo;s civilian population.  The world has rarely seen a humanitarian crisis as bad as that caused by the conflict in Syria.  Ireland has been consistent in its call for all parties to the conflict to fully respect, and be held accountable for violations of International Humanitarian Law.  Throughout our EU Presidency in the first half of the year, Ireland took every opportunity to underline the gravity of the humanitarian situation, including through discussion at the EU Foreign Affairs Council.  The most recent discussions on the Syrian crisis took place at the Gymnich (Informal Meeting of Foreign Affairs Ministers) in Vilnius on 6-7 September.  Ireland fully supports the subsequent press statement by High Representative Catherine Ashton in which she highlighted the need to reaffirm our commitment to the people of Syria and to support them in every way possible through our humanitarian aid.</p><p>  Ireland has been unwavering in its support to the international humanitarian response.  To date, we have provided almost 11 million Euros to the relief effort and are one of the world&rsquo;s most generous donors &ndash; on a per capita basis - to the response to this crisis.  Through trusted NGO partners here in Ireland, as well as the UN and the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement, we are playing a considerable part in the international effort to meet the massive needs both inside Syria and in the wider region.  We stand ready to provide further assistance, within our means, to the humanitarian response.</p></reply>

I have made my views clear to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and will continue to raise the question of a Bill of Rights in my discussions with the First Minister and deputy First Minister.

Hon. Theresa Villiers MP, on 24 July, I continue to stress the importance of implementation of all aspects of the Agreements.  Since the restoration of the devolved Institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland is a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive.  Last year the Northern Ireland Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Ms. Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA, launched a public consultation process on strategies for the Irish language and Ulster Scots.  A summary of the responses to the consultation process was published on 3 July 2013.  I am firmly of the view that an Irish Language Act should be introduced in Northern Ireland.  All parties to the Good Friday Agreement recognised the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity in Northern Ireland.  In the St Andrews Agreement, the British government committed to introducing an Irish Language Act and to working with the Northern Ireland Executive to enhance and protect the development of the Irish Language.</p><p>  Officials in my Department maintain regular and ongoing contact with the Irish language community in Northern Ireland including those involved in cross-community Irish language activity.  I will continue to press in my discussions with the Northern Ireland Executive the urgent need to address this issue and to legislate for an Irish Language Act.  Officials in my Department will continue to monitor this matter in their ongoing contacts with the Northern Ireland Office.</p></reply>

The Government has also attached great importance to providing for future flows of migration between Ireland and the United States through the extension of the &ldquo;E-3&rdquo; visa scheme to include Irish citizens.In this context, we very much welcomed the US Senate&rsquo;s approval of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill by a 68-32 margin on 27 June last.  The comprehensive draft legislation, which was drafted over several months by a bi-partisan group of eight US Senators, provides for extensive reform of the US immigration system.  It includes provisions that would legalise the status of undocumented Irish people and provide a path to permanent residency.  It also provides for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US via the proposed E-3 visa.  The Bill is a very positive development.  Its provisions, if adopted, would help to end the great hardship and uncertainty faced by undocumented Irish in the US and their families here in Ireland.  The inclusion of a new provision to allow several thousand Irish citizens to legally avail of employment opportunities in the US every year is also particularly welcome.  The focus has now shifted to the House of Representatives for its consideration of the issues.  It remains to be seen whether a consolidated Bill can be agreed between the Senate and the House of Representatives.  It is generally accepted that securing overall agreement will remain a complex and challenging process.</p><p>  During my recent visit to Washington DC on 11-12 July last, I held a series of meetings on Capitol Hill, including with key members of the House of Representatives and Senate, with the US Administration and with Irish-American community representatives.  I reiterated the Government&rsquo;s interest in all aspects of immigration reform and in particular our interest in seeing an overall agreement reached which provides relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and a facility for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US.</p><p>  I want to acknowledge the role played by our staff at the Embassy in Washington who have been following developments closely and building support for our objectives.  I intend to make further contacts with key Congressional leaders in the course of my visit to New York later his month to address the UN General Assembly.  I also wish to acknowledge the active role being played by a number of Irish community organisations, including the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform and the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform.  I also intend to have further exchanges with these and other Irish-American community representatives while I am in New York later this month.</p></reply>

That section also required that physiotherapy or similar treatment be prescribed by a practitioner before qualifying for relief.  This requirement has, therefore, been part of the qualifying criteria since the introduction of relief for health expenses and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that guidance and instructions to staff have remained unchanged in this regard.</p><p>  The position is, as I have stated on many occasions in the House, that this issue was raised during the debates in the Seanad on Finance Bill 2013, during which I agreed to re-examine the matter during the course of this year.  My Department is currently in the process of examining the issue and when the analysis is completed and the findings are presented to me, I will make any necessary decisions in the context of Finance (No 2) Bill 2013.</p></reply>

It applies to gross income before deduction for the various tax incentives or reliefs such as pension contributions.  In addition, it also applies to income sources that are exempt from income tax such as income of certain artists or income from woodlands.  However, allowance is made for the deduction of normal expenses associated with a trade, including normal capital allowances. </p><p>  There are some types of income which are not chargeable to USC, such as social welfare payments and other similar payments made by bodies such as the Health Service Executive.  Those in receipt of such income are only liable to the USC to the extent that they have income from other sources which exceeds &euro;10,036 per annum.  Furthermore, persons resident in Ireland are liable to USC on their world-wide income.  Persons who are not resident in Ireland are liable to USC on income arising here.  Such persons may obtain double taxation relief in their country of residence in respect of USC paid.

The measure was designed to boost tourism and create additional jobs in that sector. In line with best international practice it was introduced as a temporary measure and is due to expire at end December 2013, at which point it will revert to 13.5%. Retaining the 9% rate would be very costly to the Exchequer and would require an increase in taxation or reduction in expenditure elsewhere.

When computing its profits for an accounting period, any company is entitled to claim capital allowances in respect of the wear and tear on plant and machinery owned by it and in use for the purposes of its trade at the end of that accounting period. In the case of an aircraft leasing company, this means that the company could claim a capital allowance in respect of the cost of acquiring an aircraft. The allowance is granted over a period of 8 years at a rate of 12.5% per annum. </p><p><b>Stamp Duty</b></p><p>  Section 113 Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999  exempts from stamp duty instruments for the sale, transfer, or other disposition , either absolutely or otherwise, of any ship, vessel or aircraft, or any part, interest, share, or property in any ship, vessel or aircraft. Section 85 Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 (as amended by FA 2013) provides that stamp duty is not chargeable on the issue, transfer or redemption of an enhanced equipment trust certificate.  An enhanced equipment trust certificate is defined as meaning &#8220;loan capital issued by a company to raise finance to acquire, develop or lease aircraft&#8221;</p><p><b>VAT</b></p><p>  Irish VAT is not charged on lease payments in respect of an aircraft where the aircraft is effectively used wholly outside the EU.</p><p>  The leasing of aircraft to qualifying international airlines is subject to VAT at the zero rate.  The aircraft must be used by an airline flying chiefly for reward on international routes. The lessor is entitled to deduct VAT incurred on the acquisition of the aircraft and other expenditure in connection with the leasing activity, subject to the usual restrictions.  In such circumstances, the lessor will be in a continuous VAT repayment position.</p><p>  A range of other services which lend support to the aviation leasing industry are also zero-rated for VAT purpose:</p><p>- the supply, repair, maintenance and hiring of equipment incorporated or used in aircraft flying chiefly for reward on international routes;</p><p>- the supply of goods for the fuelling and provisioning of aircraft flying chiefly for reward on international routes; and</p><p>- the supply of navigation services by the Irish Aviation Authority to meet the needs of aircraft flying chiefly for reward on international routes.</p><p>  The 23% standard rate of VAT is applicable to other aviation leasing arrangements. In such cases, the lessor is entitled to deduct VAT incurred on the acquisition of the aircraft and on expenditure incurred in connection with the taxable leasing activity.</p><p><b>Cost to the Exchequer of these exemptions</b></p><p>  There is no overall costing of the value of the Stamp Duty exemption referred to above. As indicated in my reply to the Deputy's questions on the tax revenue generated by the aircraft leasing sector, the sector is in a net repayment position in respect of VAT as a result of the zero rating of services.</p><p><b>Numbers employed by the aircraft leasing industry</b></p><p>  Surveys on the aircraft leasing industry in Ireland indicate that it supports around 1,000 direct employees and around 500 indirect employees in high-value employments.</p></reply>

This was reflected in the report on Economic and Monetary Union prepared by the Presidents of the European Council, the Commission, the Eurogroup and the European Central Bank.  A complete banking union requires common supervision, deposit insurance, a common resolution framework and a common fiscal backstop.  Earlier this year the first part of the Banking Union was put in place following agreement on the proposal for common supervision, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).  The SSM will apply to the 17 euro-area Member States and is open to the non-euro-area Member States who wish to participate.</p><p>  Following the adoption of the SSM the European Council called for the creation of a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) for banks covered by the SSM.  This follows from the principle underpinning the banking union that where supervision is centralised it should be complemented with a centralised resolution authority.  The SRM proposal consists of the Single Resolution Board and a Single Resolution Fund, financed by contributions from the financial sector. For legal reasons (as supervision is exercised by the ECB, resolution should be exercised by the same level of authority), the Commission will take the final decision to trigger resolution and the use of a single resolution fund.  The SRM will apply the resolution tool-kit in line with the Bank Recovery and Resolution (BRR) proposal which is currently being negotiated at trilogue level.</p><p>  Under, the proposal, a Single Resolution Board (SRB) would prepare and carry out the resolution of any bank in a Member State participating in the Banking Union. It would have broad preparatory powers and be responsible for the key decisions on how a bank would be resolved.  The Board will involve the representatives of national resolution authorities of participating Member States, the ECB and the Commission, as well as an Executive Director and a Deputy Executive director.</p><p>  I am working with ministers from the other Member States at the ECOFIN Council to bring about the SRM.  My officials are engaged in technical negotiations on the proposal.  Ireland welcomes the proposal for the SRM as the next essential step to complete the banking union.  It will assist in achieving the objective established by the Heads of states and governments of breaking the link between the sovereign and the banking sector.  It should apply to all banks in the participating Member States and have a credible backstop to ensure that national budgets are not exposed by decisions of the SRB.</p></reply>

The anti-money-laundering obligations applicable in Ireland derive from the Third EU Money-Laundering Directive.  The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 was enacted in July 2010 to transpose the Third Money Laundering Directive (2005/60/EC) and its Implementing Directive (2006/70/EC) into Irish Law.  Part 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 2010 sets out the obligations of &#8220;designated persons&#8221; in relation to customer identification.  One such obligation set out in the Act is the obligation to conduct customer due diligence, prior to the establishment of a business relationship.  Customer due diligence refers to the identification of customers and that of any beneficial owners of financial products associated with the customer.</p><p>  An Post and the Prize Bond Company are deemed to be a &#8220;<i>designated person</i>&#8221; under the Criminal Justice Act 2010 as they fall within the definition of a &#8220;<i>financial institution</i>  &#8221;. In light of this, An Post and the Prize Bond Company are required to comply with the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the sale of Prize Bonds to customers.  This means, in practical terms, that customer due diligence must be conducted on all purchases of prize bonds, irrespective of value.</p><p>  The extent to which any particular person or product may be exempted from the customer due diligence requirements of the Act is determined by reference to the Act having regard to the underlying Directives.  The Central Bank of Ireland has no discretion to exempt certain firms from the requirement to comply with the Act.  In light of these considerations, I am exploring with the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and my colleague the Minister for Justice whether or not exemptions available under the Directives may be applied to small value purchases of prize bonds facilitated on behalf of the State by An Post and the Prize Bond Company.</p></reply>

The EU VAT Directive provides that coal, in general, should apply at the standard VAT rate of a Member State, which in Ireland is 23%.  However, the VAT Directive has a number of derogating provisions whereby Member States may maintain a tax rate applicable at a certain date even though such supplies would ordinarily be supplied at the standard rate.  The UK can apply the 5% rate to coal and other fuels used for residential purposes on the basis that they had a zero VAT rate in place for those supplies on 1 January 1991.  This provision also allows Ireland to apply the zero VAT rate to certain foodstuffs, children&rsquo;s clothes and shoes, and certain medicines on the basis that the VAT rate in force on 1 January 1991 was zero.  However, it is not possible for Ireland to apply a zero rate or 5% rate to coal, as we did not apply a zero rate to coal on that date.  Nonetheless, as Ireland applied a reduced VAT rate to coal on 1 January 1991, this allows us to continue to apply a reduced rate to coal, but only where the rate is 12% or more.  In this context, the only means of reducing the VAT rate on coal would be through a general reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate, which would be excessively costly to the Exchequer.  The application of carbon tax on solid fuels does give rise to a price differential with Northern Ireland, but the supply of solid fuel in the State is strictly controlled under regulations made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the commencement of solid fuel carbon tax, with effect from 1 May 2013, was announced on that basis in Budget 2013.</p><p>  The Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuels)(Amendment) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 270 of 2011), made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, specifies the standards for coal placed on the market and extends the regulatory framework in relation to the distribution and sale of coal in the State.  Under the Regulations, coal merchants supplying coal products in the State, including those based in Northern Ireland, are obliged to register with the Environmental Protection Agency and comply with sulphur content and packaging standards applicable to coal sold in the State.  These standards differ to those applying in Northern Ireland.  In particular, the sulphur content of coal that may be sold in the State, which is not more than 0.7% sulphur by weight, is lower than the standard which applies in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, coal supplied in Northern Ireland, to standards applicable in that market, do not meet the fuel standards applicable in the State and may not be sold in the State. Compliance with the Regulations is enforced by the Local Authorities.</p></reply>

The banks in all countries in the European Economic Area and in most states of the Middle East, North Africa and Caribbean have implemented the IBAN format for account identification.  The IBAN contains a combination of information including the National Sort code (NSC), the account number and elements from the Bank Identifier Code (BIC) system. In Ireland the IBAN is 22 characters long.  Currently in Ireland the banks use a routing system based on the NSC (National Sort Code) and account number.  For international transfers the NSC is replaced by a BIC (Bank Identifier Code).  BICs are usually 8 digits but can be up to 11 digits long and identify the beneficiary's bank. For example Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s BIC is BOFI IE2D whereas AIB&rsquo;s is AIBK IE2D.</p><p>  Under the Single European Payments Area (SEPA) from 1 February 2014 consumers and business will have to use the IBAN and BIC for account identification purposes and for making transactions.  The IBAN and BIC are contained on every bank statement issued in Ireland.  As the IBAN contains the national sort code and bank account number already in use in Ireland and contains the elements of the BIC, it contains sufficient information to route a payment efficiently to a destination bank (whether local or overseas) while also containing information about the exact account at that bank branch.  As such it is suitable to allow the efficient conducting of business.    The United States of America is one of a number of countries that do not use IBAN at present. It is unlikely that the US will move to the IBAN standard in the near future and as such there will be no change for consumers and businesses here transacting with consumers or businesses in the United States of America.</p></reply>

Since July 2011 paper receipts no longer issue in respect of any tax payments.  This decision was taken on the basis that the vast majority of taxpayers conduct business with Revenue via its online service.  The online service facilitates direct access to payment information and therefore customers have no need for a paper receipt.  The change has resulted in significant cost savings in terms of postage, stationery and staff resources.</p><p>  This arrangement now also applies to LPT and customers who file online receive an electronic acknowledgement and have ongoing access to their return and payment details.

In such circumstances a paper acknowledgement issues within two weeks. </p><p>  Customers who file and pay using the paper LPT return do not receive a paper receipt.  They do of course have evidence of LPT payments through their own financial institution records.

The legislation contains measures which will reform and strengthen credit unions and deals with four broad areas namely: Prudential regulation; Governance; Restructuring, including the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo); and Stabilisation. </p><p>  All sections of the Act are currently being commenced and will be aligned to the introduction of the underpinning Central Bank regulations, which will see implementation in a coherent and cohesive manner in accordance with the published Implementation Plan. </p><p>  The Act introduces new functions for the Board of Directors which has responsibility for the general control and management of the credit union.  These functions include setting the strategy, monitoring the implementation of the strategic plan and reviewing it on a regular basis as well as ensuring that the credit union is on a sound financial footing.  This should allow a credit union to satisfy itself on its long-term viability.  Where appropriate a credit union should engage with ReBo regarding restructuring options.</p></reply>

On the budgetary side, this includes requirements to reduce the General Government deficit to below 3 per cent of GDP by 2015 and achieve a structural balance in the medium term, while also taking action to reduce our General Government Debt to GDP ratio.   </p><p>  As we move out of the Programme and, subsequently, out of Excessive Deficit Procedure in 2016, a multi-annual fiscal sustainability plan will ensure the full benefits of our budgetary efforts are secured and that our continuing obligations, both under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2012 and at a European level, are met.</p><p>  The Medium-Term Economic Strategy is therefore intended to cover the period 2014-2020 and will address macroeconomic and fiscal challenges in the post EU-IMF Programme period, reflecting the Programme for Government&rsquo;s focus on growth and employment.</p></reply>

As a result the Special Liquidators are currently in the process of devising and implementing a sales process in respect of these assets.

This makes it difficult for a borrower and his or her lenders to address the personal debt difficulties on a whole of debt basis.  </p><p>  In view of this, at the start of March the Central Bank commenced a process to facilitate the development of a co-ordinated approach among lenders to the resolution of multiple debts owed by distressed borrowers.  The Central Bank has informed me that it facilitated the process whereby, following a Request for Information to a number of parties, the Central Bank announced in July 2013 that the lenders participating in the scheme had appointed StepChange Debt Charity (StepChange) as the service provider for the scheme. </p><p>  The aim of the pilot scheme, which is voluntary by both debtors and creditors, is to achieve sustainable and fair outcomes without the need for the borrower to enter the statutory insolvency process.  It is focused on enhancing cooperation between lenders of secured and unsecured debt at an early stage.</p><p>  The Central Bank has informed me that StepChange is a UK based not-for-profit organisation with over 20 years' experience giving free and impartial advice to people who are struggling with problem debt.  StepChange will operate the pilot scheme on behalf of participating lenders, engaging directly with distressed borrowers to establish appropriate loan modifications as part of a longer term resolution of their financial difficulties. </p><p>  I understand that in the UK, StepChange is funded by creditors.  This is made possible by the charitable contributions that creditors make to Stepchange.  Details can be found at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>.  The Central Bank has advised that under the provision of Section 33AK of the Central Bank Act, the Central Bank cannot comment on the funding provided by individual financial institutions to third parties.</p></reply>

This is the equivalent of a tax credit of &euro;165 and is only available in respect of fully trained guide dogs.   </p><p>  The qualification criteria for granting this additional relief is that the individual must be entitled to the Blind Person&rsquo;s Tax Credit under section 468 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA) and also provide written confirmation from the Irish Guide Dogs Association that he or she is the registered owner of a trained guide dog.  </p><p>  To qualify for the Blind Person&rsquo;s Tax Credit, an individual or the individual&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner must have impaired vision to an extent specified in the legislation and certified by an eye specialist, i.e. a medical practitioner with an additional qualification in Ophthalmic Medicine or Ophthalmic Surgery, or a registered Optometrist.  A doctor's certificate is not sufficient.</p><p>  Relief in respect of health expenses is allowed in accordance with the provisions of section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  In order to qualify for relief an individual must show that he or she has incurred health expenses for the provision of health care.  For the purposes of section 469 &quot;health care&quot; is the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation or treatment of an ailment, injury, infirmity, defect or disability.</p><p>  Given that there is a requirement for certification by a qualified practitioner in order to obtain the Blind Person&rsquo;s Tax Credit, the use of a fully trained guide dog to alleviate the disability is deemed to constitute a health expense and it is on this basis that this additional relief for health expenses is allowed.</p><p>  I understand that autism assistance dogs are primarily trained to act to improve the behaviour of the child by promoting calmness and providing companionship.  I will ensure that my officials consider all available expert medical research on the benefits of certain treatments in considering any proposed extension of tax relief on medical grounds.  </p></reply>

Information on LPT exemptions is available on the Revenue website, www.revenue.ie.    LPT is a self-assessed tax so it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  The condition of the property would be one of the factors a property owner would take into account in valuing his or her property and the absence of toilet facilities in a residential property may have an impact on its valuation.  </p></reply>

However, in general, bilateral double taxation agreements allocate taxing rights between two countries in order to ensure that income is not subject to double taxation.  Tax treaties generally contain a mutual agreement procedure which provides for tax authorities to agree a consistent approach with each other in relation to tax disputes such that a taxpayer does not end up with State A and State B taxing the same income twice.  This can result in the reallocation of tax between countries resulting in refunds by one country and additional payments to the other.</p></reply>

This includes any LPT that has been deferred by the liable person.  In addition, any outstanding LPT Returns must also be submitted to Revenue.  The Revenue Commissioners also advise that they have provided comprehensive information in the &#8220;About LPT&#8221; section of their website, <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>, as to how a liable person, or a person acting on their behalf, may obtain confirmation that there are no outstanding amounts of LPT for a residential property being sold.  In addition, the Commissioners have developed guidelines, also published on their website, for both vendors and purchasers which set out in detail all of the potential implications for LPT arising from the sale of a residential property.</p><p>  The vendor can access the LPT details for the property being sold online via the Revenue website, <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>, using the relevant Property ID number, their PPS number and the PIN code that was issued to them when they filed the LPT Return.  The relevant LPT details can be printed off and used to satisfy the purchaser that the property in question has no outstanding LPT issues.    </p><p>  Alternatively, the vendor, or a person acting on his or her behalf, can contact Revenue's LPT Branch by telephone or in writing to request the relevant confirmation.  Contact details for LPT Branch are available on the Revenue website.</p><p>  In order to further facilitate sales and purchases of residential property, the Revenue Commissioners will also be making an online look-up facility available to solicitors by the end of September 2013 which, with the agreement of the vendor, will allow them confirm the LPT details of properties being sold without the need to contact Revenue.</p></reply>

Minister of State Brian Hayes deputised for me at the meeting. The meeting was attended by representatives from the Finance Ministries and Central Banks of all 28 EU Member States, representatives of the Commission and the European Central Bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) and the Economic Policy Committee (EPC), and invited guests. The following issues were discussed.   </p><p><b>  Economic outlook and financial stability</b></p><p>  The Commission and the European Central Bank reported on the main developments regarding the macro-economic and financial outlook of the euro area and the EU as a whole. Completion of the Banking Union was also discussed, with particular focus on proposals for a Single Resolution Mechanism, the work on which will continue and will be progressed by the Lithuanian Presidency in the weeks and months ahead.</p><p><b>Improving access to finance for SMEs - European policy options</b></p><p>  The European Council on 27-28 June 2013 concluded that SME financing is a key priority.  Following a proposal made by the Irish Presidency, a High-Level Expert Group on Long-Term Finance and SMEs was established. The focus of the group is on concrete capital market instruments to stimulate and permanently diversify SME and mid-cap financing and the financing of infrastructure projects. The Group produced an interim report in July and will publish its final report in November. Based on the interim report, Ministers had a discussion on which options are best to address the SME financing issue. On foot of this discussion, the Presidency will write to President Van Rompuy in advance of the European Council on 24-25 October. </p><p><b>Follow-up to the G20 Leaders' Summit and preparation of the IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings and G20 ministerial meeting.</b></p><p>  This item was primarily for information in the run-up to the IMF and World Bank Annual Meetings. Discussion at the Annual Meetings will focus on the global economy and implementation of ongoing IMF reforms, in particular, on the ratification of the 2010 quota and governance reform as well as the agreement (due by January 2014) on the IMF quota formula and the 15th General Review of Quota.</p><p>   The Presidency reported on the main outcomes of the G20 Leaders' Summit in St Petersburgh on 5-6 September.  While the Summit had been overshadowed by the situation in Syria, a discussion on economic progress had been fruitful and agreement on tax transparency was a major breakthrough with the Leaders renewing their commitment to automatic exchange of information as the new global standard. The G20 Leaders also endorsed the OECD action plan on tax base erosion and profit shifting.</p><p><b>Future shape of financial system - from the Banking Union architecture to efficient structure of financial markets</b></p><p>  Ministers had a discussion on the Future of the EU banking system. The focus of the meeting stressed the need for further convergence with the objective to arrest the fragmentation of banking along national lines. To achieve this we need to credibly break the link between the banks and sovereigns, as called for by the European Council. </p><p>  Bruegel, the Brussels-based think-tank, presented a paper on the future shape of the financial system, highlighting two points: firstly the need for a banking system that is credibly delinked from sovereigns and the further development of other aspects of financial intermediation.</p><p><b>Fight against tax fraud and tax evasion - towards a global standard on automatic exchange of information</b></p><p>  The Council had a general discussion on the development of a global standard for the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities. The OECD Secretary General was present for this discussion. Ministers supported this initiative and stressed the importance of a globally co-ordinated approach and that EU initiatives should be totally consistent with approaches being implemented or considered elsewhere.</p></reply>

AIB utilises industry leading fraud monitoring software that learns cardholder behaviour and provides a fraud risk score for each transaction.  Where a transaction is deemed suspicious, AIB may take preventative action and make contact with our customer to confirm recent transaction history. AIB constantly reviews the performance of its fraud monitoring strategies to minimise the impact of fraud monitoring on their genuine customers.</p><p>  Card Protection Kits (CPKs) are anti-fraud devices that are installed on AIB ATMs to prevent skimming attacks.  These devices are tested and where necessary updated regularly to ensure maximum protection against this fraud type.  In the event that a skimming device is detected on an ATM, the ATM is automatically closed and remains closed until a full inspection of the ATM has been completed.  It is only after this inspection that the ATM is returned to service.</p><p>  Presently, in the event that a customer's card has been compromised as a result of this fraud type, they are refunded the value of any fraudulent spend completed on their card.  AIB's ATM network is monitored 24/7, and support lines are available for customers to report anything suspicious found at an ATM.</p><p>  All AIB ATMs are protected by CCTV, so in the event of criminal activity, this CCTV is available to the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on request.  AIB works closely with other ATM acquiring banks, Card Issuers, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other industry groups such as Irish Payments Service Organisation (IPSO) and the Irish Banking Federation (IBF) to ensure that every effort is made to share knowledge and reduce fraud on our ATM networks.</p><p>  AIB is represented at various industry ATM and Card fraud forums both in Ireland and across Europe to ensure that they are aware of current trends and any potential fraudulent threats at ATM networks.</p><p>  In the event of significant fraudulent attacks at their ATM network, AIB has a crises management team that comes together to discuss, review and agree next steps.  This information is also shared with other ATM acquiring banks via IPSO.</p><p><b>Permanent TSB</b></p><p><b>  permanent tsb</b> employ a zero tolerance to ATM fraud and configures its ATM fleet with some of the best technologies available on the market.  </p><p>  Some of the technologies the Bank employ include Anti-Skimming technology with metal detection and digital signal jamming around card slots, PIN pad protection to prevent shoulder surfing, anti-cash trapping devices and CCTV. </p><p>  The Bank has also configured the ATMs that in the event of a skimming fraud attempt, the ATM will go out of service automatically.  It will only be returned to service once it is confirmed that the machine is no longer tampered or compromised, indicating to the fraudsters that the Bank's devices will not tolerate any attempt at tampering.  </p><p><b>  permanent tsb</b> also have a monitoring system in place which alerts the Bank to the possibility of fraudulent transactions.  Alerts are driven by the most probable fraud scenarios based on prevailing trends.  </p><p>  Customer education also forms part of any additional security and the Bank's ATM on-screen advice to customers is to always cover their PIN and to report anything unusual or suspicious about the device to the local Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

The establishment of a restructuring board was a core recommendation of the Report of the Commission on Credit Unions which was agreed with all credit union stakeholders.  The role of ReBo is to facilitate and oversee the restructuring of credit unions in accordance with the 2012 Act.  The restructuring functions of ReBo are set out in Section 44 of that Act and include:</p><p>a) analysing and examining information provided to it by the Bank, credit unions or by any other person, </p><p>b) developing provisional proposals and plans with credit unions for the restructuring of the credit union sector,</p><p>c) engaging with credit unions to facilitate agreement on restructuring proposals,</p><p>d) assisting credit unions in the preparation of restructuring plans,</p><p>e) considering and assessing restructuring plans submitted to it by or on behalf of credit unions including any funding requirements under the plan including requiring credit unions to engage third parties to verify information and provide a report to ReBo,</p><p>f) approving, approving with conditions or rejecting those restructuring plans,</p><p>g) recommending the restructuring plans to the Minister and advising the Bank of its recommendations,</p><p>h) overseeing the implementation of restructuring plans, including the provision of post-restructuring support. </p><p>  Since the establishment of ReBo on a statutory basis, significant progress has been made in putting the ReBo organisation in place, including the approval of its governance structures and policies and procedures by the Board of ReBo and the development of systems and processes to assist credit unions with restructuring proposals. ReBo has also recruited a Chief Executive Officer and a number of staff.</p><p>  In order to carry out its functions under the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012, ReBo continues to interact with credit unions and sector stakeholders through speaking at sector events and meetings.  It has also launched a website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.rebo.ie</font></i>.  In addition, expressions of interest forms were sent to every credit union and I have been informed that the response to date has been very positive and follow up from ReBo is underway.</p><p>  I have also been informed that ReBo has received a number of requests from credit unions for assistance.  ReBo is engaging with these credit unions and restructuring plans are being analysed and developed. </p><p>  It is important to maintain the independence of the Credit Union Restructuring Board from the Central Bank as the two bodies have significantly different roles as set out in legislation and as recommended in the Report of the Commission on Credit Unions.</p><p>  However, the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 sets out that ReBo shall co-operate with the Central Bank in a way that contributes to promoting the best interests of credit unions generally. </p></reply>

However, with regard to the VAT treatment of below cost selling, VAT is a tax on the value added to a supply, and the collection and recovery of VAT takes place at each stage of the chain of supply from manufacturing to retailer.  Under EU and domestic VAT rules traders who are registered for VAT collect VAT on the goods and services that they sell.  In turn such traders are entitled to recover the VAT they incur on their business inputs used in the purchase or production of goods or delivery of services.  Consequently, if there is a decrease in value at any stage in the process the trader is entitled to a refund of the excess of VAT incurred over that collected.  </p><p>  In this case, where a retailer is in a situation of net VAT gain as a result of below cost selling, this is not a loss to the Exchequer or an additional benefit to the retailer, it is merely how VAT is charged.</p></reply>

The Code provides, inter alia, that mortgage lenders should allow for a flexible approach in the handling of arrears and pre-arrears cases and that they should aim, as far as possible, at assisting the borrower who is in genuine difficulty having regard to the specific circumstances in individual cases.  In particular, the Code provides that a lender&rsquo;s Arrears Support Unit (ASU) must base its assessment of the borrower&rsquo;s case on the full circumstances of the borrower including:</p><p>- the personal circumstances of the borrower;</p><p>- the overall indebtedness of the borrower;</p><p>- the information provided in the standard financial statement (SFS);</p><p>- the borrower&rsquo;s current repayment capacity, and</p><p>- the borrower&rsquo;s previous history.</p><p>  In relation to the sale of the IBRC mortgage book, the Special Liquidators are taking professional advice on the appropriate method of disposing of loan assets and on the appropriate criteria for determining who should qualify to bid for loan assets.

The Special Liquidators are under instruction from the Minister to ensure that the valuation of all IBRC assets is completed by 30 November 2013 and that the sale of all IBRC assets is agreed or completed by no later than 31 December 2013 or as soon as practicable thereafter.</p><p>  I am advised that the contractual terms and conditions of customer mortgages and other borrowings will not change as a result of the appointment of the Special Liquidators or the ultimate sale of the obligations to a third party.

There is a tax-free threshold (referred to as a &lsquo;group threshold&rsquo;), based on the relationship between the disponer (the person making the gift/leaving the inheritance) and the donee (the beneficiary).  Previous gifts/inheritances since 1991 from other disponers in the relevant group are counted when calculating the taxable amount over the threshold.  The balance of the gift/inheritance above the threshold is taxable, currently at a single rate of 33%.  </p><p>  The Group A tax-free threshold is &euro;225,000; the Group B tax-free threshold is &euro;30,150; and the Group C tax-free threshold is &euro;15,075.</p><p>  Group A relates to gifts and inheritances taken by children from their parents. Group B covers gifts and inheritances between relatives, for example, brothers and sisters, grandparents to grandchildren, uncles and aunts to nieces and nephews.  Finally, Group C deals with gifts and inheritances between all other persons.</p><p>  There is a CAT agricultural relief.  In order to qualify for this relief an individual receiving a gift or inheritance of agricultural property must qualify as a farmer.  For the purpose of the relief a farmer is an individual at least 80% of whose assets constitute agricultural property. </p><p>  CAT agricultural relief takes the form of a reduction in the market value of the agricultural property - currently by 90% - for the purposes of establishing the Group thresholds and determining whether or not a CAT liability arises on a transfer.  This relief has increased over the years from an original reduction of 50% when CAT was introduced in 1975.  The relief will be withdrawn if the agricultural property is sold or compulsorily acquired within six years of or, in certain circumstances, ten years of the gift or inheritance unless the proceeds are reinvested in other agricultural property.</p><p>  The overall position as regards CAT is therefore, that parents can transfer a family farm with a market value of up to &euro;2,250,000 to a child without any charge to CAT arising on the transfer, (assuming the child qualifies as a &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; under the 80% assets test) as the market value of the agricultural lands transferred would be reduced by 90% to &euro;225,000 &ndash; this is the Group A threshold for transfers from parent to child for CAT purposes &ndash; to leave no CAT payable (assuming that the child has received no prior gifts or inheritances from his or her parents).  </p><p>  Preparations for Budget 2014 and the consequent Finance Bill are ongoing.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on what changes, if any, are being considered in this relief or any other tax relief.  I will, however, bear in mind the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns in this matter.</p></reply>

These supply chain control measures are designed to make it difficult for fuel criminals to source marked fuel for laundering and to get laundered product onto the market.  From their regular contact with fuel trade representatives, Commissioners are aware of a number of initiatives by fuel traders to provide assurance to customers about the quality of their fuel in response to the threat posed by illicit supplies.  Such assurance can be provided only for fuel that is sourced through the legitimate supply chain and accordingly these initiatives and the supply chain controls operated by Revenue are mutually beneficial.  </p><p>  The legitimate trade can contribute to closing down the illicit trade by providing information on the outlets that are selling laundered diesel.  Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group (HEMG) and has established regional sub-groups of the HEMG to facilitate the reporting of information by traders through their representative associations.  Retailers who suspect or have evidence that laundered diesel is being sold in their area should report this directly or through their representative associations to Revenue, and I would encourage the Deputy to avail of these channels.  Any such reports are treated as confidential and are fully investigated by Revenue.  </p><p>  Revenue collects some &euro;1.1 billion annually in excise duty from road diesel so the potential for loss of tax revenue from fuel laundering is very significant.  However, estimating the extent of any illegal activity is inherently problematic and claims about the extent of this activity and the associated tax loss must be treated with caution.  While it has not been possible to establish the cost of fuel laundering to the exchequer, Revenue recognises that fuel laundering represents a significant risk.  </p><p>  In response, Revenue has made action against fuel laundering one of its priorities and is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem.  In addition to the supply chain controls mentioned already, Revenue is working with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in the UK on the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker.  Revenue and HMRC signed a Memorandum of Understanding in May 2012 on a joint approach to finding a more effective marker for use in both jurisdictions.  The final evaluation of submissions received in response to an Invitation to Make Submissions (IMS) is underway and the outcome of this process is expected later this year.</p><p>  Revenue, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, continues to intensify enforcement action against fuel fraud and this work has yielded significant results to date.  In the past two years 106 filling stations throughout the State were closed for breaches of licensing conditions.

The Budget 2013 booklet makes clear, however, that the savings figure is provisional as further detailed analysis of the necessary changes and their impact would be required. That detailed analysis is ongoing.</p><p>  Given that whatever changes are introduced to deliver on the Programme for Government commitment will further restrict the current scale of pension tax relief available to higher earners, it might be expected that such changes would have some impact on the scale of savings that might otherwise be achieved, for example, by a reduction in the rate of tax relief on pension contributions. However, as I have explained in previous replies to questions in this area, the estimated cost of tax relief on supplementary pension contributions and the estimated savings from any proposed changes to those reliefs are based largely on aggregate data and will vary according to a range of factors, including the scale of contributions made from year to year and the numbers making such contributions. In these circumstances, it will not be possible to isolate the impact of any particular change on those estimates. </p><p>  In addition, and as stated in my Budget 2013 speech, tax relief on pension contributions will continue at the marginal rate.	</p></reply>

Both banks also submit monthly returns which outline progress in terms of achieving the targets, as well as providing a breakdown of lending by sector and region.  The banks also meet my Department and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress.

In addition, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government signed a Regulation, on 27 August last, that further amended the list of &#8220;Unfinished Housing Estates&#8221; entitling certain additional residential properties to a waiver from the 2012 Household Charge.  Accordingly, information on outstanding Household Charges is not currently available and is not likely to be available for some time.

The Revenue Commissioners have put in place facilities for property owners to pay the &euro;200 arrears, using any of the following methods: by accessing the LPT online system on Revenue's website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i>, using their PPSN, Property ID and PIN, and choosing a payment option from direct debit, deduction at source from salary or occupational pension, deduction at source from certain payments received from the Department of Social Protection, deduction at source from scheme payments received from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, single debit authority, debit or credit card, or cash payments through approved payment service providers; by calling the LPT Helpline - 1890 200 255 - and paying by debit or credit card; or by cheque, postal order or similar which should be sent to Local Property Tax Branch, Revenue Commissioners, PO Box 1, Limerick.  The Commissioners recommend that customers note their Property ID and PPSN or tax reference number on the back of the cheque or postal order. </p><p>  I am informed that to date some &euro;462,000 has been paid directly to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of more than 2,100 properties.  Further information on household charge arrears is available in the &quot;frequently asked questions section&quot; of Revenue's local property tax website.  Revenue's priority has been, and continues to be, the implementation and collection of the local property tax.  However, in due course, Revenue will use the various debt recovery powers available to them to collect the &euro;200 arrears which will remain as a legal charge on the property.</p></reply>

In addition, the Eurogroup also agreed to consider retroactive recapitalisation of banks on a case-by-case basis once the instrument enters into force.  This provides one potential avenue for Ireland to recoup some of the funds it put into the banks in the wake of the banking crash.  As each case will be considered on its merits, it would not be appropriate for me to speculate on the implications of this agreement.  Both AIB and Bank of Ireland have forecast they will be profitable next year, and coupled with a growing economy, it is likely that these factors will enhance the valuations of the banks.  In this context, other potential purchasers may emerge and we may decide that they offer a more attractive route to exit our investments.  Therefore, I do not want to tie the future of the banks or the banking system solely to the ESM, but it is vital that we have the option still in place.</p></reply>

These staff are deployed across a number of compliance and enforcement programmes that reflect the strategic and business priorities set out in its Statement of Strategy and Annual Corporate Plan.  These programmes include anti-smuggling controls, audit, assurance checks, debt management, investigations, prosecutions and anti-avoidance interventions.  Resources are continuously redeployed across these programmes in response to the Commissioners' assessment of risk.  It is not possible, therefore, to disaggregate the resources deployed exclusively on tackling the smuggling and sale of illicit tobacco products.</p><p>  Regarding the Deputy's question on lost revenue, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that determining the scale of any illicit activity and the associated loss to the Exchequer is problematic, and that any estimates of such losses need to be viewed with caution.  I understand that a survey in respect of 2012 carried out for the Revenue Commissioners and the Health Services Executive found that the level of consumption of illicit cigarettes would indicate a notional loss of the order of &euro;240 million in excise duty and VAT in that year, if the consumption of illegal cigarettes were replaced fully by taxed consumption.</p><p>  Tackling the illicit tobacco trade remains a key objective for Revenue.  In the period from January to July 2013, some 24 million cigarettes were seized and 60 court convictions were secured for cigarette smuggling and illegal tobacco sales.  Revenue's Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2010-2013), which is published on <i>www.revenue.ie</i>, includes a range of measures designed to complement each other in identifying and targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for illicit tobacco products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible.  Key elements of Revenue's strategy include developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, developing analytics and detection technologies, and ensuring optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and inland in order to intercept and seize illegal products and to detect and prosecute those involved.  In carrying out this important work, Revenue works in close co-operation with other relevant agencies, both nationally and internationally.</p></reply>

These matters are governed by the EU VAT Directive, which generally provides that supplies of goods and services should be subject to VAT at the standard rate, which in Ireland is 23%.  The VAT Directive is very restrictive in relation to the application of lower rates of VAT, where Member States may apply up to two reduced rates of VAT of between 5% and 15% but only to specific goods and services set out in Annex III of that Directive.  In addition, Member States may retain a zero rate of VAT, or a rate of VAT less than 5%, on goods and services where that rate applied to those goods and services on 1 January 1991.  However, no new activity can apply at those rates, and once removed activity cannot be reinstated at those rates.  The VAT Directive also allows the continuation of a reduced rate on goods and services not listed in Annex III, where they carried a reduced rate on 1 January 1991.  However, the Directive requires that a reduced rate of at least 12% apply to those goods and services.   In general, Ireland applies a reduced VAT rate and zero rate of VAT to a far greater range of goods and services than any other EU Member States.  In this regard, Ireland already applies the zero rate of VAT to basic foods, and the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% applies to most services, while tourist related services currently apply at the 9% rate.  In addition, the 23% standard rate applies to most luxury goods, including cars, petrol, diesel, alcohol, electrical equipment, etc.  In this context, while there is generally scope to apply a higher rate of VAT to many goods and services, there is very little scope to do the reverse.  With regard to undertaking a comprehensive review of the different rates of VAT that are applied to different product types, the VAT system and its structure are reviewed on an annual basis in the lead-up to the budget.</p></reply>

However, in line with the recommendations of the National Payments Plan, approved by the Government last April, it is intended that Government Departments, Local Authorities and State Agencies will cease using cheques in their dealings with the business sector as from 19 September 2014, with the exception of instances where electronic alternatives may not be practical.  This date will be known as e-Day.  This issue was also the subject of a circular by my Department on 6 August 2013 to all Departments, Local Authorities and State Agencies.  A copy of this circular is available at <i></i>.  In order to ensure a smooth transition to the new arrangements, and to give the various public sector bodies and the affected businesses plenty of time to make arrangements for paying electronically, a full year's notice of its implementation is being given.</p><p>  The particular focus of e-Day is to encourage SMEs to migrate from cheque usage as they are either issuers or receivers of more than 60% of all cheques in Ireland.  Businesses and other organisations issue about two thirds of all cheques.  SMEs account for nearly 50% of all cheques issued to businesses and almost 90% of business cheques issued to other businesses.  A shift from cheques to electronic as a preferred method of payment will result in reduced costs and improved cash-flow for the overall business sector.  While e-Day applies to all Government Departments and Offices, Local Authorities and State agencies, it is also hoped that other businesses and organisations will themselves choose to reduce the use of cheques for inward and outward payments.</p><p>  The National Payments Plan seeks to reduce the cost of Ireland's payment system (estimated at 1.4% of GNP) through the increased use of more efficient payment methods which will lead to increased competitiveness and efficiency.  The National Payments Plan estimates that if Ireland were to match best practice in Europe, savings of up to &euro;1 billion per annum could be made across the economy.  The plan is not about closing down options for consumers and businesses, but expanding them.  Its vision is for a society where modern forms of payment will be universally accepted, and be the preferred payment choice for most.  However, cash will remain a widely used method of payment, while cheques continue to be available for those consumers who want to use them.</p></reply>

The Commissioners also advise that in the majority of cases, deductions from Social Welfare payments have already commenced and approximately &euro;720,000 has been collected by Revenue to date.  I am further advised that certain issues arose with this payment option, whereby a number of property owners selected the wrong Social Welfare payment type.  This was subsequently corrected and deduction at source in these cases should have already commenced.  In a further category of cases that opted for this payment type, the person either selected a Social Welfare payment type for which deduction at source did not apply, or was found not to be in receipt of any Social Welfare payment.  In these instances, Revenue contacted the property owner directly advising him or her to select an alternative payment option.  The Commissioners also advise that, where operational and administrative issues have arisen, they have been addressed on a case by case basis, and there may be a residue of cases where deduction at source from Social Welfare payments has not yet commenced as these are currently being worked by Revenue.  I am advised that it is not possible to provide details of the numbers concerned but they represent a small subset of the numbers who have selected this payment option.  For completeness, the Social Welfare payments from which LPT may be paid via deduction at source are as follows: State Pension (Contributory); State Pension (Non-Contributory); Widow/widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension; Widow/widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Non-Contributory Pension; State Pension (Transition); One Parent Family Payment; Invalidity Pension; Carer's Allowance; Disability Allowance; and Blind Pension.</p></reply>

This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based.  The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets.  The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements.  However, the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model.  In other words, a 15% tax on the commission will be charged.  In addition, excise duties are being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers' and remote betting intermediaries' licences.  The Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013, which will establish the regulatory framework for the licensing regime, was published in July.  The Deputy will be aware that under the EU Technical Standards and Regulations Directive it was necessary to show the published Bill to the EU Commission and other Member States, which will take three months for clearance.  This standstill period ends next month after which I hope to progress the Bill through the D&aacute;il subject to scheduling agreement between the Whips.  The tax changes provided for in the Finance Act can only be implemented once the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 is enacted. </p></reply>

The Act provides that in determining the payment, regard must be had to the balance in the Fund when all commitments have been met.  The transfer is in respect of 2013 only.  Some &euro;46.5 million transferred to the Exchequer from the Local Government Fund in 2012 in two tranches -&euro;23.5 million on 20 September 2012 and &euro;23 million on 13 December 2012.

In order to estimate the potential revenue from a tax on "net assessable household wealth", one would need to identify the wealth held by individuals, which is not possible from the data available at present.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no statistical basis for compiling estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax.  Although an individual&rsquo;s assets and liabilities are declared in a limited number of specific circumstances - for example, after a death - Revenue states it is not in a position to link an individual's income to her or his financial assets.  I am informed by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) that its institutional sector accounts do not give an indication of the number of households or persons classified by the categories of wealth they hold.  These statistics are based on aggregate information collected from financial institutions and do not contain the demographic details which would enable such a breakdown of the statistics.  While the CSO's institutional sector accounts show that households held approximately &euro;126 billion on deposit in 2010, this is not broken down by income or wealth categories.</p><p>  I understand that, following discussions between the Department of Public Enterprise and Reform, the CSO and the Central Bank, the CSO has commenced a &ldquo;Household Finance and Consumption Survey&rdquo;, which will collect information on household wealth.  The first results of this survey will be available in 2014.  The data to be collected by the CSO as part of its Household Finance and Consumption Survey is not being collected for the purposes of calculating the potential yield from a wealth tax but to collect general information on the financial situation and behaviour of households.  I would also say that Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) are, in effect, taxes on wealth, in that they are levied on an individual or company on the disposal of an asset (CGT) or the acquisition of an asset through gift or inheritance (CAT).  However, they are not annual taxes on an individual&rsquo;s wealth.  The rate of both these taxes is 33%, which I increased from 30% in Budget 2013.  I also reduced the CAT group tax-free threshold for gifts and inheritances by 10%, following a number of reductions in recent years.  The introduction of a wealth tax could have a negative impact on receipts from CGT and CAT.</p><p>  The Domicile Levy introduced in Budget 2010 also constitutes a form of wealth tax.  The levy is currently charged on an individual who is Irish-domiciled whose world-wide income exceeds &euro;1 million, whose Irish-located property is worth more than &euro;5 million, and whose liability to Irish income tax was less than &euro;200,000.  The levy applies for the tax year 2010 and subsequent years.  It is payable on a self-assessment basis on or before 31 October in the year following the valuation date, which is 31 December of each year.  In Budget 2012 I expanded the application of the Domicile Levy by removing the citizenship condition.  Finally, given that asset values increase and decrease over time and in the context of recent economic circumstances, they may have declined considerably in many cases.  Thus, if the value of an asset or of an individual&rsquo;s wealth is measured at a particular time, there is no guarantee that the asset value or the individual&rsquo;s wealth will remain at that level or increase from that point.  This would make it difficult to predict the potential yield from a wealth tax and would have to be borne in mind in terms of its consistency as a source of revenue.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for CAT agricultural relief, an individual receiving a gift or inheritance of agricultural property must qualify as a farmer.  For the purpose of the relief, a farmer is an individual at least 80% of whose assets constitute agricultural property.  CAT agricultural relief has increased over the years from an original reduction of 50% when CAT was introduced in 1975.  The relief will be withdrawn if the agricultural property is sold or compulsorily acquired within six years of or, in certain circumstances, ten years of the gift or inheritance unless the proceeds are reinvested in other agricultural property.  CAT business relief takes the form of a reduction in the taxable value of the relevant business property - currently by 90% - for the purposes of establishing the appropriate group tax-free thresholds and determining whether or not a CAT liability arises on a transfer.  The relief will be withdrawn if within six years of the gift or inheritance the assets cease to qualify as a relevant business property, unless this is because of bankruptcy or if the company is wound up bona fide due to insolvency.  The relief will also be withdrawn if within six years of the gift or inheritance, the business or any business that replaced it is sold, redeemed or compulsorily acquired unless the business is replaced within one year by other relevant business property.  Preparations for Budget 2014 and the consequent Finance Bill are ongoing.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on what changes, if any, are being considered in this relief or any other tax relief.</p></reply>

I am further advised that section 15A (as amended) of the Act provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person, as defined within section 2 of the Disability Act 2005, where the adaptation has been grant-aided or approved for grant aid, by a local authority under either the Housing (Adaptation Grants for older people and people with disabilities) Regulations 2007 or Regulation 4 of the Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grants) Regulations 2001.  The reduction in market value is limited to the lesser of the value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property or the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  Where such circumstances arise, Revenue must be notified in writing of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation and any relevant documentation, including that relating to the payment of the grant, must be submitted.

The measure was designed to boost tourism and create additional jobs in that sector.  In line with best international practice, it was introduced as a temporary measure and is due to expire at end December 2013, at which point it will revert to 13.5%.  Retaining the 9% rate would be very costly to the Exchequer and would require an increase in taxation or reduction in expenditure elsewhere.  Any proposal to maintain the 9% VAT rate will be considered in the context of the budget.</p></reply>

"Relevant planning decision" is defined in the provisions as meaning (i) a change in the zoning of land in a development plan or local area plan from non-development land-use, that is from agricultural, open space, recreational or amenity use or a mixture of such uses, to development land-use, that is to residential, commercial or industrial uses or a mixture of such uses, or from one development land-use to another, including a mixture of such uses, and (ii) a material contravention decision by a planning authority in relation to a development plan.  In the case of rezonings, the 80% rate applies where there is a disposal of land following its rezoning where that rezoning takes place on or after 30 October 2009.  In the case of material contravention decisions, the 80% rate applies where there is a disposal of land following a material contravention decision where that decision is made on or after 4 February 2010.</p><p>  The 80% tax rate applies in respect of disposals by individuals or companies as part of their land dealing or developing trade or as the disposal of a capital item.  It only applies to the part of the profits or gains that is attributable to the relevant planning decision.  Any part of the profits or gains that is attributable to other factors, such as construction operations on the land or the expectation that the land would be rezoned, or benefit from a material contravention decision in the future (&lsquo;hope value&rsquo;), continues to be taxed at the normal income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax rates, as appropriate.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that on the basis of the available details from corporation tax and income tax returns for 2009, 2010 and 2011, the latest year for which the necessary details are available, there is no record of any such profits or gains having been returned.  However, the Commissioners have indicated that the existing database does not include details of capital gains returned via the CG1 tax return because these are not captured in electronic format and, consequently, that if windfall profits have been returned using this medium, it is not possible to centrally identify the relevant details.</p></reply>

My Department promotes the availability of this service to public service bodies on an ongoing basis.  Filling of vacancies in State Agencies and Commercial Semi-State Bodies is often a matter for individual organisations and Boards.  The Public Appointments Service would be pleased to discuss the facility of advertising of vacancies on publicjobs.ie with any State Agency or Organisation.   More specific information requested by the Deputy regarding filling of vacancies in my Department is outlined in the following table:</p><p><table><tr><th>Name of Body </th><th>Are vacant positions currently advertised through the Public Appointments Service?</th><th>Are there any proposed measures due to be put in place to ensure vacancies are advertised through the Public Appointments Service?</th></tr><tr><td>Irish Fiscal Advisory Council</td><td>Vacancies are advertised through PAS, following procedures and sanction set by DoPER. </td><td>As per the Fiscal Responsibility Act, &#8220;the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council may appoint persons to be members of staff of the Council, on such terms that are determined by the Council with the prior consent of the Minister of Finance given following consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.&#8221; Recruitment procedures are directed by DoPER, including consultation and advertising with PAS for any vacancies arising.</td></tr><tr><td>Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo)</td><td>Yes. ReBo has recently advertised 3 Job specifications, all of which were advertised by the PAS on <i>publicjobs.ie.</i></td><td>The ReBo Recruitment and Selection procedures are currently being  drafted and will incorporate a requirement to advertise all positions on <i>publicjobs.ie.</i></td></tr><tr><td>Central Bank of Ireland</td><td>No.</td><td>The Central Bank of Ireland manages its own recruitment campaigns.

Where Revenue recruit using their own recruitment licence the vacancies are publicly advertised in compliance with the codes of practice prepared by the CPSA.<br />Revenue uses its own recruitment licence to fill critical skills in a number of specialised areas. For example Revenue is currently running an open competition for senior specialists, at Principal Level, in the area of Corporate and International Taxation.  This competition was advertised in the national press, revenue.ie and is advertised on the Public Appointments Service website.</td></tr></table></p><p>The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) operates with a commercial remit to provide asset and liability management services to Government.  Businesses managed by the NTMA include borrowing for the Exchequer and management of the National Debt, the State Claims Agency, the New Economy and Recovery Authority, the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the National Development Finance Agency.  The NTMA assigns staff to the National Asset Management Agency and provides it with business and support services and systems.  It also has a number of staff on secondment to the Department of Finance&rsquo;s Banking Shareholder Management Unit.  The NTMA competes with the private sector to recruit staff with necessary specialist and commercial skills and expertise to provide these services.  It utilises a range of recruitment methods including advertisement on its websites, newspaper advertisements and recruitment agencies to fill positions.  This recruitment model has proven highly successful and has, for example, enabled the NTMA to recruit over 280 staff to NAMA since NAMA's formal establishment in December 2009.</p></reply>

The necessary legislation is currently being drafted.  The NAMA Board is remunerated from NAMA&rsquo;s operating income, not from the Exchequer.  Total remuneration paid to members of the NAMA Board was &euro;405,000 in 2012.  The salary of the CEO of ReBo - the Credit Union Restructuring Board - post Haddington Road agreement is &euro;85,127 per annum.  If a 10% cut was applied to this, it would result in a saving of &euro;8,512 per annum.  ReBo has a Chairman and 10 ordinary board members.  The Chairman has an annual fee of &euro;11,970 and the ordinary board has annual fee of &euro;7,695.  The estimated annual savings would be &euro;22,230 if a 25% cut was applied to fees.</p><p>  It is important to note that the figures for the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council are calculated based on the maximum cost possible.  As is policy, no fees are paid to members of the Irish public service, and as such, at present, this affects the Chair and one Council Member, who do not receive fees.  Thus the total fees cost relates to a calculation of the maximum applicable.  The fees payable to Council Members are based on those payable to Directors of Category 2 Non-Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, which are set from time to time by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The relevant fees for the chair are &euro;20,520.  The fees are not payable to members of the Irish public service.  Given that the Chair Fees are &euro;20,520, if 10% was deducted from Chair&rsquo;s pay in the event that the Chair was employed outside of the Irish public service, the savings would be &euro;2,052.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council does not have a CEO, but we have answered for their Chair.</p><p>  Revenue is not a commercial or non-commercial Semi-State Board and there are no board member fees.  The Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal is not Exchequer funded.  The Central Bank of Ireland is not Exchequer-funded.  The Financial Services Ombudsman Council determines the levies and charges payable for the performance of services provided by the Financial Services Ombudsman.  These levies are charged by industry.  The Credit Union Advisory Council has a Chairman and 5 ordinary board members.  The Chairman has an annual fee of &euro;3,705 and the ordinary members have annual fees of &euro;2,470.  The estimated savings would be &euro;4,013 per annum if a 25% cut was applied to fees.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the ACELS function was given to Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), formerly the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), in 2010. </p><p>  The list of recognised English Language Training Organisations (ELTOs) is published on an annual basis and all recognised ELTOs are listed on the ACELS website (www.acels.ie) and on the F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Education in Ireland listings.  Recognition is granted after a process of documentation submission and inspection of the organisation has taken place and been deemed to meet standards.  Ongoing compliance is ensured through periodic reviews and inspections.</p><p>  The standards with which ELTOs must comply are set out in the ACELS regulations, but these do not set out specific requirements relating to the payment of host families.  However, if there are complaints regarding an ACELS-recognised provider then these can be brought to the attention of ACELS through their general complaints procedures.</p><p>  It should be noted that recognition by ACELS is not mandatory for providers wishing to provide English-language training.  ELTOs are free to decide for themselves whether they wish to become ACELS-recognised and thereby benefit from being listed as a recognised provider. </p></reply>

As of May 2013 there are 10,754 persons on the Live Register in Co. Meath.  In 2013 F&Aacute;S plan to provide training opportunities for over 650 persons directly in locations in Co. Meath.  In addition many people from Co. Meath also participate in F&Aacute;S training courses in Co. Louth and in Co. Dublin.  The type of training available is determined by an annual comprehensive business planning process focused on providing training opportunities for employment.  This business planning process consists of - Under the direction of the Board of F&Aacute;S, the F&Aacute;S Executive work closely with key FET stakeholders such as VECs, DSP/INTREO and other Government Departments such as DJEI, to ensure that F&Aacute;S training can make a key contribution to progressing the Government's 'Pathway to Work' initiative as well as meeting employer needs and the career and employment aspirations of a diverse range of clients who will engage with F&Aacute;S training throughout 2013.  The national 2013 F&Aacute;S Training - Service/Business Plan is formulated via an internal and external consultation process at both local and national level and provides overarching national guidelines for training programme selection and delivery.  At a regional and county level formal consultation takes place with key stakeholders e.g. Department of Social Protection, Education and Training Boards, Enterprise Ireland, Irish Development Authority, Enterprise Boards, Employers etc.  A comprehensive analysis of available statistical data is also undertaken e.g. unemployment trends, vacancies, local job opportunities, regional labour market reports etc. This process helps to determine the regional and local course types with the focus on providing market led training opportunities.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, Solas is being established to co-ordinate the operation of the Further Education sector, alongside the rationalisation of 33 VECs and the FAS Training Centres into 16 Education and Training Boards.  The Further Education and Training Act 2013 was enacted in July 2013 and SOLAS will be established before the end of the year.  The Act requires that SOLAS prepares a five year national strategy in respect of the provision of further education and training.  A wide ranging consultation process with key stakeholders including employers will from part of this process.  In addition, the Act requires SOLAS to consult on an on-going basis with the Minister for Social Protection, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and employers in the context of the relevance of the programmes of further education to be funded by SOLAS. A business plan for 2014 will be prepared by Solas in that context.</p><p>  In general, live register figures and population figures are taken into account with available budget and resources being allocated based on a comprehensive regional annual business planning process.</p></reply>

This account is audited each year by independent auditors and accounts in respect of the last number of years are available on my Department's website. </p><p>  The Department reimburses Bus &Eacute;ireann for a range of costs identified as being directly incurred in the operation and administration of the scheme, together with an agreed 13% charge to cover all other direct costs and indirect costs attributable to the work carried out for the Department.  In recent years an element of the 13% charge has been rebated to the Department by mutual consent. The breakdown of the 2010 and 2011 figures (&euro;18.2m and &euro;16.7m) are available on the Committee of Public Accounts website.</p><p>  While the scheme has evolved since 1975 it continues to be operated under the original arrangement and there is no obligation upon the Department under the EU Directive to terminate this arrangement.</p><p>  Issues relating to the present arrangements for the school transport scheme have been raised with me and with my officials by various representative groups</p><p>  As the Deputy points out, a Commercial High Court case was taken by Student Transport Scheme Ltd against the Minister for Education and Skills.  The judgement, delivered on 23 October 2012, concludes that the operation of the Scheme does not establish the existence of a contract and that the evidence establishes that the arrangements between the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann do not contain terms that might normally be associated with a commercial contract.  The detailed judgement is available on the Courts Service website.  This is currently the subject of a potential appeal by Student Transport Scheme Ltd to the Supreme Court. </p><p>  I am sure that the Deputy will accept that matters that may be raised in the context of such an appeal should properly be addressed in that forum.</p></reply>

The main craft trades have been designated by F&Aacute;S and come within the scope of the Statutory Apprenticeship system.  While there are apprenticeships in the electrical and mechanical sectors, there is no apprenticeship in Mechanical Engineering at present.  The full list of apprenticeship trades is available at www.fas.ie.  Apprenticeship in Ireland is organised by F&Aacute;S in co-operation with the Department of Education and Skills, Employer Bodies and Trade Unions.  Apprenticeship is a partnership between Employer Bodies, Trade Unions, the Department of Education, F&Aacute;S and the Apprentice.  Assuming that the individual in question registers as an apprentice, a training allowance will be paid when he attends off-the-job training at phases 2, 4 and 6.</p><p>  To register as an apprentice the entry requirements are as follows:</p><p>1. The prospective apprentice must obtain employment as an apprentice in their chosen occupation.</p><p>2. The employer must be approved by F&Aacute;S and must register the prospective apprentice as an apprentice with F&Aacute;S.</p><p>3. The minimum age at which the employment of an apprentice may commence is 16 years of age.</p><p>4.  The minimum educational requirements are:</p><p>- Grade D in Five subjects in the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills Junior Certificate Examination or an approved equivalent, or</p><p>- The Successful completion of an approved Pre-Apprenticeship course, or</p><p>- Be over 18 years of age, have at least 3 years work experience approved by F&Aacute;S</p><p>5.  In certain crafts, apprenticeship applicants are required to pass a colour vision test approved by F&Aacute;S.  </p><p>  Some apprenticeship job vacancies are advertised on the Department of Social Protection website under the section titled &quot;Jobseekers&quot; which can be accessed at www.welfare.ie.  The individual in question may also contact their local F&Aacute;S Training centre to discuss the Standards Based Apprenticeship Scheme.</p></reply>

The convention establishing the EUI was signed in April, 1972 and Ireland acceded to the convention in March 1975.  The EUI's functions include advanced post-graduate and post-doctoral teaching, and research across four Departments - History and Civilisation, Economics, Law and Political and Social Sciences. </p><p>  Article 5 of the Convention sets out the authorities of the Institute, being the High Council, the Principal of the Institute and the Academic Council.  Article 6 outlines the composition and responsibilities of the High Council, which involves the main guidance of the Institute, directing its activities and supervising its development.  This includes, for example, the appointment of the Principal and the Secretary of the Institute, the approval of the Institute's budget and giving a discharge to the Principal in respect of the implementation of the budget, the approval of the general teaching policy, the creation of posts for professors assigned to the Institute and the creation of interdisciplinary centres within the Institute.</p><p>  Article 6 also provides that the High Council be composed of representatives of the Governments of the Contracting States and that the office of President of the High Council shall be held for one year by a representative of each of the Contracting States in turn.  Ireland holds the office of President of the High Council from March 2013 to March 2014.  The President works closely with the Principal of the Institute, its Secretariat and the other Contracting States represented on the High Council in directing the activities of the Institute, supervising its development and discharging the responsibilities of the High Council set out in the Convention.</p></reply>

There will therefore not be a reduction in resource teaching time for these pupils over the amount of support provided last year. </p><p>  Details of the SNA and resource teaching allocations which have been made to schools by the NCSE to date for the 2013/2014 school year are now available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie, which provides details of the SNA and resource teaching allocations for each school on a school by school and per county basis.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the NCSE recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools. </p><p>I have, as suggested by the Report, requested the NCSE to establish a Working Group to develop a proposal, for consideration, for a new allocation model for teaching supports for children with Special Educational Needs based on the profiled educational needs of children in schools, and which will aim to ensure that resources are directed to those children and schools who need them most.</p></reply>

I have referred the draft General Scheme and draft regulations to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, to allow a full public discussion of the proposed legislative framework, including inputs from parents and the education partners.  I hope the Committee will give this early consideration so that we can proceed to the next stage of legislation as soon as possible.   </p><p>  In bringing forward these proposals, my policy objective is to ensure that every child is treated fairly and that the way in which schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent.  As the Bill and the Regulations will be published in draft form, they will also be subject to a lot of detailed scrutiny before becoming law.  I will be reflecting carefully on the views expressed in the consultation process to ensure they strike the right balance between school autonomy and fairness in our education system.</p></reply>

The redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers is key to the Department's ability to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers.  Thereafter, schools are required under the panel arrangements to fill permanent vacancies from supplementary panels comprised of eligible fixed-term (temporary/substitute) and part-time teachers.</p><p>  The detailed arrangements for panel access for fixed term (temporary), substitute and part-time teachers for the 2013/14 school year are set out in Circular 0038/2012 which is available on the Department website.</p><p>  All eligible applicants who met the eligibility criteria were placed on the relevant supplementary panels.  Applicants who did not meet the eligibility criteria were informed accordingly by my Department earlier this year.  There is no mechanism to expand the criteria to cater for unsuccesful applicants. </p></reply>

However, unlike other subject areas, the content of the religious curriculum provided by schools is not set by my Department.  The Education Act recognises the rights of the different church authorities to design curricula in religious education and to supervise their teaching and implementation.  This means that the content of the religious education programme in a particular primary school is determined by the patron of the school.</p><p>  The situation is similar at post primary level, where a programme of religious instruction approved by the school patron may be offered.  However, post primary schools also have the option of using the Religious Education curriculum which has been designed as an examinable subject at Junior and Leaving Certificate by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).  The NCCA syllabuses are academic in nature.  They are concerned with understanding religion as a phenomenon in the world and are designed to be studied by students of all religious faiths and of none.  The new specification for Religion in Junior Cycle, as part of the new Junior Cycle Framework, will be available for September 2017. </p><p>  It is important to note that, under section 30 of the Education Act (1998), no student can be required to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student. </p><p>  My Department continues to implement the measures identified in the Action Plan that I published in June 2012 in response to the Report of the Advisory Group to the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism.  As well as implementing the measures that will ensure that school patronage, in the selected areas, reflects parental preferences, I have also requested the NCCA to start exploring, with the education partners and religious interests, the development of Education about Religion and Beliefs (ERB) and Ethics programmes which will supplement existing faith formation programmes in schools. </p><p>  The developmental work will draw on current practice in schools in this area as well as international good practice and research and will be informed by the same pedagogical principles that underpin the rest of the primary school curriculum.  The work will also be informed by the experiences of the Community National Schools, under the auspices of the Education and Training Boards.  The unique 'Goodness Me Goodness You' multi-belief programme being developed with and by those schools in an action research approach, is premised on inter-religious dialogue and dialogue between religion and belief systems.  The programme they are developing will become available on-line over the coming months and it will be of interest to all working in the field of religious education.</p></reply>

The course was included in the CAO handbook by AIT without prior agreement from the HSE in relation to the provision of clinical placements. The HEA's concern was that the students on the programme would be proceeding on a course without an agreement in place in relation to the provision of clinical placements, and as a consequence would undertake an incomplete course of study.  In November 2012, out of concern for the position of students involved, the HSE agreed that it would support the students who had already commenced the course to access clinical placements provided AIT succeeded in achieving accreditation for the course. </p><p>  Institutes of Technology are autonomous statutory bodies with responsibility for their own academic affairs and it is the responsibility of the institutions themselves to secure accreditation and professional recognition for particular courses where appropriate.  It is normal practice with new courses leading to a professional accreditation that they must operate for a period while accreditation is being established.  In the case of the AIT course, the Institute initially sought accreditation from the British Academy for Audiology (BAA).  However, AIT encountered difficulties in obtaining this accreditation and the BAA subsequently suspended their accreditation process.  A number of alternative options for accrediting the course were examined.  However, the institute was unable to get the required accreditation and the HEA was advised in May 2013 of AIT's decision to discontinue the programme.</p><p>  On foot of a High Court Judicial Review in August 2013 the HSE agreed to offer twelve clinical placements for the students and to work with AIT to secure other placements on the understanding that a Professor Audiology would within six months write and endorse the course as being equivalent to a BSc in Audiology internationally.  Based on the above understandings, the HEA has agreed to fund the programme for this cohort of students.  This agreement by the HSE and HEA allows AIT to recommence the audiology programme thus enabling the students to continue with their course. </p><p>  The total legal costs of the action for AIT are not yet available, however I understand that the institute has agreed that it will cover the legal fees for the students involved in the case.  The HEA has kept my Department fully informed of all developments in relation to this programme and I have received regular updates on the efforts that have been taken by the HEA in consultation with the HSE to ensure that the issues with the programme are resolved in the best interests of the students. </p><p>The HEA has recently written to the President of AIT seeking clarification on a number of issues including the likely timelines associated with the appointment of an external independent Professor of Audiology and confirmation that the students have been fully informed of the risks attaching to proceeding with the course, particularly in relation to professional accreditation. In addition, at the request of the HEA, the Governing Body has initiated a comprehensive review of circumstances surrounding the matter.  On finalisation of this review consideration will be given as to what further action is appropriate.</p></reply>

This Fund is being financed by the cash contributions of up to &euro;110 million pledged by the religious congregations to support the needs of some 15,000 survivors of residential institutional child abuse.  Counselling, psychological support and mental health services are one the four classes of services specified in the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act, 2012 within which the Board can determine approved services.  The Board is also required to determine the criteria by reference to which it will make decisions in respect of applications to it.</p><p>The Board has met on a number of occasions since its establishment and is considering the arrangements to be put in place for the operation of the Fund.  In performing its functions the Board will have regard to the existence of publicly available services.</p><p>In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that the National Counselling Service, which operates under the auspices of the Health Service Executive, provides counselling services to those who have been abused in childhood, with priority given to those abused in residential institutional care.  In addition, the HSE also provides funding for psychotherapy and counselling services for victims of institutional abuse living abroad through the External Counselling Claims fund. </p><p>The establishment of the Statutory Fund does not affect the entitlement of former residents to receive support from these services. </p></reply>

In its principles the Framework highlights the role of "creativity and innovation". There are 24 Statements of Learning which specify what students should know, understand, value and be able to do at the end of junior cycle. A number of the statements are relevant to enterprise but one in particular emphasises that the students "should take initiative, be innovative and develop entrepreneurial skills". </p><p>  In Senior Cycle, there are opportunities to develop entrepreneurial skills through, for example, the Leaving Certificate Business Studies course or through participation in the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme Links modules and in the Leaving Certificate Applied.</p><p>  For Transition Year students there is the opportunity to participate in the Sean Lemass Awards that include the Transition Year Mini Company and its &quot;Get up and Go&quot; competition and the County/ City Enterprise  Board &quot;Student Enterprise &quot; Competition.

There is no scope to give any consideration to the provision of additional teachers in order to reduce class sizes.</p><p>  Classroom teachers are currently allocated under the published Staffing Schedule on the basis of a general average of 1 teacher for every 28 pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools. The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. My Department's guidance to schools is that variations in class sizes should be kept to the minimum.</p></reply>

It has completed its initial assessment of all first time applications received before the August 5th deadline for priority processing. Late applications continue to be accepted.</p><p>  This year the SUSI process consists of 3 stages:Following the on-target completion of the first stage (initial assessment), 61,000 first time applicants have now been assessed by SUSI, including 3,000 late applications. Of these 51,000 are eligible to proceed to the next stage of the process - to return documents requested by SUSI to support their application.  However, it is anticipated that only about 40,000 applications will actually proceed to final decision. This prediction is based on last year's experience in the numbers of applicants who applied to SUSI but in the end did not proceed to college:  9,000 first-time applicants were refused a grant in 2012 because they did not meet the all the eligibility criteria and a further 1,400 were cancelled in 2012 at the applicant's request.</p><p>The second stage of the SUSI process is for students to return their completed document packs as requested by SUSI to support their applications. Applicants have until 24 September to do this to be prioritised for the third stage of the process.</p><p>  The third stage of the SUSI process which is final assessment and final decision has been substantially streamlined for 2013 by the automation of SUSI's links to the CAO. However those applicants who are outside the CAO (and those within the CAO who have not opted in to allow CAO share information with SUSI) must provide SUSI with a Final Course Acceptance Form (FCA) confirming which college/course they selected. This is necessary before the grant application can be finally decided. A SUSI campaign for the return of the FCA form (which can now submitted online at www.susi.ie) is ongoing.</p><p>  Following receipt of the FCA form by SUSI, applications can be finalised once colleges have confirmed that students have registered for their courses. This contact with the colleges takes place in early October and, together with students providing their bank details to SUSI, is the final step necessary before grants can be paid.</p><p>The published first grant payment dates are 18 October for higher education and 25 October for further education (PLC) applicants.</p></reply>

The Act provides that Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the body established under that Act, shall publish a Code of Practice, establish the Mark and accept applications from providers of education and training for authorisation to use the Mark.</p><p>  Section 60 of the Act states that the Code of Practice shall contain provisions relating to the protection of enrolled learners, the collection of fees and the tax compliance of the providers concerned. Section 61 states that providers wishing to apply for the Mark shall have established procedures for quality assurance and access, transfer and progression in accordance the Act and that each programme provided by the provider leads to an award which is recognised in the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), if it is capable of being so recognised. Only when these conditions are met can a provider apply to demonstrate its compliance with the Code of Practice.</p><p>  The Act does not restrict applications only to providers of English language courses or programmes leading to degrees nor does it distinguish between the Irish and non-Irish awarding bodies, so long as the awards are aligned to the NFQ.</p><p>  Section 64 of the Act provides for the payment of an annual charge for authorisation to use the Mark. The actual fee that will be charged to providers is still under consideration.</p><p>  QQI are currently undertaking a comprehensive policy development programme, involving consultation with all the relevant stakeholders regarding the formulation of policies across all of their functions. As part of this programme they have published a Green Paper on the International Education Mark and the deadline for submissions on that Green Paper passed on 13 September. QQI will now develop a White Paper on the International Education Mark before their Board adopts a policy in this area. It is expected that QQI will publish the Code of Practice and establish the International Education Mark in 2014.</p></reply>

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.  Children who have school placements and meet the criteria for eligibility under the medical strand of the scheme may be approved for home tuition in circumstances where (a) they cannot attend school at all or (b) where they are absent for a significant proportion of the school year and where the degree of absence is such that without supplementary instruction they are unlikely to be able to perform academically at the level appropriate to his/her level of ability.</p><p>  Children with a special educational need who are awaiting an educational placement may be approved for home tuition as an interim measure pending the identification of a school placement for them by the National Council for Special Education.  If a placement becomes available for a child during the school year home tuition will be withdrawn.  In certain circumstances the tuition allocation may be withdrawn on a phased basis to facilitate the transition of a child into school placement.</p></reply>

Since becoming Minister for Education and Skills, I have taken a number of steps aimed at helping reduce the burden on families.</p><p>  I have met with members of the Irish Educational Publishers' Association and have received a commitment from them to limit the publication of new editions of textbooks and to maintain editions of books in print, unchanged for at least six years. The publishers have also assured me that they would sell books for rental schemes to schools at substantial discounts.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that I am very much in favour of schools establishing textbook rental schemes.  I launched new &quot;Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools&quot; on the 28th January last. These Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated. The aim of the Guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.</p><p>  I have also been clear in my support for any measures that can be put in place to reduce uniform costs for parents including measures such as the use of generic type uniforms or the use of &quot;sew on&quot; crests.  I have raised this matter informally with the National Parents Council at primary level and recommended that the National Parents Councils &ndash; Primary and Post Primary mobilise parents associations to raise this issue with school authorities.</p><p>  It is very important that all schools are sensitive to the financial pressures on parents in making decisions, not just about school uniforms or books, but about any matter that has cost implications for parents.</p><p>  I believe that schools should consult parents on matters relating to their children's education, including those matters which have cost implications, and schools should be responsive to the views and concerns of parents.  In that regard, I believe that requiring schools to have a parent and student charter can help ensure that schools will interact better with individual parents and with the parent associations generally. The cost of school uniforms is one area where there should be a shared view.</p><p>  The creation of parents' and students' charters, including an examination of any required legislation, will be among the issues to be progressed by my Department over the next year.</p></reply>

Major changes are being made to initial teacher training and literacy and numeracy units are now in place in the National Teacher Induction Programme. School self-evaluation is being rolled out and I have introduced new requirements on standardised testing including the return of aggregate data to my Department.  A national programme of professional development for primary and second level teachers is underway.</p><p>  The Strategy acknowledges that learners in Irish schools experience language learning in both English and Irish throughout their school careers.  It also recognises the range of linguistic settings in schools - English-medium schools, gaelscoileanna, gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; and Gaeltacht schools.  This diversity brings particular challenges for the teaching and learning of literacy.</p><p>The literacy and numeracy strategy recognises that the learners in Irish-medium schools and settings have very varied learning needs and that they need to develop literacy skills in both Irish (as their first language or as the first language of the school) and in English.</p><p>  In relation to the needs of Gaeltacht schools, a number of measures have been progressed under the Strategy.In the area of initial teacher education, work is underway in looking at entry requirements for initial teacher education including the standard of Irish required and the importance of the standard of Irish among both primary and post-primary teachers in regard to teaching Irish as a subject, using it as a means of communication in schools and using it as a medium of instruction. In relation to curriculum, work has begun on the recasting of the Junior Cycle Irish curriculum.  A background paper is due to be published shortly by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  The new curriculum will be developed in line with the Strategy and should reflect the particular needs of students in Irish medium schools in the Gaeltacht.  The NCCA is also working on the new integrated language curriculum for primary schools which will enable teachers to achieve learning efficiencies by explicitly drawing children's attention to similarities and differences between their languages.</p></reply>

This includes recommendations in relation to the rolling out of a Universal Newborn Hearing Screening Programme, the provision of information to parents in relation to services available to children with hearing impairment, the provision of Irish Sign Language support for children and their families, and with regard to the establishment of new special classes for children who are deaf or hard of hard of hearing.</p><p>  The Departments of Health and Education along with the Health Service Executive and the Visiting Teachers for the Hearing Impaired have also developed and agreed new co-operative working structures, as has been recommended by this report.</p><p>  The NCSE has opened one new such special class for Deaf/hard of hearing children for the 2013/14 school year and will continue to open such classes, as necessary. This brings the total number of special classes for children with hearing impairment to 16 special classes with 10 special classes being attached to mainstream primary schools, with 6 special class at post-primary level. There are also 3 special schools for children with hearing impairment.</p><p>  An enhanced capitation grant is provided to the special schools and special classes for hearing impaired pupils.</p><p>  Pupils in special classes and special schools for hearing impaired children are supported by enhanced pupil teacher ratios of 7:1. Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support is also provided in these schools and classes, as required.</p><p>  In line with my Department's policy that children with special educational needs (SEN) access appropriate education intervention in mainstream settings where possible, many deaf/ hard of hearing pupils are integrated into mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level with the assistance, as necessary, of resource teaching and special needs assistant support.</p><p>  Grant-aid is also provided to schools towards the provision of special equipment for pupils who are hard of hearing, such as sound field systems and radio aids.</p><p>  My Department also provides funding for a weekly home tuition service whereby tutors visit the homes of deaf and hard of hearing pre-school children and school-going pupils to provide training in Irish Sign Language (ISL) for these children, their siblings and parents.</p><p>  In addition, the Visiting Teacher Service for Children and Young People with a Hearing Impairment is provided by my Department from the time of referral through to third level education. The Visiting Teacher service provides advice and support to ensure that the needs of children and young people with hearing impairment are met. This service is available at pre-school, primary and post-primary levels. Specifically, the service works in partnership with parents of pre-school children with hearing impairment, visiting their homes and/or meeting them in groups to inform, advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to their education and overall development and in helping their children to derive maximum benefit from the educational opportunities available.</p><p>  My Department, through the Higher Education Authority (HEA), has established and funds a Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for ISL/English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies. The course modules deal with issues such as sign linguistics, bi-lingualism and socio-linguistics of sign language. The course is delivered in seminar sessions/group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment and a project and course design.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy my Department will continue to consider and implement the recommendations of this report, in conjunction with other Departments and agencies where necessary, and subject to the availability of resources.</p></reply>

All seven universities and Dublin Institute of Technology feature in the top  600 worldwide. </p><p>  Both Trinity College Dublin and National University of Ireland, Galway have  improved their performance on last year's results.  They are to be  congratulated, but it should be noted that a range of factors can influence an  institution's placement from one year to another across the various different  ranking systems, having regard to the different criteria employed and the  relative performance of other institutions. </p><p>  There can be significant debate around the relative importance attached to  rankings criteria and on their capacity to fully capture the quality of what is  on offer in higher education institutions.   QS have been criticised for their  reliance on highly subjective reputational surveys used for the reputation  indicators. In Ireland's case it is likely that the perceptions of those  surveyed will also have been influenced by external factors, including the  wider economic crisis.  QS use the student faculty ratio as a proxy for the  quality of teaching and learning in our institutions and this indicator has  been inevitably effected by the reality of Ireland's economic situation which  presents challenges right across the public sector, including higher education.  </p><p>  Delivering high quality higher education for a growing proportion of our  population in this context will mean that we need to maintain a clear focus on  system performance overall rather than a narrower focus on individual  institutional performance.  However, it is recognised that league tables are  referenced by international investors, employers and students as a marker of  quality across systems and as such they cannot be ignored.  While some higher  education systems have invested heavily in elite institutions and adopted a  policy of differentiated support for different tiers of institutions, in  Ireland our focus is on advancing performance across an accessible and diverse  system of institutions.  This policy which promotes participation in high  quality higher education provision is paying dividends for Ireland's growing  competitiveness.   </p><p>Ireland performs well against many international benchmarks and is ranked first  in EU and fourth in OECD for higher education attainment rates of our 25-34  year olds.  </p><p>  Our high numbers of young graduates has led Ireland to be ranked 3rd for the  availability of skilled labour in this year's IMD World Competitiveness  Survey.  This follows the positive findings of the 2012 Talent Shortage Survey  conducted annually by the Manpower Group, which ranked Ireland as the global  leader for the availability of skills and the least difficult location,  globally, in which to find talent.   </p></reply>

In addition, a number of new initiatives have been implemented as  recommended by the independent review by Accenture.  The initiatives include  direct information sharing between SUSI and Government bodies and agencies  including the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection, the  General Register Office (GRO) and the Central Applications Office (CAO).  These  links should reduce significantly the number of documents required from  students in processing their grant applications. </p><p>  SUSI introduced a self-service online application tracker.

One aspect of this Agreement relates to supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and as both Unions that represent SNAs namely, SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to the Haddington Road Agreement, the Department has now implemented supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2013/2014 school year. </p><p>  The detailed arrangements are set out in Departmental Circular 0037/2013 which issued on 1 July 2013 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address: .</p><p>  The first part of the LRC proposals for supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs outlines that the supplementary assignment arrangements only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant. </p><p>  Accordingly, with effect from 1 May 2013 once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service is notified by his/her employer that he/she is to be made redundant then he/she shall be deemed to be a member of a Supplementary Assignment Panel for SNAs. </p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that the 1st of May date was set in Circular 0037/2013 in order to ensure that the overwhelming majority of SNAs who worked in schools during the past year would be eligible for the supplementary assignment arrangements, as agreed to in the LRC proposals.</p><p>  As the LRC proposals are part of a wider public-sector pay agreement that represent compromises by both employers and unions, I do not have the ability to alter the terms of that agreement. </p></reply>

I made clear at the time that if amalgamations take place as a  result of this budget decision, they will be voluntary and follow decisions  taken by local communities and not by my Department.  </p><p>  The Deputy has also raised questions about the scope for schools to work  together via shared savings to achieve savings.  I believe it is important that  we do whatever we can to harnessing the purchasing power of all schools to help  reduce costs for individual schools.   A key government priority is to  substantially reduce costs and achieve better Value for Money (VFM) through  reforming public procurement.  As part of this reform the Office of Government  Procurement is being established to centralise procurement across the public  service and this has potential to reduce costs including also for schools. </p></reply>

The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model  proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional  resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  </p><p>  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down Syndrome who  are in the Mild General Learning Disability (Mild GLD) category should continue  to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as  other pupils with a Mild GLD.  </p><p>  The NCSE policy advice did not recommend that an exception should be made for  children with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild GLD range, over other children  who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions. </p><p>  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a  new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with  mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down Syndrome, who  have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level  of need and in line with their learning plan process.   In the meantime, schools  are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted  to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with  their needs.  </p><p>  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group  in order to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation  Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report. </p><p> </p></reply>

The DLP is responsible for  ensuring that the standard reporting procedure is followed so that suspected  cases of child abuse are referred promptly to the HSE or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The  level of resources devoted to supporting children with Special Educational  Needs has been maintained at &euro;1.3 billion this year. This includes provision  for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs), nearly 10,000 Learning Support and  Resource Teachers, provision for over 730 Special Classes attached to  mainstream schools at reduced pupil teacher ratios, enhanced capitation for  special schools and special classes and provision for assistive technology  support.  </p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Department of Health and Children/Health  Service Executive assumes direct responsibility for young adults with special  educational needs who are over 18 years. My Department may allocate funding  towards an educational component of such provision. This is generally  transacted through the co-operation hours scheme operated by Vocational  Education Committees (VECs) where the local service provider makes application  to the relevant VEC for tuition hours. My Department also provides funding to  the National Learning Network for this purpose. As such, students can continue  to participate in educational programmes through further adult educational  programmes or in adult settings.  </p><p>  Young adults with disabilities are also eligible to access F&Aacute;S mainstream  services. For 2013, the F&Aacute;S budget includes a provision for &euro;52m which will  support around 3,300 specialist vocational training places for people with  disabilities, who do not avail of the mainstream options, through Specialist  Training Providers (STPs).  </p><p>  Learners on Specialist Training programmes have the opportunity to participate  in training ranging from FETAC level 3 to level 5 on the National Framework of  Qualifications (NFQ). All training programmes delivered through these  interventions address both the generic and vocational skills requirements of  participating learners. </p><p>  Specialist training offers additional supports to learners which include  individualised training and progression plans, literacy and numeracy support,  longer training duration, adapted equipment, transport arrangements, enhanced  programme content and enhanced trainer/learner ratio. </p><p>  The Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) scheme also provides a third  level admissions scheme for school leavers who have a disability or specific  learning difficulty. Students who are considered to be DARE eligible may secure  a college place on a reduced points basis. Details of the DARE scheme are  available at www. accesscollege.ie. Additional supports for young adults with  special educational needs are also provided by Disability Officers in third  level colleges.  </p></reply>

In this regard  a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children  from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis  of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on  which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in  respect of all applicants. </p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process  where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the  Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil,  the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the  Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational  Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.  </p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can  assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for  their child. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board,  National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at  01-8738700. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I recently published a draft General Scheme for an  Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, 2013 as well as draft regulations for  discussion ahead of enacting legislation. I have referred the draft General  Scheme and draft regulations to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and  Social Protection, to allow a full public discussion of the proposed  legislative framework, including inputs from parents and the education  partners.  </p><p>  I hope the Committee will give this early consideration so that we can proceed  to the next stage of legislation as soon as possible.  </p></reply>

Where ICT is embedded in the curriculum it can  serve to engage and motivate children in the learning process. It has proven to  increase students' self-esteem and creates a more positive disposition towards  learning as well as providing teachers with more up to date, exciting and  relevant ways of presenting and engaging with the curriculum. ICT can act as a  catalyst for peer teaching and learning and is hugely powerful in the  development of team-work, higher order thinking skills and a collaborative  learning and teaching environment. </p><p>Since 1998, the national ICT in Schools programme has focused on building  capacity across the schools system for integrating ICT into teaching and  learning and developing pupils' digital literacy,  The ICT in Schools programme  must address new policy challenges and opportunities arising from major  developments in curricular reform, digital publishing, digital content  dissemination tools generally, cloud services, portable computing and student  devices, and the deployment of high speed broadband at post-primary level. In  relation to curricular reform the new junior cycle in post-primary schools  outlines eight key skills required for successful learning by students across  the curriculum and for learning beyond school. Among the key skills, one is  literacy and numeracy, which includes digital literacy.  Planning is underway  for the development of a new ICT Plan.  </p><p>The PDST Technology in Education provided in their summer course programme  (2013) for teachers a course 'Active learning in literacy and numeracy using  tablet devices'. This five day course was run in 28 different venues around the  country with approximately 400 training places.  In addition, 48 tutors were  trained to deliver the course and it is intended that these tutors will be used  during the school year and in summer 2014 to offer the same professional  development opportunity to other teachers. In addition PDST Technology in  Education have produced an advice sheets for schools and good practice videos  specifically relating to the use of tablet devices. </p><p>I am aware of the fact that parents are being asked to fund the introduction of  tablet devices into the classrooms.  In relation to the introduction of tablet  devices in schools this is an operational matter for the Board of Management of  each school and my Department has no role at individual school level in  approving such initiatives.  I believe it is important that where new  technology, is being adopted by schools parents should be consulted prior to  the decision being made and that the costs implications are fully considered by  the Boards of Managements.</p></reply>

This issue has been referred by the contractor to third party conciliation, as provided for in the contract.  The parties subsequently agreed to extend the ambit of the conciliation to encompass issues relating to other areas of the scheme. The conciliation process, which is conducted on a confidential and without prejudice basis, is expected to conclude shortly. The outcome will determine which approach is to be taken to deal with the matters in dispute and, in this context, how the remainder of the scheme will be progressed. It is therefore not possible at this point to give a timescale for completion of the works. </p></reply>

Procurement of supplies and services accounts for around &euro;9 billion of current spending by the State per annum. This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the Public Service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.</p><p>  In this regard, the National Procurement Service (NPS), which will be transferring into the new Office of Government Procurement (OGP), has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service's buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. </p><p>  In some instances the take up of the NPS arrangements has been low. In order to increase the usage of the NPS arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements. Last year my Department issued Circular 06/12 which implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. </p><p>  While the key purpose of Circular 6/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money, it is worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, these need not be accepted as the norm. The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring on-going cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions.  </p><p>  As Circular 6/12 has served its initial purpose, in that it has highlighted the exceptional value for money available to public bodies that use the limited number of framework arrangements referred to in Circular 6/12. I will shortly issue a new Circular that will replace 6/12.</p><p>As public bodies are now better informed of the wide range of goods and services available for purchase under national arrangements, the new Circular will inform public bodies of the continued need to secure best value for money through the use of national contracts,<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  put in place by the Office of Government Procurement (formerly the National Procurement Service), when procuring a range of commonly acquired goods and services. The benefits arising from these central arrangements include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency; and enhanced service levels.</p></reply>

The immediate objective of the national revaluation programme is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas is conducted as soon as possible. Revaluation is conducted across all relevant properties in one or more rating authority areas at the same time. However, implementation of the national programme cannot occur across the entire country simultaneously and the programme must, accordingly, be operated on a phased basis. Following the first revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation (Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001).</p><p>Section 9(10) of the Valuation Act 2001 provides that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions. Section 19(1) of the said Act empowers the Commissioner to make a Valuation Order specifying a rating authority area over which a revaluation is to be conducted, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the rating authority concerned.</p><p>Steady progress is being made on the National Revaluation Programme. Between 2007 and 2010 the three Rating Authority areas of South Dublin, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown were revalued comprising c.17,700 commercial properties which represents approximately 22% of the national rateable valuation base. Additionally, there are currently six revaluation projects in progress which include the Rating Authority areas of Dublin City, Waterford City and County and Dungarvan Town together with Limerick City and County comprising c. 38,000 commercial properties or 32.6% of the valuation base. Furthermore, the statutory consultation process, required before a valuation order can be made is under way with a further five rating authorities, Galway City Council, Kilkenny County Council, Kilkenny Borough Council, Carlow County Council and Carlow Town Council. Decisions in relation to a further set of rating authorities for revaluation are currently under consideration by the Valuation Office.</p><p>The current position as regards projects in train or pending is set out in the following table:</p><p><table><tr><th>Rating Authority<br />Area</th><th>Date Valuation Order Signed</th><th>Publication Date for the New Valuation List.</th><th>Number  of Items (2009 Baseline data)</th><th>% of Valuation Base [Pre - Revaluation]</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin City </td><td>05/05/2011</td><td>31/12/2013</td><td>25117</td><td>26.62</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City  </td><td>12/12/2011</td><td>31/12/2013</td><td>2548</td><td>1.44</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford County </td><td>12/12/2011</td><td>31/12/2013</td><td>1387</td><td>0.39</td></tr><tr><td>Dungarvan Town </td><td>12/12/2011</td><td>31/12/2013</td><td>621</td><td>0.24</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City </td><td>29/03/2012</td><td>31/12/2014</td><td>4085</td><td>1.94</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick County </td><td>29/03/2012</td><td>31/12/2014</td><td>4505</td><td>1.98</td></tr><tr><td>Galway City </td><td>Valuation Order pending</td><td>3702</td><td>2.30</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County </td><td>Valuation Order pending</td><td>1974</td><td>0.92</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny Borough </td><td>Valuation Order pending</td><td>993</td><td>0.48</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow County </td><td>Valuation Order pending</td><td>982</td><td>0.38</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow Town </td><td>Valuation Order pending</td><td>906</td><td>0.40</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Totals</td><td>-</td><td>46820</td><td>37.09</td><td>-</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Essentially, FOI is being extended to the widest possible definition of public bodies, including a number of significant high profile bodies which have been excluded since the legislation was first enacted.  Provision is also being made in the Bill (Section 7) to allow for the application of FOI, either in whole or in part, to non-public bodies which are in receipt of significant funding from the State.  This will be progressed in due course by way of Ministerial Order subject to consultation with the relevant Departments to agree on criteria to select bodies which are a priority for bringing within the FOI regime.</p><p>  As regards the companies that are owned by local authorities, the position is that, while it would not be possible for me to state definitively that all of the companies that are owned by local authorities will be covered by FOI under the new legislation, it appears on the face of it that such companies will be automatically comprehended by the very broad definition of public body contained in Section 6 of the FOI Bill, in particular Section 6(1)(f), subject to the appropriate commencement period provided for in Section 1(3) of the Bill. Certainly no exemption has been provided for such companies.  Confirmation of the position in any particular instance should presumably be available from the relevant local authority based on its knowledge of the specific legal structure that is in place.</p></reply>

This appointment is made by the President following nomination by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas. Since the Freedom of Information Act 1997 came into force, the Ombudsman has also held the office of Information Commissioner.  Appointment to the post is by a similar process to that of the Ombudsman.</p><p>  The practice in the past under previous administrations was for the relevant Minister to ask the Government to note the name of the proposed nominee for the position prior to the resolutions before both Houses of the Oireachtas. I considered that the most satisfactory approach to the nomination process was to invite expressions of interest for the appointment by public advertisement. It was not felt necessary to involve the Public Appointments Service in the nomination process. Some 35 expressions of interest have been received and the assessment of candidates is being undertaken at present.</p><p>  The Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 provides that the appointment may be preceded by consideration by a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas as may be designated by the relevant Minister. It is my intention that once a nominee has been approved by the Government a referral will be made to the Public Services Oversight and Petitions Committee. </p></reply>

This would be expected to have an adverse impact on the commercial position of the state body in question, which would not be in the public interest or consistent with the need to safeguard the State&rsquo;s economic and financial interests.  It was on that basis that three of the companies mentioned in the questions - Coillte Teoranta, Dublin Bus and Bus Eireann were excluded from the application of FOI under the new legislation.</p><p>  There is an argument that commercial state bodies operating in a monopoly or near-monopoly position would not be subject to competitive disadvantage and for that reason should be subject to FOI.  On that basis, I consulted with relevant colleagues about the potential of including such commercial state companies within the scope of FOI.  Following consideration of the views of my colleagues, I decided that Irish Rail should be brought within FOI now but that the other such commercial state bodies should not be included at this stage.  I intend, however, to review this position in the medium-term.  As the exemption for the commercial state bodies is provided in a Schedule to the legislation, I will be in a position to amend the position by way of Order if required.</p><p>  I also considered the question of including the Commissioners of Irish Lights (CIL) within the remit of FOI.  CIL operates throughout the whole Island of Ireland and although it is not strictly a North/South body, it operates very much on an all Ireland basis.  Consequently, with the agreement of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I decided that it would be more appropriate for CIL to be subject to the FOI Code of Practice in operation for North/South bodies which has been approved by the North South Ministerial Council and which has regard to the FOI legislation operating in both the UK and Ireland.  I understand that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will be progressing this matter in the near future.</p></reply>

The Board is comprised of the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, and three non-civil servant members, one of whom acts as Chairman. There is 1 vacancy at present for a non-civil servant member. The two Secretaries General are not paid fees for membership of the OAB.

It is not anticipated that any vacancies will arise in the next six months</p><p><b>Public Appointments Service</b></p><p>  The Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004 states that I as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice and Equality should appoint members of the Board of the Public Appointments Service. The Board is meant to be representative of our client base.  The majority of the board is therefore civil or public servants, nominated by the relevant Minister.  The Chairman is paid &euro;11,970 p.a and three board members are paid &euro;7,695 each p.a. There are no vacancies anticipated in the next six months on the PAS Board.</p><p><b>An Post National Lottery Company</b></p><p>  The statutory provision providing for the making of appointments to the Board of the National Lottery is the National Lottery Act 1986, Section 14.

The Agreement negotiated will deliver the necessary &euro;1bn saving in the public service pay and pensions bill by 2015 while ameliorating the impacts for public service staff on low and middle incomes to the greatest extent possible.  The core pay of 87% of the workers in the public service was not reduced by the legislation.</p><p>  The Government, in seeking to apply the reductions involved, distinguished between lower and higher paid public servants. The pay cuts applied under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 apply only to those higher paid public servants on annual salaries of &euro;65,000 or more. In contrast,  the related  Haddington Road Agreement which secures non-core pay savings and additional productivity from public servants protected the earnings of the majority of public servants below &euro;65,000 to the greatest extent possible commensurate with securing the savings necessary. In contrast, those on salaries over &euro;65,000 have had reductions in their pay ranging between 5.5% and 10% under the Act</p><p>  I am happy that the agreement reached between the Government and Trade Unions that represent public servants is fair, progressive and balances the interests of public servants with those using and paying for public services.</p><p>  The Government recognise that the savings sought from the public service pay and pensions bill are extremely difficult and challenging for all public servants and are very conscious of the very significant contributions they have made to date. However, the reductions now required are a necessary further contribution to the fiscal consolidation process required to restore our economic sovereignty and bring our current expenditure deficit under control. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-09-18a.1252.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013091800077#WRBB03000"><p>In relation to improving access for small and medium sized enterprises my Department has issued guidelines (Circular 10/10) that require public bodies to promote participation of such enterprises in the award of public contracts. These guidelines set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote the involvement of smaller enterprises in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts. The key provisions of the guidance include:</p><p>  - supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i>   website;</p><p>  - less use of &#8220;restrictive&#8221; tendering procedures and greater use of &#8220;open&#8221; tendering;</p><p>  - ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;</p><p>  - sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical.</p><p>  In order to promote and improve such practices the National Procurement Service (NPS), which will be transferring into the new Office of Government Procurement (OGP), established its 'Working Group to assist Small and Medium Enterprises' in February 2012 to facilitate open discussion on the issue of public service  procurement. The Working Group consists of representatives from the NPS, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Chambers Ireland, and the Small Firms Association. The Group has met on a number of occasions and has raised many issues relating to procurement and particularly how these issues impact on SMEs.  Resulting from these discussions the NPS has issued two circulars to all buyers in, and suppliers to, the public service with the aim of improving practice in the procurement arena.  </p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide. Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.</p><p>  In summary, increasing value for money through better government procurement is a key programme in the reform agenda. The reform of procurement across the public service is commencing and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business, however it is important for the SME sector to understand how public procurement is changing and to engage the public sector buyers through the fora available. The procurement management team will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way. </p></reply>

National rules governing public procurement must comply with EU Treaty principles, rules, and national guidelines. These rules have been developed to ensure equal treatment; non-discrimination; mutual recognition; proportionality; and transparency. </p><p>  Tenderers who feel that they have not been treated fairly during the course of a public procurement process may have recourse under the Remedies Directive (EU Directive 2007/66/EC) which provides for remedies in both the public sector and utilities sectors, for tenderers and others that have been harmed by breaches of the Public Contracts and Utilities Directives; this Directive has been transposed into Irish Law by regulations made under Statutory Instruments 130 of 2010 and 131 of 2010. </p><p>  The Remedies Directives leaves it to the Member States (MS) to decide whether reviews are handled by administrative or judicial bodies. The Annual Implementation Review published by the European Commission (9 October 2012) outlines the review procedures in EU Member States. First-instance independent reviews are carried out by judicial bodies in 13 MS (DE, FI, FR, EE, EL, IE, IT, NL, PT, LT, LU, SE and UK), and by an administrative body in 14 MS (AT, BE,27 BG, CY, CZ, DK, ES, HU, LV, MT, PL, RO, SI and SK). The actual difference between the type of review body chosen is less acute than the terms 'administrative' or 'judicial' would suggest. The report goes on to clarify that, many of the administrative bodies in the MS are quasi-judicial in nature. In these countries the standing of the persons deciding the cases is also similar to a judge. </p><p>  In addition to the option of judicial review, the Remedies Directive outlines practices that are in place at national level through guidance documents issued by the National Public Procurement Policy Unit in my Department. These would include:</p><p><i>- Public Procurement Guidelines - Competitive Process 2004</i>  , in respect of the procurement of general services and supplies - highlighting the need for a competitive process in respect of contracts below the EU threshold values;</p><p><i>- Circular 10/10</i>   - provide guidance to public bodies to promote participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the award of public contracts; </p><p><i>- the Capital Works Management Framework</i>   - provides a suite of best practice guidance, standard contracts and generic template documents, which are available to download for all contracting authorities to provide a consistent approach to the management of public works and construction-related services projects; and</p><p><i>- Standardisation and simplification of tender documentation (for supplies and services)</i>   - In order to reduce the costs involved in participating or conducting the procurement function, the National Procurement Service has published a suite of model tendering and contract documents which help businesses and buyers to reduce costs. </p><p>All regulations, circulars, guidelines and standard forms (for general supplies and services) are available on the Government's eTenders website at: <i>www.eTenders.gov.ie.</i> The Capital Works Management Framework documents are available on the Construction Procurement Reform website: <i>www.constructionprocurement.gov.ie</i></p><p>  In terms of centralised procurement arrangements, the National Procurement Service (NPS) as a matter of course offers full debriefing to suppliers who have engaged in the procurement process.  At these sessions contractors can raise any areas or issues of concern.</p><p>  The NPS is also fully compliant on the issue of contractors' rights under the Remedies Directive.  Such rights ensure full disclosure of relevant details regarding the awarding of a tender and the relative merits and characteristics of that tender versus those who were unsuccessful. </p><p>  The NPS has recently established a collaborative working group which brings together Employer Representative Bodies (IBEC, SFA, ISME etc.) and procurement stakeholders in the public service to discuss issues and areas of concern. The NPS is confident that the working group will help to inform the continued delivery of best practice by public sector Buyers through the procurement process.</p><p>  Finally I would point out that the area of Public Procurement is undergoing an extensive reform. While this reform is primarily aimed at delivering public services at a competitive cost, it will also focus on improving public procurement practices. This will ensure openness, and equality of opportunity for businesses including the SME sector.</p></reply>

Drafting of the Bill has commenced and the views of the FPER Committee will feed into this drafting process.  It is anticipated that the Bill will be published later this year and enacted early in 2014.  </p><p>  The key objective in introducing a register of lobbying is to make information available to the public on the identify of those who are communicating with Government and senior civil and public  servants  on public policy matters. It will also provide a framework for holding those engaged in lobbying accountable for the manner in which they conduct the activity.  This will allow the wider public to reach informed evidence-based judgements about the extent to which different interest groups are accessing key decision makers across the political and public service systems.  Regulation would be expected to increase the public understanding of lobbying activity in Ireland.	</p></reply>

The new rate for 14 of these committees is &euro;8,740 if the chairperson is a TD and &euro;5,989 if the chairperson is a Senator.

Ministers may not claim for these expenses.  Under the same Regulations, an additional amount of &euro;1,700 per annum is payable to the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee for the same purpose. An additional amount of &euro;1,000 per annum is to the Chairman of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, a Joint Committee appointed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Select Committee on Members&rsquo; Interests of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, or the Select Committee on Members&rsquo; Interests of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003 transferred to the Commission from the Minister for Finance the function of payment of the allowances referred to.</p><p>  There is no Committee Chairperson hospitality allowance payable to a committee chairperson.  However, I am informed by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Service that an allocation is provided to Oireachtas committees to meet expenditure incurred within the Leinster House complex on entertainment associated with committee business or arising from official committee travel. When entertainment arises, the committee present the relevant invoice or receipt, following which that bill is then paid by the Oireachtas.  Each committee can spend a maximum of &euro;2,539 per annum.</p><p>  If the Deputy wishes to obtain further information on that allocation, or details of payments made in a particular year or period in respect of these allowances, she may request these from the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission directly. </p></reply>

The webpage can be found at .  The EU's initial position papers which were published on that webpage subsequent to the first round are the technical documents that were presented to the US side during the first round. These documents cover the following areas:-</p><p>  - Cross-cutting &amp;amp; institutional provisions on regulatory issues</p><p>  - Technical barriers to trade</p><p>  - Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures (i.e. barriers to trade in food and agricultural products) </p><p>  - Public Procurement </p><p>  - Raw materials and energy</p><p>  - Trade and sustainable development </p><p>  These papers were prepared ahead of the first round with the involvement of the EU Trade Policy Committee. The normal interdepartmental co-ordination process informed the position taken by Ireland.</p><p>  The negotiations will be an iterative and on-going process and my Department, as lead Department for coordinating Ireland's interests in EU trade policy, will bring together the inputs from all Departments and relevant stakeholders in order to evaluate Ireland's interests in these negotiations.  In this context, my Department recently launched a Request for Tenders for a &#8220;Study to Examine the Economic and other impacts on Ireland of a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and related potential opportunities&#8221;. The focus of this study will be to identify opportunities and key areas and sectors of the Irish Economy that will be impacted by the TTIP and to quantify this impact. The study should also identify the appropriate strategy that should be deployed to maximise the potential arising from the TTIP and provide an assessment of the longer term implications for enterprise policy. </p></reply>

These requirements are largely reflected in the Companies Act 1963, the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 and the European Communities (Companies: Group Accounts) Regulations 1992, as amended.  Equivalent requirements apply across the EU.  The Fourth and Seventh Directives have been replaced by a new Accounting Directive 2013/34/EU which is required to be transposed by July 2015.  The requirements concerning the accounts of unlimited companies are governed by domestic legislation. </p><p>  The extent to which profits are or are not disclosed is of general application and is not determined on the basis of the sector in which a company or group operates.

There is also an extensive range of statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary bargaining process, together with long-established dispute settling institutions that play an important role in disputes relating to collective bargaining.  </p><p>  In the absence of a practice of voluntary collective bargaining, subject to agreed qualifying criteria, the Industrial Relations Acts, 2001 &amp;amp; 2004, provide for a mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers in their totality could be assessed. </p><p>  A 2007 decision of the Supreme Court in Ryanair v The Labour Court, brought clarity in terms of the process to be followed where issues pursued to the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Acts, 2001 &amp;amp; 2004 to resolve problems between employers and workers on employee representation issues where that could not be done through existing procedures.</p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to reform the current law on employees' right to engage in collective bargaining (the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001), so as to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. </p><p>  With this in mind, in late 2012, I wrote to relevant stakeholders inviting their observations on the matter. Submissions have been received and follow up meetings took place between Departmental officials and stakeholders up to end May 2013. </p><p>  I hope to be in a position to put proposals to Cabinet later this year. In this context, I am certain that satisfactory arrangements can be put in place that will reconcile Ireland&rsquo;s constitutional, social and economic traditions, and international obligations, whilst at the same time ensuring continued success in building Ireland&rsquo;s domestic jobs-base and in attracting overseas investment into the economy.</p></reply>

No. 224/1989) give effect to Directive 85/577/EEC on Contracts Negotiated Away from Business Premises, and give consumers a right to cancel contracts for goods or services concluded during unsolicited visits to the consumer's home or place of work or during an excursion organised by the trader away from his business premises. This right must be exercised within seven days of the making of the contract. The Regulations further specify the information to be provided by the trader on the consumer's right of cancellation. The Regulations do not apply to contracts with a value of less than &euro;50 and to certain other specified contracts.      </p><p>  The European Communities (Protection of Consumers in Respect of Contracts Made by Means of Distance Communications) Regulations 2001 (S.I. No. 207 of 2001) give effect to Directive 97/7/EC on Distance Contracts and apply to consumer contracts concluded by mail, e-mail, telephone or online. The Regulations give consumers a period of seven days in which to cancel such contracts and also specify the information, including information on the consumer's right of cancellation, which the trader must provide prior to the conclusion of the contract. Certain specified contracts are outside the scope of the Regulations and the right of cancellation. The European Communities (Distance Marketing of Consumer Financial Services) Regulations (S.I. No. 853 of 2004) provide for a cancellation period of 14 to 30 days for distance contracts for financial services.  </p><p>Directives 85/577/EEC and 97/7EC are due to be replaced by Directive 2011/83/EU on Consumer Rights. The new Directive requires traders engaged in the supply of goods or services on a distance or off-premises basis to provide a broader range of information to consumers, extends protections to visits by the trader to the consumer's home or place of work solicited by the consumer, and increases the duration of the period within which contracts can be cancelled from seven to fourteen days. My Department published a consultation paper on the implementation of the Directive in May 2013, and this can be accessed at    . Member States are required to transpose the new Directive by 13 December 2013 and to apply it from 13 June 2014.</p></reply>

The HSA has focused on health and safety in the agriculture sector over many years and continues to do so.</p><p>  Last year I approved the HSA's 2013 Programme of Work, which was prepared against a background of unacceptably high levels of work-related deaths and injuries in the agriculture sector. The Programme acknowledged that while progress has been made in agriculture by bringing stakeholders together and by developing action plans where everyone has a role to play, it was not enough and thus provided for a HSA led campaign of awareness raising around specific risks along with identified priority actions for the sector. Out of the 12,850 planned workplace inspections and investigations for 2013, 3,000 will be carried out in the high risk agriculture sector.  </p><p>  The HSA has continued its practice of emphasising the importance of workplace health and safety in the agriculture sector. In this regard, in April this year, in line with the Programme of Work, a two-week farm safety campaign with a focus on joint involvement with farmer representative organisations was carried out.  The campaign included actions such as farm walks and talks, with a particular focus on farmers in the 60+ age group.  This age-group was focused upon as over half the people killed over the last decade in agriculture were in this age-group.  In an effort to focus attention on age as a risk factor, the HSA and the IFA have jointly produced a DVD entitled 'Older, Wiser, Safer - A Practical Guide to Safety for Older Farmers.' </p><p>  The HSA has also used the partnership approach to improving farm safety.  This approach involves engaging with the major stakeholders in the agriculture sector in the task of improving farm safety through the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee - a sub-committee of the Board of the HSA.  This approach is designed to better support the identification and development of broad based actions by the primary stakeholders to assist in developing and sustaining a safety and health culture within the sector.  It seeks to emulate the approach that has worked well in the construction sector.</p><p>An important element of achieving improved farm safety outcomes is the recently published three-year (2013-15) Action Plan for the Farm Safety Partnership.  This plan aims to deliver coordinated initiatives on awareness raising, safety promotion, research and special projects. In response to the serious challenges faced in agriculture, the HSA has<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  introduced a number of initiatives including: </p><p>- On-line farm risk assessment tool   . </p><p>  - A Code of Practice for Agriculture which includes a Risk Assessment Document and a Safe System of Work Plan (SWWP). The Code provides practical user-friendly guidance with respect to farmers, family members, employees, service providers, advisers, trainers and persons with a role related to safety and health. It sets out clearly the major risks in farming and provides a simple approach through the risk assessment document to managing safety at farm level.</p><p>  - An extensive media campaign on national TV, national &amp;amp; local radio and in the print media.</p><p>  In 2012, the HSA has carried out an integrated farm safety media campaign, which included graphic TV advertisements, and hard-hitting radio and print advertisements, all with a strong focus on the shocking consequences of farm accidents for real farmers.  The aim of this element of the HSA's campaign was to drive home the terrible consequences that result from accidents in the agriculture sector.</p><p>Early this year, a very hard-hitting radio advertisement involving the effects of power-take- off (PTO) entanglement, previously aired in 2012, was again featured on National and local radio and will be aired again coming up to the impending National Ploughing Championships (24th - 26th September), at which the HSA, with assistance from the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee will have a very visible presence, where it will host a major farm safety stand featuring both external active demonstrations of tractor and quad bike safety and internal demonstrations on a wide range of guidance and information available from the HSA.. Associated HSA sponsored radio and print advertisements highlighting the importance of farm safety<s><font color="#FF0000"> </font></s>are in place from 16<sup>th</sup>   September until after the Championships.  </p><p>  Particularly due to the number of child fatalities so far this year on Irish farms (3), the HSA has placed a Child Safety advertisement again in the Irish Farmers Journal and National and local press, to be aired before and during the Ploughing Championships. This advertisement, which won Gold in the Irish Print Advertisements Kinsale Sharks Awards for 2013 will also feature on National Ploughing Championships mobile boards.</p><p>  In addition, &#8220;Survivor Stories&#8221; DVDs, all with a strong focus on the shocking consequences of farm accidents for real farmers, have been widely distributed to all farming organisations for showing at meetings of their members. The HSA hopes for more use of these DVDs and other guidance material in the coming months. Similarly, images and stories of other serious accidents were shown before and after the &#8220;Ear to the Ground&#8221; television programme.</p><p>  The HSA has 20 Inspectors who carry out proactive inspection work in the agriculture sector including 5 full time specialists in the Agriculture Inspection Group.   The level of awareness among farmers in relation to their duty to ensure a safe farm - based on inspection - is now estimated at 80%.  It continues to be the experience of the Inspectors that while the standard of the individual Safety Statement/Code of Practice is, in general, adequate to control the risks on the farm, the implementation of the identified controls and allocation of resources required is lower. </p><p>  In July this year, the HSA commenced a 'Farm Safety Survey' of 3,000 randomly selected, farm households. The overall aim of the proposed research is to identify the factors most likely to influence farmers in Ireland to make long-term behavioural changes with regard to their daily farm work, to improve knowledge of methods of farm accident prevention, to inform future HSA preventive activity and to make recommendations concerning how best to make farms safer places to work and live. </p><p>Ultimately, day-to-day responsibility for workplace safety rests with those in the workplace in the first instance.  In that context, it is important that we continue to maintain a strong focus on workplace safety as safe workplaces can ultimately only be delivered by those who control and work in them.  Agriculture, by its very nature, is one of the more hazardous occupations, especially as the workplace and family home are so often one-and-the-same.  In such circumstances<s>,</s>   I would urge all involved in the agriculture sector to re-double their efforts to improve health and safety standards in their sector.</p></reply>

Improving working capital is of course a priority for the Government.</p><p>  I introduced two targeted schemes to support an additional flow of credit into the economy, namely the Microenterprise Loan Fund and the Credit Guarantee Scheme.  </p><p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund improves access to credit for microenterprises and facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses with less than 10 employees from all industry sectors across the country, which have been refused access to credit from the banks. Support is in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks. Microfinance Ireland is delivering the Microfinance Loan Fund, and will generate &euro;40m in additional lending for microenterprises and create over 3,800 jobs over a 5 year horizon.</p><p>  The SME Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) supports SMEs who, because of lack of collateral or because of the sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing traditional bank credit. Commercially viable, well performing micro, small and medium enterprises that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services, and can demonstrate their ability to repay the loan are the target of this scheme.  The CGS will facilitate up to &euro;150 million of additional lending per annum for SMEs with potential to create over 1,000 jobs each year.  I am in the process of having the CGS independently reviewed to help improve the Scheme for all businesses, and I intend taking appropriate action as a result of the review to ensure use of the Scheme is maximised.</p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, my Department is improving access to working capital so companies can avail of increased export opportunities through a range of products as this is a key issue for growing Irish enterprises.  State supported variants of this form of finance are available in a number of countries and the SME State Bodies Group will examine if such a scheme has merit for Irish export orientated SMEs.</p><p>  While also recognising that non-bank financing instruments can also be quite effective in complementing traditional financing channels in supplying growth capital to SMEs and entrepreneurs, the SME State Bodies Group will actively explore the potential of new and/or alternative approaches to financing SMEs for example peer to peer lending, supply chain finance and crowdfunding and will  endeavour to ensure that any new initiatives within the financial system receive an appropriate response from the policy system.</p><p>  The issue of working capital for SMEs will be a key consideration during the formation of the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs.</p></reply>

This includes, inter alia, ratification of the Cape Town Convention, which provides a legal framework for international mobile assets, the 12.5% corporate tax rate, the creation of an extensive Double Taxation Treaty network and the introduction of securitisation legislation (Section 110). These in combination with Ireland&rsquo;s long history in aircraft leasing dating back to the establishment of GPA in the 1970s and the promotion and marketing of Ireland as a leasing location has resulted in more than 50 global lessors employing more than 1000 staff establishing operations in this jurisdiction. The international lessors operating in Ireland now include globally recognised companies such as: ORIX, AWAS, Airbus, GECAS, Sumitomo Mitsui, ILFC and Avolon. Since many of these companies have located in Dublin to source specialised staff and to be close to the international connectivity afforded by Dublin airport (most of the customers of these firms are based overseas), very few of the aircraft leasing firms qualify for grant support from IDA and instead tend to use fiscal and non-grant incentives.       </p><p>  While leasing doesn&rsquo;t have the public profile or job numbers associated with our ICT or Life Sciences industries, the competence, global reach and achievements of the leasing companies based here have helped Ireland acquire an international reputation as a centre of excellence in this specialised area. When airlines and their financiers anywhere in the world think about aircraft leasing, they think about Ireland. This is a significant achievement for a small economy and testament to the vision, hard work and expertise of the leasing community.</p></reply>

From their offices in Dubai and Riyadh, the agency has an experienced and locally well connected workforce in place, to provide advice and assistance to individual client companies who have this region as a business priority.  The markets where most attention has been concentrated to date are UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, with markets such as Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait considered as offering good opportunities in certain sectors.  There has been a series of Ministerial-led Trade Missions to the region over the past years and Enterprise Ireland is now planning a further Trade Mission to the focus markets of UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia early in 2014. </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland has an exceptionally well connected Market Research Centre where client companies who wish to brief themselves on these countries can access the latest databases and available business research.</p><p>  Throughout 2013, Enterprise Ireland has had delegations of Irish companies from the Education, Travel Technology, Consumer Retail, Construction, Engineering and ICT sectors participating in trade events in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.  By year end almost 60 Irish companies will have participated in these events.</p><p>  In the past two years alone, Enterprise Ireland client companies established 51 new offices in the MENA region, demonstrating a strong commitment to building lasting business relationships with their Middle East Partners.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland had also focussed on Libya for a number of years prior to the outbreak of hostilities there.  Enterprise Ireland continues to monitor the situation there closely and there is currently some activity around sectors such as aviation and healthcare. </p><p>  Other markets in North Africa have not been highlighted as priority by Enterprise Ireland due to the relative lack of activity and interest by companies in these markets, with available resources currently being dedicated to the more accessible markets in the Gulf.</p><p>Regarding the Middle East, the majority of the estimated $4.3TRN in infrastructure projects, to be completed by 2020, will take place in the Gulf Cooperation Council States of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain.

IDA cannot comment on the details of site visits as this is commercially sensitive information.</p><p>  As Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial.

At present, there are 17 IDA supported companies in Co. Wicklow employing 2,267 people.  IDA Ireland has strong relationships with these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites. </p><p>  I am determined to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for foreign direct investment. In winning such investments, I am, however, mindful of the need to address the concerns that have been expressed to me by Deputies on all sides of the House about the relatively low level of site visits to certain regional locations. I have, accordingly, requested IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to work with my Department so that we can explore what further initiatives we can take to ensure we have a better approach to enterprise development in regional locations. This exercise will complement the in-depth analysis of our FDI strategy which is currently being undertaken. This analysis, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, the changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that will be introduced in 2014 and our approach to regional development will inform the formulation of an appropriate FDI strategy for the period post 2014.</p></reply>

The Plan contains a range of policy actions to assist enterprise development.</p><p>  In terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland provides a range of supports for high potential start-up companies including, financial supports, business and marketing advice, mentoring and product development.  At present, there are 99 Enterprise Ireland client companies in Co. Cavan, employing more than 4,500 people.  Over &euro;600,000 has been paid out in funding by the agency to client companies in Co. Cavan this year. </p><p>  In 2012, EI client companies created 374 jobs in Co. Cavan. On 15 February, my colleague, Minister Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd officially launched the establishment by Enterprise Ireland of a &lsquo;once off&rsquo; &euro;200,000 Competitive Feasibility Fund aimed at stimulating start-ups and creating jobs and growth in the North East Region (Counties Louth, Cavan &amp;amp; Monaghan).  Three new projects are currently being supported under this initiative which provides funding of up to &euro;25,000 per project.</p><p>  To date in 2013, Cavan County Enterprise Board (CEB) has approved &euro;234,500 in financial assistance to a range of enterprises which have the potential to create 47 full time and 16 part time new direct jobs.  Cavan CEB delivered 15 enterprise-related training programmes this year which were attended by over 200 participants.  A new suite of training courses is currently being rolled out for autumn 2013. The CEB also provided mentoring assistance to 24 owner/managers of business enterprises. In addition the CEB has held special advisory clinics, and engaged with a large number of clients and prospective start-ups to discuss options for expanding their business or starting new enterprises. </p><p>  Cavan CEB launched a new initiative to support and promote female entrepreneurship, and has also been involved in a wide number of other initiatives to support microenterprises in the county, including a in the County and has supported the very successful &lsquo;Taste of Cavan&rsquo; showcase for local food producers and engaged closely with Bord Bia on developing complementary supports for new and existing local food producers.</p><p>  At present, there are 34 IDA Ireland client companies in Co. Cavan, employing approximately 3,200 people.  Approximately 70% of all FDI investments won by IDA come from within the agency&rsquo;s existing client base. IDA&rsquo;s strategy for regional locations is to leverage the existing client base in order to derive further investment opportunities. </p><p>The wider North East Region has been successful from an FDI perspective as evidenced by Ebay&rsquo;s announcement creating 450 new jobs on 14   February 2013; PayPal&rsquo;s announcement of the creation of 1,000 jobs over the next four years at its new European Operations Centre in Dundalk, and Prometric&rsquo;s announcement of a major investment in its test development services business in Ireland, to be headquartered in Dundalk with the creation of 100 jobs.  These investments will bring spin off benefits right across the North East Region. IDA will continue to consider all opportunities to leverage its property portfolio in towns like Cavan in order to facilitate investment generation and job creation.  </p><p>  I am confident that all these initiatives, together with those outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs will help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities in the county over the coming years. </p></reply>

The matter was referred by the union to the Labour Court under section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969. The Union agreed to be bound by the Court&rsquo;s Recommendation. </p><p>  The company was not represented at the Labour Court hearing. The Court found it regrettable that the Company declined to participate in the investigation of the dispute or to put forward its position on the Union's claims.</p><p>  In its recommendation, the Court could see no reason as to why the workers associated with the claim should be afforded less favourable terms and conditions of employment, including rates of pay, than those of other workers engaged in a similar work in analogous employment in which working conditions are determined by collective bargaining. In this context, the Court recommended that the dispute should be resolved by the parties entering into negotiations on the Union's claims with a view to concluding a collective agreement.</p><p>  I regret that the company has decided against attending the Labour Court hearing, contrary to good industrial relations practice in that regard. In my view, the experience and expertise of the Labour Court offers the most appropriate and effective avenue for resolving such issues. </p><p>  I would urge both parties to avail of the services of the State&rsquo;s industrial Relations machinery who remain available to assist the parties, if requested. In my opinion, engagement with the State's industrial relations machinery offers the best way whereby the parties involved in this dispute can hope to resolve their differences.</p><p>  However, the system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature and recommendations of the Labour Court are not legally binding. Neither the Labour Court, nor I, can compel a company to comply with such recommendations.

A continuing challenge for the Irish labour market is to attract from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) those skills we cannot source from within the EEA and which we need to exploit the potential for growth in high performing sectors. This is the over-arching objective of the employment permit system and my Department, through its links to the labour market and industry, is best positioned to cater for and react to trends in this area.</p><p>  The current system, whereby applicants for an employment permit undergo separate application processes with my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality, does ensure a clear division between economic migration and general immigration policies and ensures each Department has clear control of those areas of responsibility which fall within its remit. </p><p>  An amalgamation of the functions and the separation of labour market access from my Department would also be problematic from an industry prospective.  </p><p>  We also have to be mindful of the fact that the employment permits regime complements other Government initiatives, especially in the education sector, and which are aimed at increasing the domestic supply of skilled labour. This requires adjusting the employment permit regime when sufficient domestic supply becomes available.</p><p>  In addition, any relocation may incur substantial up-front costs and it is questionable what benefits may arise.  </p><p>  Notwithstanding this, both Departments are closely aligned and meet on a regular basis to discuss issues of mutual concern and some joint initiatives have been undertaken by my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality in 2013 in order to provide a more coherent service across both the employment permits and visa regimes:</p><p>- With effect from April, certain categories of non-EEA immigration permission holders, who have been offered employment in an eligible occupation are allowed to apply for an employment permit whilst already legally residing in the State. Up until that point DJEI had to refuse applications for EPs solely on the basis of the applicant being resident in Ireland and not having an appropriate residency stamp for the purposes of making an EP application.</p><p>- With effect from July, the Department of Justice and Equality permits non-EEA nationals, who have been invited to attend a job interview by an employer based in the State in a recognised occupation on the    list to seek entry to the State on a temporary basis in order to attend such interviews, and if successful, apply for and await a decision on an employment permit application.</p><p>- With effect from September, the Department of Justice and Equality, in conjunction with this Department, are piloting an Atypical Working Scheme.  This scheme provides a streamlined mechanism to deal with atypical employment where the nature of the work is not governed by the Employment Permits Acts or by administrative procedures under the Employment Permits Acts.  In essence, the Department of Justice and Equality will grant permission to work in the State where it is for less than 90 consecutive calendar days provided the employment is not in respect of an occupation on the  List. This Scheme also facilitates non-EEA nationals on a trial employment in respect of an occupation on the    List for a period of up to 90 consecutive calendar days with a view to applying for an employment permit and awaiting the outcome of the application within that timeframe.</p><p>- In addition, short term staff exchanges between both Departments will commence shortly.  This initiative is designed to improve staff awareness of the respective schemes.</p></reply>

No decisions are taken at these meetings but they provide Ministers with an opportunity to discuss current policies and issues in greater detail than is possible at formal Council Meetings and with contributions from external experts.</p><p>  My colleague, the Minister for Small Business, Mr John Perry, T.D., attended the Informal Competitiveness meeting of Internal Market and Industry Ministers in Vilnius on 23 July 2013. A senior official of the Department represented my colleague the Minister for Research and Innovation, Mr Sean Sherlock, T.D., at the Informal meeting of Ministers for Research on 24 July 2013. </p><p>The theme for EU Internal Market and Industry Ministers meeting was the   Modernisation of Public Administration, especially digitalising of public procurement, as a means to foster competitiveness in Europe.</p><p>  The meeting was chaired by the Minister of Economy of Lithuania Mr Evaldas Gustas. The European Commission was represented by the Vice-President and Commissioner in charge of Industry and Entrepreneurship, Mr Antonio Tajani, and Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, Mr Michel Barnier.  Keynote speakers included officials from the Commission and the OECD.During the meeting Ministers broke into three parallel break-out sessions and discussed Smart Procurement, Transparency and Accountability of State-owned Enterprises and SMEs: the Application of the Think Small First Principle.  </p><p>  Minister Perry chaired the break-out session on Smart Procurement which included e-procurement and the stimulation of innovative procurement.   Ministers discussed how end-to-end e-procurement integrates all phases of procurement from the electronic publication of notices to electronic payment. It can maximize the efficiency of public expenditure and become a new source of economic growth. The procurement of innovative products and services was also discussed as a key driver of the modernisation of the public sector. Minister Perry also reported back to the Council plenary meeting on the outcome of the discussions held in the break-out session.</p><p>During the break-out session on state-owned enterprises (SOEs), Ministers stressed the economic importance of SOEs and for maintaining competitiveness. Ministers agreed that it would be useful for the Member States to share recent experiences of SOE reform.</p><p>During the break-out session on SMEs, Ministers underlined that public administrations have to be responsive to the needs of SMEs. Member States were invited to apply an SME test in legislation and to simplify business licensing procedures. </p><p>The topic for the lunchtime debate focussed on female entrepreneurship as source of economic growth and new jobs.  Women make up 52 per cent of all the European population but they account for only one third of self-employed people or those starting new business in the EU. Ministers discussed measures to promote women's entrepreneurship, creativity and innovative capacity.</p><p>  The second day of the Informal Competitiveness Council on 24 July 2013 discussed research and innovation policy items which focussed on the necessary skills required to be able to serve science and innovation in the future. The discussion was guided by a paper from the Lithuanian Presidency based on the type of future skills required, national level initiatives and measures at European level. The Ministers also discussed skills mapping, skills development and skills matching. </p><p>  The meeting was chaired by Lithuanian Minister of Education and Science, Mr Dainius Pavalkis, and the European Commission was represented by European Commissioner for Research and Innovation, Ms. M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn.  </p><p>  Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn addressed the Council on the subject of the greater role of Horizon 2020 in skills development and the short-term need to address unemployment, particularly of young people at European level. Dr. Donald Dingwell, Secretary General, European Research Council, moderated the ensuing Council discussion.  Ireland made the following points:</p><p>- There is a clear need not only to increase the availability of researchers but to enhance their skills to meet European targets for EU 2020 and the European Research Area, particularly in the areas of knowledge transfer and exchange and in innovation and entrepreneurship;</p><p>- While across Europe there is a widespread level of activity and a growing number of examples of training schemes at doctoral level, there is also a need  for skills training for more established researchers;</p><p>- Horizon 2020 will play an important role in meeting Europe's needs for appropriately skilled researchers; the agreement reached between the institutions on the increased budget for Marie Curie Actions in Horizon 2020 is welcome;</p><p>- Another element to support meeting Europe's needs for skilled researchers is addressing recruitment, selection, careers and promotion issues. The work of the Steering Group on Human Resources and Mobility on these issues has been valuable in analysing the problems arising, identifying best practices and fostering mutual exchanges and learning among Member States and Associated Countries on these issues;</p><p>- Euraxess plays an important role in supporting researcher mobility and careers.</p><p>  The Council concluded that there was a clear need, not only to increase the availability of researchers, but to enhance their skills to meet European targets for EU 2020 and the completion of the European Research Area, particularly in the areas of knowledge transfer and exchange, and in innovation and entrepreneurship. While across Europe there is a widespread level of activity and a growing number of examples of training schemes at doctoral level, there is also a need for skills training for more established researchers.  In that regard, Horizon 2020 will play an important role in meeting Europe's needs for appropriately skilled researchers.</p></reply>

The company informed employees of its decision on 22 August last, and a 30 day consultation process with employees commenced.  Its North American operations have also been affected.  The cuts are as a result of certain areas of the company's operations not growing or performing as expected.

Under Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the European Commission conducts the negotiations on behalf of the EU. The Association Agreement between the EU and Central America was signed in 2012, and the trade part of the Agreement, with Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama entered into force on 1 August 2013. This will open up markets for goods, public procurement, services and investment, and should create a stable business and investment environment based on predictable and enforceable trade rules, and should also help to reinforce economic integration. The Agreement includes provisions guaranteeing the protection of human rights, as well as commitments on labour standards and environmental protection that will underpin sustainable development in the region.   Another aspect of the Agreement is that it underpins the strengthening of economic integration of the region.  This in turn will facilitate the movement of EU goods within Central America through more regional rather than "national" regulations, the use of a single administrative document for customs declarations, the harmonisation of customs procedures, and the elimination of double duties on EU goods moving from one country to another in the region.</p><p>  The labour and environmental standards which are in the sustainable development chapter of the Agreement reflect international agreements in these areas, to which Ireland is already party.  Under the EU-Central America Agreement, an arbitration system and a process that facilitates engagement with civil society are put in place to ensure an adequate degree of public accountability to initiatives that could carry consequences for labour and the environment.</p><p>  Current Irish exports to the three countries based on 2012 figures are</p><p>  - Honduras &euro;3 million, of which computers (44%), infant foods (27%) and telecommunications and sound equipment (12%), make up 83% of the total.</p><p>  - Nicaragua &euro;3.1million, of which computers (45%), infant foods (36%) and medical and pharmaceutical (10%) make up 91% of the total</p><p>  - Panama &euro;14.7 million, of which medical and pharmaceutical (31%), infant foods (28%), and Spirits and other alcoholic beverages (21%) make up 80% of the total.</p><p>  I understand that in relation to Costa Rica, Guatemala and El Salvador, the provisions of the Association Agreement concerning Geographical Indications that are a precondition to the entry into force of the Agreement for these countries, have not yet been met.</p></reply>

The zero hour protection applies to all employees whose contract operates to require them to be available whether they work on a casual basis or not.  </p><p>  This feature of the legislation covers situations where, for example, an employee is sent home if things are quiet or is requested to be available for work and is not, on the day, asked to work.  Where an employee suffers a loss by not working hours he/she was requested to work or be available to work, the zero hours provisions of the Act ensure that he/she is compensated for 25% of the time which he/she is required to be available or 15 hours whichever is the lesser.  The level of compensation may be impacted if the employee got some work.  An expectation of work does not, however, entitle an employee to compensation.</p><p>  The zero hours provision does not apply to lay-offs, short-time, emergency or exceptional circumstances, employee illness, employee on-call or where the employee is paid wages for making him/herself available for work.</p><p>  Section 17 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 sets out the requirements regarding notification to the employee of the times at which he/she will be required to work during the week. Generally, an employee is entitled to 24 hours&rsquo; notice of his/her roster for the week, although section 17(4) allows for changes as a result of unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>  Section 19 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 sets out an employee&rsquo;s entitlement to paid annual leave equal to 4 working weeks in a leave year in which he or she works at least 1,365 hours (unless it is a leave year in which he or she changes employment) or one-third of a working week for each month in the leave year in which he or she works at least 117 hours or 8 per cent of the hours he or she works in a leave year (but subject to a maximum of 4 working weeks).</p></reply>

While this survey will provide data on employment created in a range of sectors classified by internationally agreed NACE codes, the digital gaming sector will be included under the wider ICT sector and, as such, it will not be possible to provide data relating solely to the digital gaming sector.   </p><p>A study published in October 2011 by Forf&aacute;s entitled &#8220;<i>The Games Sector in Ireland: An Action Plan for Growth&#8221;</i>   stated that employment in the digital games sector had increased five fold to 2,500 since 2004. The report estimated that employment in the sector could double to 4,500 by the end of 2014 if approprate supporting actions were taken. It was for that reason that, in July 2012, I established the Digital Games Clustering Development Team, which comprises representatives of industry and Government Departments and Agencies, for the purpose of ascertaining how best the recommendations in the Forf&aacute;s report could be implemented.</p><p>  In accordance with the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, the Clustering Development Team is currently working with my Department, assessing options for the creation of a new financial instrument/relief to incentivise creative content development in the games sector. The Team is also formulating proposals to develop an appropriate model for a national centre which will bring together students, games developers and entrepreneurs so that Ireland will be best placed to grow employment in the digital games sector. In accordance with the timeframe outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, the Team has indicated that it will be presenting its proposals in this regard to me before year end.</p></reply>

The team now consists of two staff in Sao Paulo and three staff based in Dublin. In addition, EI has added 20 Pathfinders in the priority market of Brazil and throughout Latin Market, including a presence on the ground in Mexico. These are market experts in vertical sectors which match the areas of priority and greatest opportunity for Irish companies.</p><p>  In line with its client-led approach, Enterprise Ireland has prioritised the Brazilian market in Latin America for supporting our indigenous companies to grow their exports. EI established the office in Sao Paulo, Brazil in 2008, with the objective to support indigenous Irish firms who are clients of the agency to build market sales to the Brazilian market, the largest in Latin America.</p><p>  A Ministerial-led Trade Mission to Brazil is to take place shortly.  Over 35 participants will travel to build on Enterprise Irelands on-going work with its client companies and previous Ministerial Trade Missions in 2008 and 2010 and the Trade Mission led by President Higgins in 2012.  In conjunction with our Embassies in the region, EI continues to promote, through speaking engagements, social media sites, networks and trade and other media, key messages regarding Ireland.  In addition, EI will host a Business Breakfast in Mexico City on the occasion of the visit of President Higgins to Mexico in October 2013.</p><p>  In 2013 Enterprise Ireland has also organised 5 inward buying delegations from Brazil. These were focussed on areas of significant opportunity for Irish companies and the delegations included senior executives from major Brazilian companies in Life Sciences, Agri-technology, Financial Services and Telecommunications. These visits have opened up opportunities for Irish companies in a variety of end markets, and EI will be working closely with these companies to help deliver sales and ultimately jobs for these indigenous firms.</p><p>  I am confident that, with the efforts being made by Enterprise Ireland and the resources being made available to the agency by the Government, exports to the region will continue to grow.  </p></reply>

Innovation Vouchers worth &euro;5,000 are available to assist a company or companies to explore a business opportunity or problem with a registered knowledge provider. To date in 2013 a total of 619 vouchers with a potential maximum value of &euro;3,095,000 have been approved. </p><p>  The Innovation Vouchers initiative, administered by Enterprise Ireland, has been designed to stimulate increased innovation within the small business sector while bridging the gap that exists between the small business sector and public research bodies.  As a measure of the scheme&rsquo;s success in fostering collaboration many of the companies who worked with a knowledge provider have since applied for more substantial funding from programmes like Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Innovation Partnership programme - designed to support collaborative research in companies that do not have their own R&amp;amp;D department but want to develop a new product or technology using research expertise.</p><p>  The Innovation Voucher Programme has been running successfully since 2007 and my Department and Enterprise Ireland plan to continue the programme as long as the demand justifies it and it continues to meet a need in the small business sector.</p></reply>

The proposed legislation will provide for the recognition of the acquired gender of transgender persons aged 18 and over and who are not married or in a civil partnership. </p><p>  Once enacted, it will mean that a transgender person will have their acquired gender fully recognised by the State for all purposes including the right to marry or enter a civil partnership in the acquired gender and the right to a new birth certificate.</p><p>  The Bill represents a significant step forward in the rights of transgender persons in Ireland.  In publishing the General Scheme, I have taken into account the views of the representative bodies, the changing attitudes in our society and the developments in the health care and related supports for transgender persons to ensure that this Bill provides a progressive and streamlined approach to giving legal recognition to transgender persons.</p><p>  The application process for gender recognition is a simple administrative procedure, through my Department, which will involve a statutory self-declaration by the applicant that they intend to live permanently in the new gender and validation by the primary treating physician that the person has transitioned or is transitioning to the acquired gender.  The applicant will not have to specify that they have been living in their acquired gender for a specific period of time prior to their application. </p><p>  The issue in relation to transgender persons who are married or in a civil partnership and who wish to have their acquired gender recognised is an extremely complex one.  There is no simple legislative solution to this issue that can be guaranteed to be constitutionally robust, and I want to legislate now for the majority of the people affected, who are single. </p><p>  This matter will be looked at again once the Government has decided its response to the Constitutional Convention recommendations on same-sex marriage. </p><p>  I have requested the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection to consider the provisional draft Heads of Bill and, in that regard, officials from my Department will appear before the Committee on the 23 October, 2013. I feel that the Committee can make a very positive contribution to the preparation of the legislation and I believe that this approach should greatly assist the drafting of the legislation and its progress through the Oireachtas. </p></reply>

JobBridge internships are monitored by the Department at all stages.  All host organisations must comply with rigorous criteria and a monthly compliance monitoring process is in place.  One-in-four internships in 2013 have received an on-site monitoring visit.</p><p>  JobBridge placements are not positions of employment.  JobBridge interns are currently permitted to undertake a maximum of two internships, up to a cumulative total of 9 months, whether or not they have participated in the Work Placement Programme (WPP).  No minimum or maximum period between internships applies to interns.  Interns may not be on a placement with a host organisation with which they have a prior working relationship, including a WPP placement.</p><p>  On foot of a recommendation in the recent independent evaluation of JobBridge, I am considering options to allow interns to avail of more than two internships.  Changes to JobBridge criteria are posted on the JobBridge website (www.jobbridge.ie).</p><p>  Internships must provide a minimum of 30 hours work experience per week for the intern.  This condition is linked to the payment of the &euro;50 top-up and is also designed to ensure that internships provide a real working experience to the intern. Interns taking up paid employment either during or on completion of this internships are subject to the same regulations as all the other jobseekers in receipt of a jobseeker's payment.</p></reply>

The decision to reform State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives. </p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  The State pension age will be further increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.   </p><p>  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age. This applied at a time when longevity was much lower and working patterns were more likely to be physically demanding.   State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension and was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Overtime, the age for State pension contributory was reduced to 66 years.   </p><p>  In December 2012 there were approximately 14,400 State pension (transition) claims in payment. The Deputy may wish to note that  a significant number of people coming on to State pension transition in 2012 did not come from work as significant numbers were  already on other social welfare schemes well in advance of State pension transition age. For example,  12.5 per cent came from work with over 50% coming from other social welfare schemes such as illness benefit, jobseekers benefit and assistance, invalidity and carers. </p><p>  In terms of social welfare supports available to those at age 65 who are unable to remain in the workforce, the main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker's benefit.  Persons who qualify for a jobseeker's benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).    </p><p>  The recently published OECD report on the Review of the Irish Pension System confirms that reforms are necessary if we are to continue to put pension provision on a sustainable footing given the changes in demographics, the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund, and the difficult fiscal situation.  </p></reply>

In this regard, it is self-evident that a family with more child dependents, for example, or with caring requirements, will receive more than a family with none and so on. </p><p>  In some cases, families receive larger volumes of supplementary payments and therefore have a higher level of welfare income. This is usually because one or more family members require caring or have a disability, in which case the Department of Social Protection provides extra supports to assist the families in question.</p><p>  It should be noted that, as regards people of working age receiving welfare payments, the vast majority of those on the Live Register receive only a single personal weekly payment of &euro;188 or less and no additional benefits of any kind. Those individuals therefore have a very strong incentive to work. </p><p>  In a small percentage of cases where a disincentive to work does exist, I am overseeing extensive reforms to remove such disincentives and assist people back to work and towards financial independence. For example, the Department is working with the Department of the Environment to introduce Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), to replace Rent Supplement. HAP will subsidise rent for people on welfare and in low-income employment so that they will not lose housing assistance when they move from welfare to work.</p><p>  The introduction of any maximum ceiling on the amount of social welfare to be paid to an individual or family would be a matter for Government to consider in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

The decision to reform State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives. </p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  The State pension age will be further increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.   </p><p>  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age. This applied at a time when longevity was much lower and working patterns were more likely to be physically demanding.   State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension and was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Overtime, the age for State pension contributory was reduced to 66 years.   </p><p>  In December 2012 there were approximately 14,400 State pension (transition) claims in payment. The Deputy may wish to note that  a significant number of people coming on to State pension transition in 2012 did not come from work as significant numbers were  already on other social welfare schemes well in advance of State pension transition age. For example,  12.5 per cent came from work with over 50% coming from other social welfare schemes such as illness benefit, jobseekers benefit and assistance, invalidity and carers. </p><p>  In terms of social welfare supports available to those at age 65 who are unable to remain in the workforce, the main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker's benefit.  Persons who qualify for a jobseeker's benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).    </p><p>  The recently published OECD report on the Review of the Irish Pension System confirms that reforms are necessary if we are to continue to put pension provision on a sustainable footing given the changes in demographics, the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund, and the difficult fiscal situation.  </p></reply>

FIS is designed to prevent child and family poverty and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment as compared to social welfare payments.</p><p>  To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week. A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria. The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them. Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p><p>  The &#8220;hours worked&#8221; eligibility criterion has been reduced significantly since the introduction of the scheme in 1984. The requirement was initially set at 30 hours per week but was progressively reduced to 19 hours per week in 1996. Further reducing the &#8220;hours worked&#8221; requirement would have expenditure implications.

At each stage, the Department has negotiated rates and discounts to reflect these developments. Payments for LUAS were calculated on the basis of ridership and ticket survey information while the payments to private operators were based on fares foregone.</p><p><b>Details of Payment to CIE, Private Operators, Pobal and Luas - 2007 to 2012:</b></p><p><table><tr><th></th><th><div>2012</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2008</div></th><th><div>2007</div></th></tr><tr><td>CIE</td><td><div>&euro;61,201,720</div></td><td><div>&euro;61,358,000</div></td><td><div>&euro;61,369,045</div></td><td><div>&euro;61,200,000</div></td><td><div>&euro;56,461,729</div></td><td><div>&euro;52,576,856</div></td></tr><tr><td>Private Operators</td><td><div>&euro;7,411,480</div></td><td><div>&euro;7,675,000</div></td><td><div>&euro;7,246,163</div></td><td><div>&euro;6,227,308</div></td><td><div>&euro;6,365,937</div></td><td><div>&euro;5,526,210</div></td></tr><tr><td>POBAL</td><td><div>&euro;1,500,000</div></td><td><div>&euro;1,500,000</div></td><td><div>&euro;1,500,000</div></td><td><div>&euro;1,500,000</div></td><td><div>&euro;1,500,000</div></td><td><div>&euro;1,500,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Luas</td><td><div>&euro;3,862,457</div></td><td><div>&euro;3,907,500</div></td><td><div>&euro;2,848,383</div></td><td><div>&euro;3,568,377</div></td><td><div>&euro;2,749,855</div></td><td><div>&euro;2,917,001</div></td></tr></table></p><p>An Inter-Departmental Working Group has been established to carry out a review of the current free travel scheme.

It is a lump sum and in most cases is paid automatically, but some people need to claim. The total amount of winter fuel payment can vary from &pound;100 - &pound;300 sterling having regard to age and household composition. Most payments are made between mid- November and December in a given year.</p><p>  The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that people living outside the UK may be paid the winter fuel payment where they can demonstrate a &ldquo;genuine and sufficient link&rdquo; to the UK&rsquo;s social security system.</p><p>  The UK winter fuel allowance is contribution based and, as an entitlement has been established, then the UK would have first responsibility to pay the allowance.  As the fuel allowance here is a means tested payment, which is paid on the basis that an applicant is unable to provide for his or her own heating needs, we would have to take account of the receipt of the UK payment in assessing eligibility.  This position applies in relation to all other payments received from countries which impact on social welfare payments.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-09-18a.1744.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013091800079#WRMM00700"><p>I wish to assure the Deputy that prompt processing of claims remains a priority for me. Each scheme area is continuously monitored and reviewed to ensure customers are responded to as quickly as possible.  In recent years, backlogs have not been a feature of many scheme areas such as pensions, maternity benefit, illness benefit, domiciliary care allowance, and child benefit.  I am proud to inform the Deputy that the Department has had major success in clearing the backlogs which have been a feature of some other scheme areas.  For instance, new claim backlogs have been eliminated in family income supplement, invalidity pension, carer's allowance and redundancy.  Disability allowance backlogs are in the process of being eliminated.  In addition, backlogs in local office-managed schemes continue to reduce, particularly in the one parent family scheme.</p><p>  Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the applicant, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.  Delays can also arise if information is required from social security organisations in other jurisdictions and where additional information has been requested from the applicant but remains outstanding.</p><p>  The Department is committed to ensuring that claims are processed as expeditiously as possible.  All claims are registered promptly, in some schemes this is done through the scanning of claim documents onto the system while in other schemes this involves an officer inputting data.  The time taken to perform means tests and/or medical examinations where these are required is not measured separately, while a determination on habitual residence, where required, is an integral part of the decision making process.</p><p>  As part of the Department&rsquo;s programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.</p><p>  In addition, the staffing needs of the Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.</p><p>  Work on clearing backlogs in some scheme areas, such as carers allowance and invalidity pension has temporarily distorted the time taken to clear claims due to the high level of reviews and appeals following backlog clearances, but the progress made will be reflected in processing times in the coming months.  As mentioned, new claim backlogs have been eliminated in carer's allowance, invalidity pension and family income supplement.  All backlogged disability allowance applications have been decided, where possible, with the remainder awaiting additional information necessary in order to decide the claim.</p><p>  The new Intreo service is currently being rolled-out and implemented on a phased basis.  This new service integrates employment and income supports and provides for a streamlined and personalised service to clients in accessing job opportunities and availing of supports to enable them to get back to work at the earliest possible opportunity.  The Intreo Centres also include a single integrated decision-making team that integrate and streamline the processes formerly undertaken by the different agencies now amalgamated into the Department.  The benefits of the integrated decisions process are already visible in terms of shorter decision times and in the reduced recourse to supplementary payments in offices where integrated decisions are in operation.</p><p>  If an applicant for any of the Department&rsquo;s schemes is experiencing financial hardship, they may be eligible for a short-term supplementary welfare allowance payment, administered by the community welfare service of the Department.  This is a means tested weekly payment, subject to certain terms and conditions, which provide an immediate basic income support to eligible people whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.</p></reply>

The Pensions Board supervises the regulation of individual schemes in accordance with the Pensions Act. However, the Pensions Act does not regulate how company accounts should reflect pension arrangements for its employees.</p><p>   In general terms, I can advise that funded defined benefit pension schemes are required to satisfy the Funding Standard as set out in the Pensions Act 1990, as amended.  This is a wind up standard which means that a funded defined benefit pension scheme is required to maintain sufficient assets to meet the liabilities of the scheme in the event of the wind up of the scheme. Where a scheme fails to satisfy the Funding Standard, the scheme is required to submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board setting out how it is proposed to restore scheme funding.  I understand that the Pensions Board has recently agreed a funding proposal for the pension scheme in question.</p><p>  I amended the Pensions Act in 2012 to require funded defined benefit pension scheme to hold additional funding in the form of a risk reserve in order to provide some protection for scheme members against future volatility in financial markets. This requirement will apply in a gradual way from 2016.  I also amended the Pensions Act this year to provide the Pensions Board with the power to wind up a pension scheme.

The Pensions Board supervises the regulation of individual schemes in accordance with the Pensions Act.</p><p>  In general terms, I can advise that funded defined benefit pension schemes are required to satisfy the Funding Standard as set out in the Pensions Act 1990, as amended.  This is a wind up standard which means that a funded defined benefit pension scheme is required to maintain sufficient assets to meet the liabilities of the scheme in the event of the wind up of the scheme. Where a scheme fails to satisfy the Funding Standard, the scheme is required to submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board setting out how it is proposed to restore scheme funding.</p><p>  I amended the Pensions Act in 2012 to require defined benefit pension schemes to hold additional funding in the form of a risk reserve in order to provide stronger protection for scheme members against future volatility in financial markets. This requirement will apply in a gradual way from 2016.  I also amended the Pensions Act this year to provide the Pensions Board with the power to wind up a pension scheme. This power can only be exercised where a scheme is underfunded and the trustees and the employer are not in a position to adopt a funding proposal or where the trustees of a scheme fail to comply with a direction from the Pensions Board to restructure scheme benefits.</p><p>  My objectives with regard to regulation are to ensure that measures are in place to protect the pension rights of scheme beneficiaries.</p></reply>

This service provides comprehensive information and advice to mortgage holders in arrears or pre-arrears in assessing their options. The service, which differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice, has three elements:</p><p>- The Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline (phone 0761 074050) provides general mortgage arrears information and signposting in relation to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears  and other supports available for those in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears. The Helpline operates Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and has had over 7,000 callers since July 2012. The annual budget is &euro;374,400 and costs to date since its establishment at end July 2012 amount to &euro;392,800.  In addition, an information awareness campaign during Quarter 1 2013 cost some &euro;80,400. The Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline is funded by the lenders.</p><p>- The redesign of the website:    provided for the key online access for general mortgage arrears information and advice and has had over 147,000 visitors since June 2012. The annual budget for the website is &euro;1,200 and the total costs to date since it was first established in 2009 are &euro;5,400.</p><p>- The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. The advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland. A county by county panel with over 2,000 participating accountants is in place and their details are available on . Borrowers are free to choose their own advisor from this panel and the lender will pay &euro;250 to the accountant of the borrower's choice for the provision of this advice. The Central Bank collates the information relating to the number of borrowers who have availed of the independent financial advice service. To end June 2013 just over 100 invoices had been received by the lenders. It is worth noting that the numbers don't directly relate to the reporting period as there will be time delays between the issue of the long term forbearance offer, the meeting with the accountant, and the receipt by the lender of an invoice.  The cost of this service is met wholly by the lenders. It is estimated that the amount paid to date to the accountants participating in the service is in the region of &euro;25,000.</p><p>  It is expected that this service will become more important as the lenders roll out their long term forbearance options and as the Central Bank Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets process intensifies. A full review of the independent financial advice service is underway to ensure that the service is meeting its objectives. The review encompasses all aspects of the service including an examination of the number of borrowers availing of the service and if the participation should be extended to other interested parties. As part of the review a process of consultation was undertaken and the review is expected to be completed by end October 2013.</p></reply>

It includes part-time workers (those who work up to 3 days a week), seasonal and casual workers entitled to jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance. Unemployment is measured officially by the Central Statistics Office's Quarterly National Household Survey. A person is unemployed if, in the week before the survey, they were without work and available for work within the next 2 weeks.</p><p>  Self-employed persons are liable for pay related social insurance (PRSI) at a rate of 4%, which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory). This compares to employees in respect of whom a combined 14.75% rate, under full-rate PRSI Class A, is paid giving entitlement to the full range of social insurance benefits including jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</p><p>  Any person of working age who does not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit may claim means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. Subject to means and other qualifying conditions, self-employed persons may claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or there is reduced demand for their services. Typically over 80% of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claims from self-employed persons have been awarded over recent years.</p><p>  Previously self-employed persons in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available through the State.  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.  However, many services are available to the formerly self-employed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.

Job seekers who are in receipt of a live claim (Jobseekers Allowance/Jobseekers Benefit/One Parent Family Payment/Disability Allowance) or are signing on for credits for at least 3 of the last 6 months (78 Days) are eligible to participate.    These eligibility criteria are necessary in order to target scarce exchequer resources to those who are long-term unemployed.

The Revised Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;3.66bn in 2013.  The family income supplement or FIS payment is designed to provide income for employees on low earnings with families.  The Revised Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure on FIS of nearly &euro;230 million in 2013.</p><p>  Under the general conditions of the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes a person must be fully unemployed for at least 4 in any 7 days. To qualify for payment of FIS a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.</p><p>  Where persons take up employment which involves working more than 3 days per week but less than 19 hours the part-time job incentive scheme may, subject to scheme criteria, support them in making such a transition to employment. The scheme allows persons who are long-term unemployed to take up part-time employment for less than 24 hours per week and receive a weekly income supplement. Participants in this scheme are expected to continue to make efforts to find full-time work.</p><p>  More generally it is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, resulting in an increase in the number of persons employed for less than a full week. This is an important policy issue for the Department but any changes to the current criteria could have significant cost implications. For that reason, the Department will consider this issue very carefully. In tandem the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, which has already reported to me on a number of important policy areas, is now looking at the whole area of atypical work and I look forward to their recommendations on this issue by end year.</p></reply>

There are approximately 82,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for the scheme in 2013.</p><p>  Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.

There is no limit or restriction on the proportion or number of people that may receive rent supplement in an area. Section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 provides that payment of rent supplement can be refused in respect of accommodation which is situated in an area notified to me as the Minister for Social Protection by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, as being an area of regeneration.  There are no such areas in County Wicklow.</p></reply>

This Operational Programme (OP) is currently in the early stages of preparation under the leadership of the Department of Education and Skills.  This will involve a consultation phase and negotiations with the European Commission and factoring in the outcomes of the Partnership Agreement process led by DPER. However, at this point, the European Parliament and the European Commission have yet to reach an agreement on the qualifying criteria for funding from the YEI and this is delaying the application for funding. It is anticipated that the OP will be advanced to completion by early 2014.</p><p>  Implementation plans of each Member State in relation to the Youth Guarantee will have a bearing on their ability to access funding from the YEI. In addition to, and concurrent with our work on the ESF OP, an interdepartmental working group is currently preparing the Implementation Plan for the Youth Guarantee which, when approved by the government, will be submitted to the European Commission at the end of this year.  In terms of preparation for implementation, we sought funding from the European Commission (&euro;250,000) for a proposed pilot Youth Guarantee project in the Ballymun area. I am pleased to say that our submission was one of those approved by the Commission for funding and the Ballymun project will commence in October.</p></reply>

It is intended to produce a concrete plan for the implementation of the Guarantee before the end of 2013. The Government, through an interdepartmental implementation group is working with all relevant sectors to maximise the impact of a Youth Guarantee in Ireland. The Department of Social Protection set up this interdepartmental group with officials and programme managers from the Department of Education and Science, Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to develop this plan. These Departments consult with relevant sectors on a regular basis in relation to the programmes and services for which they have responsibility. It is also planned to have a round of such consultation before finalising the implementation plan.</p><p>  In terms of a starting point for the design and operation of programmes to be funded from the EU youth employment initiative, the Department of Social Protection has obtained funding from the European Commission (&euro;250,000) for a pilot Youth Guarantee project in the Ballymun area. On the National Steering Group for the Ballymun pilot are representatives from the business (IBEC), education (FAS\VECs) and youth-sectors (National Youth Council of Ireland). Experience gained from this pilot project is being used in part to inform the design of the national Youth Guarantee project.</p></reply>

The Advisory Group is charged with, inter alia, examining and reporting on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  Any proposals for change must be cost neutral. </p><p>  On 6 September 2013 I published the Group&rsquo;s report on the issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons so as to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable. </p><p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. </p><p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries. To this end, the Group recommended that Class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work because of a long-term illness or incapacity through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for Class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points. This is in line with the estimated level of contributions needed to provide access for the self-employed to Invalidity Pension contained in the 2010 Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund. </p><p>  In the course of the Group&rsquo;s deliberations, the Group identified a range of issues associated with the subject of social insurance for the self-employed that should be addressed and have made a number of recommendations in this regard.  These include, among others, the means assessment for self-employed income in terms of accessing jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments, credited PRSI contributions, self-employed access to activation and training schemes and the role that information campaigns might play in addressing information deficits, particularly with regard to entitlements to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</p><p>  The question as to whether the present arrangements regarding social insurance for the self-employed are appropriate has increased in prominence over recent years. I welcome the Group&rsquo;s finding that the current system of means tested Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment. </p><p>  The recommendation concerning long-term sickness or injuries is an important contribution to the policy debate regarding the range of benefits the self-employed might access through their social insurance contributions.  In this regard, the 2010 Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, published last year, determined that the self-employed are obtaining better value for the level of their current social insurance contributions than employees (the Actuarial Review found that the effective annual rate of contributions needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%).</p><p>  This finding was noted by the Advisory Group in its recommendations.  Consequently, the recommendations of the Advisory Group require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the 2010 Actuarial Review relating to the level of contributions levied on Class S contributors and the current shortfall in this regard.</p><p>  My colleagues in Government and I will now carefully reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.</p></reply>

An exception may be made in certain circumstances where there may be difficulty in accessing the post office during normal working hours, such as while a person is undertaking a course of study under the Back To Education Programme, or while partaking of an internship under the Work  Placement Programme or National Internship Programme.  In these cases, payment may be made by electronic fund transfer directly into the customer&rsquo;s bank account.</p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s future Payment Strategy, which was recently approved by Government, envisages a payments environment which is fully electronic and builds on current approaches to modernise the payment of welfare benefits.  The Department recognises the importance of modernising welfare payment methods to our customers and to the wider Irish economy. The strategy is in line with wider Government policies and objectives on better public services and more effective e-payments, as set out in the Public Service Reform Plan and the eGovernment Strategy 2012-2015 and is aligned to the objectives of the recently published National Payments Plan. The migration to e-payments will be a gradual process and will be developed, implemented and achieved with strategies that complement and enhance the Department's fraud and control policies.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-09-18a.1913.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013091800079#WRPP02100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 680, 702 and 704 together.</p><p>  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office. </p><p>  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is currently underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 17,041 at 16 September 2013.</p><p>  The average waiting time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 these times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks while the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to August 2013 reducing to 35.4 weeks for an oral hearing and 27.1 weeks for a summary decision.   </p><p>  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.</p><p>  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p></reply>

The application for invalidity pension was disallowed by a deciding officer.

This additional evidence, along with the original information, was evaluated by a different medical assessor who also expressed the opinion that the person concerned still did not satisfy the medical criteria.  Accordingly, the deciding officer confirmed the original decision and notified the claimant of the outcome on 4 July 2013.</p><p>  The person concerned appealed the decision and, again, submitted further medical evidence which was forwarded to a different medical assessor for evaluation.  The opinion of the medical advisor based on all the evidence supplied is that the person concerned  now meets the medical criteria for invalidity pension.

A key element of this package was to add an additional 2,500 places to T&uacute;s &ndash; the community work placement initiative.  The additional 2,500 T&uacute;s placements have been committed nationally with 60 placements allocated to Cavan and 40 to Monaghan.  I am anxious to provide as many work placement opportunity as possible within the resources available to the Department of Social Protection  and the take up of placements by local development companies and the community and voluntary sector is reviewed at regular intervals.  The Deputy may wish to note that some 12,800 people have already been employed on T&uacute;s and currently 6,487 part-time participants and 341 full time supervisory staff are on the payroll.</p><p>  The purpose of the rural social scheme (RSS) is to provide income support for farmers and fisherpersons who have an entitlement to specified social welfare payments.  The scheme currently provides work opportunities for around 2,600 participants and 130 supervisory staff of which 120 participants and 6 supervisors are engaged in Counties Cavan and Monaghan.  All places nationally are allocated with funding for 2013 amounting to &euro;45m. This does not allow for the recruitment of additional participants above the numbers stated above. I have no plans to increase the number of places available on this scheme.</p></reply>

This is subject to certain specific exceptions, one of which permits these activities during the prohibited periods on grounds of public health and safety and this notably occurs where road hazards may require hedge trimming or vegetation clearance.</p><p>  Hedgerows are an important reservoir of biodiversity and habitat for birds, insects, wild flowers and other wildlife during the summer breeding season.  The purpose of these provisions is to protect bird life during the nesting season, to prevent forest fires, and to protect vegetation and wildlife habitats during the months of growth and reproduction.  </p><p>  While hedgerows and scrub are important as wildlife habitats, they need to be managed in the interests of both farming and biodiversity. In that regard, my Department is reviewing the current legislative provisions. As part of that review, the potential for setting the relevant dates by statutory instrument, rather than in primary legislation, as is the position currently, will be examined.</p><p>  Furthermore, I included a commitment in the National Biodiversity Plan 2011-2016 to review, in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, both hedgerow and scrub regulation with a view to producing guidelines to encourage best practice for hedgerow and scrub management for wildlife.</p></reply>

The aim of the group is to address the strategic gap in information on landcover, landuse and habitats in Ireland and the initiative was undertaken in accordance with the objectives of Ireland's National Biodiversity Plan, which aims to progress the development of a national terrestrial and marine habitat map by 2015.</p><p>  As part of this initiative, the EPA undertook a pilot mapping of habitats in County Roscommon utilising existing spatial data accessible to members of the group.  Data sources from my Department include baseline and repeat surveys of a range of habitats listed in the EU Habitats Directive or those which provide habitats for species listed in the Directive. The Roscommon pilot identified the feasibility of the approach and also identified gaps in knowledge and data in particular to map unenclosed and upland areas. Further consideration is being given to the outcome of the pilot before developing a national program.</p><p>  My Department also undertakes habitat mapping within inshore and coastal marine Natura 2000 sites.  In many such sites, this has been a collaborative effort with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine so as to facilitate more informed management of aquaculture and sea fisheries.  This mapping work, along with the national seabed mapping programme (INFOMAR) and bespoke mapping projects undertaken within the wider public service, is contributing to the development of a national marine habitat map.  All such efforts were recently compiled by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Marine Institute to support Initial Assessment reporting as required under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.</p></reply>

It forms dense thickets along roadsides, waste-grounds and waterways, reproduces by vegetative means and is difficult to kill off once it becomes established.  This plant is included among the list of the 100 most invasive alien species of the world.</p><p>  My Department has been working with the Northern Ireland Environment Agency to fund and manage the <i>Invasive Species Ireland Project </i>since 2006. This initiative provides advice and guidance on the management of a range of invasive species, including the knotweed, which can negatively impact on the environment and on property on the island of Ireland. I am not aware of any estimated cost of not addressing the spread of this species. Best Practice Management Guidelines for Japanese knotweed have been published and can be accessed at on the project website at . These guidelines provide practical advice to persons and organisations, including local authorities, on the removal and disposal of Japanese Knotweed. When dealing with Japanese Knotweed, it is critical to ensure that any viable rhizomes, the main means by which the plant spreads, are not given the chance to escape into the wider environment.  </p><p>  I am aware that EU funding is available for projects to tackle the problem of invasive species.  For example, a project on Controlling Priority Invasive Non-native Riparian Plants and Restoring Native Biodiversity (CIRB) aims to control and, if possible, eradicate harmful invasive plant species, including Japanese Knotweed, from trial river catchments in Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland.  The &pound;2.6 million CIRB project commenced in early 2011 and will operate until December 2014. The project is part financed by the European Union's European Regional Development Fund through the INTERREG IVA Cross-border Programme, managed by the  and part-financed by and the Northern Ireland   . </p><p>  In addition, my Department provided Inland Fisheries Ireland with matching funding of over &euro;700,000 under the EU Life+ funding initiative for a four year project called CAISIE (Control of Aquatic Invasive Species in Ireland) to target the invasive curly-leaved waterweed (<i>Lagarosiphon major</i>) in Lough Corrib, Co. Galway, and to tackle<b></b>  key invasive species on the Grand Canal, Barrow Line and Navigation.  </p><p>    My Department will consider the results of these programmes to see whether further targeted schemes should be pursued or supported in the future.</p></reply>

To this aim I have met with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland to enhance co-operation between my Department and both tourism bodies in promoting heritage and tourism.</p><p>  The unique qualities of Ireland's national heritage play a significant role in enhancing and projecting Ireland's image abroad, and in supporting economic renewal through cultural and heritage tourism and in downstream opportunities, such as in the retail, catering and accommodation sectors.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland figures show that some 3.5 million overseas visitors engaged in cultural activities while in Ireland in 2011.  Over 2.5 million tourists visited historic houses or castles, while 2 million visited our archaeological monuments. There were over 3.7 million visitors to heritage sites where the Office of Public Works provides a guide service.  </p><p>  My Department's network of National Parks and Nature Reserves are also a major part of Ireland's tourism attractions. My Department is supporting the greater use of our parks and reserves in a manner which is compatible with conservation and protection of their biodiversity.  It can be difficult to give an exact number for visitors to National Parks as there are many access points to some of the parks but visitor numbers have been estimated at over 2 million per annum. Ireland's National Parks are the most popular destinations for the domestic holiday market, with 23% of this tourism market segment visiting the Parks in 2011.</p><p>  Where numbers are more readily measurable, increases have been seen in recent years. In 2011, Connemara National Park attracted a footfall of 202,543 visitors (representing a 30% increase on 2010 visitor numbers), Glenveagh National Park attracted a footfall of 112,000 visitors, while Glenveagh Castle attracted 41,161 visitors. Muckross House witnessed an increase of 13% in visitor numbers with 105,145 people visiting the House. </p><p>  My Department is also actively engaged in a wide range of activities in support of The Gathering, both in co-operation with bodies such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Office of Public Works, and in promoting its own initiatives. For example the 'Places to See' and 'Monuments to Visit' websites provide directions to lesser known heritage sites and details of what the visitor can expect to find on arrival. A small amount of capital funding is provided by my Department to support the Office of Public Works' conservation programme for the State's heritage portfolio, many properties from which attract high levels of visitors to Ireland.</p><p>  My Department will continue to develop visitor facilities where resources allow, such as walking and cycling routes, enhanced signage and interpretation. In the last couple of years my Department opened modern visitor centres at Ballycroy National Park, Co. Mayo, Clara Bog Nature Reserve, Co. Offaly, and a visitor information point for the Burren National Park in Corofin, Co. Clare.</p><p>  Killarney House in Killarney National Park is currently undergoing major refurbishment to transform it into the main visitor and interpretative centre for the National Park with a focus on interpreting the parks natural wealth. This is a major project for my Department and involves collaboration with OPW as project managers and F&aacute;ilte Ireland which has committed funding of &euro;5.2 million towards the project, under its Tourism Investment Programme.</p><p>  In addition, my Department provides core funding for several heritage organisations such as the Heritage Council, which supports a range of initiatives including National Heritage Week, and the Irish Architectural Foundation, which runs the successful Open House event each year. </p><p>This year, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, my Department is also initiating a pilot programme, the <i>Historic Towns Initiative</i>  , in Youghal, Westport and Listowel with the Heritage Council and the local authorities in each town.   My primary objective with this initiative is to ensure that the participating towns have access to, and an understanding of, appropriate guidance to assist them in best conserving their heritage assets and, in so doing, underpin the sustainability of their community and local economy.  It is my hope that meeting these goals will also, by extension, significantly enhance the visitor experience in these towns, thus helping to maximise the potential positive contribution of tourism to each of these towns and their respective hinterlands.  </p></reply>

The Acts allow me to make a preservation order where I consider a national monument to be at risk.  Protection may be extended to previously unrecorded monuments by entering them in the Register of Historic Monuments or the Record of Monuments and Places.  Prosecutions in respect of damage to recorded monuments are initiated where warranted.</p><p>  Part IV of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012 provides for the protection of architectural heritage. The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including them on the Record of Protected Structures.  Under section 53 of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012, I may make recommendations to a planning authority concerning the inclusion in its record of protected structures any structures which I consider would merit such inclusion and the attendant planning restrictions which would apply to protect the structures' special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest.</p><p>  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future. Recognising this duty of care placed on owners of protected structures, a number of State financial supports provide for the conservation and restoration of heritage structures in both private and public ownership. </p><p>  Comprehensive statistics are not available in respect of the number and location of endangered heritage sites or buildings throughout the country. As the Deputy can appreciate, however, the scope for funding for the conservation of the built heritage is currently constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances. </p><p>  An overall allocation is provided from the National Lottery each year for expenditure through the Votes of various Departments. In 2013 my Department's allocation of funding of &euro;4.446m to the Heritage Council was partially funded by National Lottery funds.  In turn, the Heritage Council supports a range of heritage conservation projects. It is a matter for the Heritage Council to allocate its funding appropriately given competing priorities within the heritage sector.  However, I understand that in 2013 the Council is funding or otherwise supporting a number of programmes for the conservation and preservation of our heritage.</p><p>  Additionally, my Department provides funding through a Structures at Risk Fund to assist with works to safeguard structures protected under Part IV and, in certain cases, works to safeguard structures within Architectural Conservation Areas, where an urgent need for works to such structures has arisen and has been demonstrated.    In 2013 I allocated a total of &euro;475,000 in grant funding to thirty-four local authorities under my Department's Structures at Risk Fund 2013 to enable conservation works to forty-five heritage structures in both private and public ownership deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration and which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012. </p><p>This year, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Heritage Council, my Department is also initiating a pilot heritage-led regeneration programme, the <i>Historic Towns Initiative</i>  , in Youghal, Westport and Listowel with the local authorities in each town.   I have awarded &euro;80,000 to each of the three towns from my Department's voted allocation towards works to promote and enhance the heritage of the town in line with the objectives of this pilot programme.</p><p>  My Department is also providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the Office of Public Works (OPW) in 2013 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership.   The OPW undertakes the care and maintenance of national monuments in my ownership or guardianship (of which there are approximately 750).  My Department's National Monuments Service works in close collaboration with the OPW on survey, excavation and research work to optimise the protection, management, interpretation and presentation of national monuments in State care.  </p><p>  My Department has been and is currently involved in various actions which aim to address specific issues such as the endangerment of our national heritage.  These include the work of an expert advisory committee, set up in 2011 and representing key stakeholders, to review the operation of Part IV of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012 in respect of protection and management of architectural heritage.</p><p>My Department also publishes a series of booklets for owners and occupiers advising on the care and maintenance of old and historic structures.   These are available on my Department's website   .</p><p>  In 2011, I announced a major refurbishment programme for Killarney House and its ornamental grounds and gardens. The House will be developed as the main visitor and interpretative centre for the National Park highlighting the beauty and interpreting the richness and significance of the Park's landscapes, habitats, flora and fauna as well as telling the story of man's interaction with the park over the centuries.  It is also intended that some of the formal rooms will be restored to their former glory. This is a major project for my Department and involves collaboration with OPW as the project managers and F&aacute;ilte Ireland which has committed funding of &euro;5.2 million under its Tourism Capital Investment Programme.</p></reply>

The arts, culture and heritage sectors continue to offer vital opportunities for the provision of important cultural, social and employment benefits to communities throughout the country.   The nature of employment within the arts sector encompasses a very wide range of activities, while cultural and heritage tourism is one of the most important elements of Ireland's tourism product. Its scope can include those engaged in the arts practice within specific artistic genres and can also encompass areas which flow from such artistic pursuits. It may also embody the whole industrial creative sectors - the foundation of which lie in the pure arts areas. Accordingly, there are differentiated sets of figures which reflect the differing basis from which employment numbers are derived. </p><p>  The arts underpin policies in attracting foreign direct investment, in the creation of an imaginative labour force, in establishing an innovative environment in which the creative and cultural industries can thrive and in the area of cultural tourism.  The arts are a significant economic contributor and employer in their own right and they are also important building blocks for those economic policies the Government has identified as crucial for our economic recovery.  </p><p>  A report entitled<i> An Assessment of the Economic Impact of the Arts in Ireland,</i>   published by the Arts Council in 2011, updates a previous independent evaluation by consultants Indecon of the economic impact of the arts, published in 2009.  The updated report shows that the arts provide significant direct and indirect employment. The sector supports 21,328 jobs and contributes &euro;306.8 million in taxes.  The arts also impact on the wider creative industries, such as the advertising sector, architecture, fashion and design, and cultural tourism, contributing &euro;4.7 billion to the economy and supporting 79,000 jobs.</p><p>  In April last, Minister Joan Burton and I were pleased to announce a further extension of the successful JobBridge national internship scheme, which will provide for new internships in the arts sector. In association with the Arts Council, the new strand will provide exciting opportunities for those interested in careers in the arts, allowing them to gain hands-on experience and enhance their skills. The extension of the scheme will foster emerging talent in the arts and also support local arts groups in theatre, film, visual arts, dance, music, literature and more.  This as an important development because it will help people take the first step towards a career in the arts. In this sector there is a long tradition of new entrants working alongside established artists, performers, practitioners and arts administrators.   </p><p>  Within the current economic constraints, investment in the arts, heritage, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity of these sectors. While I know that the Deputy appreciates the funding difficulties facing all Departments at this time, I can assure him that I remain committed to securing the best possible level of funding for these sectors. The specific allocations to be made in future years will, of course, be dependent on the budgetary and estimates cycles in each of those years.</p></reply>

Some of the events supported have involved collaborations with US artists and I am pleased that many of these have proved successful. For example, the Irish Arts Centre in New York has been supported annually for concerts to present Irish musicians performing with US musicians and these have served to raise the profile of Irish talent and creativity.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that in 2011 Culture Ireland funded a year of Irish arts in the US involving over 400 events. Throughout that year, more than 1,000 artists and producers from Ireland presented work in a range of art forms, including theatre, music, literature, visual arts, dance and film.</p><p>  I am acutely conscious that the cultural ties between Ireland and America are unique. By bringing Irish creative talent to audiences across America, we are celebrating that unique shared story and growing key relationships between Irish artists and ensembles and leading US arts festivals, venues and institutions. I remain committed to supporting such endeavour, within the available resources.</p></reply>

It forms dense thickets along roadsides, waste-grounds and waterways, reproduces by vegetative means and is difficult to kill off once it becomes established.  This plant is included among the list of the 100 most invasive alien species of the world.</p><p>  I am assured that Waterways Ireland takes the presence of Alien Invasive Species (AIS), including Japanese Knotweed, extremely seriously and is actively working towards the prevention, early detection and eradication of AIS along the various navigations. </p><p>  In relation to the Deputy's specific query, I am advised that following the recent relining works on Level 6 of the Royal Canal, some knotweed was found on the newly landscaped soil.  On foot of this discovery at the initial stand near the approach to the lock gate, operational staff of Waterways Ireland carried out systematic spraying of the infected area at the Lock and another section of knotweed on open ground at the opposite end of Level 6 beyond Coke Ovens Cottages (which was not connected to the relining works).  On a follow up site visit on 11 September 2013, it was observed that the small stand of knotweed at the edge of the water had been eradicated by the effective spraying regime. I am advised that Waterways Ireland staff will continue to monitor the area for any reoccurrence of the infestation on its property.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that a wall separates the canal property from Irish Rail property and material overhanging the wall has recently been trimmed due to the impact on members of the public on the canal towpath.  I should say that Waterways Ireland&rsquo;s operational staff will systematically and safely spray and eradicate any identified patches of knotweed found on the canal property.  It may also be noted that training in the identification, suitable control and management of AIS is given to Waterways Ireland's operational, technical and engineering staff as part of their regular tool box talks. </p><p>  I am advised that Waterways Ireland works very closely with Inland Fisheries Ireland in the control and management of AIS, particularly aquatic species, including research into new methods of control.  Waterways Ireland also works with Invasive Species Ireland and other relevant bodies in the dissemination of information and practices in the control of AIS and will continue to liaise with Irish Rail to devise a management plan for AIS in areas of common interest.</p></reply>

Whilst legislative change will be required to implement this decision in a number of cases, I have written to the relevant organisations to ask them to implement this decision on an administrative basis pending statutory implementation. In addition, from January 2013 there has also been a reduction of 100% in fees for membership of the Irish Film Board.</p><p>In addition to the bodies listed below, responsibility for the Censorship of Publications Board and the Censorship of Publications Appeal Board has recently transferred to my Department.

Turf cutting has been ended on 53 Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation, in keeping with Ireland's obligations under the Habitats Directive. Any further turf-cutting on these sites can only occur in the exceptional circumstances allowed for under the terms of the Habitats Directive. The National Raised Bog Management Plan, currently in preparation, will set out the future management and restoration approach for each of these sites, including how the interests of turf-cutters are to be addressed. </p><p>  Some 75 raised bog Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs) were formally designated by my predecessor under the Wildlife Acts. NHAs are protected through a requirement for certain, potentially damaging activities to receive Ministerial consent before being undertaken. Turf-cutting is listed as an activity that requires such consent. However, turf-cutting on NHAs was subject to a derogation which allowed continued cutting for domestic purposes until the end of 2013.</p><p>  In May 2010, the previous Government decided that turf cutting should come to an end on all raised bog NHAs at the end of 2013. However, the current Programme for Government undertook to review the situation. This review is currently underway and the future of turf-cutting on raised bog NHAs is being considered as part of that review. It is my intention that the review will provide clarity for turf-cutters and land-owners on these NHAs, in advance of the 2014 turf cutting season and my Department will be contacting individual land-owners and turf-cutters on these sites in due course.</p></reply>

Fahy [2001]) as conferring a right on the citizen to transact his or her business with the State through Irish. The Official Languages Act 2003 seeks to give legislative effect, insofar as the delivery of public services in Irish is concerned, to Article 8 of the Constitution. The Act provides a framework for the incremental provision of public services through Irish in order for the State to fulfil its responsibilities in this regard in a cohesive and coherent manner.In addition to various direct statutory obligations emanating from the Act, public bodies are obliged to prepare and implement language schemes, when requested by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to do so. The purpose of these schemes is to increase over time the quality and quantity of services provided in Irish by public bodies, having regard to available resources.    As a result of the 143 language schemes that have been agreed since the commencement of the Act in 2003, almost 200 public bodies have been covered by the language scheme process. I am satisfied that the various schemes being implemented include the majority of public bodies who have regular contact with the general public. It is my view also that there has been a significant improvement in the quality and quantity of services being provided in Irish by public bodies as a result of the Official Languages Act.</p></reply>

The Council is funded by my Department and is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations, including funding decisions.  In 2013, the Arts Council will receive an allocation of over &euro;60.6 million in current, capital and EU Presidency funding.  Details of all funding provided by the Arts Council to arts practitioners, arts groups and venues, including arts centres, are available on the Council's website at <i>.</i>  In a wider context, the Arts Council support of a range of arts forms is set out in its strategic overview document entitled <i>Developing the Arts in Ireland: Arts Council Strategic Overview 2011-2013</i>  . In this strategy document, which is available on the Council's website, its work and key strategic principles that inform its funding decisions are laid out.</p><p>  I have outlined below a range of ways in which my Department and relevant bodies within its remit are supporting cultural and heritage initiatives in conjunction with local groups and communities.

A particular criterion is for a site to be considered to be of outstanding universal value, defined by UNESCO as meaning of &ldquo;<i>cultural and or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations of all humanity.</i>  &rdquo;</p><p>The nomination process is initiated by the relevant State authorities drawing up a <i>Tentative List</i> of what they consider to be the most important heritage sites within their national boundaries.  Following a public consultation process and consideration by an expert advisory group, a new <i>Tentative List</i>   for Ireland was approved and submitted to UNESCO in March 2010 containing the following sites:</p><p>- The Burren;</p><p>- C&eacute;ide Fields and North West Mayo Boglands;</p><p>- The Monastic City of Clonmacnoise and its Cultural Landscape;</p><p>- The Historic City of Dublin;</p><p>- Early Medieval Monastic Sites (Clonmacnoise, Durrow, Glendalough, Inis Cealtra, Kells and Monasterboice);</p><p>- The Royal Sites of Ireland (Cashel, D&uacute;n Ailinne, Hill of Uisneach, Rathcroghan Complex, Tara Complex and potentially Navan Fort in Armagh);</p><p>- Western Stone Forts (Aran Islands - 7 forts, Cahercommaun, The Burren, Caherconree, Staigue, Benagh and Dingle Peninsula).</p><p>The nomination of a property to the World Heritage List is a significant undertaking that requires the development of comprehensive nomination documentation, including a management plan for the property.  Following submission of a nomination to UNESCO, it is evaluated by three advisory bodies:</p><p>-  the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS);</p><p>- the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN); and</p><p>- the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property(ICCROM).</p><p>Once the site has been evaluated, the intergovernmental World Heritage Committee makes the final decision regarding the site&rsquo;s inclusion on the World Heritage List.</p><p>The seminar I hosted on 12 September 2013 was designed to consider the interest of local authorities and community groups in pursuing full nomination of World Heritage Status for the sites on the Tentative List and to clarify all the elements involved in applying for and retaining such status. My aim is to encourage consultation within local communities and support local effort for the nomination of World Heritage Status where that is sought.  Following on from the seminar, my Department will liaise further with the local authorities and communities involved with a view to further advancing that process.</p><p>The locations of sites on Ireland&rsquo;s Tentative List extend over the administrative areas of 13 local authorities whose attendance at the seminar is set out in tabular form below.</p><p><table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>Attended </th></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon County Council</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>South Tipperary County Council</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath County Council</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council</td><td>YES</td></tr></table></p><p>The seminar was also attended by representatives of Armagh District Council in connection with the potential to include Eamhain Mhacha/Navan Fort in the Royal Sites of Ireland nomination.</p></reply>

This Charter places new responsibilities on Government Departments, agencies, cultural institutions and arts organisations in terms of providing and promoting arts education to children and young people. </p><p>  Both Minister Quinn and I believe passionately in arts education and want to see a joined-up Government approach across Departments, education agencies and arts organisations.  The Charter will see organisations like the Arts Council, the National Cultural Institutions, the Colleges of Education and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment working with both Departments in order to bring the arts into the classroom and learners into the institutes for the arts. </p><p>  A High Level Implementation Group was established to oversee the implementation of the Art in Education Charter earlier in the year and it will report twice a year. The Implementation Group is chaired by Professor John Coolahan, Professor Emeritus, NUI Maynooth. Its membership includes Orlaith McBride, Director of the Arts Council, Mary Nunan, Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, University of Limerick, Alan Wall, Director, Department of Education and Skills and Niall &Oacute; Donnch&uacute;, Assistant Secretary, Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  </p><p>  The Group has met on a number of occasions and has been proactive in meeting organisations from both the arts and education sectors.  Progress is being made on a number of initiatives, including developing a website/portal as a key communications and information channel for both the education and arts sectors.  Suitable models for art-rich schools and for artists to become involved in the programme are also being examined by this Group. </p><p>  There is no specific funding provision in my Department's Vote for arts in education this year. However, the Deputies may be aware that in May 2012 I announced the introduction of a new philanthropic initiative on a pilot basis for arts and culture organisations.  This year, &euro;210,000 will be available to arts organisations under this scheme and the majority of the Philanthropy Initiative funding will be directed towards arts and culture organisations seeking support for projects that include an education component.  The application form includes a provision that in the event of multiple applications competing for limited grant allocation, priority will be given to Arts in Education projects aimed at disadvantaged (DEIS) schools.</p></reply>

The report, commissioned by the Heritage Council and prepared under the direction of a steering committee chaired by my Department, provides comprehensive evidence-based data that supports and enhances our innate understanding of the importance of our built heritage in supporting employment.</p><p>  Whilst not specifically presenting the data with reference to youth, the report indicates that capital investment in built heritage conservation provides significant employment in the construction industry, while also assisting in developing and maintaining specialised skills among conservation professionals and craftspeople. While funding for investment in heritage is particularly limited at present, my Department will continue to provide funding within available resources for the protection, conservation and development of our built and natural heritage, which will in turn generate employment. In May, for example, I approved offers of funding to thirty-four local authorities under my Department's Structures at Risk Fund to enable conservation works to forty-five heritage structures from my Department's 2013 Built Heritage Capital Programme.  As the Deputy will appreciate, small but targeted heritage grants can incentivise job-rich investment in existing assets, particularly given that built heritage conservation work is labour intensive and uses high-end craft and professional skills.</p><p>In addition, my Department has committed to consider initiatives in<b></b>  traditional building skills and energy efficiency in traditionally built structures in conjunction with relevant stakeholders.

Salmon conservation limits are set similarly for all of Ireland&rsquo;s 142 salmon rivers. The main criteria used are the size of the river (wetted area) and the latitude. In addition factors specific to each river are used such as the proportion of one sea winter salmon and multi sea winter salmon in the population and the average weight of these salmon. Other inputs to calculating conservation limits nationally are proportions of male and female salmon and the average numbers of eggs per female fish. The Independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) advice for the Suir for 2013 was that the river was meeting its CL and had a surplus of 2,371 salmon. The SSC advice for the Nore for 2013 was that the river was also meeting its CL and had a surplus of 5,548 salmon. On the basis of this advice a Snap net fishery was open on both rivers, although with a restricted season on the River Suir to facilitate rational exploitation for the smaller surplus of Salmon in that river. The SSC advice for the River Barrow for 2013 was that it was significantly below its conservation limit and therefore would remain closed for harvesting of Salmon. The opening of a Snap net fishery on the River Barrow could only be considered if there is a suitable surplus of salmon (in excess of conservation limit) available for harvest. The snap net fisheries, which are a low intensity activity with relatively low exploitation rates, apply to each individual river.    IFI have advised that there has never been a drift net fishery on any of the individual rivers and that drift nets previously fished only in the common Waterford Estuary area and not within individual river systems. I am advised that the common estuary is considered those estuarine waters below the confluence of the River Barrow, Nore and Suir and hence is a mixed stock fishery containing Salmon from, at the very least, the three distinct rivers of the Barrow, Nore and Suir. </p><p>  Prior to any commercial fishing being considered in the estuary it will be necessary for all the rivers entering the estuary to be above their individual conservation limit and generating an individual surplus at the same time and for genetic analysis to have confirmed that no other stocks are mixed in the area. If genetic assessment can prove that the stocks in the area are specific to local rivers only, and that analysis shows that these stocks are all above their conservation limit with a surplus available for exploitation, consideration could be given to the operation of a commercial fishery on the estuary. The estuary would consititute a mixed stock fishery area, with fish originating in each of the tributary rivers. Permitting commercial fishing in such a mixed stock area where one of the genetically unique stocks is below its conservation limit would represent indiscriminate and irresponsible exploitation and would run counter to the conservation imperative. </p><p>  Any future decision on a fishery can only be taken in the context of all river stocks contributing to the estuary area being above their conservation limit. Ireland must be particularly careful to ensure that all national and international legislation and other obligations are met in any future management regime.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware &euro;25 million has been paid under the Salmion Hardship Scheme to those who ceased mixed stock fisheries and in particular ceased drift net fishing. In all the circumstances the method and intensity of commercial fishing that could be permitted in any future surplus situation would have to be carefully investigated prior to consideration of the potential re-opening of the commercial fishery.  </p></reply>

Last year, the EU Commission proposed a new directive, which would include amendments to the Renewable Energy Directive, to take into account the risk of Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) occurring as a result of the production of certain biofuels. ILUC is where the growing of crops for energy impacts on land use elsewhere. One of the amendments proposed was to limit to 5%, in energy terms, the contribution that certain crop based biofuels can make towards renewable energy targets for transport in EU Member States.The draft directive is still being discussed at EU Council Working Group level and a final Council position has yet to be agreed. The percentage that crop based biofuels will be allowed to contribute towards targets has proven to be a difficult issue to gain agreement on. i understand that the latest proposal from the Lithuanian Presidency is for a 7% cap on first generation biofuels which could be counted towards renewable energy targets. I also understand that the European Parliament has recently voted for a 6% cap but it appears that it has not yet a mandate to negotiate with Council.    I am in agreement that the issue of ILUC needs to be addressed and that that the production of next generation biofuels, which have little or no risk of ILUC, must to be encouraged and supported. </p><p>Though the increased deployment of electric vehicles will make some contribution towards Ireland's 2020 transport target, the vast bulk of the target will be met by the use of biofuels. We import most of our biofuel requirements and will continue to do so to 2020. Currently, there is only one biofuel producer of scale in Ireland who produces biodiesel from waste materials, such as used cooking oil and tallow. This producer will not be impacted by the ILUC proposal. The availability of competitively priced sustainable biofuels to 2020 will continue to be monitored by my Department.  </p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, accommodation and staffing are amongst the most significant cost components of public sector bodies and it is incumbent on all agencies to achieve economy and efficiency. In this context, the Deputy will be pleased to learn that the Board of IFI has commenced a strategic rationalisation of its Dublin based accommodation into one location. </p><p>  On its establishment, IFI had accommodation at three locations in Swords, including leasing a headquarters building, and premises in Glasnevin and Blackrock. As part of this rationalisation, and in keeping with Government policy to exit from expensive leases wherever possible, IFI exercised the break clause on the Swords Headquarters when it arose and has already disposed of the Glasnevin premises. </p><p>A key part of the accommodation strategy is the rationalisation and amalgamation of all Dublin property, including the Blackrock Office. This rationalisation strategy will generate efficiencies and also savings over time in relation to lease rents and in terms of the significantly better energy efficiency of the new Headquarters facility in City West, which will also be consistent with Government commitments as regards reducing CO2 emissions and energy consumption. The rationalisation will also assist in financing the fitting out of the new headquarters and other property rationalisations outside Dublin. </p><p>I am advised that the current proposal is to transfer Blackrock staff to the new IFI Headquarters Office in Citywest when it is complete and that there is no proposal to transfer staff currently stationed in Blackrock to the current IFI Headquarters Office in Swords. I am further informed that this rationalisation is being undertaken in conformity with Public Financial Procedures, including capital appraisal, and that IFI has engaged with all staff on these matters and are continuing to do so through the normal Industrial Relations channels.</p></reply>

This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  While I do not have statutory authority to direct commercial companies in the rollout of services, the National Broadband Plan aims to facilitate investment in such services. Since the publication of the Plan, eircom has extended its plans for the rollout of high speed services to 1.2m premises, and other fixed line and mobile operators are investing in enhanced product offerings, including 4G mobile and high speed cable services. These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction and regulatory arrangements for next generation access. Publication of the National Digital Strategy, and changes to planning and permitting regimes will also facilitate investment by the commercial sector, in line with the commitments in the National Broadband Plan. </p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years. The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government intervention that may be required and the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. All relevant matters, including issues related to pricing, will be considered as the process develops. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p></reply>

That Memorandum sent a strong signal of our shared interest in developing the opportunity to export green electricity from Ireland to Britain and will result in completion of consideration of how Irish renewable energy resources, onshore and offshore, might be developed to the mutual benefit of both countries. An agreed programme of work to this end is underway with the ambition to settle on an Inter-Governmental Agreement in early 2014. A key objective, from an Irish Government perspective, is to realise the potential for investment, jobs and growth. The amount of energy to be procured by the UK and the mechanisms for sharing the resultant economic benefits, including an appropriate return to the Exchequer, are among the matters to be addressed ahead of signing any Inter-Governmental Agreement. One of the key requirements for proposals of a significant scale for wind energy export will be the achievement of the necessary planning consents in Ireland. Planning permission for major renewable energy projects of significant scale are determined by An Bord Plean&aacute;la (ABP). In order to facilitate decisions by ABP on projects specifically for export, a clear national planning policy framework is essential and I have asked my Department to prepare such a framework. The policy framework will provide the opportunity to integrate relevant EU Directive requirements (including Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment), trans-boundary dimensions and stakeholder participation within the context of a national framework.    The outcome will be a high level development framework taking its lead from the Inter-Governmental Agreement, EU Directive requirements and relevant national, regional and local planning policy considerations in conjunction with wider policies, objectives and requirements. It will incorporate a vision and strategy coupled with technical parameters and a spatial element. </p><p>  The development of the framework will be progressed by my Department over the next year or so and will provide confidence and certainty for all stakeholders through an open, fair, balanced and consultative process. It is intended to commence public consultation in the coming weeks by formally inviting all interested parties and members of the public to make written submissions on the export project which will be taken into consideration in preparing the framework. Details on this will be provided through a new dedicated section on my Department&rsquo;s website, exclusive to the project, and which will be updated as the project progresses. </p><p>  It is important to note that any wind energy export strategy would also depend on the conclusion of an Inter-Governmental Agreement that would ensure such exports were in the interests of both Ireland and Britain.</p></reply>

Aggregate costs per minute do not necessarily indicate the cheapest offer available in the Irish market and there is a significant variation in these costs across all operators. The EU publication also makes no distinction between pre- and post-paid customers. </p><p>According to data from Teligen (who compile telecom data and metrics on behalf of ComReg) the cost of mobile post-paid packages in Ireland is below or close to the EU average while the cost of pre-pay packages is above the average. Costs in Ireland are however converging to the EU average. </p><p>ComReg's data also indicates that the costs have been decreasing over the last two years. In its Quarter 2 Report for June 2013 it shows that Average Revenue per User (ARPU) for mobile services in Q2 2013 was &euro;27 per month, down from &euro;29 for the same period in 2012. </p><p>This decline in ARPU is likely to be a reflection of a number of factors including reduced consumer spending, lower priced mobile plans, increased sales of bundled products (combining mobile with fixed calls and sometimes broadband) and reductions in roaming and mobile termination rates, among others.</p></reply>

The Better Energy Financing (BEF) model proposes that the current suite of Exchequer-funded grants for energy efficiency measures would be replaced by a new financing scheme open to householders. The current programme, which includes Better Energy Homes and Better Energy Warmer Homes, will remain open for applications until the new BEF scheme is introduced. In the interim, I have no plans to reduce funding or discontinue the existing residential sector supports. I wish to stress, however, that it is my intention in the context of the introduction of a BEF scheme that the existing Warmer Homes scheme, aimed at those on low incomes, would remain in existence.My Department, with the assistance of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), has put in place a project team to design the BEF scheme under the direction of a Project Board representing key State and industry stakeholders. The design of the scheme is currently being developed and a public consultation process was undertaken during August. On foot of the outcome of this consultation and the recommendations of the Project Board, it is my intention to bring the matter to Government in the coming weeks outlining the detailed design of the BEF programme.    The Better Energy Homes scheme provides support to homeowners towards the installation of attic and wall insulation, and heating system upgrades including solar thermal with the works being undertaken by privately appointed contractors.</p><p>The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to lower income households vulnerable to energy poverty. The scheme is delivered through a combination of SEAI-appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage and via an area based approach. Measures available include: draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation and are free of charge to the customer.</p><p>Just over 250,000 homes have been upgraded through the Better Energy schemes that are administered by the SEAI.

In order to achieve this overall target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable generation by 2020. To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. In 2012, 15.5% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of quarter one this year over 1,700 MW of wind generation capacity was connected to the grid. It is estimated that to deliver on our 40% target, a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of renewable generation capacity will be required. It is anticipated that onshore wind will provide the bulk of this capacity.While good progress has been made towards achieving our 2020 renewable electricity target, maintaining the required rate of wind energy build is presenting a challenge. Analysis shows that the target will not be achieved without an increase in build from an historic average of 180 MW per year to at least 250 MW per year. Non-achievement of our 2020 target would result in compliance costs and emissions permit purchases. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has estimated that these could amount to between &euro;100 million and &euro;150 million per annum for each percentage shortfall in renewable energy and a further &euro;250m in emissions permit purchases.   In recognition of (i) the absolute need to meet our 2020 targets, (ii) the obstacles faced by developers in bringing projects to fruition and (iii) the need for policy certainty, earlier this year I took a number decisions to allow for greater flexibility of the Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff, or REFIT, support schemes. With regard to REFIT 1, approval to extend the backstop date to 2027 was received from the European Commission in early August and the scheme has now been amended accordingly. The extension of REFIT 1 to 2027 seeks to allow an adequate return on investment for developers whose investments facilitate Ireland in meeting the 2020 target. It also seeks to ensure the timely closing of this support scheme. </p><p>The extension of the REFIT 1 backstop date is part of a range of measures aimed at addressing the challenges of meeting our 2020 renewable electricity target. Acceptance of grid connection offers made by EirGrid under the Gate 3 process to developers of just under 4,000 MW of renewable generation is due to be completed in October. In light of the fact that a significant portion of Gate 3 projects is now likely to connect post 2015, I have also amended the terms and conditions of REFIT 2 to allow projects until 31 December 2017 to become operational. The progress of wind energy build will continue to be monitored closely by my Department and key State bodies.   </p></reply>

Prices in the electricity retail market are fully deregulated. Customers can therefore avail of competitive offerings from electricity and gas suppliers. Prices are set by suppliers and are commercial and operational matters for them. I have no statutory function in the setting of electricity prices.Electricity and gas costs in Ireland are influenced by various drivers, including global gas and oil prices, the costs of capital, exchange rate fluctuations, the small size of the Irish market, geographical location and low population density.The most important factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is the continuing upward trend in international gas prices. In Europe, wholesale natural gas prices have been on an upward curve since the second half of 2009. This is driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa, Japan and by the significant growth in demand from China and India. This feeds directly through to retail electricity prices as most of Ireland's electricity is produced at gas-fired stations. </p><p>The trend of increasing gas prices in European wholesale markets, and the underlying dependence on gas in the electricity mix underline the need to maintain the focus on continuing to address controllable cost factors, to increase the penetration of indigenous secure renewables in the Irish electricity system and to take action on energy efficiency in homes and businesses.</p><p>At a national level, the competitive energy market in place helps put downward pressure on prices. In addition, we must focus on all possible additional actions to mitigate costs for business and domestic customers, including rigorous regulatory scrutiny of the network costs component of retail prices.</p><p>I am committed to working with enterprise and with the energy sector to ensure that the costs of energy are as competitive as possible. In this context, promotion of energy efficiency measures is an area within our control where action can be taken to reduce energy costs.</p><p>Increasing use of indigenous sustainable sources of energy in electricity generation will help offset the impact of volatile fossil fuel prices. The Government has a renewable electricity target of 40% by 2020. Good progress has been made in meeting this target and its realisation will introduce more certainty in the energy fuel mix as well as boosting security of supply.</p><p>The Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy supports the security of our energy supplies and the development of renewable electricity in Ireland. Its legal basis and method of calculation are set out in the regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. The PSO is levied on all electricity customers. It is set at &euro;1.54/kVA per month for medium and large customers for the period October 2013 to September 2014. I have no plans to alter the PSO schemes at this time.</p></reply>

This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>    Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. </p><p>  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years. The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government intervention that may be required and the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. All relevant technical matters and issues related to pricing, will be considered. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p></reply>

In order to meet our overall 16% requirement, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources.</p><p>  In 2012, 5,254.5 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity was produced from renewable sources. The breakdown by sector is as follows: </p><p><b>Technology Amount (GWh)</b></p><p>  Hydropower 802.0 </p><p>  Windpower 4,010.0</p><p>  Landfill gas 175.0</p><p>  Wood 180.0 </p><p>  Biogas 24.0</p><p>  Renewable waste and other 63.0</p><p>  Solar (PV) 0.50 </p><p>  It is estimated that to deliver on our 40% target, a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of renewable generation capacity will be required.

It is also essential that children, young people and parents are educated as to the risks that can be found online, that parents and teachers are supported in explaining these issues to children and that the optimal technical solution to protect children is identified. In this regard, there are a range of tools available online to assist parents in managing internet access.</p><p>  The industry also shares in the responsibility to take all reasonable steps to protect children and I have met the Internet Services providers (ISPs) to explore these issues in detail. The ISPs also have a variety of measures and resources already in place, with software and other tools available to help parents ensure online safety for their children. </p><p>  I remain to be convinced that a blanket or &lsquo;default on&rsquo; blocker such as that proposed in the UK would achieve the desired ends and whether, in fact, it is open to Governments to impose a blanket or general obligation of this nature on ISPs.</p><p>  What we need to ensure is that the State responds appropriately and in a manner which is effective, workable and respects the rights of individuals. Work is continuing to identify measures which might prove effective. I have met with the ISPs earlier this Summer to discuss this issue and further meetings will be held by my Department with the ISPs in the near future. While there are a number of other difficulties with it, the UK approach may have lessons for us. The Government will keep a close eye on what happens but, for the moment, it seems that the solution will involve a multi-faceted effort by Government, industry, educators and, most importantly, parents. </p></reply>

The current system stipulates that, except for certain classes of social welfare recipients, if you own a television set in Ireland you are liable to pay a television licence. Revenue derived from the licence fee is used to fund public service broadcasting in the State.Viewers who wish to do so may additionally subscribe to an independent commercial multichannel TV provider but no such subscription goes to fund public service broadcasting. Furthermore, no VAT receipts derived from the purchase of televisions, or ESB usage, for example, flow to the public service broadcasters. Part 7 of the 2009 Act provides for public service broadcasting and sets out the provisions relating to the public service broadcasting corporations, RT&Eacute; and TG4, including their principal objects. </p><p>These objects provide for the companies' statutory mandates and encapsulate national policy in terms of public service broadcasting. They include the specific objective of providing for national, free-to-air public service broadcasting services, as well as the provision of a broad range of other additional services that are seen as fundamental to the role of the public service broadcaster. In their pursuit of these objects, the provisions of the Act subject the public service broadcasting corporations to a range of additional regulatory obligations. These statutory objects and obligations set the State-owned public service broadcasters apart from their commercial counterparts.</p><p>The rationale for providing State funding for public service broadcasting is to ensure an independent and reliable income flow that allows both RT&Eacute; and TG4 to attain their public service objects, while safeguarding their editorial independence. This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.</p><p>In relation to the television licence fee monies, it should be noted that not all of these are allocated to the public service broadcasters and that a proportion is available to both public and independent broadcasters through the Broadcasting Funding Scheme.</p><p>The purpose of this Scheme is to encourage the inclusion of additional programming of a particular character in broadcasters programme schedules. The Scheme is open to independent producers and all 'free to air' broadcasters. It is funded by way of a payment of 7% of net licence fee receipts, which is paid to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) in respect of this Scheme. This amount was increased from 5% to 7% under the Broadcasting Act 2009.</p></reply>

As shareholder, however, I have a strong interest in relation to the ongoing commercial position of the Company and I and my Department regularly liaise with the Company in this regard. An Post has many strengths and has the largest retail presence in the country. I have impressed on the Company the need to further exploit its unique position in this regard and have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins. </p><p>I have read and considered the Irish Postmasters' Union (IPU) 2012 Report on The Future of the Post Office Network in Ireland which I found to be both positive and ambitious. The report focuses on growing the business to make the network more sustainable.</p><p>In May this year, I addressed the annual conference of the Irish Postmasters' Union and emphasised the intrinsic strengths of the network and the opportunities for new developments. Having invested in the computerisation of all post offices, An Post is well positioned to become the front office provider of choice for Government and the financial services sector.</p><p>An Post has made much progress towards diversification with its enhanced arrangement with AIB and its agreement with Aviva for the transfer of Aviva Ireland's branch offices personal insurance business book to One Direct. More recently the opportunity to pay the local property tax via An Post outlets was secured. An Post has also been selected as the preferred bidder, following a competitive tender process, for the cash element of welfare payments which augurs well for the future of the network.</p><p>In the context of the public sector transformation agenda I will continue to engage with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to consideration, as appropriate, of the post office network for transactional elements of the business of Government Departments and Agencies and have stressed to my Government colleagues that the network is ideally configured for over the counter transactions.</p><p>Overall, it is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company, in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focussed network of post offices. </p></reply>

In Ireland, the analogue terrestrial TV network was switched off and replaced by SAORVIEW, the new national digital terrestrial TV network, on 24 October 2012. This was in line with the timetable set by the EU which had requested Member States to switch off analogue terrestrial TV by end 2012.    The allocation of the additional spectrum that became available as a result of analogue switch off is a matter for the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) as part of its statutory function in relation to the management of the radio spectrum under the Communications Regulation Act, 2002 as amended. </p><p>  In November 2012, ComReg announced the results of its Multi-Band Spectrum Award (MBSA) process which resulted in a total licence yield of &euro;855 million to be paid over the duration of the terms of the licences (from 2013 to 2020).</p><p>  These spectrum bands are highly suitable for advanced mobile services due to their excellent propagation properties, which allow for wide area coverage and improved in-building reception. </p><p>  It is a condition of a Liberalised Use Licence that a minimum 70% population coverage obligation is to be achieved by a licensee within 3 years of its licence commencement date. I am advised that ComReg considers that actual coverage levels are expected to exceed this obligation given the competitive nature of the market and the limited risk of roll-back of coverage from current higher levels. </p><p>While the four Liberalised Use Licences of the Mobile Network Operators commenced on 1 February 2013, the timing and extent of &lsquo;4G&rsquo; (Long Term Evolution (LTE)) network rollout is, with the exception of the above coverage obligation, a matter for the operators themselves.

ComReg, which is accountable to Committees of the Oireactas in accordance with s34 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002, is independent in the exercise of these functions.The latest ComReg quarterly market report shows that mobile market penetration in Ireland is 118% and that the mobile market accounts for approximately 73.7% of all voice and internet subscriptions (fixed and mobile). Increasing demand for data services over fixed and mobile networks is a challenge for industry and Governments globally. The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published last year, aims to address this challenge by facilitating investment by the commercial sector and committing to the State intervening where there is no commercial case for investment.    Since the Plan was published, significant investments have been announced in both fixed and mobile networks in Ireland. In December 2012, ComReg announced the results of its multiband spectrum auction, in which the mobile industry is investing &euro;855m in spectrum licences to rollout advanced 4G mobile services. Operators are now preparing to roll out these services. In addition, at least one operator has announced a significant upgrade to its 3G network. </p><p>  These developments, together with commercial investments in fixed broadband services will result in an improvement in the overall quality of telephone and broadband services throughout the country. This will be augmented by a State investment in high speed broadband, under the National Broadband Plan, in those areas where commercial investments are not deemed to be feasible. </p></reply>

At present the mobile phone operators provide the mobile base station location and the centre of the coverage area to the emergency call answering service. The location information received by the emergency call answering service is then passed on to the relevant emergency services.  My Department is aware that there are a number of software applications that run on smart phones that will provide more accurate location information than is currently available from the operators.  Given that not everybody uses a smartphone or has downloaded these applications it is considered that this solution has limited application at present. In addition, as the presentation of location information using these applications has not been standardised, the processing of this information by the Emergency Call Answering Service could be challenging at present. </p><p>  My Department will, however, engage with the mobile telephone operators and ComReg in the next few months to explore technical ways to improve the location information available at a network level. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-09-18a.2248.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013091800079#WRWW01100"><p>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is responsible for regulating the electricity and natural gas markets in Ireland.  It was established under the Electricity Regulation Act of 1999 (ERA) as the statutory independent energy regulator.  Responsibility for the regulation of these markets is a matter for the CER. Prices in the electricity retail market are fully deregulated since April 2011.  Prices are set by suppliers, not the CER. It is important to highlight that electricity customers can avail of price and product offerings from a range of electricity suppliers in the competitive market.  Up until 1 October 2011 the CER regulated the Bord G&aacute;is Energy (BGE) tariffs for its residential and smaller business customers.  CER's regulation of BGE's tariffs for the latter group ended at that point.  The CER still regulates BGE tariffs for its residential customers. Prices charged to business gas customers are commercial matters for the suppliers concerned and the same is the case for non-BGE suppliers to residential customers. Both business and domestic customers can avail of the competitive offerings from suppliers including discounts. </p><p>  In regard to the most recent decision by the CER to apply an increase of 2.04% in BGE's regulated residential gas tariffs with effect from 1 October, this decision followed a review by the CER of BGE's application for an increase.  While BGE originally applied for a 7.22% increase in its residential tariff, a separate and subsequent decision by the CER, aimed at increasing bookings for larger customers, resulted in mitigating the level of the rise in the network charges component of prices. This decision, combined with a cut by the CER in BGE's allowable supply costs, resulted in a lower increase than had been requested by BGE. It is also important to note that lower gas demand results in higher network charges as these costs are mostly fixed and need to be paid even when demand reduces.  I understand that a marginal increase in wholesale international (sterling denominated) gas prices, which accounts for approximately 50% of Irish gas prices, did not impact on the tariff increase as much as upward pressure on gas network tariffs driven by lower gas demand, which accounts for 40% approximately of a typical gas bill.</p><p>  In making its decisions on the tariffs, the CER takes account of the need to protect consumers from unnecessary price increases by ensuring that only reasonable, necessary and efficiently-incurred costs are recovered by BGE. The CER is concerned at the impact of electricity and gas price increases on vulnerable households and is working with energy suppliers to ensure that vulnerable customers are protected through, inter alia, the installation of Pay As You Go meters. </p><p>  As regards the operation of the CER, I am satisfied that the CER has the knowledge, skills, and expertise to carry out its functions in accordance with its statutory mandate. The Electricity Regulation Act provides that the CER shall be independent in the performance of its functions subject to the Act itself. Additionally, Schedule 1 of the Act provides that the CER shall account for the performance of its functions to a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas and shall have regard to any recommendations of such Joint Committee relevant to its functions.</p></reply>

The final decision to proceed with implementation of a National Postcode System will be for decision by Government in due course and will be based on appropriate financial, technical and operational considerations.  There has been widespread support from public and private business for the introduction of postcodes nationally.  Following stakeholder consultations in 2010 the key general areas where benefits could be derived from a National Postcode System were identified as being:</p><p>- Improved efficiency and accuracy of internal business processes as a result of improved accuracy and consistency of databases across public and private sectors;</p><p>- Delivery of improved efficiencies with regards to logistics (including emergency service response);</p><p>- Better planning and analysis capabilities across public and private sectors;</p><p>- Providing a stimulus to mail volumes through improved direct marketing capabilities;</p><p>- Enabling organisations to improve existing services and/or develop new service offerings; and</p><p>- Facilitating improved efficiencies and quality improvements in the mails sector.</p></reply>

I can confirm that the team of consultants engaged by my Department to assist it in monitoring compliance with the conditions of the consents granted by my Department in respect of this project have the necessary expertise, experience and competence to carry out this work. I can also confirm that the consultants have adequate access to all areas of the project to enable them to carry out their role in an effective manner. As regards the visit undertaken by the Environ tunnelling specialist on 2/3 July, the specific scope of that visit was to:   </p><p>- Review the points raised during the previous visit by the tunnelling specialist;</p><p>- Assess the possible reasons behind the &ldquo;depressions&rdquo; that had been recently reported in Sruwaddacon Bay; and</p><p>- Examine what lessons have been learned from the above incidents. </p><p>  The site visit involved discussions with SEPIL and its tunnelling contractors, document reviews and a visit to the tunnelling compound. Entry inside the tunnel itself was not undertaken and this would have required specific confined space training. However, entry to the tunnel was not required to complete the scope of work and hence this did not materially affect the conclusions of the site visit report.</p></reply>

Specifically, the Act requires RT&Eacute; to provide digital coverage to the same extent as provided over the previous analogue network, i.e. 98% population coverage, and I am advised by RT&Eacute; that this level of coverage is being provided by the SAORVIEW TV network.  For the remaining 2% of the population, RT&Eacute; launched SAORSAT in March 2012.  The development and provision of SAORSAT, which is a &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; satellite system providing access to the RT&Eacute; channels and TG4, was undertaken by RT&Eacute; on its own initiative and, as in the case of the SAORVIEW DTT network, is not a matter in which I have a function.  Ireland is not the only country to have introduced a national TV network on both a terrestrial and satellite platform.  Many countries, including the UK, have developed their digital networks on both the traditional terrestrial platform and also over satellite.  The reason for this is simple.  It is technically and financially impossible to provide 100% coverage using a terrestrial TV platform.  However, through SAORVIEW and SAORSAT, Ireland now has 100% &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; coverage of the RT&Eacute; channels and TG4 for the first time in the history of the State. </p><p>  That said, I have noted the specific details of the case raised by the Deputy in this Question and have had them brought to the attention of RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s network company, 2RN.  I have been assured by the company that they will seek to make contact with the individual concerned to see if anything can be done to improve the person&rsquo;s terrestrial TV reception.</p></reply>

In order to meet our overall 16% requirement, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity, 12% of heating and 10% of transport demand from renewable energy sources.  There are a number of policy measures in place, designed to incentivise the development necessary to meet Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy targets.  These include the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) schemes to support renewable electricity and heat generation, measures such as the Biofuel Obligation Scheme to increase the use of biofuels in the transport sector, and the Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme to incentivise the purchase of new electric vehicles.  In addition, I will be publishing a bioenergy strategy later this year which will further outline the role that energy from biomass will play in contributing to the achievement of our national targets.</p></reply>

The Better Energy Homes scheme commenced in 2009 and provides support to homeowners towards the installation of attic and wall insulation, and heating system upgrades including solar thermal with the works being undertaken by privately appointed contractors.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme commenced in 2000 and delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is delivered through a combination of SEAI appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage and via an area based approach.  Measures available include: draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation and are free of charge to the customer.  The area based model was introduced in 2012 to target low income homeowners experiencing extreme energy poverty.</p><p>The Greener Homes Scheme was introduced in 2006 to encourage homeowners to convert their heating systems to use more sustainable energy sources and was closed at the end of 2011.</p><p>The following table outlines the number of homes that received energy efficiency measures across all the schemes since their commencement to date.

The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, including the most appropriate method of valuation.   The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. </p><p>  It is important to acknowledge that commercial rates, as a local tax, and the rating system generally are deeply embedded in the local government system.   A large body of case law is well established and local authorities and ratepayers are, in the main, very familiar with, and generally accepting of, the operation and practice of the rating system.   Rates are also a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.</p><p>  I am acutely aware of the pressures on small and medium-sized businesses at the present time.   Local authorities have been asked by my Department to exercise restraint or, where possible, to reduce commercial rates and local charges for 2013.   Local authorities have responded well to such requests in recent years and in 2013, 87 out of the 88 rating authorities have either reduced their ARV or kept it the same as in 2012.  I am keeping the approach to rates by local authorities under active review, and am determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain costs in the local government sector.</p></reply>

There are a number of indicators as to what makes a property suitable for occupation for the purposes of determining liability to the Charge.  The indicators include the structure of the property, whether or not it has a roof, whether or not it is so affected by dampness as to render it unsuitable for habitation, and whether or not it has sanitary facilities, including a water closet and water supply.</p><p>  It should be noted that certificates of exemption and certificates of discharge are issued solely in respect of residential properties, as defined by the Act.  Therefore, a local authority is not in a position to issue a certificate of discharge or waiver in respect of a property deemed to be uninhabitable on a given liability date for the Non Principal Private Residence Charge.   </p><p>  Should there be uncertainty as to the potential liability of a property to the Charge, the owner is advised to contact the local authority in question to determine liability.</p></reply>

The quarterly and half-yearly payment options incorporate a surcharge element to cover the higher administrative costs involved in processing such applications.  The estimated annual income from the increased charges for half-year and quarterly vehicle licences is in the region of &euro;50m.  Were a monthly pro-rata system to be introduced, this loss in income would have to be compensated for elsewhere in the motor tax system, or through the taxation system generally.  It would also have a negative transitional impact on the flow of income to the Local Government Fund and consequently on grant allocations to local authorities from the Fund.</p><p>  There would also be significant once-off costs in setting up such a system, as well as ongoing administrative, control and financial costs.  Any such proposal would require enforcement provisions to ensure that there is a system in place to recoup income lost to the taxpayer where there are insufficient funds in personal accounts to meet the payment or where the direct debit option is cancelled by the account holder once a disc is issued, and provisions to enable recovery of the disc where required.</p></reply>

In relation to estates which have been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the permission, section 180 provides that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the developer or by the majority of the qualified electors who are owners of the houses involved, initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act 1993 for declaring the road(s) to be public roads, for whose maintenance the local authority will then be responsible.  Section 11 of the Roads Act empowers a local authority, by order, to declare any road over which a public right of way exists to be a public road.  Before making an order the local authority must be satisfied the road is of general public utility, consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge and consult with the public/consider any objections received.  The consideration of the objections and the making of the order declaring the road to be a public road is a reserved function, so that the decision whether to take the road in charge is ultimately one for the discretion of the elected members.</p><p>  In relation to estates which have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced within the relevant period section 180 also provides that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of the owners, initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act.  However, in this case the section provides that the provision in section 11 of the Roads Act requiring the authority to consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge is to be disregarded.</p><p>  Section 180 also provides that where a planning authority, in complying with section 180, makes an order under section 11 of the Roads Act, it must also take in charge any open spaces, car parks, sewers, watermains, or drains within the attendant grounds of the development.  Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a planning authority may take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, at any time after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the planning authority consider that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer.  Planning authorities have also been empowered to take in charge part of an estate or some, but not all, of the facilities in an estate.</p></reply>

Under the Acts, the primary management and enforcement response to littering, including the provision of signage to deter dog fouling, is a matter for local authorities.</p><p>  It is a matter for each individual local authority to decide the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean-up actions in relation to litter, taking account of local circumstances and priorities.</p><p>  In relation to the provision of funding to local authorities to tackle the issue of dog fouling, under the Anti-Litter &amp;amp; Anti-Graffiti Awareness Grant Scheme, for which my Department has provided funding for local authorities since 1997, local authorities are invited to select suitable projects for funding and deciding on individual grant allocations.  The Scheme requires that projects selected should promote greater public awareness and education in relation to litter, including the issue of dog fouling, and since 2008, graffiti. They should also, where possible, focus on voluntary initiatives by community and environmental groups and involve schools and young people in anti-litter and anti-graffiti action. I made a total of &euro;900,000 available to fund suitable projects under the Scheme in 2013, which included funding approval for Wicklow County Council for a Green Dog Walkers initiative, designed to raise awareness about the issue of dog fouling.</p><p>  I believe that raising awareness of the litter problem and educating our young people is key to effecting a long-term change in society&rsquo;s attitudes towards litter disposal but ultimately, it is the responsibility of each individual to ensure that they play their part in preserving the environment for others through the responsible disposal of their litter, including dog fouling.</p></reply>

The plan contains a list of 58 actions arising from the review, some of which are a matter for my Department and others which are the responsibility of the EPA and others. </p><p>  In the plan, I prioritised a number of actions for implementation in 2012, with others to be considered over a longer period as they will require detailed consultation and possibly primary legislation. Details of the expected timeframes for the implementation of individual recommendations were set out in the implementation plan.   Implementation of the majority of recommendations is progressing in a satisfactory manner. However, delays have arisen in some areas, particularly those requiring legal advice and/or legislative change. My Department and the Agency have continued to liaise on implementation and I expect to publish a review of progress made in the near future.   </p><p>  The review recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that immunity from prosecution, as applicable to the EPA in carrying out its functions, be reconsidered. As set out in the implementation plan, I propose to commence consideration of this issue in the latter half of 2013. It should be noted that primary legislation would be required if, subsequent to this consideration, it is decided to progress it. Furthermore, I also note that the EPA is not the only Agency that currently has statutory immunity. In this context, it will be particularly important to thoroughly examine the potential impact of any change in this provision on the ability of the EPA to discharge its statutory functions effectively.   </p><p>  In respect of the EPA falling within the remit of the Ombudsmans Act 2012, the EPA Review Group recommended that it should do so in respect of issues of maladministration only. My Department is liaising with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of the Attorney General on this issue.   </p><p>  In regard to whistleblower legislation, my colleague the nister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin, T.D., published, in July 2013, the Protected Disclosure Bill 2013, which will establish a detailed and comprehensive legislative framework protecting whistleblowers in all sectors of the economy.   </p></reply>

Interpretation of the legislation may be a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately may be a matter for the Courts.   </p><p>  Under the 2011 Act  &quot;residential property&quot; is defined as a &ldquo;building that is situated in the State and that is occupied, or suitable for occupation, as a separate dwelling, whether or not the occupier shares, or would be entitled to share... any accommodation, amenity or facility with any other person.&rdquo; </p><p>  There are a number of indicators as to what makes a property suitable for occupation for the purposes of determining liab ility to the Charge. The indicators include the structure of the property, whether or not it has a roof, whether or not it is so affected by dampness as to render it unsuitable for habitation, and whether or not it has sanitary facilities, including a water closet and water supply. A property that is not suitable for occupation should not be regarded as a residential property within the meaning of the 2011 Act and would not therefore be liable for the Household Charge.   The Household Charge has been replaced by the Local Property Tax in 2013.   Any potentially liable owner should contact their local authority to determine whether or not the property in question has been liable for the Charge.</p></reply>

This increase is driven by the Dublin market, where rent levels have increased by 4.7%, whereas average rent levels in the rest of the country have fallen by 1.3% on a year-on-year basis.   Fluctuations in rent levels are a factor of supply and demand.  While Government should not seek to interfere unduly in the operation of the market , movements in price levels are kept under close scrutiny .   </p><p>  I recently published a Homelessness Policy Statement in which I outlined the Government's aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.  The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness. </p><p>  As such, while I do not consider that these price changes will unduly affect the Government&rsquo;s homelessness strategy I will keep all relevant data under review.</p></reply>

I am not a party to those proceedings and I became aware earlier this month that, regrettably, the process has not identified a basis on which the parties could agree to bring to a conclusion the various matters at issue at Priory Hall.   </p><p>Earlier this week I announced a move by Government to convene a process with stakeholders to identify fair and equitable solutions for Priory Hall residents and for the future of the complex.      </p><p>  The most pressing issue is finding a solution to the unacceptable position in which the former owner occupiers find themselves.  I have asked senior officials from my Department to make contact with the stakeholders best placed to deliver the necessary solutions and to ask the parties concerned to come together in good faith on this complex matter.   </p><p>The full resolution of the Priory Hall situation is the ultimate goal. However, after two years in personally very difficult circumstances, it is vital above all else that the former residents are quickly facilitated in getting on with their lives.  I have set down a short period of 21 days to reach conclusions on the matter and I would urge all parties to work together constructively towards that end.</p></reply>

The Office of Environmental Enforcement within the EPA has a mandate to deliver enhanced environmental compliance both through enforcement of agency licences issued to waste, industrial and other activities, and also through the supervisory role which it exercises in respect of the environmental protection activities of local authorities.  In this regard, the Office acts as a resource to members of the public who have exhausted all other avenues of complaint.  Under section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996 the nister is precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by the agency or a local authority, in particular circumstances, of a statutory function vested in it. </p><p>  The enforcement of planning control is a matter for the relevant planning authority.  Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, a planning authority must issue a warning letter in relation to written complaints regarding unauthorised development, or other unauthorised development, of which it becomes aware (except in the case of trivial or minor development).  There is also a statutory obligation to carry out an investigation and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued or a court order should be sought, under section 160 of the 2000 Act.  Where a planning authority establishes, following an investigation, that unauthorised development (other than development that is of a trivial or minor nature) has been or is being carried out, and the person who has carried out the development has not proceeded to remedy the position, then the planning authority must issue an enforcement notice or seek a court order, unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so.</p></reply>

There is a particular focus on supporting communities that are vulnerable, disadvantaged or under threat, and an adherence to the values of local participation.   </p><p>I am advancing a Programme of reform for local government which includes measures to enhance alignment between local government and local development. The Action Programme for Effective Local Government - Putting People First represents a significant change in government policy in relation to local government and seeks to position local government as the main vehicle of governance and public service at local level &ndash; leading economic, social and community development, delivering efficient and good value services, and representing citizens and local communities effectively and accountably.   </p><p>  The vision and focus underpinning the Government&rsquo;s decision is to achieve a more joined-up approach to service delivery at local level, with responsibility for what is being done &ndash; and being spent &ndash; in the area of local and community development devolved to local level. This will be underpinned by new local governance arrangements that will seek to enhance involvement by citizens and communities in the design, implementation and targeting of services. The new measures will see the introduction of Socio-Economic Committees in each local authority area which will be tasked with developing a 5 year City/County Local and Community Plan for its area encompassing all state funded local and community development interventions.   </p><p>  The Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) is one of my Department&rsquo;s main social inclusion programmes.  The LCDP aims to tackle poverty and social exclusion in disadvantaged communities. It is a key tool of Government in providing employment supports, training, personal development/capacity building and other supports for the harder to reach in the most disadvantaged areas in society.  It is a locally accessible, frontline intervention, supporting disadvantaged communities.  The Programme will invest some &euro;48 million in our communities this year.  Funding for a redesigned Programme for 2014, with a renewed emphasis on targeting the harder to reach individuals and communities, is under consideration in the context of the annual estimates process.  The new programme would also effectively contribute to citizen engagement in line with national policy.   </p><p>  There is a considerable diversity of roles within the community sector; any person studying community development has access to the services available through the various educational and academic institutions to inform themselves of career path opportunities. In addition, for some individuals experience of voluntary work is a key contributory factor in choosing a particular academic course and a career pathway.</p></reply>

These arrangements will seek to ensure that the measures being pursued by housing authorities reflect the housing-led approach advocated in the Homelessness Policy Statement, that actions are in place towards achieving the target of ending long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 and that evidence to support progress will be presented through the reports on the indicators.  While it is clear that a proportion of funding must be used to provide sufficient bed capacity to accommodate those in need of emergency accommodation, it is equally important that resources are channelled to deliver more permanent responses in a more focused and strategic way.</p><p>When I published the Homelessness Policy Statement, I announced a set of indicators which will be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed.  These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness in Ireland and, in quantifying its on-going extent, will support the bringing forward of realistic and practical solutions.</p><p>Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with the housing authorities.  Under the new funding arrangements, responsibility for rigorous assessment, appraisal and decision making in relation to proposals and funding of particular services within the available allocations rests with the Management Group of the region led by the lead housing authority.  My Department has no function in regard to decisions on operational matters.  It is a matter for housing authorities to consider the ongoing funding requirements of particular services within the available allocations.</p><p>The regionalisation of homeless services follows Ministerial directions made in 2010 under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 on the establishment and membership of the Joint Homeless Consultative Fora and Management Groups.  These regional fora are based on the statutory local government regions, with the internal division of the Border region into North East and North West regions.  The regional approach is considered more appropriate as it helps to bring a more strategic perspective to bear on action to address homelessness, including avoidance of over-concentration of homelessness services in certain centres and promoting appropriate regional availability of services, consistent with need.       My Department provides funding to housing authorities towards the operational costs of homeless accommodation and related services under Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988; &euro;45 million is being made available by my Department to housing authorities in 2013 for this purpose.  This amount represents a decrease of 3.32% on the 2012 outturn and this reduction has been applied on a pro-rata basis to each of the 9 homeless regional allocations for 2013.  The table below outlines the allocation for each region for 2013.  Housing authorities also provide funding from their own resources and the total available funding from my Department and housing authorities is expected to be approximately &euro;50 million in 2013.  In addition to this funding, in excess of &euro;30 million is also provided annually through the HSE for health and personal social care related supports.</p><p><b>Funding in 2013 under Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Region</th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>31,322,223</td></tr><tr><td>South West</td><td>4,272,197</td></tr><tr><td>Mid West </td><td>3,399,336</td></tr><tr><td>South East</td><td>1,787,469</td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>1,528,951</td></tr><tr><td>North East </td><td>879,963</td></tr><tr><td>Mid East </td><td>811,275</td></tr><tr><td>Midland </td><td>649,707</td></tr><tr><td>North West </td><td>348,879</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>45,000,000</td></tr></table></p><p>A Protocol for the Delegation of Section 10 Homeless funding has been agreed between my Department and Kildare County Council, as lead authority for the Mid East region.

It is a nation-wide system, based in three regional communication centres in Dublin, Limerick and Castlebar.  The system supports the operators in dealing with 999 / 112 calls for fire service assistance from the public, identifying their location and mobilising the appropriate initial response.  The three regional communications centre s maintain radio communications with the responding fire service and also have a co-ordinating role in major emergencies.  The regional communication centre s also gather, collate and make available detailed statistical information for fire authorities.   The primary benefit of the CAMP Project has been its provision of modern, consistent, quality-assured call-handling approach. It was an early example of a successful &lsquo;shared services&rsquo; initiative.   </p><p>The first generation communications and mobilisation system has served the public well over the last 20 years .   However, it is clear that, with its analogue- based radio system , it is nearing the end of its life cycle.  Requirements for additional functionality e.g. mobile data, location services, officer paging have also emerged as drivers for change   . </p><p>  CAMP &ndash; The Next Generation policy document was prepared by my Department&rsquo;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management.  It sets out a policy of moving from three separate region-based communication systems to a single national system with distributed nodes at the current three CAMP centres.  The three centres will be interconnected and capable of despatching, monitoring and supporting each other .   It is intended to use the new National Digital Radio Service (TETRA) now being used by other emergency services as the main communications system, bringing fire services in line with other emergency services.  This will provide the opportunity to achieve an improved, more resilient service for the public .   In a distributed national system one control centre can mobilise the fire fighting resources of another control centre so that, if necessary, calls can be routed to available operators at other centres. </p><p>  The transition from three separate regional communications centres to a single distributed system, using the National Digital Radio System will involve five key work packages with overlapping timelines.  Necessary preparatory work is currently underway and migration will be carried out progressively in the period 2014 to 2016 , subject to the availability of finance for necessary capital expenditure.</p></reply>

It will take account of the following key contextual issues: the evolution of wind turbine technologies since the current Guidelines were published in 2006; experience to date in the application of the current Guidelines; research relating to wind turbine noise issues since the current Guidelines were adopted; Ireland's binding targets in relation to renewable energy update and penetration.</p><p>  This study will form a key input into the review of the statutory guidelines. The study is expected to be completed shortly , and this will allow for the preparation and publication of revised statutory guidelines in draft form. All statutory planning guidelines issue first in draft form for public consultation over a period of a couple of months. The indicative timetable for the publication of the draft guidelines is Quarter 1 201 4 . The draft guidelines will &ndash; like all other new or revised guidelines &ndash; be available for extensive public consultation for a period of 6 weeks to 2 months, to allow for publication of the final guidelines by mid- 2014. Once the consultation period is closed, the submissions received on the draft guidelines will be considered and taken into account in the final form of the guidelines.</p><p>  In the meantime all applications for wind energy development must be rigorously assessed in the light of the detailed advice in the 2006 guidelines.</p></reply>

The main legislative provisions that apply inside smoky coal ban areas include a ban on the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of smoky coal; a requirement to sell solid fuel in sealed bags with a printed notice; a requirement for commercial operators to maintain a register, if storing smoky coal for the purpose of placing on the market or on sale at a separate location outside the ban area; transportation of smoky coal in minimum quantities of 3 metric tonnes in Dublin or 1 tonne inside other ban areas; and retention of records by drivers of vehicles transporting smoky coal, detailing the type of fuel on board, who supplied it and to where it is being transported.</p><p>  Maps of all smoky coal ban areas are available on my Departme nt's website at the following link: </p><p>The Regulations also require that all smoky coal sold outside smoky coal ban areas for residential use outside those areas must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%. This consolidates the environmental and related human health benefits achieved by an earlier voluntary agreement with the Solid Fuel Trade Group (SFTG), representing the majority of major coal importers.   </p><p>Coal bagging operators and certain solid fuel suppliers trading in smoky coal must be registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Those who must register include all fuel wholesalers and distributors of smoky coal but only those retailers for whom 50% or more of their total annual sales proceeds are from smoky coal. However, all retailers who trade in smoky coal must ensure that their fuel wholesalers are registered with the EPA and must hold a record to this effect with their supplier's registration number.   </p></reply>

Chapter 6 of the Programme sets out policy decisions to replace town councils with a new comprehensive model of municipal governance based around principal towns to strengthen local government within counties and address weaknesses and anomalies in the current system . The recommended local electoral areas detailed in the Boundary Committee Report , published on 30 May 2013 ,   will form the basis for configuration of the new municipal districts <font color="#333333">. </font>   I understand from the Report that the Committee was mindful of the need to integrate towns and boroughs into the new governance structures when determining the local electoral areas. </p><p>  Cities and boroughs will retain mayoral status, which will also apply in the case of districts with county towns and towns over a certain population, within the new municipal district system.   </p><p>I am confident that the new governance arrangements within counties will enable councillors to represent their constituents more effectively than under current arrangements. An important benefit of the new system is that different functions will be performed by members at county and district levels. This will result in greater effectiveness than the current parallel town and county system, which involves a significant element of duplication of functions, as well as other weaknesses and anomalies.   </p><p>The division of functions between county and district levels will be determined on the basis of what is most relevant to each level. Local matters will be dealt with at municipal district level, while those of wider strategic application will be decided at county level, without duplication between county and district jurisdictions. The elected members will perform a range of important reserved functions at district level on a fully devolved basis, subject to certain requirements in relation to consistency with overall local authority policy.</p></reply>

Each such drowning is a tragedy and the effects are long lasting for the family, friends and colleagues of the victim.   </p><p>  Irish Water Safety continues to work hard in carrying out its statutory duties to raise awareness of water safety, set the standards for water safety measures and, ultimately, reduce the number of drownings in Ireland.   </p><p>  In 2012 alone ,   lifeguards who are assessed by Irish Water Safety rescued 398 persons from drowning, administered first aid to 2,809 people and reunited 319 lost children with their guardians. There were many thousands of other interventions by lifeguards that anticipated and thus prevented accidents occurring.   </p><p>My Department keeps under review the funding of all functions and agencies covered by the Department&rsquo;s Vote. Given the current difficult economic situation it is important to consider the range of innovative steps that may be taken to respond to the challenges that arise. I understand that the Council of Irish Water Safety has begun work on an emergency plan for future hot weather or heat wave events, such as occurred in July 2013. I welcome this and I will continue to work with Irish Water Safety to ensure that the resources available are used to their fullest potential and to support them   in developing responses to water safety challenges.</p></reply>

The Roadmap, which covers a wide range of areas across energy, transport, climate change, industry, commodities, agriculture, fisheries, biodiversity and regional development, sets milestones for 2020   illu strating what will be needed gradually to improve resource efficiency and sustainable growth. Each milestone indicates actions to be taken at all levels of society, including by Member States and at EU level, to commence the process in six main areas for key resources (ecosystem services; biodiversity; minerals and metals; water; air; land and soil; and marine resources) and for three key areas of economic value (food and drink; buildings; and mobility).   </p><p>The European Commission is developing, in consultation with Member States and other stakeholders, a suite of indicators that will monitor and measure progress on resource efficiency. This will include the development of a headline indicator &ndash; &ldquo;Resource Productivity&rdquo; &ndash; to measure the Roadmap&rsquo;s principal objective of improving economic performance while reducing pressure on natural resources. The EU 7 th Environment Action Programme, agreed during the Irish Presidency, contains a priority objective to turn the EU into a resource-efficient, green and competitive low-carbon economy.   </p><p>At national level, the drive for resource efficiency covers a number of sectors and areas of nisterial responsibility and a range of plans and programmes are in place which will contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Roadmap. Within my own area of responsibility, positive developments include the publication in 2012 of a number of important policy documents: Green Tenders &ndash; An Action Plan on Green Procurement; Our Sustainable Future &ndash; A Framework for Sustainable Development for Ireland ; and A Resource Opportunity &ndash; Waste Management Policy in Ireland.</p><p>  Resource efficiency is at the heart of Ireland&rsquo;s well established and successful National Waste Prevention Programme (NWPP), which promotes resource efficiency and more sustainable production and consumption behaviours.  In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has funded a large number of projects in the area of waste and resource management under its Science, Technology, Research and Innovation for the Environment (STRIVE) Programme. Further information on the many initiatives under the NWPP and STRIVE projects and research is available on the EPA&rsquo;s website - www.epa.ie.</p></reply>

A planning authority must issue a warning letter in relation to written complaints regarding unauthorised development, or other unauthorised development it becomes aware of (except in the case of trivial or minor development). There is also a statutory obligation to carry out an investigation and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued or a court order should be sought, under section 160 of the 2000 Act.  Where a planning authority establishes, following an investigation that unauthorised development (other than development that is of a trivial or minor nature) has been or is being carried out, and the person who has carried out the development has not proceeded to remedy the position, then the planning authority must issue an enforcement notice or seek a court order, unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so.</p><p>Planning authorities implement their enforcement functions by acting on complaints and/ or submissions from members of the public and by carrying out their own inspections from time to time and as appropriate.</p><p>I have no plans currently to amend the Planning Act in this regard.</p></reply>

It is my intention that   the new approach would deliver both enhanced environmental performance and a quality service for consumers.   </p><p>The waste policy also identifies the need for a review of the effectiveness of current structures as regards waste enforcement. This review is currently underway and is being led by a working group chaired by my Department and also involving the EPA, the local authorities, and other agencies with a role in enforcement. It is expected that the review will be completed by the end of the year.   </p><p>Among the measures contained in the policy, which will play an important role in the provision of effective and efficient delivery of waste management services is the reduction in the number of waste management planning regions from 10 to 3 . The County and City Managers Association has confirmed the composition of the three new Waste Management Planning Regions -   which correspond with the regional structures set out in the Government&rsquo;s Action Programme for Effective Local Government - and ratified the Lead Authorities tasked with developing new plans for   the three Waste Management Planning Regions.      </p><p>An inter - departmental working group was established under the policy to report to Government with options to minimise the impact of waste charges on low income households. The Working G roup, which comprises representatives of my Department and the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Finance; and the T&aacute;naiste's Office, submitted its second report to Government on 23 July, 2013 . Government considered the report and, given the complexity of the issues involved, the de ploy ment of further expert resources in the process is being considered with a view to the Working Group submitting a third report to Government by the end of 2013.</p></reply>

There has been a significant increase in the number of these types of projects over the last 12 to 18 months . I acknowledge that the processing of the se projects can take some time, including for reasons related to the submission of projects with insufficient documentation or with documentation that requires some level of clarification.   Each project is dealt with separately and the time required for approval varies, depending on the range and types of issues that need to be addressed.   </p><p>In the context of the project referred to in the question , the request for approval was received on 26 June 2013 and   a number of queries were submitted to the Local Development Company, Louth LEADER Partnership, during August.

The details of this scheme are avail able on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.environ.ie . There is no provision at present for the purchase of individual houses by tenants of approved housing bodies. My Department has been in consultation with the approved housing body sector regarding the development of an enabling regulatory framework to support the expanded role for the sector as envisaged in the Government&rsquo;s 2011 Housing Policy Statement . In July 2013 I published Building for the Future, a Voluntary Regulation Code for Approved Housing Bodies in Ireland   which has been developed by my Department to provide a framework within which statutory regulation of the AHB sector will be pursued. This will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged in my Department&rsquo;s housing policy statement. The Code will assist housing bodies to improve their governance, management and financial capabilities and will facilitate better oversight of the AHB sector. I expect that this framework will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners and will underline its status as a viable and attractive investment opportunity for financial institutions.</p><p>In conjunction with the development of this framework, my Department will examine a range of issues around the long-term financing of the sector. How best to use the equity accrued in approved housing body housing stock to, for instance, leverage additional new supply will be considered; the sale of existing stock to tenants is one of a range of options in this regard.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No.2) Bill 2012 provides for the extension of the provisions of the Act to the not-for-profit approved housing body sector, which will bring an estimated 20,000 additional tenancies within the remit of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB). The Board will be re-named, as the word &lsquo;Private&rsquo; will be removed from its name. This Bill represents a significant further evolutionary step in the development of the rented sector and underpins the concept of tenure neutrality that was outlined in the Government&rsquo;s 2011 Housing Policy Statement  . </p><p>The Bill was published on 19 July 2012 and   was passed by the D&aacute;il in July 2013.

Based on the total vehicle fleet of some 2.4m vehicles, that percentage would equate to 120,000 vehicles.</p><p>  I have recently introduced changes to the procedures for declaring vehicles of the road which will mean that, from 1 October 2013, the facility to declare that a vehicle was off the road for a period when the vehicle is next being taxed will cease. Owners will have to notify licensing authorities in advance of the vehicle being taken off the road, or alternatively pay arrears when next taxing their vehicle. The introduction of a similar system in the United Kingdom saw evasion rates there reduce from 5% to under 1%. I will be closely monitoring the impact of the new procedures with a view to examining what further action may be necessary to reduce motor tax evasion to the lowest level possible.</p></reply>

Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014 the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund. In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing. </p><p>The Government has indicated an intention to move, from 2014, to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised. The remaining 20% of the Tax collected nationally will be re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of General Purpose Grants. The approach used to allocate the 20% of Local Property Tax revenue available for equalisation will depend on factors such as overall yield and yields at individual local authority level. The priority will be to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases.   </p><p>The Government decided that the relevant Departments would consider the balance of taxation and spending measures necessary to support the intention to move to 80% local retention of the Local Property Tax.   A working group comprising a number of Departments, including my own, is examining the issues involved ,   and relevant decisions in respect of local government funding in 2014 will be taken in the context of Budget 2014.   </p><p>I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates. A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.   </p><p>Placing the local government sector on a more sustainable financial footing is an important objective of the changes to the funding of the local authorities .   I am satisfied that the changes which are currently underway will deliver a model of funding which is sustainable in the broadest sense into the long-term.</p></reply>

Examples of this include the publication in March of this year by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (done in conjunction with the PSNI, IPSO and IBF) of a guide to fraud prevention entitled &quot; Be Aware Beat Fraud&quot;. and both the Garda and IPSO websites contain links with information on crime prevention methods in this regard. </p><p>  Furthermore An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation Payment Card Unit, continues to co-operate with the various international police forces and agencies, including Europol and Interpol to target online fraud. </p><p>  Work is also undertaken by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources through its Make IT Secure Campaign, which is fully supported by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which aims to improve the awareness of risks arising from increased use of IT in everyday life.  In addition, IPSO maintains statistics in relation to payment fraud, issues regular alerts of card fraud scams and provides advice to consumers and businesses in relation to how to keep their payments and financial information secure. The Irish Bankers Federation also provides fraud prevention tips to consumers through publications such as its Guard your Cards booklet. </p><p>  Regarding the issue raised concerning information being made available to online retailers regarding suspected or actual fraudulent activity, I can say that while any exchange of information would have to have regard to data protection legislation, section 94 of the European Communities (Payment Service) Regulations, 2009 provides for appropriate processing of personal data by a payment system or service provider for the purposes of the prevention, investigation and detection of payment fraud.</p><p>  In terms of the nature and extent of this type of fraud, I am advised that the Irish Payment Services Organisation Ltd (IPSO) website identifies that following an estimated increase of payment card fraud of 24% year on year from 2009 to 2011, card fraud has decreased by 21% in the value of fraud losses in 2012 compared to the preceding year.  It is estimated that an approximate total of &euro;20.4 million was lost to fraud on Irish issued payment cards (including credit, debit and ATM cards) in 2012. This compares with an equivalent estimated figure of &euro;25.7 million worth of losses recorded in 2011. However, I am also informed that the instances of online fraud involving the use of payment cards against retailers who engage in the sale of goods on the internet has increased for a number of factors including the increased use of the internet as a point of sale for retailers and the increased usage and availability of payment cards.  </p><p>  In response to this, members of the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation engage with IPSO and the IBF on an ongoing basis on the latest forms of fraudulent attacks. Where new fraud trends are identified they are immediately distributed to the various fraud forums in place including retailer associations and via media reports. The use of secure payments systems and maintenance of up to date anti-fraud protocols can prove extremely effective in preventing retailers becoming a victim of such fraud. </p><p>Finally I would stress that retailers and consumers must be as proactive as possible in all of this area and ensure that they avail of the existing security and fraud prevention measures and  advices when making payments online by only using secure online payment methods and by promptly reporting unauthorised transactions immediately to their bank all of which is vital in counteracting online fraud<b>. </b>  Where fraud does occur it should be brought to the attention of Garda authorities who have my full support in targeting such fraudulent activity.</p></reply>

This is evidenced by the visa waiver programme for holders of certain categories of UK visa, which this Government introduced in July 2011.  In the twelve months following the introduction of the programme, visits from the countries covered by it increased by 21% over the preceding twelve months.  The Government has also taken other steps to make the visa process easier including making greater use of multi-entry visas for regular tourist and business visitors from targeted markets including China, the UAE and Russia. </p><p>  Building on these measures, work is ongoing on the development of short-stay Common Travel Area (CTA) visa arrangements which would allow tourists and business visitors to travel to the CTA, with first arrival in either jurisdiction, and thereafter to travel freely both within the island of Ireland and between Ireland and the UK. In other words the outer perimeter of the CTA would operate, to quote the Deputy's own words, like a mini-schengen and represent a historic breakthrough in the manner the CTA operates.  It is planned for the roll-out of such a visa to take place in mid-2014.  Prior to its introduction, the necessary technical and operational arrangements, including the capture of biometrics for visa applicants, needs to be put in place between the two jurisdictions.  These initiatives have been universally welcomed by tourism bodies and tour operators particularly those operating in emerging markets.</p><p>  Ireland has not applied to participate in those aspects of the Schengen Aquis that provide for the abolition of internal border checks. This decision has been taken to maintain the CTA with the UK which remains a priority for Ireland.  The population of the island of Ireland are Irish citizens and a significant proportion of people in Northern Ireland identify themselves as such and carry an Irish passport.  The operation of the CTA facilitates citizens of Ireland and of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to move freely within the CTA.  Of course, nationals of the European Union as well as Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland enjoy extensive free movement rights as a matter of EU law and the operation of the CTA does not interfere with these rights.  </p><p>  The fact remains that the CTA could not continue to operate if Ireland were to participate in the Schengen agreement on border controls while the United Kingdom did not.  To do so would result in a situation where the land border with Northern Ireland would become the external border of the Schengen area.  Ireland would be required to apply the Schengen agreement provisions on the external border and to impose systematic checks and monitoring on all persons travelling to Ireland from the UK by air, sea and land.  This is obviously something that no Irish Government would seriously contemplate.  The reality is that we cannot operate a common travel area with the UK and unilaterally be part of the Schengen zone at the same time.</p></reply>

This process has already commenced.</p><p>  At my request the National Disability Authority (NDA) facilitated consultations with the Deaf Society in Ireland and submissions were received from them in relation to actions that could make improvements in the lives of deaf people.  Those submissions were considered for inclusion where possible and appropriate in the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan which was published in July 2013 on the Department of Justice website.  The National Disability Strategy is a whole-of-Government approach to advancing the social inclusion of people with disabilities.</p><p>  In line with the policy of mainstreaming, sign language is reflected in the responsibility of several Ministers.  Policy in the area of language for people with disabilities is reflected in the Education Act 1998 (learning through Irish Sign Language), the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 (language assessment) and the Disability Act 2005 (Code of Practice on Accessibility of Public Service and Information provided by Public Bodies).  In addition the Sign Language Interpreting Service (SLIS) is provided for under the Citizens Information Board.  With regard to EU Directive 2010/64/EU on the right to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings, Ireland's existing arrangements for translation and interpretation already meet, in practice, the requirements of the Directive.</p><p>  It must be pointed out however, that there are no plans to recognise ISL as Ireland's third official language.  It is mechanisms for the further promotion and recognition of ISL that are being examined, in consultation with The Deaf Society, so that an agreed platform can be reached in relation to the form of recognition that is possible.</p><p>  The existing legislation in Ireland gives a level of recognition and practical measures equal to, or above that, in countries which have formally recognised sign language.</p></reply>

In relation to civil legal aid, it should be noted the demand for legal services from the Legal Aid Board (&ldquo;the Board&rdquo;) has increased significantly since the down-turn in the economy.  While there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand for general legal services (excluding asylum) in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006.  Demand across the organisation in 2013 is running at the same level as it was in 2012.  Demand for services at Nenagh Law Centre has remained relatively high. In the 12 months to the 1 September 2013 it received 629 new applications. In common with the vast majority of the Board&rsquo;s law centres it is a relatively small office staff wise.  At the moment there are approximately 114 persons awaiting a triage appointment in Nenagh while there are approximately 77 persons who have had a triage appointment and are awaiting further services. I can also advise the Deputy that as of 1 September 2013 there were approximately 5,383 persons nationwide who were awaiting legal services from the Board. A significant number of these will have had a first appointment with a solicitor (see the first bullet below in relation to the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach).</p><p>The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid at the same level for 2013 as it was in 2012 (and 2011).  Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery. The Public Appointments Service concluded a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board earlier this year from which a number of permanent appointments have been made and a number of temporary positions have also been filled.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, on 12 September 2013, I signed into law a new statutory instrument in respect of civil legal aid provided by the Legal Aid Board which, inter alia, provides for an increased contribution from persons availing of the services offered by the Board.  I intend for any funds raised by these measures to be retained by the Board to better fund the provision of services to those in need of them and reduce waiting times for those services.  At a time when the State is facing significant demands on its resources an increase in contributions allows the Board to achieve its objectives without money being diverted from other programmes. The increased contributions should result in increased funding of up to &euro;700,000 per annum being available to the Board once the increases have full impact.</p><p>I believe this additional resource for the Board will assist it in tackling those waiting times.  I am conscious that the increase in the minimum contribution as a percentage is significant.  However, I believe the contributions payable still compare favourably with other jurisdictions.  Provisions remain in place to allow the contribution to be waived in hardship cases.  In response to the changed environment the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services.  Those steps include the following:</p><p>- The Board has been piloting a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage.  The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times. The aim of the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes).  If the applicant requires further services they remain on the &lsquo;waiting list&rsquo;.  There is or has been a &lsquo;backlog&rsquo; of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month.  A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were satisfied with this particular service initiative.  This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved.</p><p>- In August 2012 the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres. This is a &lsquo;start to end&rsquo; system which will in the medium term deliver efficiencies in terms of the administration aspect as well as in relation to the delivery of the legal services. It will take time for the full benefits of this system to materialise.</p><p>- In November 2011 I transferred responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded family mediation service to the Board.  A key reason for this transferring was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law).  Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common.  Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House (where the Dublin District Family Court sits) involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service located there also. Similar initiatives have now been introduced in Cork and Naas and are being evaluated;</p><p>- While the Board&rsquo;s asylum related legal services were previously funded from a separate grant, since 2012 I have funded the Board on the basis of a single &lsquo;grant-in-aid&rsquo;.  With the drop in demand for asylum, the Board has taken steps to integrate the delivery of its asylum related services into the general law centre service delivery model thus effectively transferring resources from the asylum area to the general legal service area where the demands have increased;</p><p>- I am aware that the Board has maintained a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court. Cases in the District Court are often those that need the most immediate remedy;</p><p>- I am also aware that the Board continues to engage with other key players in the justice / legal area such as the Courts Service and the Health Service Executive, with a view to trying to ensure that State funded resources that impact on its area of business are used to best effect.</p><p>I am very conscious of the difficulties that delays in accessing legal aid can give rise to and I am aware that the Board is also keenly aware of those difficulties and is working to ensure the delays are minimised to the greatest extent possible.  I understand that if an applicant is a respondent in court proceedings and the Board is not in a position to provide representation before the next court date, the person is furnished with a letter confirming details of his application for legal services and the anticipated time when he or she will be given an appointment.  The person is advised to attend court and present this letter to the Judge.  The following table sets out the waiting times as of the 1 September 2013 for centres not operating the triage approach (second column) and the waiting times for centres operating the triage approach (third and fourth column).  The fourth column indicates the additional time that a person who has had a triage appointment is likely to have to wait for a second consultation.  The Board does not calculate &lsquo;average&rsquo; waiting times.  The waiting times can go up and down, largely depending on demand.</p><p><b>Waiting times at law centres on the 1 September 2013</b></p><p></p><p><table><tr><th>Law Centre</th><th>General - Law centres not operating triage <br /><br />(months)</th><th>Waiting time<br />for a triage appointment <br /><br />(months)</th><th>Further waiting time where triage appointment previously given <br /><br />(months)</th></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Brunswick St</td><td>-</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Finglas</td><td>-</td><td>10</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Gardiner St</td><td>-</td><td>0</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Popes Quay</td><td>-</td><td>9</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>South Mall</td><td>14</td><td>-</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Athlone</td><td>-</td><td>4</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Castlebar</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Ennis</td><td>15</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Galway- Francis St</td><td>-</td><td>7</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Galway - Seville H</td><td>-</td><td>0</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Letterkenny</td><td>-</td><td>10</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>10</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>-</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Navan</td><td>-</td><td>5</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Nenagh</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Newbridge</td><td>-</td><td>6</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td>-</td><td>7</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>-</td><td>3</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Tralee</td><td>6</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Tullamore</td><td>6</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>7</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>9</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>8</td></tr></table></p><p></p></reply>

The person concerned has no application for residency pending and there is no evidence that the person's passport was seized by the Irish Naturalisation and  Immigration Service.  The person concerned has had his case considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended and under Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended. Refoulement was not found to be an issue in this case. In addition, no issue arises under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice (UN Convention against Torture) Act, 2000. Consideration was also given to private and family rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).</p><p>  The Deportation Order was signed on 3 May 2012. One of the requirements of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must present to the Garda National Immigration Bureau on an appointed date, to date the person concerned has not presented and is therefore classed as an evader. The person concerned remains in the State illegally.</p><p>  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State. The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

The Garda authorities are extremely aware of the concerns which exist on the part of many elderly persons as to their safety in their homes and are responding through a range of enforcement, prevention and community policy measures.</p><p>  In particular, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented a robust and effective response to the incidence of burglary and aggravated burglary, especially through Operation Fiacla which is focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries.  Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda Region to target suspect offenders.  As of 31 August, 6,329 persons have been arrested and 3,541 persons have been charged with burglary offences under Operation Fiacla. The latest quarterly figures from the Central Statistics Office for burglary show a welcome reduction of 9.1% in burglary and related offences which is a clear demonstration of the effectiveness of the measures which the Garda Commissioner has put in place to successfully disrupt those who seek to prey on law abiding householders.</p><p>  In so far as the particular needs and concerns of the elderly are concerned, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Older People Strategy was launched in 2010.  The Garda Older People strategy promotes actions including the development of effective communication links between Garda&iacute; and older people, the delivery of proactive, timely and effective responses by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for older people, actions to increase trust and confidence by lessening the fear of crime, and indicators to determine and respond to the needs and expectations of older people on an ongoing basis.</p><p>  These objectives are pursued through various community policing initiatives and crime prevention programmes carried out in partnership with local communities such as Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert. There are currently in excess of 3,700 Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert  groups established countrywide. The Garda authorities indicate that there is a significant willingness amongst the public to participate in such initiatives which help to promote responsible community involvement and assist in promoting good crime prevention practice.</p><p>  I should also mention the Crime Prevention Ambassadors initiative which was recently set up with pilot schemes currently operating in the Cavan/Monaghan and Meath Garda Divisions. This initiative is delivered in partnership with the Aging Well Network and Community Alert and involves older persons in given communities volunteering to act as Crime Prevention Ambassadors within their local areas. Each Crime Prevention Ambassador is provided with a resource pack which includes crime prevention literature and briefings from Crime Prevention Officers and Community Garda&iacute; to equip them with the necessary knowledge which they in turn disseminate within local communities.  Of course crime prevention advice specifically for the older persons is also available directly from all Garda stations, or to download on the Garda Website .</p><p>  Another example of the practical measures being taken under the strategy are the Caller Cards issued under the Bogus Caller Card Initiative to all Garda Divisions for distribution amongst older persons groups and individuals. The Caller Cards resulted from a best practice study under the Garda Older Person Strategy. The initiative provides older people with printed Caller Cards to give to callers offering a service from door to door, requesting them to leave their contact details so that they can get back to them if they require that service. The initiative is intended to empower the older person to take control of these situations and discourages bogus callers.  The Garda authorities have my full support in this ongoing work to respond to the needs and concerns of older people and to confront crime in all its forms.  I have every confidence that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to deliver an effective police service which meets the needs of all in our community, including older people.</p></reply>

The Fund was originally drawn from the National Lottery surplus but, as with other National Lottery funded subheads, it is now drawn also from exchequer funds.  The decision was taken in 2012, because of the urgent need to make savings in Government expenditure, that this Scheme could not be sustained in the current circumstances.   Beneficiaries were advised in October 2012 that it would be phased out on a gradual basis over a 3 year period, with the first reduction taking effect in late 2013. This is   in order to give affected organisations, including the Asthma Society of Ireland, as much time as possible to adjust to the change and to consider how they may increase the funding they receive through other fundraising projects.  As the decision to phase out the Scheme is currently the subject of a legal proceedings initiated by The Rehab Group and Rehab Lotteries, I am not in a position to meet organisations or comment further at this time.</p></reply>

The debate on each of these topics is summarised as follows.</p><p><b>Immigration and Asylum</b></p><p>The first item discussed was the Commission's fourth Annual Report on Immigration and Asylum which sets out the main developments in this area at EU level and within Member States.  Ministers were asked to discuss a number of questions, <i>viz</i>  : how the EU's migration policies could best assist economic recovery and growth and how the contribution of migrants could be maximised; whether greater intra-EU mobility opportunities for third country nationals could help to ensure a workforce that is better able to respond to market needs; and what the Council's priorities should be in light of the report's findings. </p><p>  There was general agreement that while legal migration - and particularly that of highly qualified workers - should be promoted, the existing labour force in the EU should also be utilised to the maximum extent.  It was emphasised that EU migration policy should be based on labour market needs.  Ministers also agreed on the importance of concluding negotiations on the several 'live' proposals concerning legal migration.  </p><p>  In the asylum area, ministers welcomed the agreement that the Irish Presidency had brokered on the Common European Asylum System.  It was also agreed that solidarity between Member States should be further encouraged, and that an effective returns policy, including the proper implementation of existing readmission agreements, should be ensured by all parties.</p><p><b>Syria</b></p><p>  The next item discussed was the situation of persons displaced to neighbouring countries as a result of the conflict in Syria.  Ministers expressed deep concern at this humanitarian crisis and welcomed the Commission's initiative of developing a Regional Protection Programme and a comprehensive assistance package.  It was agreed that the resettlement of refugees, while important, should not be the sole means of alleviating the crisis and that the neighbouring countries should receive additional supports.  Ministers also agreed that Syrian refugees who have already entered the EU should, in comparable situations, be assessed in the same way in all Member States.  </p><p><b>Cybersecurity </b></p><p>Discussion on this topic acknowledged the huge benefits of digital technology but also the increasing rate of cybersecurity incidents which pose a threat to EU governments, businesses and citizens.  Ministers were asked to discuss how co-operation could be strengthened to prevent such incidents, and what measures could be taken to enhance the capacity of law enforcement authorities to tackle this scourge.  Ministers welcomed the debate as timely and expressed strong support for an integrated approach to include improved information-sharing, training, and strategic partnerships with the private sector, with third countries and with other key stakeholders. The importance of co-ordinated actions was emphasised along with the need for concrete measures to improve co-operation, including examining the issue of criminal sanctions.  </p><p><b>Future development of the JHA area</b></p><p>Discussions on this topic focused on the successor to the Stockholm Programme, which ends in 2014.  Ministers were asked to debate the changes in the area of freedom, security and justice since the adoption of the Stockholm Programme in 2009; which strategic priorities should be identified for the next multi-annual programme; and which principles should guide this work (including whether the policy and financial cycles should be aligned).</p><p>Ministers agreed, <i>inter alia</i>  , that the next programme should be strategic in focus and avoid a long catalogue of actions; should provide for fast and effective responses to crisis situations; should build on lessons learned from the current programme; and should be linked to the budgetary cycle.  It was considered that relevant agencies should also be consulted.  </p><p><b>Data Protection reform</b></p><p>Finally, Ministers debated the role of the European Data Protection Board as provided for in the draft Data Protection Regulation.  There was broad support for the proposed Board as one of the main vehicles for achieving a more coherent and streamlined application of data protection standards across the Union.  However, it was concluded that the Board's powers should be the subject of further deliberations at Council Working Party level. </p></reply>

However, there is a comprehensive legislative regime in place to deal with matters such as the interception of telecommunications and the retention of communications related data.

I wish to inform the Deputy that, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions, which include the provision of accommodation for court sittings.</p><p>  I am informed that the Courts Service in considering any venue for closure undertakes a cost analysis exercise which includes an assessment of the costs associated with the holding of court sittings in a court venue over a 12 month period.   I am informed that while the assessment would not cover the cost of the number of hours Garda&iacute; from Swinford and Ballyhaunis would be expected to spend in Castlebar Court for District Court sittings, the cost analysis includes an assessment of the net Garda travel and subsistence costs based on Garda attendances at the venue identified for closure when compared with the proposed alternative venue calculated over the number of sittings held over a period of 3 months and extrapolated over a 12 month period; the travel and subsistence costs for courts staff attending the identified venue when compared with the alternative venue; the travel and subsistence costs for the permanently assigned Judge to the relevant District; additional legal aid costs arising from the holding of the court sittings over the 3 month period extrapolated over a 12 month period and operational costs associated with the identified venue over a 12 month period e.g. Courthouses maintenance, light, heat &amp;amp; fuel.</p><p>  I am informed that the closure of Swinford Courthouse would yield estimated annual savings of &euro;7,598 for the Courts Service, while the net exchequer savings will amount to &euro;3,206 per annum. The closure of Ballyhaunis Courthouse  would yield estimated annual savings of &euro;5,148 for the Courts Service, while the net exchequer savings will amount to &euro;1,325 per annum. Additionally, as part of the detailed assessment undertaken, the Office of Public Works were requested to undertake an assessment of the condition of both Swinford and Ballyhaunis Courthouses. I am informed that their report indicated that Swinford required immediate remedial works at a cost of circa &euro;60,000 with an equivalent cost of circa &euro;134,000 for Ballyhaunis. Their report also indicated that both Courthouses would require further works in a 3 &ndash; 5 year time period at a total estimated cost of &euro;170,000.</p><p>  As you are aware, during the course of 2012 the Courts Service completed a comprehensive review of all venues throughout the country. The purpose of this review was to establish a framework within which venues could be considered for closure taking account of a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc. Each venue identified for consideration for closure was the subject of a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case. During this assessment and the preparation of the business case, the question of the availability or otherwise of public transport between the identified venues and the proposed alternative venues was considered. This methodology was followed in the case of both Swinford and Ballyhaunis. The Building Committee and the Courts Service Board were informed that there was a limited public transport service between Swinford/Ballyhaunis and Castlebar. Additionally the issue of public transport between both venues and Castlebar was specifically referenced in some submissions made to the Courts Service during the assessment process and I am informed that a copy of every submission/representation received was circulated to each member of the board in advance of the meeting on 1st July 2013 when the Courts Service Board made the decision to close both Swinford and Ballyhaunis Courthouses.</p></reply>

Since then, two programmes of statute law restatement, involving more than 110 restatements, have already been completed and are available on the Commission's web site (<i>www.lawreform.ie</i>).

The Referendum on the Court of Appeal is due to be held on 4 October next.  In the event that the Referendum is passed the changes to the Constitution contained in the Bill will take effect in accordance with the provisions in the Bill.</p><p>  As regards the issues raised by the Deputy, the following is the position:</p><p>-The President of the High Court's ex-officio membership of the Supreme Court is provided for in the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act 1961 rather than in the Constitution.  It is the Government's intention that the President of the High Court will continue to be an ex-officio member of the Supreme Court.</p><p>-The Bill does not provide for any change to the President of the High Court's ex-officio membership of the Council of State.  Instead, the Bill provides for the amendment of Article 31.2.i to include the President of the Court of Appeal as an additional ex-officio member of the Council of State.</p><p>-If the Referendum is passed, there will be one Court of Appeal which will deal with both civil and criminal appeals.  </p><p>-The Bill provides for the deletion of the one-judgment rule contained in Article 34.4.5.

The marriage or civil partnership must be subsisting and recognised under Irish law. Section 15A provides that the Minister may waive certain conditions for naturalisation if satisfied that the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.</p><p>  Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons. </p><p>  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended.

The McAleese committee was set up to establish the facts regarding Magdalen laundries and following on from that the Government decided to establish a scheme of benefits on the lines recommended by Judge Quirke. </p><p>  In looking into the issues raised relating to the Bethany Home I and Minister of State Lynch met with the Bethany Survivors Group this year.  Many of the issues raised by the group fell outside the remit of my Department.  However, I informed the group that I would consider the matter in consultation with my cabinet colleagues and revert back to them. This has been done and unfortunately the members of the group are disappointed with the outcome.  </p><p>  The main demand of the Bethany Group is to be included in the Residential Institutions Redress Scheme which falls under the remit of the Minister for Education and Skills.

The position is unchanged since then.</p><p>  I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the person concerned is the subject of a Deportation Order and is therefore illegally present in the State.</p><p>  The person concerned arrived in the  State on 15 May 2000 claiming to be from South Africa and claimed asylum.  Her asylum claim was refused on the grounds of credibility. A Deportation Order was signed on 23 September, 2002. By letter dated 8 November, 2002 the person concerned was informed that she was required to present to the Garda National Immigration Bureau on 15 November, 2002 to make arrangements for her deportation. She failed to present and was classed as an evader. </p><p>  In 2009 the person concerned made an application for a residence card on the basis of her marriage to an EU national and was given permission to remain in the State while this was considered. In 2010 the person concerned was informed that this application was unsuccessful as she had failed to demonstrate that her EU spouse was exercising his EU Treaty Rights in accordance with the requirements of the Regulation.</p><p>  In 2011 the person concerned made a second asylum claim and when it was discovered that she was a dual applicant the application was withdrawn.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the asylum application of the person concerned was fairly and comprehensively examined. The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside the State. The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau. </p><p>  As a matter of policy, I do not intend to reward persons who have failed a very fair, thorough and comprehensive asylum process, and who have then proceeded to evade their deportation.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Local Garda management is aware of anti-social behaviour and criminal activity in the area and, most recently, has introduced a new Policing Plan in response to this type of criminality.  The Plan came into effect from 1 August 2013 and includes dedicated patrols in the area at key times. I am advised that the Plan has had a positive impact in addressing anti-social behaviour in the area and has been the subject of favourable comment by local elected representatives, Dublin City Council and local residents groups since its implementation.  In addition to the measures contained in the Plan, the area is patrolled regularly by uniform and plain clothes patrols, augmented by the Divisional Traffic Unit and Task Force. The area continues to receive high visibility patrolling by the Community Policing Unit based at Coolock.</p><p>  Local Garda Management closely monitors the Policing Plan, and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the community in the area to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public. The situation will be kept under review and paramount consideration given to the needs of residents. </p><p>  I am assured that Garda management is satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing service is being delivered to the area concerned.</p></reply>

Garda vetting disclosures are issued to specified organisations registered with the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for that purpose in respect of a particular post or employment.  The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012 and expects to receive in the region of 350,000 applications by the end of 2013. </p><p>  The disclosure is made to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.  </p><p>  Each time a new vetting application is received, a full vetting check is conducted to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. The non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the certificate protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service. It also affords the registered organisation the facility to assess suitability based on the most up to date information available on the applicant. The Deputy will appreciate that the safety of children and vulnerable adults is the primary consideration and this must remain the case.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is approximately 9 weeks from date of receipt. However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  In the interest of fairness and equity, Garda vetting applications are processed in chronological order based on the date of receipt in the GCVU.</p><p>  All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.  </p><p>  It is essential that the GCVU has the resources required to perform this most critical of roles effectively and I have given this matter particular priority. In that regard I have been actively engaged with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. As a result of that engagement, I am pleased to say that the Commissioner has confirmed to me that there are now 134 whole-time equivalent staff (130 civilians and 4 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) assigned to the GCVU, some 41 of whom have been redeployed from elsewhere in the public service since the end of March 2013. Some of these redeployed staff have only recently completed their training in the vetting process, and the full impact of their work will be seen in the coming weeks. Furthermore, I have also recently received sanction for the redeployment of 40 additional staff to the GCVU. This brings the total number of staff in that service to over 170 which, when compared to the average staff allocation of 78 at the Unit over the past two and a half years, represents an increase of 117%.</p><p>  Development of an e-Vetting solution is underway. This will facilitate the processing of all applications in an e-format, thus removing the time-consuming current process of manually managing all applications received . The initial phase of testing this e-vetting system will take place in the fourth quarter of 2013.  When this is achieved, this system will streamline the overall vetting process in this jurisdiction, and further contribute to reductions in processing times for all vetting applications. </p></reply>

The allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. However, I am assured that as part of road traffic enforcement policy in the area, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carry out planned and 'ad hoc' checkpoints as required, including mandatory alcohol testing (MAT) checkpoints.  In addition, all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are tasked with the enforcement of relevant legislation, including the Road Traffic Acts and persons found engaging in dangerous driving are dealt with in accordance with the law.  Specific operations are also conducted targeting anti-social driving behaviour based on analysis of the incidence and location of such behaviour.  Garda management closely monitor all patrols and other road traffic strategies in place, with a view to meeting the policing needs of the communities in question, including to address speeding and anti-social driving, and with a view to reducing the number of fatal and serious injuries on our roads.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p></reply>

Under then existing arrangements a local district court clerk arranged for a person granted citizenship to take an oath before a District Court Judge and the new citizen subsequently received their Certificate of Naturalisation by post.  In addition to arranging dedicated ceremonies with appropriate dignity and recognition of what a major and important event it is to become an Irish citizen, the introduction since March 2011 of citizenship ceremonies has prevented the build up of a huge strain on court time due to the large increase in the number of decisions made on naturalisation applications.</p><p>  A total of 77 ceremonies have been held to date involving a total of 38,400 persons.  A further ceremony day planned to take place on 21 October 2013.  72 of the ceremonies have taken place in Dublin, while 2 were held in Templemore in August 2011, 2 in Cork in December 2011 and 1 in the INIS offices in Tipperary Town in November 2012. </p><p>  The average ceremony cost to date, excluding staff and processing costs, is just over &euro;4 per applicant with recent large scale ceremonies costing under &euro;4 per applicant.  While ascribing a precise cost to the previous system of naturalisation is difficult at this remove, the indications are that this was significantly more costly given that it involved the diversion of court time and facilities as well as postage costs.  Moreover, as mentioned above, the courts system would have been overwhelmed by the volume of cases which have been approved in the past two and a half years.</p><p>  Attending a citizenship ceremony is free for all naturalisation applicants and their guests, while providing a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship. </p></reply>

Those refused or deemed ineligible amounted to 1800, 1,600 and 700 respectively.  There has been an enormous increase in the volume of applications for a certificate of naturalisation in recent years.  In 2008 the number of valid applications made was just over 9,000 whereas the total number of valid applications received for 2011, 2012 and to end of August this year were 18,300, 19,900 and 12,500 respectively. </p><p>  Clearly, the dramatic increase in volume impacted on the capacity of the administrative system to process them and gave rise to a large volume of cases on hand and to a situation where most cases were taking well over two years to complete.

Over 80% of standard applications are now being decided within 6 months, a remarkable achievement given the 120% increase in application levels since 2008, when processing times were more than 4 times longer.  The total number of applications awaiting a decision currently stands at 9,000, which is less than the total number of new applications received over a 6 month period.</p></reply>

The programme comprises group interventions in three modules and allows responsive and flexible delivery of rehabilitation services which take account of individual risk, needs and capacity. </p><p>  The programme is provided by a team of psychologists who have developed specific expertise in clinical practice including assessment and therapeutic work with men convicted of sexual offences. </p><p>  The Baseline Project is a joint initiative between the Northside Inter Agency Project (NIAP) and the IPS Psychology Service which provides group programmes for young offenders in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution with a history of sexually harmful behaviour.  It also continues work into the community for those with convictions for sexual offences. </p><p>  The group programmes are rolling programmes with new participants joining and others leaving groups in response to progress.  Time for completion does vary from individual to individual. </p><p>  Not all sex offenders are suited to group programmes and other prison-based therapeutic interventions include one-to-one interventions. Sex offenders also engage with other services in order to address other related needs, such as mental health needs.  </p><p>  The Building Better Lives programme has the capacity to provide interventions to up to 60 prisoners. Since its inception in January 2009 to the end of August 2013, 343 offenders have been assessed by the Psychology Service for participation in the programme and 141 offenders have actually participated. Currently, 27 offenders are engaged in the BBL programme. </p><p>  While offenders can be supported and encouraged in their efforts to address their offending behaviour, ultimately successful completion of an intervention programme depends on the willing participation and commitment of appropriately motivated individuals. It is not possible to force an individual to engage in psychological intervention against their will. </p><p>  I would  also like to advise that the Probation Service engages with sex offenders in individual work throughout the course of their sentence.  This work primarily focuses on reducing the risk posed by the individual following release and also on child protection issues which may arise.  </p></reply>

The Bill provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for the introduction of a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other grounds presented by applicants seeking to remain in the State and also provides for a Protection Review Tribunal. At the same time, in keeping with the commitment given in the Programme for Government, consideration is being given to a statutory appeals system in the immigration area and the model considered most appropriate to this jurisdiction. </p><p>  Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing in the area of international protection, I am introducing new arrangements for the processing of subsidiary protection applications in light of recent judgments in the Superior Courts.  My Department, in consultation with the Attorney General's Office, is developing a new legislative and administrative framework for the processing of current and future subsidiary protection applications. This work which is being given high priority is close to completion and applicants will be advised of the new arrangements as soon as possible.</p><p>  As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality,  it is my considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members, including that of a streamlined, single application procedure and that of an appropriate appeals procedure. This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee. Work on the Bill continues, therefore, on that basis, including in cooperation with the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General while also taking account of any relevant rulings by the Courts. By necessity work on Trioka-related legislation such as the establishment of the Insolvency Service and reform of the delivery of legal services has been a priority for my Department. Pending the completion of this legislative workload, I expect that work on the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill will be advanced to enable it to be published as soon as resources allow. </p></reply>

While there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand for general legal services (excluding asylum) in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006. Demand in 2013 is running at the same level as it was in 2012. The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid at the same level for 2013 as it was in 2012 (and 2011).</p><p>Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in lengthened waiting times for those seeking legal services for matters that are not prioritised. Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery. The Public Appointments Service concluded a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board earlier this year from which a number of permanent appointments have been made and a number of temporary positions have also been filled.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, on 12 September 2013, I signed into law a new statutory instrument in respect of civil legal aid provided by the Legal Aid Board which, inter alia, provides for an increased contribution from persons availing of the services offered by the Board.</p><p>I intend for any funds raised by these measures to be retained by the Board to better fund the provision of services to those in need of them and reduce waiting times for those services. At a time when the State is facing significant demands on its resources an increase in contributions allows the Board to achieve its objectives without money being diverted from other programmes. The increased contributions should result in increased funding of up to &euro;700,000 per annum being available to the Board once the increases have full impact.</p><p>I believe this additional resource for the Board will assist it in tackling those waiting times. I am conscious that the increase in the minimum contribution as a percentage is significant.  However, I believe the contributions payable still compare favourably with other jurisdictions. Provisions remain in place to allow the contribution to be waived in hardship cases.</p><p>In response to the changed environment the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services. Those steps include the following:</p><p>The Board has been piloting a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage. The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times. The aim of the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes). If the applicant requires further services they remain on the &lsquo;waiting list&rsquo;. There is or has been a &lsquo;backlog&rsquo; of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month. A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were satisfied with this particular service initiative. This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved. (I have included below a table showing the waiting times for non-prioritised matters at the Board&rsquo;s law centres. It will be noted that most of the centres are operating the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach. For particular reasons a small number are only initiating the process now).</p><p>In August 2012 the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres. This is a &lsquo;start to end&rsquo; system which will in the medium term deliver efficiencies in terms of the administration aspect as well as in relation to the delivery of the legal services. It will take time for the full benefits of this system to materialise.</p><p>In November 2011 I transferred responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded family mediation service to the Board. A key reason for this transferring was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common. Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House (where the Dublin District Family Court sits) involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service located there also. Similar initiatives have now been introduced in Cork and Naas and are being evaluated.</p><p>While the Board&rsquo;s asylum related legal services were previously funded from a separate grant, since 2012 I have funded the Board on the basis of a single &lsquo;grant-in-aid&rsquo;. With the drop in demand for asylum, the Board has taken steps to integrate the delivery of its asylum related services into the general law centre service delivery model thus effectively transferring resources from the asylum area to the general legal service area where the demands have increased.</p><p>I am aware that the Board has maintained a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court.  Cases in the District Court are often those that need the most immediate remedy.</p><p>I am also aware that the Board continues to engage with other key players in the justice / legal area such as the Courts Service and the Health Service Executive, with a view to trying to ensure that State funded resources that impact on its area of business are used to best effect.</p><p>Finally, the table below outlines the waiting period (in months), up to 1 September 2013, for persons awaiting a first or second consultation at the various Law Centres in the State, and may be of assistance to the Deputy.</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Law Centre</b></th><th><b>Waiting times (months) *</b><br /><br /><b>General - Law centres not operating triage</b></th><th><b>Waiting times (months) **</b><br /><br /><b> for a triage appointment</b></th><th><b>Further waiting time (months) ***</b><br /><br /><b>wherLaw Cee triage appointment previously given</b></th></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown</td><td><b>3</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>-</b></td></tr><tr><td>Brunswick St</td><td>-</td><td><b>4</b></td><td><b>5</b></td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td>-</td><td><b>1</b></td><td><b>13</b></td></tr><tr><td>Finglas</td><td>-</td><td><b>10</b></td><td><b>5</b></td></tr><tr><td>Gardiner St</td><td>-</td><td><b>0</b></td><td><b>19</b></td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght</td><td>-</td><td><b>1</b></td><td><b>12</b></td></tr><tr><td>Popes Quay</td><td>-</td><td><b>9</b></td><td><b>3</b></td></tr><tr><td>South Mall</td><td><b>14</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Athlone</td><td>-</td><td><b>4</b></td><td><b>7</b></td></tr><tr><td>Castlebar</td><td>-</td><td><b>2</b></td><td><b>6</b></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>-</td><td><b>2</b></td><td><b>2</b></td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk</td><td><b>5</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>-</b></td></tr><tr><td>Ennis</td><td><b>15</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>-</b></td></tr><tr><td>Galway- Francis St</td><td>-</td><td><b>7</b></td><td><b>8</b></td></tr><tr><td>Galway - Seville H</td><td>-</td><td><b>0</b></td><td><b>11</b></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>-</td><td><b>1</b></td><td><b>11</b></td></tr><tr><td>Letterkenny</td><td>-</td><td><b>10</b></td><td><b>6</b></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td><b>10</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>-</b></td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>-</td><td><b>3</b></td><td><b>4</b></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td><b>4</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>-</b></td></tr><tr><td>Navan</td><td>-</td><td><b>5</b></td><td><b>2</b></td></tr><tr><td>Nenagh</td><td>-</td><td><b>1</b></td><td><b>5</b></td></tr><tr><td>Newbridge</td><td>-</td><td><b>6</b></td><td><b>11</b></td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td>-</td><td><b>7</b></td><td><b>10</b></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>-</td><td><b>3</b></td><td><b>9</b></td></tr><tr><td>Tralee</td><td><b>6</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>-</b></td></tr><tr><td>Tullamore</td><td><b>6</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>-</b></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td><b>7</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>-</b></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td><b>9</b></td><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>-</b></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>-</td><td><b>1</b></td><td><b>8</b></td></tr></table></p><p>* waiting times for centres not operating the triage approach.</p><p>** waiting times for centres operating the triage approach.</p><p>***additional time that a person who has had a triage appointment is likely to have to wait for a second consultation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-09-18a.3067.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013091800079#WRNNN02300"><p>The Deputy will be aware that demand for legal services from the Legal Aid Board (&ldquo;the Board&rdquo;) has increased significantly since the down-turn in the economy. While there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand for general legal services (excluding asylum) in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006. Demand across the organisation in 2013 is running at the same level as it was in 2012. Demand for services at Newbridge Law Centre has remained consistently high.  In the 12 months up to 1 September 2013 it received 868 new applications. In common with the vast majority of the Board&rsquo;s law centres it is a relatively small office staff wise.</p><p>The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid at the same level for 2013 as it was in 2012 (and 2011).</p><p>Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery. The Public Appointments Service concluded a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board earlier this year from which a number of permanent appointments have been made and a number of temporary positions have also been filled.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, on 12 September 2013, I signed into law a new statutory instrument in respect of civil legal aid provided by the Legal Aid Board which, inter alia, provides for an increased contribution from persons availing of the services offered by the Board.</p><p>I intend for any funds raised by these measures to be retained by the Board to better fund the provision of services to those in need of them and reduce waiting times for those services. At a time when the State is facing significant demands on its resources an increase in contributions allows the Board to achieve its objectives without money being diverted from other programmes. The increased contributions should result in increased funding of up to &euro;700,000 per annum being available to the Board once the increases have full impact.</p><p>I believe this additional resource for the Board will assist it in tackling those waiting times. I am conscious that the increase in the minimum contribution as a percentage is significant.  However, I believe the contributions payable still compare favourably with other jurisdictions. Provisions remain in place to allow the contribution to be waived in hardship cases.</p><p>In response to the changed environment the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services. Those steps include the following:</p><p>The Board has been piloting a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage. The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times. The aim of the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes). If the applicant requires further services they remain on the &lsquo;waiting list&rsquo;. There is or has been a &lsquo;backlog&rsquo; of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month. A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were satisfied with this particular service initiative. This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved. (I have included below a table showing the waiting times for non-prioritised matters at Newbridge Law Centre).</p><p>In August 2012 the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres. This is a &lsquo;start to end&rsquo; system which will in the medium term deliver efficiencies in terms of the administration aspect as well as in relation to the delivery of the legal services. It will take time for the full benefits of this system to materialise.</p><p>In November 2011 I transferred responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded family mediation service to the Board. A key reason for this transferring was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common. Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House (where the Dublin District Family Court sits) involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service located there also. Similar initiatives have now been introduced in Cork and Naas and are being evaluated.</p><p>While the Board&rsquo;s asylum related legal services were previously funded from a separate grant, since 2012 I have funded the Board on the basis of a single &lsquo;grant-in-aid&rsquo;. With the drop in demand for asylum, the Board has taken steps to integrate the delivery of its asylum related services into the general law centre service delivery model thus effectively transferring resources from the asylum area to the general legal service area where the demands have increased.</p><p>I am aware that the Board has maintained a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court. Cases in the District Court are often those that need the most immediate remedy.</p><p>I am also aware that the Board continues to engage with other key players in the justice / legal area such as the Courts Service and the Health Service Executive, with a view to trying to ensure that State funded resources that impact on its area of business are used to best effect.</p><p>Finally, the table below outlines the waiting period in months for persons waiting for a first or second consultation at Newbridge Law Centre.</p><p></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Law Centre</div></th><th><div>Waiting time for a triage appointment(months)</div></th><th><div>Further waiting time where triage appointment previously given (months)</div></th></tr><tr><td>Newbridge</td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>11</div></td></tr></table></p><p></p></reply>

I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review and all court venues in County Kerry are included in this process.</p><p>  In this context the Courts Service has established a general framework within which such venues are being assessed taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue which has now commenced.</p><p>  I am informed that the Courts Service in considering any venue for closure undertakes a cost analysis exercise which includes an assessment of the costs associated with the holding of court sittings in a court venue over a 12 month period.   Witness costs are not included in this assessment. However, the cost analysis includes an assessment of the net Garda travel and subsistence costs based on Garda attendances at the venue identified for closure when compared with the proposed alternative venue calculated over the number of sittings held over a period of 3 months and extrapolated over a 12 month period; the travel and subsistence costs for courts staff attending the identified venue when compared with the alternative venue; the travel and subsistence costs for the permanently assigned Judge to the relevant District; additional legal aid costs arising from the holding of the court sittings over the 3 month period extrapolated over a 12 month period and operational costs associated with the identified venue over a 12 month period e.g. courthouse maintenance, light, heat &amp;amp; fuel. I am informed that the cost analysis in relation to the Kerry venues has not yet been undertaken.</p><p>  Following this review four courthouses in Co. Kerry, Killorglin, Cahirciveen, Kenmare and Dingle were identified as venues which should be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case.   I am informed that there are currently no plans to close the court office located in Tralee, Co Kerry. The Courts Service has assured me no decision in relation to the future of any of the court venues will be taken without prior consultation with local interested parties and court users. This consultation process has recently commenced and the views expressed in that process will be taken into account in the decision making process which will be a matter for the Courts Service Board.</p></reply>

The application is currently being processed and once completed will be returned to the registered organisation concerned.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is approximately 9 weeks from date of receipt. However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  In the interest of fairness and equity, Garda vetting applications are processed in chronological order based on the date of receipt in the GCVU and all organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.</p><p>  It is essential that the GCVU has the resources required to perform this most critical of roles effectively and I have given this matter particular priority. In that regard I have been actively engaged with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. As a result of that engagement, I am pleased to say that the Commissioner has confirmed to me that there are now 134 whole-time equivalent staff (130 civilians and 4 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) assigned to the GCVU, some 41 of whom have been redeployed from elsewhere in the public service since the end of March 2013. Some of these redeployed staff have only recently completed their training in the vetting process, and the full impact of their work will be seen in the coming weeks. Furthermore, I have also recently received sanction for the redeployment of 40 additional staff to the GCVU. This brings the total number of staff in that service to over 170 which, when compared to the average staff allocation of 78 at the Unit over the past two and a half years, represents an increase of 117%.</p><p>  Development of an e-Vetting solution is underway. This will facilitate the processing of all applications in an e-format, thus removing the time-consuming current process of manually managing all applications received . The initial phase of testing this e-vetting system will take place in the fourth quarter of 2013.  When this is achieved, this system will streamline the overall vetting process in this jurisdiction, and further contribute to reductions in processing times for all vetting applications.</p></reply>

The Bill does not make any provision in relation to the role or status of &quot;legal executives&quot; nor is any such provision envisaged. It is clear from the correspondence I have received from the Irish Institute of Legal Executives Ltd that the scope of their proposals to confer legal status and a whole range of functions on such a category of persons is extensive and goes beyond those measures to be introduced under the Legal Services Regulation Bill.</p><p>  The proposals being made by the Irish Institute of Legal Executives Ltd, on behalf of its members, are very far-reaching. They relate <i>inter alia</i> to &quot;a right of audience in the District and Circuit Courts, before tribunals and, subject to review, subsequently in all courts&quot;, and to the eligibility of members for quasi-judicial and judicial appointments (e.g as District Court judges or members of Tribunals). These proposals also draw heavily from the regulatory and practise models of England and Wales which have separate histories and do not always correspond to those of our jurisdiction nor to those set out under current Government policy in the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011. As such, they are premature in a number of key respects and give rise to a range of substantive issues that cannot be addressed, in legislative terms, by merely adding a handful of provisions to this Bill.</p><p>  While recognising that there may be additional benefits and efficiencies to be found for consumers and for the legal services sector in a more developed role for &quot;legal executives&quot; in the future, the very far-reaching proposals being made on their behalf at this time lie beyond the scope of the Legal Services Regulation Bill impinging, as they do, on aspects of the courts and the judiciary.  Such matters, including their constitutional and other substantive aspects, will need to be considered carefully and separately on their own merits, while others may come to be considered in due course by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority. It nonetheless remains open to legal executives, who are so minded, to pursue the career of solicitor or barrister by way of capitalising on their acquired legal knowledge and experience.</p></reply>

The key anti-discrimination measures, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977, the Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Acts specifically identify Travellers by name as a group protected. The Equality Act 2004, which transposed the EU Racial Equality Directive, applied all the protections of that Directive across all of the nine grounds contained in the legislation, including the Traveller community ground.<b></b>All the protections afforded to ethnic minorities in EU directives and international conventions apply to Travellers because the Irish legislation giving effect to those international instruments explicitly protects Travellers.</p></reply>

Under the Agreement the purpose of processing of the PNR data is strictly limited to preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious transnational crime.</p><p>  Ireland supports the proposed Agreement which is among a series of measures being taken at EU level in the fight against terrorism and serious transnational crime.

This is the largest reduction in the annual expenditure ever recorded and represents a fall of approximately &euro;10 million, or 16%, over the peak recorded in 2009.  This follows a number of measures introduced since I came into office including significant cuts to practitioners' fees during 2011.</p><p>  Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal aid him/herself.  The Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that an accused person who faces serious charges is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence and if he/she cannot afford to pay for legal representation there is a right to legal aid.  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend him/herself in person or through legal assistance of his/her own choosing or, if he/she has insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.</p><p>  A new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is being drafted to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including the transferring of responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute in cases of abuse.  Provisions to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions will have regard for a person's right to the presumption of innocence, to a fair trial and to be given legal aid where appropriate.</p></reply>

Since then, UNTSO has performed various tasks entrusted to it by the Security Council, including the supervision of the General Armistice Agreements of 1949 between Israel and its Arab neighbours; the observation of the ceasefire in the Suez Canal area and the Golan Heights following the Arab-Israeli war of June 1967; and the assistance to the UN Interim Force in South Lebanon to fulfil its mandate.  Ireland has participated in UNTSO since 18 December 1958.</p><p>  In response to a request from the United Nations in April 2013, Ireland nominated Major General Michael Finn for the post of Head of Mission and Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation.  Ireland&rsquo;s nomination was successful and the United Nations appointed Major General Finn to the post with effect from 01 July 2013 for an initial contract period of one year.  Currently, apart from Major General Finn, there are twelve (12) Irish officers serving with the UNTSO mission. Major General Finn brings to his new position extensive command and peacekeeping experience attained through service at the national and international levels. He has served overseas in Lebanon, the Golan Heights in Syria and in Kosovo.</p><p>  Our involvement in peace support missions has greatly enhanced the professional capacity and capability of the Defence Forces. This has, in turn, increased our value to the United Nations. The appointment of Irish officers, such as, Major General Finn, Brigadier General Patrick Phelan as Deputy Force Commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and Brigadier General Gerald Aherne, as Mission Commander of the EU mission for the training of Somali Security Forces, is another indication of the high regard in which Irish personnel are held internationally.</p></reply>

The meeting was chaired by the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Baroness Catherine Ashton and hosted by the Lithuanian Minister of National Defence Mr. Juozas Olekas.  NATO Secretary General Mr. Anders Fogh Rasmussen joined the meeting for some working sessions.  Preparations for the European Council thematic discussion on security and defence on 19-20 December 2013 dominated discussions throughout the meeting. </font><font color="#2F2F2F">The informal Defence Ministerial meeting is not a decision-making forum, but rather provides an opportunity for Defence Ministers to discuss current issues and review ongoing progress on Common Security and Defence Policy developments.  As the meeting coincided with the Jewish Holy Day, Rosh Hashanah, I was not in a position to attend and was represented by the Secretary General of the Department of Defence, Mr. Michael Howard. The forthcoming Council meeting of Heads of State and Government was a priority issue during Ireland's recent Presidency of the Council of European Union. It was discussed at a number of high level meetings, including the Defence Ministerial which I chaired in Dublin on behalf of the High Representative.  I also hosted a seminar on this very topic. This issue will be further discussed at the formal Defence Ministerial scheduled to take place in November at which I expect to attend.</font></p><p>  The last time European Heads of State or Government held a discussion on defence matters was five years ago.  The Vilnius meeting discussed two documents published in July as part of the preparations for the December meeting: the High Representative's Interim Report on Common Security and Defence Policy and the European Commission's Communiqu&eacute; &#8220;Towards a more competitive and efficient defence and security sector&#8221;.</p><p>  On Thursday evening, during the first working session, Ministers discussed the High Representative's Interim Report on Common Security and Defence Policy and had an exchange of views.  The focus was on identifying the main deliverables for the discussion at the level of Heads of State and Government in December, as well as on a possible way forward. On the basis of the discussion, a final report will be submitted to the President of the European Council, Mr. Herman Van Rompuy at the end of September.  This report, together with the European Commission's Communiqu&eacute;, will feed into the report to be prepared by President Van Rompuy for the European Council.</p><p>  During the working dinner, delegations discussed the latest developments in Syria and the response of the European Union to the situation there.  The Operation and Mission Commanders of the four ongoing EU military missions briefed delegations on the current state of play regarding their missions.  These are Operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina; Operation EUNAVFOR ATALANTA the EU's anti-piracy maritime mission off the coast of Somalia; and the EU Training Missions in Mali and Somalia (EUTM Mali and EUTM Somalia).</p><p>  On Friday morning, during the second working session, the European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, Mr. Michel Barnier, briefed delegates on the European Commission Communiqu&eacute; on the defence and security sector and they had an exchange of views on the document. </p></reply>

The research funded is generally in the form of applied or pre-commercial projects over a 3 to 5 year period and is undertaken, often collaboratively, by research performing organisations such as the universities, institutes of technology and Teagasc.  Awards totalling &euro;32 million were made to fifty five research projects in 2012.</p><p>  The funding provided by my Department covers a number of expense categories including staff comprising Masters and PhD students and staff recruited on contract to undertake work commensurate with the type of research involved.</p><p>  One of the key aims of my Department's research programmes is to develop research capability in the Irish public research system that contributes to underpinning the sustainability and competitiveness of the sector thereby helping to achieve the ambitious growth targets which the food industry has set itself under the<i> Food Harvest 2020</i> plan.   The staffing element of the funding provided through these programmes is, therefore, focused on the training and development of early stage researchers in order to build a pool of expert scientists capable of taking up highly skilled positions in the public sector and, more importantly, in large and small indigenous and multinational food and Bioeconomy-based businesses based here in Ireland. The decision of the Kerry Group to invest &euro;100 million in locating its Global Technology and Innovation Centre in Naas was a very welcome development and is an example of the type of knowledge and science based direction being taken by some of our food companies.  This facility will have an on-going requirement for highly skilled food scientists and is glowing example of why we need to continue to invest in the training and development of staff through programmes such as FIRM.</p><p>  The recruitment of staff and issues around staff employment contracts is the responsibility of the institutions involved. Those institutions have a responsibility to comply with Government policy on remuneration, public service numbers and employment law.</p></reply>

In this context my Department issued a consultative paper towards the end of July and a process of consultation is currently underway with stakeholders following which I will take decisions that will determine how the measures are to be applied in Ireland.</p><p>  One of the issues to be determined is a provision in the draft Regulation relating to the definition of permanent grassland and pasture. Permanent grassland and permanent pasture (referred to as &lsquo;permanent grassland&rsquo;) is defined as land used to grow grasses or other herbaceous forage naturally (self-seeded) or through cultivation (sown) and that has not been included in the crop rotation of the holding for five years or longer. There is an option for Member States to include land where &lsquo;grasses and other herbaceous forage&rsquo; are not predominant but which is grazed as part of established local practice. Where Member States decide to include such land as permanent grassland, they may apply a reduction coefficient to such land whereby the number of hectares declared converts into a reduced number of &lsquo;eligible hectares&rsquo;. </p><p>  A further derogation allows for the application of a reduction coefficient to be applied to permanent grassland which is located in areas of natural constraints due to climatic conditions, poor soil quality, steepness and water supply. If such a reduction coefficient is applied under either derogation, greening requirements must be respected on all declared hectares not just on the reduced number of eligible hectares.</p><p>  The question of whether Ireland should avail of a co-efficient on such land has been included in the consultative paper.</p></reply>

The basis for these checks is clearly laid down in the governing EU Regulations and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually.  Indeed previous EU audits have made it clear that these rules and regulations must be complied with in order to avoid EU disallowances.</p><p>  Land eligibility inspections (either on-farm or by remote sensing) must be carried out on at least 5% of applicants. These checks are carried out to verify that the actual area claimed in the application form corresponds to the area farmed by the farmer and to ensure that any ineligible land or features are not included for aid purposes. Currently, around 75% of these inspections are carried out in the first instance without the need for a farm visit, as the information needed is acquired using the technique of remote sensing via satellite.</p><p>  It is also a regulatory requirement that Cross Compliance inspections must take place throughout the calendar year to take account of specific requirements at individual Statutory Management Requirement level and are required in order to ensure compliance with EU regulatory requirements in the areas of public, animal and plant health, environment and animal welfare.</p><p>  In response to a number of queries and in order to clarify recent comments regarding a perceived increase in both penalties in percentage terms and in the number of farmers penalised as a result of inspections, my Department is currently in the process of compiling a comprehensive set of statistics on all inspections carried out under the Single Payment and Disadvantaged Area Schemes since 2005. Given the very comprehensive and detailed nature of the information requested across a broad range of schemes, I am arranging for it to be provided directly in an appropriate format to the Deputy as soon as possible. </p></reply>

They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism. However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. </p><p>  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission. It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC. It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.</p><p>  I readily acknowledge that it will not be an easy task, but it is achievable if all stakeholders work in a co-operative basis. If action is not taken now, the areas will continue to deteriorate and will lead to more land abandonment. If this is allowed to happen, Ireland will lose a valuable resource from the point of view of farming, rural economy, bio-diversity and wildlife. While grazing is the only method of managing these lands, the task facing us is how to ensure that these grazing levels are appropriate to the individual commonages.</p><p>  In order to ensure that the achievement of this objective, as already stated, we need the input of individual shareholders. Grazing plans, at the level of each commonage, will allow for greater flexibility for shareholders and will enable the active farmers to increase their stock to cater for dormant and inactive persons. It will be matter for agreement between the shareholders &ndash; as was always the case &ndash; to decide how best to reach the stocking levels. Professional assistance will be required, in particular where the commonage has been damaged by under-grazing. </p><p>  The Grazing Plan will have to cater the traditional farming methods for the area, with provision made for sheep and other animals, such as cattle, providing that they are appropriate to the habitat. An appropriate time-scale will have to be put in place but the Plan should include the incremental steps to achieve GAEC. The whole concept will be output driven, in that the assessment of the Plans will be based on whether the commonage is in GAEC or not or whether the appropriate progress has been achieved.  </p><p>  Apart from ensuring that the Grazing Plan is valid, there are a number of other complications, including:</p><p> - Dormant shareholders &ndash; in the majority of cases, these persons are no longer farming;</p><p> - Current claimants on the commonages, who do not farm or manage the lands. The issue of whether the latter claimants will continue to be eligible for payment will have to be examined.</p><p>  There are other issues that will need to be considered. These include the fact that many commonage habitats have been significantly damaged by under-grazing, with resulting problems that must be addressed including land abandonment, spread of scrub and invasive species.</p><p>  The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture is a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate regarding the issues surrounding commonage lands, the views of the various stakeholders having being sought and considered by the Committee. As I have indicated previously, while it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed in the near future. My firm intention is that the process will be fully inclusive and that all stakeholders, particularly farmers and their representatives will be central to the process. It is only by adopting this approach that the desired result can be achieved.</p></reply>

As I have indicated previously, while it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend in the near future to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed. My firm intention is that the process will be fully inclusive and that all stakeholders, particularly farmers and their representatives will be central to the process. It is only by adopting this approach that the desired result can be achieved.</p><p>  With regard to the specific recommendations of the Committee contained in their Report, I can confirm that these will be included among the range of issues to be addressed in the process that will shortly be commenced by my Department - it very clear that matters to be resolved are very wide ranging and complex; it is self-evident that the process required to adequately address these must be fully inclusive and focused. To this end, I am determined, as indicated, to convene a broad group of all relevant stakeholders, charged with comprehensively addressing the range of issues.  </p><p>  Commonage lands form an important part of the farming enterprises of many farmers, particularly along the West Coast. They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism. However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. </p><p>  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission. It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC. It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.</p></reply>

Since 2011, seafood exports have grown by &euro;138 million, an impressive increase of 36%. Bord Iascaigh Mhara has reported that during that period processing companies who have benefitted from Government grant-aid through the Seafood Processing Business Investment Scheme have generated 251 new jobs in the sector and prospects are positive for jobs and growth into the future. This year, the sector continues to perform well, with exports up by almost 4% as of May and the home market continues to counter the recession, growing by approximately 2% retail sales to mid-year.</p><p>I am committed to supporting the seafood processing sector in any way I can to help it in achieving its significant potential.  The sector is one of the star performers in our food industry and can make an important contribution to our economic recovery.  Already this year, I have made available &euro;2.4 million in grant aid to 25 seafood processing companies under the 2013 Seafood Processing Business Investment Scheme.  Taken in conjunction with private sector investment, the total investment will be over &euro;8 million in 2013.  The 25 companies that received grant offers were from seven coastal counties across the country, namely Kerry, Dublin, Cork, Galway, Wexford, Mayo and Donegal.</p><p>The Seafood Processing Business Investment Scheme is implemented as part of my Department&rsquo;s Seafood Development Programme 2007-2013 and is co-funded by the European Fisheries Fund.  The Scheme aims to support seafood processing companies scale up, diversify, add value to raw material and innovate as they develop new markets, enhancing profitability and job creation prospects into the future.

The meeting involved EU Member State authorities (including ministries, services, agencies, etc.) responsible for matters of forest policy, to discuss and update themselves on the most relevant forestry issues at the EU level. The Commission, the Council Secretariat and Stakeholder's representatives were also afforded an opportunity to attend. </p><p>  The meeting considered a full agenda of current EU forestry topics including:</p><p> - A New EU Forest strategy, </p><p> - Negotiations for a Legally Binding Agreement on Forests in Europe (LBA),</p><p> - Forestry measures under the new Rural Development regime,</p><p> - Implementation of the EU Timber Regulation,</p><p> - A possible regulation on criteria on sustainable biomass, and</p><p> - A profile of forests and forest management in Lithuania.</p><p>  The question of further progress on these issues under the Lithuanian Presidency was central to this meeting and the discussions were primarily focussed on preparation for the forthcoming negotiations on the LBA which will resume in November 2013 in Geneva.  The Lithuanian Presidency was anxious to focus on appropriate negotiating positions and tactics for the EU and its Member States.  Ireland, with the Commission, led on behalf of the EU in the previous round of negotiations on the LBA which took place in Warsaw in June 2013. In this regard it is generally agreed that 90% of the technical issues relating to the proposed Forest Convention were resolved in Warsaw. It was the view of the Member States in Vilnius that a foundation for concluding the remaining elements, which have a greater political dimension, is in place and that extensive negotiation and compromise can permit the final resolution of these outstanding elements at the forthcoming Geneva meeting.</p></reply>

Discussion was based on a paper prepared by the Lithuanian Presidency which posed questions to Member States concerning the ways in which EU and national governments could enhance sustainability and support innovation, the most appropriate mechanisms for transmission of family farms and for access to land and capital and the policy measures that might be envisaged for development of cooperatives and producer organisations and for the promotion of short food supply chains and local food systems.</p><p>  As this was an informal meeting of the Agriculture Council, no decisions were taken.</p><p>  The general view expressed by Ministers was that family farms are the foundation of European agriculture and that, in addition to the economic benefits, they make a significant contribution to food security, environmental objectives and other public goods.  Thus it is important to provide continued support from public funds.  Member States mentioned the importance of innovation, farm advisory services, training and technology transfer in order to preserve the model.  Easing access to land and investment capital were also highlighted and the importance of succession planning and generational transmission were stressed.  A number of Member States mentioned the need to strengthen role of farmers in the food supply through cooperatives, collaborative farming, producer groups and short supply chains.  Other Member States said the imperative was that farm units were commercially viable.</p><p>  I made the point that family farms provided additional benefits over and above food production and should be supported.  Nonetheless, they must be competitive and innovative and the challenge would be to bring family farms along with current changes in policy and context. Policies to assist that development and change include those addressing price volatility, generational change, innovation and technology transfer.  I drew the attention of other Member States to the farm development discussion groups that had proved to be a major success in Ireland.  </p><p>  I also spoke about the need for policies to address the major issues of access to land and capital.  There was a need to find alternative means of creating economies of scale through support of collaborative farming and partnerships.  These should be assisted through domestic taxation, appropriate state aid rules and pillar 2 measures.  I mentioned the question of succession and the need to encourage more long-term leasing of land. As to cooperatives and producer groups, I noted Ireland&rsquo;s very successful cooperative movement but I made the point that there would be further need for economies of scale to ensure their ability to remain competitive in the global market. </p><p>  The EU Commission and a number of Member States used their interventions to emphasise the need to finalise the outstanding elements of CAP reform as quickly as possible and, more importantly, not to dismantle any aspect of the agreement reached in Luxembourg in June. </p></reply>

This decision was made in the context of the 2008 CAP Health Check.  </p><p>  Ireland strongly supported the abolition of the milk quota regime on the basis that quotas were widely regarded by both the Irish dairy sector and market analysts as a brake on the potential of the Irish dairy sector to respond positively to market opportunities. </p><p>  The ending of milk quota regime represents an exceptional opportunity to increase milk output in response to market demand, arising from increasing global population and the development of new opportunities for international trade with emerging markets.. Under Food Harvest 2020 the dairy industry has targeted a 50% increase in milk production in the period to 2020.  </p><p>  Against this background, I believe that the opportunities for the dairy sector as a whole will expand significantly over the coming years and my Department and its agencies will play their part in providing an appropriate framework to support the development of this critically important industry.  </p><p>  My Department has been providing a range of supports to assist farmers to exploit its potential for expansion and development.  These supports included a New Entrants to Dairying Scheme, which helps to revitalise the sector through the provision of milk quota to dynamic young educated farmers; a Dairy Efficiency Programme, which encourages the adoption of best practice management and production methods on farm; and the provision of financial support for ICBF and Animal Health Ireland to improve breed quality and animal health. My Department has also made up to &euro;40m available through its Rural Development Programme for investment on farm, as well as &euro;80m in capital investment support for the processing sector through the Dairy Investment Fund  </p><p>  These supports complement Ireland&rsquo;s natural advantages in terms of climate and grassland and I am confident that with the right approach from all of the stakeholders in the sector the target in the Food Harvest 2020 Report can be met. </p></reply>

On 11 December 2012, the European Parliament approved the agreement to apply to EU relations with Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama as of 1 August 2013. In parallel, Central America partners are progressing the completion of their internal procedures and implementation of Geographical Indicator (GI) protection. Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Panama have already ratified the agreement. The trade pillar of the agreement, including the tariff reductions, has been provisionally applied between the EU, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama as from 1 August 2013.  <font color="#004080"> </font></p><p>  In agriculture, tariffs on key agricultural products will be largely eliminated under the agreement while &quot;sensitive areas&quot; for local markets are being respected. Panama, for example, is a main importer of European whiskey to the region. 70% of its whiskey imports come from the EU and those are liberalised from day one of the entry into force of the Agreement. All other Central American countries will liberalise this market after six years. It is estimated that EU exporters of wine and spirits can expect savings of &euro;6 million annually in customs duties.</p><p>  Tariffs on dairy products will be entirely eliminated with the exception of milk-powder and cheese, for which the EU has obtained duty-free quotas. These quotas cover the currently traded quantities and will be increased on an annual basis. Irish Exporters will have an opportunity to increase their exports into this region and benefit from eliminated and reduced tariffs. Our largest exports at present to these markets are dairy products, valued at over &euro;10m, and beverages such as spirits and whiskey valued at &euro;4.3m. </p><p>  Imports from these countries to Ireland comprise mainly fruits and coffee, with imports of bananas valued at &euro;13m and pineapples at &euro;2.7m.  There are no imports of meat products. A quota for beef of 10,000t has been granted for imports of beef into the EU for all six countries which will allow for some incremental increases. </p><p>  My Department will continue to monitor the implementation of this agreement and the trade flows occurring as a result of the Agreement.</p></reply>

Under the ESD, Ireland agreed to reduce national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20%, compared to 2005 emissions levels, by 2020.  The ESD does not set individual sectoral targets.</p><p>  During 2012, as part of the work which was undertaken by the Secretariat of the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) on National Climate Policy Development, my Department engaged deeply at expert level with NESC so as to explain:</p><p> - the costs and options of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the sector </p><p> - the implications of setting targets which exceed the capacity of the sector </p><p> - the actions being taken to reduce emissions in the sector and</p><p> - the evidence that these actions are effective. </p><p>  The need for continuing analysis of the efficacy of proposed abatement actions, in a very complex system, was also emphasised.  </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s dairy and beef sectors are recognised as being amongst the most efficient in the EU and indeed the world. This is supported by a number of international reports including from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the European Commission&rsquo;s Joint Research Centre (JRC). The JRC report also favourably compared Irish beef and lamb production with that of  other countries including Brazil and New Zealand. </p><p>  Teagasc published its Marginal Abatement Cost Curve for Irish Agriculture in April 2012.  This analysis was conducted within the context of Food Harvest 2020 targets. Teagasc projects that Irish agriculture emissions, in the absence of abatement measures, could increase to 7% above 2010 levels by 2020. The Irish agriculture sector would nevertheless remain one of the most carbon-efficient in the world.  </p><p>  In summary, whilst we must face up to the reality of the Effort Sharing Decision and try to reach the National targets that were set for 2020, my Department continues to make the strong case at EU and United Nations (UNFCCC) levels that there is an inconsistency in the current approach to target setting as far as agriculture is concerned. In particular given that worldwide demand for production of food will increase by some 50% by 2030, EU policies must avoid downward pressure on food production, and maintain and enhance the EU contribution to global food production. </p><p>  In my view future ambition setting at EU level therefore should not lead to a reduction in food production in an agriculture system that is recognised as one of the most efficient in the world. Such an approach carries the very real risk of carbon leakage, as production is taken up by less sustainable systems in other parts of the world with the consequence of overall increases in emissions in global terms.</p><p>  Ireland must be recognised as a world leader in sustainable and carbon efficient food production through utilising existing best practice and further developing high efficiency farm practices and models. </p></reply>

Most support to the seafood sector is co-funded by the European Fisheries Fund and is covered by the separate Seafood Development Programme 2007-2013.  The Irish seafood national programme was an ambitious plan that foresaw Exchequer supports of almost &euro;75 million being made available to the seafood sector over the three years 2011-2013.  This was separate and additional to Exchequer investment under the EU co-funded Seafood Development Programme.  Clearly the economic environment has changed greatly since these programmes were drawn up and the scale of Exchequer investment foreseen in the Irish Seafood National Programme has not proved possible.  This has meant that not all of the Schemes originally envisaged could be implemented as originally foreseen.  </p><p>  As part of the original development of both programmes, a strategic environmental assessment was conducted.  During the course of the public consultation on that SEA, the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards (now Inland Fisheries Ireland) raised concerns about the possibility of sea-lice emanating from salmon farms negatively affecting migrating wild salmon.  The Minister for Communication, Energy and Natural Resources supported these concerns.  Rather than delay the finalisation of the programmes, it was agreed to temporarily exclude salmon farms from financial support under the Programme until such time as the sea-lice issue had been satisfactorily resolved.  </p><p>  The Irish Seafood National Programme included targets for increases in production by 2015 for the main aquaculture species, including salmon.  Because of the aforementioned temporary restriction on financial support to the marine salmon farming sector, arising from the SEA, the Programme acknowledged that the targeted increase in production of salmon would be adversely affected by the absence of development support.  However, the Programme did not include any restriction on the development of the salmon farming sector itself, nor could it, and Government policy has throughout remained committed to supporting (without grant-aid) the development of the sector, in full compliance with law. </p><p>  A pilot project was proposed in the Irish Seafood National Programme with the purpose of examining the feasibility of various additional measures for the control of sea-lice.  This project was to be 100% funded by the Exchequer and did not involve the allocation of EFF funds.  In the second half of 2010, there were communications in relation to the proposed pilot project between the then Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Minister for Communications Energy and Natural Resources.  These communications related to the structure of a steering group that would develop and lead the project.  My Department's records indicate that those communications did not advance beyond preliminary considerations, so the mooted pilot project never went beyond a proposal.  </p><p>  At present, my Department is processing one application for a &quot;deep sea&quot; salmon farm that was submitted by Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM).  BIM has submitted an application for an Aquaculture and a Foreshore Licence for the cultivation of Finfish near Inis Oirr in Galway Bay.  BIM is an independent statutory body.  The matters raised by the Deputy in relation to BIM are operational issues and are therefore matters for BIM itself.  BIM's application and its accompanying Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is currently being considered fully in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act and the 1933 Foreshore Act as amended.   It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on an application which is under active consideration as part of a statutory process.  </p><p>  Ireland's sea lice control protocols are operated by the Marine Institute and involve regular inspections of marine fin fish sites by Marine Institute Inspectors (sites are inspected 14 times per annum).  Results of inspections are provided to the farm operators within 5 working days.  Results are also reported to my Department and to other interested parties such as Inland Fisheries Ireland.  Overall results and trends are published annually.  Notices to treat are issued to operators if lice levels are found to be above treatment trigger levels.</p><p>  These protocols are considered to be more advanced than those operated in other jurisdictions for the following reasons:</p><p>- The inspection regime is totally independent of the industry;</p><p>- Data obtained as a result of inspections is published and made widely available;</p><p>- Treatment trigger levels are set at a low level.</p><p>  In 2008, the State introduced a new Pest Management Strategy, supplementing the control regime already in place.  Since the introduction of that Strategy, there has been a steady decline in the levels of sea lice infestation on farmed fish nationally during the Spring migration period for wild salmon.  During the three years from 2010 to 2012, the percentage of inspections of farmed salmon where lice levels were below the treatment trigger levels has remained relatively constant at 82% in 2010, 87% in 2011 and 83% in 2012.  The national mean lice level on farmed salmon during the Spring period has fallen from 1.74 in 2007 (prior to the introduction of the new pest management strategy in 2008) to 0.72 in 2010, 0.35 in 2011, 0.45 in 2012 and 0.19 in 2013.</p><p>  Lice infestation levels on the sites operated by the company referred to by the Deputy were, in general, satisfactory during the period 2010 - 2012, including during the Spring migration period for wild salmon.  There was, in fact, no significant rise in the number of sites with lice levels above the treatment trigger levels, although there were significant issues with lice control at one site.  In response to elevated lice levels at this one site and following an active programme of treatments by the company, the management cell process, which is part of the pest management strategy, was invoked and the company was advised on the appropriate management of the stocks on site.  The management cell recommended an accelerated harvest of all stocks from the site and the company co-operated fully with this process.  The full results of the State's overall sea lice inspection and control programme are published annually by the Marine Institute and are available for download from the Marine Institute website .     </p><p>  In relation to the EU pilot complaint referred to by the Deputy, my Department forwarded all relevant material to the EU Commission, including material supplied by Inland Fisheries Ireland.  In addition, the EU Commission arranged for Inland Fisheries Ireland to make a direct oral presentation of its position at a meeting with the Commission on 19 December 2011, at which my Department was also present.  Following consideration of the scientific facts underpinning the State's control protocols for the management of sea lice, the EU Commission closed the case on 11 October 2012.  Accordingly, my Department regards this matter as settled.</p></reply>

In Ireland, the Minister for Health has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation at both EU and domestic level.  However my Department plays a collaborative role in policy and enforcement, together with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).  In this regard, EU Food Information for the Consumer Regulation adopted in 2011 provides a framework for providing information to consumers in relation to the provenance of food, and provides for the extension of compulsory origin labelling to meats other than beef.  I have been a strong proponent of appropriate food labelling and my Department will play an active part in deliberations in how best to implement these provisions, once the Commission has completed its impact analysis on the matter later this year. </p><p>  In relation to traceability, the identification and registration of cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry and equines is also governed by EU Regulations and these Regulations have been transposed into national law.  My  Department's Animal Identification and Movement (AIM) database is a generic system that records identification and movement data on cattle, sheep, goats and pigs.  The AIM system was developed using Internet-based technology and the majority of interactions with the system are electronic transactions.  This system is widely recognised as among the best in the world. </p><p>  In the wake of the horsemeat incident earlier this year, my Department is introducing a range of measures to improve traceability systems in the equine sector and is liaising with passport issuing agencies in Ireland in this regard. Protocols to allow abattoir operators to cross check the details of passports with these agencies have been developed, aimed at ensuring that only those horses eligible for slaughter are slaughtered.  The Department is also developing a central database of horses which will involve migration of selected data from passport issuing agencies.  The database is being populated with information provided from the databases maintained by the agencies, by the Department from records obtained at slaughter plants and knackeries and by local authorities in respect of records maintained at appropriate slaughter plants.  The intention is that this database will be used at abattoirs to assist in verifying the authenticity of the passport for the equine presented and to record its date of slaughter.</p></reply>

There are two separate Retirement relief thresholds depending on the relationship of the transferor to the transferee.  Budget 2012 introduced the following changes to these thresholds with effect from the 1 January 2014, with the 2 year lead in period flagged in advance to allow for an orderly transition:</p><p>a) Transfer or Disposal of land to a person other than one's child</p><p>  For land transfers by persons aged between 55 - 66 years of age where the consideration is less that &euro;750,000 there is full relief on CGT.  For land transfers by persons aged over 66 years of age the amount of full CGT relief is only available on considerations up to &euro;500,000 to encourage earlier lifetime transfer of land holdings.</p><p>b) Transfer of land to one's child</p><p>  Irrespective of the amount of consideration for the transfer, full CGT relief may be claimed by a person aged between 55 - 66 years of age on the transfer to his/her child. </p><p>For land transfers by persons aged over 66 years of age the amount of full CGT relief is only available on considerations up to &euro;3 million, again to encourage earlier lifetime transfer of land holdings.  If the child disposes subsequently of the land within 6 years clawback of the above reliefs applies.</p><p><i><i>Stamp Duty on Land Transfers</i></i></p><p>  Budget 2012 introduced new lower stamp duty rates for land transfers with a 2% rate now applicable to non-family transfers; a half rate or 1% was introduced for land transfers to close relations until the end of 2014.  Prior to Budget 2012 a stamp duty rate of up to 6% was applicable on land transfers. In the most recent Budget 2013 the 100% relief on stamp duty for land transfers to certain young trained farmers was extended for a further 3 year period to end of 2015.</p><p>  The issue of introducing further tax reliefs in Budget 2014 is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Finance.  The taxation measures announced in Budgets 2012 and 2013 reflected the Government's commitment to the agri-food industry and in particular to the expansion planned in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy, and I will again be engaging with the Minister for Finance before the introduction of Budget 2014 in relation to further progressive taxation measures linked to policy priorities in my Department.</p></reply>

The aid substantially covered the cost of transport into the country, thus reducing the cost to farmers of a bale of hay by approximately one third.  While the scheme operated through the co-operatives, marts and other approved agencies, the actual beneficiaries are the individual farmers and primary producers who needed urgent supplies of feed.  Operating the scheme in this manner was the quickest and most effective way of getting the fodder to those who needed it.  </p><p>  Of the 81 different concerns which participated in the Scheme, to date, 58 have submitted claims, of which 14 have been fully processed and paid with a further 9 cases cleared to payment stage.  Of the remaining 35 cases that have submitted documentation, 17 have yet to submit sufficient documentation.  These concerns have been contacted directly and are working with my Department to resolve the outstanding issues.  Currently documentation remains outstanding from 23 concerns.  An emergency helpline was set up to deal with animal welfare issues emanating from the fodder crisis.  Some 1,100 calls were logged to the helpline and 475 farmers were specially aided to a total of over &euro;170,000.  The majority of the callers were diverted directly to their nearest Co-Op/ Mart in order to access their nearest source of supply.</p><p>  However, the Deputy may also be aware that agreement was reached in Brussels last week which provides for an advance payment under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme<i>. </i> This will now allow us to make advance payments, at a rate of 50%, to those applicants whose applications are confirmed fully clear, with effect from 16 October, with balancing payments being made with effect from 1 December<i>.  </i>My approach to the Agriculture Commissioner had been prompted by the protracted unseasonable weather which prevailed throughout the country, which culminated in the serious national fodder shortage which led to severe difficulties for farmers. Being acutely aware of the significance to farmers and the wider rural economy of the Single Payment, and mindful of the ongoing financial crisis, I have been particularly concerned at the difficulties caused for farmers by the adverse weather conditions during the first half of the year.  <i></i></p><p>  The total value of the advance payments, which will begin issuing as and from 16 October, the first day of the new EU financial year, will release payments worth some &euro;600 million.  The benefit in making these payments six weeks earlier than otherwise provided for under the existing rules of the scheme will be particularly beneficial at this time<i>, </i>both to the individual farmers concerned and also the wider rural community.  I can assure all concerned that my officials will do all that is needed to ensure the maximum number of applicants receive their advance payment at the earliest possible date<i>.</i></p></reply>

If a child is in need of care and protection and is unlikely to receive it at home, then the HSE has a duty to ensure they receive appropriate care.  In cases where parents are unable to cope due to illness or other serious problems they may agree to their children being taken into the care of the HSE on a voluntary basis.  Where the HSE has serious concerns for the care and wellbeing of a child, and where it is not suitable or the parent is not agreeable to a voluntary care arrangement, it may apply to the courts for a care order.  </p><p>  When a child cannot live with his or her parents either on a short or long-term basis, the HSE will, in the first instance, seek a suitable relative - including a grandparent - or person known to the child to provide care.  All foster carers, including relatives, undergo an assessment and training process to establish their suitability and competence.  At the end of May there were 6,441 children in care, 30% of whom were in foster care with relatives.</p><p>  The National Standards for Foster Care 2003 state that &quot;children and young people in foster care are encouraged and facilitated to maintain and develop family relationship and friendships&quot;.  They also state &quot;the families of children in foster care are involved in their care, in partnership with social workers and foster carers unless this is detrimental to their well being of the children, in which case the reasons for excluding them are recorded on the case files&quot;.   The National Standards for Residential Care state that &quot;visits from family members, significant others and friends are encouraged and facilitated in private&quot;.  They go on to state &quot;where young person has lost contact with a parent, family or significant others the supervising social worker and staff members actively seek to re establish contact and to identify key people within the extended family to provide support&quot;. </p><p>  Access and contact by relatives to a child in care is based on the needs of the child.  In most cases access to family is actively promoted and encouraged unless the access is posing a risk to the child or is causing the child distress.  A child's view with regard to access is also sought where age appropriate and this view is to be respected.  In most families grandparents are viewed as important family members outside of birth parents and siblings.  Although they are not always made party to proceedings from the outset they can be approached to provide care where either parent is deemed unable to function in a parental role.  Many of the 1094 (Q2 2013) relative foster carers currently caring children in care are the children's grandparent and therefore play a significant role in the child's life. </p><p>  Under Section 47 of the Child Care Act 1991, &quot;Where a child is in the care of a health board, the District Court may, of its own motion or on the application of any person, give such directions and make such order on any question affecting the welfare of the child as it thinks proper and may vary or discharge any such direction or order.&quot;  In circumstances where access and contact is restricted an application can be made under section 47 to the court for a direction in relation to access and contact if they are not satisfied with arrangements as set out in the care plan.  The Judge can then make a direction on the whether access to their grandchildren will be allowed.</p></reply>

I have identified eight key areas of action which I believe need to be considered and addressed as a matter of urgency.  These are:</p><p>- Increasing the qualification requirements for all staff in pre-school services to a minimum standard at FETAC Level 5</p><p>- Improving the quality and curricular supports for pre-school services when implementing the Siolta Framework and Aistear Curriculum </p><p>- Implementing the new National Pre-School Standards</p><p>- Introducing a registration system for all pre-school services</p><p>- Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust</p><p>- Publishing inspection reports on-line</p><p>- Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance</p><p>- Increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance</p><p>  There is considerable international evidence that increasing the qualifications of staff working with children increases the quality of services.  It is my intention, therefore, to introduce new qualification requirements for the sector starting this year.  This will be an important new development as, at present, staff working in childcare services other than under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, are not subject to any requirement in respect of qualifications.</p><p>  The  ECCE programme introduced the first-ever requirement for minimum qualifications for staff working in the childcare sector.  The current requirement under the programme is that the pre-school leader delivering the pre-school provision must hold a qualification in childcare/early education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ), or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare/early education field.  </p><p>  The minimum requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year will be increased to Level 6.  In addition, all pre-school assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a pre-school service, will be subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  This requirement will be effective from September this year for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services.  My Department is currently examining measures to support training for childcare staff in line with the increased qualification requirements.  </p><p>  Under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006 as provided in the Child Care Act 1991, the Health Service Executive has responsibility for the inspection of services and the enforcement of the regulations.  Inspection is carried out to monitor compliance with the Regulations thereby ensuring the health, safety and welfare of children and the promotion of their development.   </p><p>  A number of steps are being taken to improve the current inspection system.  These include the introduction of National Quality Standards for pre-school services later this year as part of the inspection process.  In addition, my Department is working with the Pre-School Inspectorate to develop new protocols on regulatory compliance so that there is greater clarity and consistency of approach as to how inspection reports deal with findings of serious non-compliance as opposed to minor breaches and full compliance.  My Department is also undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (Pre-school) Regulations, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution.  </p><p>  In relation to the publication of pre-school service inspection reports, the HSE has begun the process of publishing retrospective reports on-line, and this process will continue over the coming weeks and months.  All new inspection reports from 1st July will be published on-line on completion.  The publication of these reports is being hosted by Pobal, and the reports are available on the Pobal website.</p><p>  The registration system for new services is in place from 1 September on an administrative basis and new services wishing to open are required to register with the HSE.  The HSE will determine whether the childcare service is compliant in terms of suitability and service design <i>before</i> the service will be permitted to operate.  Following commencement of the service, actual care and welfare practices will be inspected.  A more comprehensive form of registration will be included in legislation which is expected to go through the Oireachtas during the autumn, and to be introduced from 1 January.   </p><p>  I have met with a number of parents affected by the programme and listened to their particular concerns and explained my plans for improvement to them.  More generally, while I understand and sympathise with the concerns of parents, I would take this opportunity to reassure them that the majority of children in Ireland have very positive experiences in creches, and that the footage shown in the Prime Time programme was, I understand,  atypical, in that it was culled from a very significant amount of filming most of which was not of concern.</p></reply>

I do not intend to respond today to all of the specifics of that document.  Overall I wish to recognise that the Child Welfare and Protection service is faced with considerable demands arising in part from the steady increase in referrals to the HSE social work services . </p><p>  In order to ensure that the needs of children and families entering the system are met, it is important that referrals are evaluated by fully qualified and proficient staff who are also in a position to recommend appropriate responses.  The IASW submission focuses on the need for additional social work staff staffing to achieve this, and in this context I can say that the latest HSE employment census indicates that the number of whole-time equivalent (WTE) social workers employed in the Children and Families service area was 1,397 at the end of June 2013.  The census numbers reflect the outcome of a process of re-classification of social workers within the HSE into individual care groups, including Children and Families, to support the process of establishing the Child and Family Agency. </p><p>  Social work staff levels are being kept under constant review and vacant positions are being filled in response to identified need.  In this context a new panel of professionally qualified social workers was established in June 2013 to allow for the filling of vacancies in social work teams.  A total of 114 vacant social worker posts have been approved for filling from this panel with a further 112 currently being filled.</p><p>  In relation to care placements, the policy of the HSE is to place children in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community.  The vast majority of children in care are in foster care.  Some children have highly specialised needs arising from severe behaviour difficulties, in some cases as a result of injury, accident or disability or in others due to their childhood experiences.  The care needs of these children are generally met by directly provided or commissioned.  There was an increase of 44.27% in the number of foster families between 2009 and 2012 from 2,959 to 4,269.  This has improved the capacity of the service to provide appropriate care placements, and has outstripped the 11.5% increase in the number of children in care during this period.</p><p>  There is a comprehensive change programme currently being implemented in Children and Family Services.  This programme is addressing the quality and consistency of child welfare and protection services, both currently and in preparation for the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency, which is imminent.  Resourcing is one element of this change programme, but equally important in structuring the new Agency is the need to enhance multi-disciplinary and inter-agency co-operation to ensure the provision of more streamlined and integrated services for children and families.</p></reply>

I have received a large volume of representations on behalf of the applicants involved and I and my officials have actively been trying to assist the small number affected.  To this end I asked the Irish Embassy in Moscow to contact the Russian authorities for information on the legislative changes that occurred in Russia.  The Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation has confirmed to the Irish Embassy that new legislation came into force on 3rd July 2013 which requires a child to be on the national adoption database for twelve months before that child is deemed eligible for intercountry adoption and may be placed on an international adoption database.  The previous period was eight months. </p><p>  The Adoption Act, 2010, provides for adoptions from countries that have ratified the Hague Convention on adoption and from countries where there is a bilateral agreement in place.  During the drafting of the Act a considered and detailed transitional process to deal with the change from previous legislation to the new Act was put in place.  The transitional measure contained in Section 63 of the Adoption Act, 2010, allows applicants with a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt who had commenced the adoption process at the time of the commencement of the Act to continue with that adoption, from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country.  Such applicants were thus afforded an additional three year period to complete these particular adoptions from non-Hague countries, and must complete the process by the 31st October 2013. </p><p>  Firstly I have been using diplomatic channels to seek solutions for the applicants involved.  To this end I wrote to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to request that the Irish Ambassador to the Russian Federation contact the relevant Russian authorities to outline the difficult situation these applicants have been put in following the change in Russian procedures and to explore possible solutions.  The Irish Ambassador to Russia met with the Deputy Foreign Minister Titov in Moscow on 10th September 2013 and outlined the position and noted our desire for a degree of flexibility in relation to the implementation of the changes recently introduced, which has affected a small number of Irish applicants who were at an advanced stage in the adoption process.</p><p>  I have also recently met with the Embassy Attach&eacute; from the Russian Embassy to Dublin who was representing the Russian Ambassador to highlight the current difficulties the sudden change in Russian legislation has created.  This meeting was positive and the Attach&eacute; indicated that officials from the Ministry of Education in Moscow are aware of the issues and are examining them closely.</p><p>  In conjunction with the diplomatic efforts being made through various channels, I am exploring the possibility of amending the Adoption Act, 2010 to address this situation.  As the Act is drafted on the basis of the incorporation of the Hague Convention and the minimum set of standards outlined therein, the implications of amending the Adoption Act, 2010 must be carefully examined.</p></reply>

In March the HSE wrote to these Section 63 DES holders to invite them to apply for an assessment as part of the application for a DES which would be issued under Section 40 of the Act, and 161 of these applicants applied.

It found that it is very difficult to identify young carers in the population. </p><p>  In order to learn more about children that undertake caring roles, my Department requested the Central Statistics Office to include a question in the Census of Population 2011.  People of all ages were asked whether they provide any unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long term-term illness, health problem or disability.  The Census of Population 2011 found that 6,449 children provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problems or disability.  Overall, 5.6 per 1,000 children provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problem or disability.  Rates ranged from 4.3 per 1,000 in Co. Louth to 8.2 per 1000 in Co. Leitrim.  It is further planned, under the National Strategy for Research and Data on Children's Lives published by my Department in November 2011, that an analysis of those children who reported in the 2011 Census that they undertook caring roles, will be carried out by the end of 2013.  This analysis will be examined to see how it can help inform future policy as to how best to address the support needs of children and young people who undertake caring roles.</p><p>  In 2012 the Department of Health published The National Carers' Strategy &ndash; Recognised, Supported, Empowered.  The strategy recognizes that although the needs of young carers can be similar to carers of any age, they may have additional needs, which include support in education to help them to achieve their full potential.  My Department has been supporting the implementation of this strategy by ensuring that the children strategies which it is developing are cognisant of the necessity to make them as &quot;carer friendly&quot; as possible.  However, given the relatively young age of children attending programmes administered by my Department's Childcare Directorate, the number of cases where such children might be carers is extremely small.  </p><p>  In preparation for the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency (CFA) the following actions have been taken that are relevant to the Carers Strategy:</p><p>- Child care staff have been alerted to the strategy and its relevance to children with carer responsibilities</p><p>- Strategy disseminated to key children and family services staff</p><p>- Linkages between carer responsibilities and child protection issues have been highlighted to staff</p><p>  The National Education Welfare Board (NEWB) is developing national guidelines as a practical support for schools in the preparation of School Attendance Strategies as outlined in Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000.  The guidelines will assist schools to implement effective measures to support children at risk of poor attendance and participation, including those with caring responsibilities.</p><p>  The NEWB has made significant progress towards delivering an integrated school support service based on the principle of &quot;One Child, One Team, One Plan&quot;.  This streamlined national approach will enhance education support services and enable the NEWB to respond appropriately to the circumstances in which children and families need help from NEWB.  Consultation on the practice model started in October 2012 and concluded early in 2013.  The model is also being developed to complement and link with models of practice and methods of working proposed by the new Child and Family Agency (CFA) within its proposed National Service Delivery Framework.</p></reply>

Under section 26 of the Child Care Act 1991, the Court may appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> to a child who is the subject of care proceedings, if it is satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of the child and in the interests of justice to do so.  They are always appointed where a child is subject to Special Care proceedings. </p><p>  I believe that there is considerable scope to improve the quality, consistency and cost effectiveness of the current service which has evolved in an ad hoc manner over a number of years.  I also believe that a much more regularised structure for guardian ad litem services needs to be developed if the role of the GAL is to deliver real value.  Officials within my Department are working closely with the Department of Justice and Equality and the HSE with a view to establishing the most appropriate arrangements for the future organisation and delivery of this service.</p></reply>

There is no doubt that the current budgetary situation is challenging for many organisations.

At this very early stage, there has been no formal evaluation of its operation.  There has been considerable anecdotal evidence from school principals, the National Education and Welfare Board and parents of the effectiveness of the year in preparing children for school.  These views are in line with international evidence on the importance of pre-school education.</p><p>  Within Growing Up in Ireland, Ireland's longitudinal study of children and young people, data is currently being collected on five year olds.  One of the ways that this data will be used is to develop an understanding of how the pre-school year is working.  This research will be made available widely when it is finalised.</p><p>  The Child Care Regulations, under which creches are inspected, focus on the welfare and well being of children, rather than specifically on education.  As I have stated before, there are a number of reforms of our inspection system underway, including the introduction of registration, harmonisation of approach nationally and the introduction of National Standards on which inspections will be based.  When those reforms have been implemented a major review of the regulations will take place with a view to ensuring that they reflect all aspects of children's care and education and that they incorporate the principles of both Aistear, the national curriculum framework for children aged 0-6 and Siolta, the national quality framework.   In this context, in 2012 a pilot joint inspection between the HSE  and the Department of Education and Skills Inspectorate took place, which looked at both welfare and wellbeing and education.  My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Education and Skills to develop the regulations, standards and tools that will be required to develop and implement a new inspection regime.</p><p>  Results of inspections of individual services will continue to be made available on line.  </p></reply>

Exceptions can also be made for relative carers who may be in a position to care for a younger sibling. The paramount consideration is the interests of the child balanced with the likelihood of the applicant being in a position to provide good foster care as outlined in the criteria for acceptance.   </p></reply>

Since Friday, 1<sup>st</sup> February 2013, cigarette packaging placed on the Irish market must display graphic photographs with a strong health warning. These images depict the negative health impacts associated with smoking, and were selected by Ireland from the library of images developed by the European Commission. From these images, the most effective combined warnings for the Irish market were identified by research conducted by TNS MRBI commissioned by the Office of Tobacco Control in the Health Service Executive.  </p><p>Although no formal assessment of the impact of the warnings has taken place in Ireland as yet, it is anticipated that these particular measures will have a positive impact on reducing the numbers of young people starting to smoke. A recent Eurobarometer survey found a high level of public support for various tobacco control measures among Irish citizens, with 90% in support of the introduction of pictorial health warnings on all tobacco products (1). Research and experience in other countries has shown that health warnings combined with coloured photographs can be an effective means of discouraging smoking and informing people about the health risks related to smoking. According to the World Health Organisation, in Canada the introduction of photo images on cigarette packs resulted in a fourfold increase in smoker's intentions to quit (20% before - 87% after). Also according to the WHO, in Brazil 56% of people changed their opinion about the health consequences of smoking after the introduction of the new packaging. Research has demonstrated clear evidence that health warnings for tobacco packaging increase consumers' knowledge about the health consequences, contribute to changing consumers' attitudes towards tobacco use and to changing consumers' behaviour (2). Combined pictorial and text warnings have been found to be significantly more impactful and memorable than text only warnings (3) and they have therefore been found to be more effective especially in changing consumer behaviour (2). Health warnings on tobacco packaging have been identified as a critical element of tobacco control policy (2).    </p><p>  A new tobacco policy is currently being finalised in the Department of Health. In recognition of the fact that no one element in isolation can be effective in reducing tobacco consumption, Irish tobacco policy is comprised of a suite of measures including education, taxation, regulation and health promotion initiatives such as the inclusion of graphic (or pictorial) warnings on tobacco packaging. </p><p>  References:</p><p>(1) </p><p>(2) </p><p>(3) </p></reply>

Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self-harm is a priority for this Government and in this regard significant additional funding has been provided in recent years to address this issue.  <i>Reach Out </i>our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention makes a number of recommendations in relation to fast track referrals to community-based mental health services, effective response to deliberate self-harm, training, reducing stigma and promoting positive mental health, initiatives aimed at helping young men and research.  </p><p>  Since 2011, funding for the NOSP has increased significantly from &euro;4 million in 2011 to &euro;7.9 million in 2013.  This increase in funding along with the additional investment in mental health has led to work being progressed on almost every recommendation in <i>Reach Out </i>  including the following actions: </p><p>- Supporting over 40 individual organisations and programmes both internal and external to the HSE.  This increase in funding has focused on resourcing front line services for persons who are in emotional distress, who have engaged in self harm or who have been bereaved through suicide.  Many of these services are being delivered by Non-Governmental Organisation sector with direct funding from the NOSP, i.e. Pieta House, Samaritans and Console.</p><p>- Working to build the capacity of frontline service providers and communities to respond to suicide through the delivery of a number of suicide prevention training programmes i.e. over 42,000 participants have completed the ASIST and safeTALK programmes.  In addition, the NOSP has invested significantly in the development of <font color="#2F2F2F">Dialectical Behaviour Therapy</font><b><font color="#2F2F2F"> </font></b><font color="#2F2F2F">(DBT) </font>services across community mental health teams. </p><p>- The NOSP resourced the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) to implement a training programme on suicide prevention for GPs and general practice staff.   International evidence highlights GP training in depression and the management of suicidal behaviour as critical to reducing suicide rates. </p><p>- The development of the National Clinical Care Programme for Self Harm in Emergency Departments and the SCAN (Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse) service.</p><p>- The delivery of two effective social marketing campaigns on mental health that have changed public attitudes and behaviours related to help seeking and mental health. The NOSP is working to develop a new national communication strategy for suicide prevention. </p><p>- The NOSP is currently working with the Irish Association of Suicidology and other partners to develop national standards for service providers that will improve the quality and safety of funded services.</p><p>- The NOSP in partnership with the Department of Education and Skills launched national guidelines on Mental Health and Suicide Prevention for the post primary school sector.  These guidelines have been distributed to schools and health services on a nationwide basis.</p><p>- The HSE is implementing the CIPC (Counselling in Primary Care) programme.  This national service was launched in 2013 and is delivering counselling to medical card holders at a primary care level.   </p><p>  The NOSP publishes an Annual Report which outlining its activities which is laid before Both Houses of the Oireacthas.  The Annual Report for 2012 was published on 5 September 2013.   </p><p>The NOSP has been reviewing its current activities to make the most of our available resources, including looking at best practice internationally to inform evidence-based policy decisions.  The review will result in a renewed strategic approach which will build on work already undertaken under <i>Reach Out. </i>   Its aim will be to support population health approaches and interventions that will assist in reducing the loss of life through suicide.  This renewed focus will provide for improved coordination and integration of services to ensure that pathways of care for persons at risk of suicide or in suicidal crisis can be accessible, acceptable and available.  </p><p>  Targets to reduce the rate of suicide for the years 2013 to 2015 have not been set.  However, it is proposed that the development of targets related to suicidal behaviour and population well-being will be considered as part of the review.</p></reply>

In 2012, a special allocation of &euro;35 million was provided for mental health to be used primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both adult and children's mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention, to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care and to facilitate the transfer of mental health service users from institutional to community based care.  414 posts were approved to implement the &euro;35 million package of special measures.   </p><p>Budgetary pressures within the HSE delayed the full utilisation of this funding in 2012, however this sum is now available to mental health services along with an additional &euro;35 million allocated in Budget 2013 for the continued development of our mental health services across a range of headings, including the further ongoing development of community services.

As at 26<sup>th</sup> August 2013, 220 of these posts have been accepted with a further 24 posts offered to candidates.  Of the 233 remaining posts, 162 are at various stages in the recruitment process.  The National Recruitment Service (NRS) creates national panels in anticipation of vacancies.

Since July, 2009 the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) is the statutory independent body responsible for the registration and inspection of all residential care services for older people. This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive regulatory framework comprising of the Health Act 2007, the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, as amended, the Health Act 2007 (Registration of Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 and the <i>National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland.</i></p><p>  All nursing homes, public and private are subject to the same core standards and regulations in relation to quality and safety in order to ensure the well-being of their residents.  In the context of continuity of care the regulations require that an individual care plan must be developed and agreed with each resident and this plan must be kept under review as required by their changing needs or circumstances.  </p><p>  The staffing requirement of each nursing home is dependent on its configuration, occupancy and the dependency levels of its residents. It is a matter for HIQA's Chief Inspector of Social Services to determine, for each nursing home, whether the staffing level and mix is appropriate.</p></reply>

Assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and reasonable expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants. </p><p>  There is also provision for discretion by the HSE to grant a card in cases of &quot;undue hardship&quot; where the income guidelines are exceeded.  Such cases are decided by a qualified Medical Officer.  Medical expenses are taken into account when assessing an application on hardship grounds. </p><p>  The HSE has produced national assessment guidelines to provide a clear framework to assist in the making of reasonable, consistent and equitable decisions when assessing an applicant for the General Medical Services scheme.  These guidelines are publicly available and can be downloaded from the HSE's medical card website. </p><p>  Budget 2013 announced that the rules on a person's expenses that are taken into account in calculating their net income for medical card purposes would be tightened. </p><p>  Changes recently introduced by the Health Service Executive from April 2013 onwards mean that payments on a home improvement loan and a &euro;50 per week allowance for a car are excluded from the standard means test assessment. </p><p>  For clarity, the exclusion from travel to work costs relates to removing the weekly amount of &euro;50 allowed to cover standing charges, such as depreciation or other running costs, used when considering travel to work costs as an outgoing where public transport is not available or suitable and a car is required. This means that the HSE will continue to consider the standard mileage costs or public transport costs when assessing eligibility.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that there are a broad range of allowable expenses under the means test assessment for medical cards that have not been affected by these changes. </p><p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the changes were identified with a view to mitigating the impact on the assessment process, while also yielding savings. In so doing, the new assessment arrangements continue to fully take account of a person's mortgage or rental expenses. In addition, other allowable expenses were protected Budget 2013. And finally, the need to reduce the income limits for medical cards was avoided.  </p></reply>

Under the GMS contract, GPs receive a range of fees and allowances, including an annual capitation payment in respect of each medical card and GP visit card patient on their GMS list.</p><p>  Section 11 of the current contract states as follows:<blockquote>&#8220;The medical practitioner shall provide for eligible persons, on behalf of the relevant Health Board, all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess.  This will include such preventive and developmental services as are currently provided or may be developed in the new style of practice which this agreement facilitates, some of which services may be included on the list of special items of service for which specific payments shall be made.&#8221;</blockquote>  The monitoring and appropriate care of patients receiving anti-coagulation therapy with Warfarin comes within the scope of competence of general practice.  Warfarin testing is also available free of charge in hospitals.</p><p>  Warfarin testing is carried out by some general practitioners as a matter of course in their practices and I welcome this.  This provides their patients with an option of receiving this service locally in a primary care setting rather than attending an acute hospital for the service.</p><p>  The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new GMS GP contract with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams. </p><p>  Officials in my Department are in consultation with the HSE with a view to drawing up a new contract.  The appropriate arrangements in relation to anti-coagulation therapy will be considered as part of the new contract. </p></reply>

Under the GMS contract, GPs receive a range of fees and allowances, including an annual capitation payment in respect of each medical card and GP visit card patient on their GMS list.</p><p>  As a result of the economic downturn, significant restrictions on Health spending have had to be implemented since mid-2008 as part of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to address the major deficit in the public finances.  The health service budget has had to be reduced by approximately &euro;2.5 billion, and is expected to make further substantial reductions in order to help bring the national finances under control.</p><p>  A review was carried out earlier this year under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009 in relation to the operation, effectiveness and impact of the amounts and rates payable to general practitioners under the relevant Regulations.  </p><p>  Having carefully considered the submissions made during the consultation process, the Minister for Health decided to reduce certain fees and allowances payable to general practitioners under the GMS Scheme, Immunisation Schemes, HeartWatch and the Maternity &amp;amp; Infant Care Scheme.  I am satisfied that the proposed reductions are fair and reasonable.  It is estimated that the effect of these cuts will result in an overall reduction of 7.5% in fees and allowances payable to GPs under the schemes in question. </p><p>  During the consultation process, the Irish Medical Organisation and others expressed the opinion that any fee cuts could result in patients no longer being able to avail of a &quot;same day&quot; GP service and could also cause GPs to reduce staff hours.  These issues were considered along with the other points raised during the consultation process.</p><p>The following Regulations have been prepared to give effect to the Minister's decisions and these came into effect on 24 July 2013:</p><p>  - S.I. 277/2013 - Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to General Practitioners) Regulations 2013</p><p>  - S.I. 278/2013 - Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to General Practitioners) (National Immunisation Programmes) Regulations 2013</p><p>  Pharmacists, Consultant Psychiatrists and Consultant Ophthalmologists have also been subjected to fee reductions under FEMPI and public sector workers have taken significant further pay reductions under the &ldquo;Haddington Road&rdquo; Agreement.  It is appropriate that GPs should share the burden on the country&rsquo;s road to economic recovery.</p><p>  Under the FEMPI legislation, the Minister for Health is required to carry out a review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of the amounts and rates fixed under the regulations each year.  This will involve a full consultation with stakeholders in 2014.  A decision will be taken at that time regarding maintaining, restoring or further reducing fees.</p></reply>

These actions include a comprehensive process mapping of neurosurgical patients, led by Beaumont&rsquo;s Chair of Clinical Governance, a review of decontamination processes, led by the Director of Operations/Deputy CEO and a review of the tracking of instruments in theatres, led by the Critical Care Directorate Nurse Manager. Regular meetings, chaired by the CEO, form part of the monitoring programme. The HSE has informed me that all of this work is in progress. </p><p>  In relation to the specific incident, as soon as a possible CJD diagnosis was made for a patient being treated in Beaumont, the hospital quarantined the equipment used on the patient in question and commenced a review to determine what, if any, risk might exist for other patients.  As part of this process, advice was provided by the Irish Panel on TSE (CJD) and from world experts in the UK, who have dealt with similar cases in the UK and worldwide. </p><p>  The review has identified a small number of patients who may have a slightly higher risk of contracting CJD than people in the general population. The exact number involved has not been made public in order to protect patient confidentiality. The relevant experts consider that the risk to these patients is minimal as transmission of CJD via surgical instrument is very rare, with no recorded cases in the past 30 years. The patients have been contacted and appropriate clinical responses are in place.</p></reply>

It is a joint programme of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness.  Vision 2020 has targeted a number of diseases that contribute to blindness, many of which are related to infections commonly found in tropical regions.  </p><p>  The WHO monitoring committee for the elimination of avoidable blindness stated in 2006 that, generally speaking, the prevention of blindness is, for the most part, not a public health issue in a large percentage of countries in the Americas and Europe.  It went on to state that many of the countries in these two regions have long solved their infrastructure problems and their health care delivery systems function efficiently.</p><p>  A number of eye conditions are part of Vision 2020, including cataract, refractive error, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration.  Detection and treatment services are available throughout the country, in community and acute hospital settings, for many conditions which can lead to vision impairment and blindness.  For example, diabetic retinopathy is the most common diabetic eye disease and the leading cause of blindness among working age Irish adults.  Approximately 10 per cent of the Irish diabetic population has sight-threatening diabetic detinopathy and around 90 per cent of this group will develop some form of retinopathy.  </p><p>  The HSE commenced the national diabetic retinopathy screening programme (Diabetic RetinaScreen) in February 2013.</p><p>  Diabetic RetinaScreen offers free, annual diabetic retinopathy screening to people with diabetes aged 12 and older.  Eye screening uses specialised digital photography to detect, at an early stage, when it is effective at reducing or preventing damage to sight.  The aim of the programme is to reduce the risk of sight loss amongst people with diabetes.</p><p>  A quality assurance framework and a central database of the eligible diabetic population has been developed for the programme.   The first round of screening is being introduced on a phased basis, in line with the roll-out of the first round of screening across other international programmes.  Approximately 30 per cent of the eligible diabetic population is expected to be invited in 2013.  It is expected that by the end of this year, 5,000 screenings will take place each month.  The remaining 70 per cent will be screened in 2014.  From 2015 full screening is to be in place.</p><p>  Two companies have been contracted to provide photography and grading services for the programme. Seven treatment centres have been identified and by the end of October 2013, it is expected that all centres will be online.  Treatment is tailored on a case-by-case basis.  For 2013, it is estimated that the cost of screening will be &euro;3.1 million and treatment will be &euro;1.8 million.</p><p>  Screening tests for glaucoma are available and treatment involves anti-glaucoma medication, which is also widely available.  Treatment options for certain types of age-related macular degeneration are available, although it is generally agreed that further research is required and this in ongoing on a global basis.  Cataract is amenable to surgical intervention and is provided in acute hospitals.  </p><p>  Section 67 of the Health Act 1970 requires that ophthalmic treatment and optical appliances be made available to medical card holders.  Services are provided to adult medical card holders and their adult dependants by contracted practitioners.  An adult medical card holder may avail of treatment and/or appliances once every two years.</p><p>  A community ophthalmic treatment scheme, providing both medical and surgical services, is available in some parts of the country.</p><p>  All children of primary school age are provided with an optical screening service by the HSE as provided for in the Health Act 1970.  Any refractive errors are treated and spectacles or other appropriate care is provided where necessary.  Children between 12 and 16 years whose parents are in receipt of a medical card are eligible for HSE eye-care services when they are named on their parents' cards.  Other children between 12 and 16 years are eligible to be seen by an HSE eye doctor when there is a medical reason for the eye condition, rather than a refractive error.  Such patients may be referred for treatment after being examined by an optometrist.</p><p>  The Government has continued to provide financial supports to those agencies involved in research, support and service provision for people with visual impairments in Ireland.  The Government remains committed to provide and develop vision services and supports through health prevention, screening and intervention policies and programmes, all of which contribute as we work to address the priority goal of Vision 2020, namely to eliminate avoidable blindness in Ireland.</p></reply>

Collaborating with individual hospitals, the SDU, together with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and the HSE, has developed the outpatient waiting list minimum dataset.  This allows data to be submitted to the NTPF from hospitals on a weekly basis and, for the first time, outpatient data is available on <i>www.ntpf.ie</i>. For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has been set of 12 months for a first time consultant-led outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE service plan. The SDU and the NTPF will work closely with hospitals towards achievement of the maximum waiting time.</p><p>  Should a patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he or she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.

The Medicinal Products (Prescription &amp;amp; Control of Supply) Regulations 2003 as amended (S.I. 540 of 2003) (the Prescription Regulations) set out the requirements relating to the sale and supply of medicines, including medicines supplied on foot of prescriptions.  </p><p>  The legislation permits a pharmacist to dispense a prescription written by a practitioner practising in another EU MS, who is of equivalent status to a registered medical practitioner or registered dentist in Ireland, if the pharmacist is satisfied that he or she can verify the authenticity of the prescription and that he or she can determine the appropriate medicine and dosage instructions of the medicine to be supplied to the patient.  </p><p>  The prescription must not have been issued to facilitate mail order of prescription medicines (which is prohibited in Ireland).  Further, a pharmacist may not dispense a cross-border prescription for a controlled drug (e.g. narcotics or psychotropics such as morphine, methadone etc.) because of the potential for abuse.  </p><p>  I understand that a similar provision exists in the legislation in Northern Ireland which allows a pharmacist in Northern Ireland to dispense a prescription written in this State, subject to the prescription meeting the requirements of Northern Irish medicines legislation. </p><p>  In December 2012, the European Commission adopted Implementing Directive 2012/52/EU which lays down measures to facilitate the recognition of medical prescriptions between EU Member States. The intention of this Directive is to harmonise the rules and facilitate the recognition of prescriptions written in one Member State and dispensed in another Member State. Work is currently under way to transpose this Commission Implementing Directive 2012/52/EU into Irish law.  The Directive will apply to prescriptions which are issued on foot of a patient&rsquo;s request for an EU cross-border prescription.  </p></reply>

Breast-feeding rates in Ireland have increases gradually over recent years and our goal is to increase this rate further. In 2011 47% of babies were exclusively breast-fed on discharge from Irish maternity units, with a total of 55.2% receiving any breast-milk (ESRI, 2012).  There is a vast body of evidence to support the importance of breast-feeding for the short and longer term health of the child and mother.  </p><p>In 2005, the Department of Health and Children published <i>Breastfeeding in Ireland: A five year strategic action plan</i>  . A National Breastfeeding Strategy Implementation Committee was appointed in 2007.  In 2011, 41.76% of births occurred in the 8 Baby Friendly designated hospitals in the Republic of Ireland. In 2012 the HSE adopted an Infant Feeding Policy for Maternity and Neo-natal Units based on the 10 Steps of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative.

The assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and reasonable expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants. Under the legislation, determination of eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the HSE.  </p><p>  While there is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with specific illnesses, such as motor neurone disease, the HSE has, however, discretion to award a medical card to avoid undue hardship, even where the person exceeds the income guidelines.    At the request of the Minister, the HSE set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for medical cards on a discretionary basis, where a person exceeds the income guidelines but there are difficult personal circumstances, such as an illness. </p><p>  The HSE have examined their medical card database to identify the number of patients with Motor Neurone disease and identified 286 clients in respect of whom the medication &quot;Rilutek&quot; has been dispensed in the twelve months to June 2013 and this figure correlates with the figure of 300 Motor Neurone patients nationally. Of these clients, 234 have a full medical card and the balance avail of the Drugs Payment Scheme to cover the excess of &euro;144 per month. </p><p>  Minister Reilly and myself are very much aware of the difficulties facing patients with Motor Neurone Disease and the Medical Officers in the HSE are taking all of these difficulties and costs into account when considering clients for eligibility for a medical card. However, as outlined earlier, the governing criteria in relation to medical cards is to ensure that patients who are unable to provide for their medical and surgical requirements without undue hardship are provided with such services.</p></reply>

This is in the interest of doctors themselves and of the patients under their care.</p><p>  This is a complex matter.  Amongst the issues involved, depending on the particular service, are changes to NCHD rosters and work patterns, greater use of Consultant teams, organisation of services, introduction of electronic rostering and time-recording systems and task reallocation between health professionals.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive's Service Plan for 2013 specifically recognises the need to address EWTD compliance.  The Executive has established a National Group to bring a clear and urgent focus to implementation of the Directive, assessment of performance and site-by-site accountability for change.  The Group has engaged and continues to work with management in each hospital regarding implementation plans and accountability.  The immediate focus is to ensure that no doctor works more than 68 hours per week and that none work shifts (including on-call) of longer than 24 hours at a time. </p><p>  I am keeping this matter under ongoing review so as to ensure that the HSE, to the maximum extent possible, reduces the average working hours of NCHDs and implements other measures to improve their working conditions. </p></reply>

Community pharmacists are authorised to dispense a maximum of seven days supply of medicines prescribed for persons who have been in-patients in a hospital or who have attended an Emergency Department and because of the circumstances of their discharge and/or the urgency of the prescribed medication it would not be possible to attend their GP to have the hospital prescription transcribed to a GMS prescription form. This arrangement relieves any difficulties that patients might encounter due to being discharged from hospital late in the evening or at weekends.</p><p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that it is best clinical practice that a person in need of treatment should regularly attend their GP and that the GP is fully aware of the medications that any patient may be being prescribed.  This is entirely consistent with the gatekeeper role played by the GP in the delivery of primary care. As GPs receive an annual capitation fee per GMS patient there are no extra costs incurred by such patients. </p></reply>

Following the subsequent completion of a workforce planning exercise and engagement with the Higher Education Authority (HEA) it was agreed that the most appropriate route for initial training should be via an accelerated two-year MSc programme for students with suitable honours degrees. </p><p>  In this context the HSE and the HEA requested the Athlone Institute of Technology (AIT) not to commence the BSc programme in Audiology in 2012 as a formal process to select a higher education institute to commence a programme in audiology had not been completed and the workforce planning exercise referred to above indicated that the student numbers required to maintain such a small workforce would not be sufficient to sustain a BSc programme. It was the intention of the HSE and the HEA to commence this selection process in early 2013. AIT commenced its BSc programme in 2012. It was not accredited with a suitable professional body as is a standard prerequisite for any health professional education and training course. The non-accreditation of the course posed obvious patient safety problems for the HSE in terms of facilitating placements. Out of concern for the students the HSE, in November 2012, agreed to support placements for the students on the basis that AIT achieved suitable accreditation from the British Academy of Audiology (BAA) by an agreed deadline of May 2013. This accreditation was subsequently not achieved within the timeframe. </p><p>  Following a judicial review initiated by two students  against AIT, the HEA and the HSE in August last an agreement was reached, subject to certain conditions, that the AIT would recommence the course, the HEA would fund it and the HSE would provide placements. The agreement relates to the current cohort of audiology students only.</p></reply>

Collaborating with individual hospitals, the SDU, together with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and the HSE, has developed the outpatient waiting list minimum dataset.  This allows data to be submitted to the NTPF from hospitals on a weekly basis and, for the first time, outpatient data is available on www.ntpf.ie. For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has been set of 12 months for a first time consultant-led outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE service plan. The SDU and the NTPF will work closely with hospitals towards achievement of the maximum waiting time.</p><p>  Should a patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he or she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved. In relation to the specific hospital appointment query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population.</p><p>  It has become clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic. Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness. While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. </p><p>  However, the Government is firmly committed to introducing a universal service within this term. The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the roll-out of the universal GP service. In doing so, it has considered the delay in the initial step and the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, with the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay. </p><p>  It has been agreed that a number of alternative options should be set out with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  As part of this work, consideration is being given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation of this universal health service.  A range of options are under consideration with a view to bringing developed proposals to Government over the next few months.</p><p>  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources totalling &euro;30 million in the two most recent budgets. </p><p>  To conclude,this Government is determined to expedite the implementation of a national GP service for the entire population, something to which no previous Government has ever aspired.</p></reply>

In 2011 the HSE Quality &amp;amp; Patient Safety Directorate established a National Integrated Care Advisory Group (NICAG) to review the existing Integrated Discharge Planning Code of Practice. Following initial consultation last year with staff in hospitals and the community services the NICAG is revising the National Integrated Care Guidance document which will replace the existing code of practice.</p><p>  This Guidance Document aims to provide practical advice for service providers regarding effective discharge and transfer from hospital to the community. It outlines the nine key steps in effective discharge and transfer of care which will facilitate faster, safer discharges for patients. These steps include identifying whether the person has simple or complex needs, setting an expected date of discharge/transfer within 24/48 hours of admission and reviewing the treatment plan with the person on a daily basis.    </p><p>In relation to discharge summary information, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has developed a National Standard for Patient Discharge Summary Information as an important step towards improving the whole care pathway and enabling the delivery of safe, person-centred care. When a patient is discharged from hospital to primary care it is essential that complete, relevant and valid information regarding the patient's stay in hospital is sent to the primary care healthcare professional in a timely manner, allowing the primary care professional to continue care and management following discharge. The National Standard for Patient Discharge Summary Information sets out the relevant and important information that should be contained in a patient's summary discharge information. HIQA has submitted the National Standard to me seeking my approval in accordance with Section 8 (1) (k) of the Health Act 2007.  My Department is currently examining this submission. </p></reply>

The HSE either directly provides or contracts disability agencies such as St Michael House to provide a range of disability services through service level arrangements.    </p><p>  St Michael&rsquo;s House received over &euro;70 million in 2012 in funding from the HSE to provide a range of services to approximately 1,660 children and adults with an intellectual disability in over 170 centres in the Greater Dublin Area and Navan Co. Meath. </p><p>  The HSE and St Michael's House work in close collaboration with regard to the funding and delivery of services to people with an intellectual disability. As a voluntary  agency, St Michael&rsquo;s house are obliged to work within the resources available to  them and in that regard have introduced significant efficiencies over recent  years to remain within budget. The HSE has advised that these changes to date have not resulted in service contraction.  </p><p>  The Haddington Road Agreement (HRA) sets out measures relating to productivity, cost extraction and reform which together intends to achieve a required pay bill reduction of &euro;150m identified in the HSE Service Plan 2013. The agreement provides a framework and opportunities for managers within the health services, including agencies such as St Michael's House, to reduce their costs associated with agency and overtime and a wide range of other pay costs, particularly through measures such as additional working hours and revised rates in respect of overtime.   </p><p>  The HSE has advised the Department of Health that the recent application of additional budget cuts under the HRA has presented a significant challenge to St Michael&rsquo;s House.   A process is now underway between the HSE and St Michael&rsquo;s House to identify the impact of these budget reductions on services.   The Department of Health has received assurances from the HSE that both organisations are committed to working within the terms of the HRA to ensure that services are impacted upon only as a measure of last resort.  </p><p>  In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service issues they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

However, people attending outpatient and hospital appointments are, in general, expected to make their own travel arrangements, using private or scheduled public transport. The exceptions are for dialysis, cancer (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and post-operative transplant patients, where transport may be provided.  In these cases, the patient's appointment  should be directly related to the treatment. </p><p>  Transport may also be provided where, in the clinician's view, the patient would be unable to make the journey without clinical assistance or where the patient must be transported on a stretcher. </p><p>  Following implementation of the HSE's non-ambulance patient transport policy, responsibility for the arrangement and provision of non-ambulance transport has moved from the HSE National Ambulance Service to local health offices in each region.  Patients or their clinicians should contact their local health office directly in relation to transport requests. </p><p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department of Social Protection administers a scheme which may help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These payments are known as Exceptional Needs Payments (ENPs).

Assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and reasonable expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants. </p><p>  There is also provision for discretion by the HSE to grant a card in cases of &quot;undue hardship&quot; where the income guidelines are exceeded. Following the centralisation of medical card processing, the Minister ensured that discretionary medical cards would be based on consistent medical grounds by requesting the HSE to set up a panel to assist in the screening of applications for medical cards on a discretionary grounds.  Such cases are decided by a qualified Medical Officer.

This allows data to be submitted to the NTPF from hospitals on a weekly basis and, for the first time, outpatient data is available on www.ntpf.ie. For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has been set of 12 months for a first time consultant-led outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE service plan. The SDU and the NTPF will work closely with hospitals towards achievement of the maximum waiting time.</p><p>  Should a patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he or she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.

The Government is committed to the provision and development of services for these children, having regard to available resources. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Health Service Executive is currently engaged in a national programme of reconfiguring therapy resources for children with disabilities, including autism, with a view to ensuring there is more equitable access to services for children, according to their individual needs.  Established since 2010, the national re-configuration programme is based on the recommendations of the   <i>Report of the National Reference Group on Multidisciplinary Disability Services for Children aged 5-18.</i></p><p>  A key objective of the HSE's <i>Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme</i><i>(0-18 years</i>  ) is to ensure there is a clear pathway for all children to the services they need regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability or developmental delay.  In practical terms this means that health professionals and parents will know exactly where a child should be referred and how to refer them.  A fundamental principle underlying the Programme is that children should receive the health services they need as close to their home and school as possible. Some children may have their needs met by their local primary care services.  An Early Intervention Team and a School Age Team will look after all children with more complex needs in a defined geographic network area, regardless of the nature of their disability.  These Teams will be supported by specialist services in areas requiring a high level of expertise.  The Programme supports the principle of providing access to mainstream education where appropriate while also recognising a continuing role for special schools. </p><p>  The Programme is rolling out at national, regional and local level and involves representatives from the health and education sectors, statutory and non-statutory service providers and parents working together to see how current services can best be re-organised.  It is supported by a National Co-ordinating Group that has representation from the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills and other key stakeholders.  Decisions regarding any local re-organisation of services are the responsibility of Local Implementation Groups which include representatives of the service providers involved, parents and educational sector representatives. </p><p>  Local Implementation Groups have been established by the HSE South to progress implementation of the Programme across the region, including in Cork.  It is envisaged that the current intellectual disability/autism services in Cork will be re-configured into the network Teams being established there under this Programme.   </p><p>  The specific issue of waiting times for assessment is an operational matter for the Health Service Executive.  Accordingly I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Therefore, there is no automatic entitlement to medical cards for persons of any age, solely relating to illness. Under the legislation, determination of eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the HSE.  </p><p>  While there is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with specific illnesses, the HSE has, however, discretion to award a medical card to avoid undue hardship, even where the person exceeds the income guidelines.    At the request of the Minister, the HSE set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for medical cards on a discretionary basis, where a person exceeds the income guidelines but there are difficult personal circumstances, such as an illness.</p><p>  The HSE has an effective system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford. They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. </p></reply>

This new model emerged from an analysis of the needs of the South Kerry area and the best use of available resources, including paramedics and advanced paramedics.  </p><p>  The plan to modernise the South Kerry service follows a consultation process with a wide range of interested groups, such as GPs, local public representatives and community groups.  The plan has also been informed by the modernisation developments that have already taken place in East Cork, North Cork and West Cork.  The plan is extremely detailed, providing numerous benefits agreed between HSE management, union representatives and staff.   The agreed plan includes:</p><p>- the replacement of current on-call work practices with on-duty rostering, to bring NAS operations in South Kerry into line with County Cork and the majority of the rest of the region, meaning that paramedic staff are at their bases or in their vehicles, ready to be dispatched immediately to 112/999 calls;</p><p>- deployment of a fleet of emergency vehicles and emergency personnel that will best serve the people of South Kerry;</p><p>- intermediate care vehicles for routine transfers of patients between South Kerry and acute and community hospitals, freeing emergency vehicles for emergency work;</p><p>- retention of the current ambulance stations Killarney, Caherciveen and Kenmare  as the locations for deployment in the South Kerry geographical area;</p><p>  A modern emergency service requires highly trained health professionals who can perform life-saving interventions at the scene of an emergency.  The NAS has invested significantly in recent years in training ambulance staff to very high standards at both paramedic and advanced paramedic level. </p><p>  Paramedics and advanced paramedics provide a very high level of medical assessment and treatment, in many cases potentially life-saving treatment.  The introduction of on-duty services in the South Kerry region now sees the availability of emergency resources and staff available  24 hours a day, seven days a week, ensuring people having equal and timely access to highly skilled paramedic and advanced paramedic staff day or night.</p></reply>

As part of this process, advice was provided by the Irish Panel on TSE (CJD) and from world experts in the UK, who have dealt with similar cases in the UK and worldwide. </p><p>  The review has identified a small number of patients who may have a slightly higher risk of contracting CJD than people in the general population. The exact number involved has not been made public in order to protect patient confidentiality. The relevant experts consider that the risk to these patients is minimal as transmission of CJD via surgical instrument is very rare, with no recorded cases in the past 30 years. </p><p>The HSE has further advised that all relevant patients were contacted by the lead consultant on Friday 18 July 2013 and a verbal apology was given to them. Clinics were arranged for the patients to meet with a consultant neurologist and a neuropsychologist on Saturday 19 July, with further follow-up appointments provided to patients if required. In addition, Beaumont Hospital will be providing support and ongoing monitoring for these individuals into the future. There is a dedicated nurse appointed for any follow-up care requirements for these patients and all of the services are provided through the Neurocentre Directorate.   </p><p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that patients receive the highest standard of care in the appropriate settings, be those acute, community or residential.  In order to maintain and enhance public confidence in the delivery of a quality system, it is essential that  appropriate mechanisms are available should the service fall short of expectations.</p><p>  There is a formal complaints process for issues concerning individuals or services under the aegis of the HSE.  Details of this procedure are on the HSE  website, at . In addition, advice and instructions for making complaints about a service or an individual may be found at www.healthcomplaints.ie.</p><p>  In the case of Beaumont Hospital, if a patient or a relative has a concern or wishes to make a complaint, they should contact the clinic where the problem arose. If the issue cannot be resolved to the patient's or relative's satisfaction, they will be connected with the Patient Representative's Office, which can offer information and support and can investigate and help to resolve the matter.  Alternatively, the complaint may be made directly to the HSE via the &quot;your service your say&quot; form.  When an individual is not satisfied with the response they receive, they may wish to take their complaint further by seeking a review from the HSE&rsquo;s Director of Advocacy or the Office of the Ombudsman.</p></reply>

The HSE either directly provides or contracts disability agencies such as St Michael House to provide a range of disability services through service level arrangements.    </p><p>  St Michael&rsquo;s House received over &euro;70 million in 2012 in funding from the HSE to provide a range of services to approximately 1,660 children and adults with an intellectual disability in over 170 centres in the Greater Dublin Area and Navan Co. Meath. </p><p>  The HSE and St Michael's House work in close collaboration with regard to the funding and delivery of services to people with an intellectual disability. As a voluntary  agency, St Michael&rsquo;s house are obliged to work within the resources available to  them and in that regard have introduced significant efficiencies over recent  years to remain within budget. The HSE has advised that these changes to date have not resulted in service contraction.  </p><p>  The Haddington Road Agreement (HRA) sets out measures relating to productivity, cost extraction and reform which together intends to achieve a required pay bill reduction of &euro;150m identified in the HSE Service Plan 2013. The agreement provides a framework and opportunities for managers within the health services, including agencies such as St Michael's House, to reduce their costs associated with agency and overtime and a wide range of other pay costs, particularly through measures such as additional working hours and revised rates in respect of overtime.   </p><p>  The HSE has advised the Department of Health that the recent application of additional budget cuts under the HRA has presented a significant challenge to St Michael&rsquo;s House.   A process is now underway between the HSE and St Michael&rsquo;s House to identify the impact of these budget reductions on services.   The Department of Health has received assurances from the HSE that both organisations are committed to working within the terms of the HRA to ensure that services are impacted upon only as a measure of last resort.  </p><p>  In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service issues they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

The maintenance charge ranges from &euro;586 to &euro;1,046 per day for private patients who are accommodated in a private designated bed.  The private in-patient daily charge is &euro;75 and is applicable to all private patients without exception.</p><p>  The Health (Amendment) Act, 2013 (No. 31 of 2013), signed by the President on 24th July 2013, provides for the introduction of a single private in-patient charge for all private patients, including those accommodated in public beds. The in-patient daily charge will cease and the hospital charge for a private day-case patient will be reduced from a total of &euro;828 to &euro;407 in a Category 1 hospital.  The daily charge for a private patient accommodated overnight in a multi-occupancy room in a category 1 hospital will be &euro;813.  Currently, the equivalent charges applied to a patient in a semi-private bed are &euro;1,008. These provisions will come into effect from 1<sup>st</sup> January 2014.</p></reply>

It is thought to be caused by a disruption in the way messages from the brain are transmitted to the body.  It is characterised by difficulty in planning smooth, co-ordinated movements, which leads to clumsiness, a lack of co-ordination and problems with language, perception and thought. Symptoms are normally noticeable from an early age.  The condition is more common in boys and sometimes runs in families.  It may also occur alongside other conditions, such as:</p><p>- Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): a group of behavioural symptoms of inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness;</p><p>- Dyslexia: a common type of learning difficulty that mainly affects the skills involved in reading and spelling words. </p><p>  For children with mild problems, these may disappear as they grow up.  However, up to 9 out of 10 children with dyspraxia will continue to have difficulties as a teenager and adult. </p><p>  Having dyspraxia does not alter a child&rsquo;s intelligence but affects their learning capability.  For this reason children with dyspraxia may require additional supports in the school setting to keep up with their classmates.  The provision of such educational supports is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills. </p><p>From a health perspective, there is no cure for dyspraxia, but a number of therapies can make it easier for the child to cope with their problems.  These include speech and language therapy, to improve speech and communication skills, and occupational therapy to find ways to remain independent and complete everyday tasks.  The provision of health related services is an operational matter for the Health Service Executive.  Accordingly I have   asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy with information regarding the specific health services available for these children.</p></reply>

Orthodontic referrals are generally received via the Public Dental Service school screening programme. An individual's access to orthodontic treatment is determined against a set of clinical guidelines called the Modified Index of Treatment Need. At the time of assessment those with urgent clinical need are prioritised for treatment. It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable as it is sometimes necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences. Patients with the greatest level of need, i.e. Grade 5 or Grade 4 are provided with treatment by the HSE. The most recent information regarding assessment and treatment waiting lists relates to the second quarter of 2013. The information is collated by the HSE for the intervals as shown only. Information for treatment waiting times is not broken down by year for waiting times of over 4 years.</p><p><table><tr><th>Waiting time from referral to assessment</th><th>1 - 6 months</th><th>7 - 12 months </th><th>13 - 24 months</th><th> &amp;gt; 2 years</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster</td><td>1208</td><td>1225</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2433</td></tr><tr><td>HSE West </td><td>602</td><td>2510</td><td>90</td><td>39</td><td>3241</td></tr><tr><td>HSE South</td><td>1731</td><td>138</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>1869</td></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin North East *</td><td>312</td><td>312</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>624</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>3853</td><td>4185</td><td>90</td><td>39</td><td>8167</td></tr></table></p><p>*Figures for Dublin North East above includes Louth and Meath.

The assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the person's overall financial situation, including the means and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.  </p><p>  I would like to advise you that, despite recent misinformed comment, there never has been, in line with the legislation, an automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with cancer (or any other specific illness). Furthermore, I wish to make it clear that the criteria applied to medical card applications by cancer patients has not been amended or reviewed. </p><p>  While there is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with specific illnesses, the HSE has, however, discretion to award a medical card to avoid undue hardship, even where the person exceeds the income guidelines.  At the request of the Minister, the HSE set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards, where a person exceeds the income guidelines but there are difficult personal circumstances, such as an illness. There has been no change in the policy of awarding discretionary medical cards.</p><p>  The HSE has a system in place for the provision of emergency discretionary medical cards for patients who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford. These are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients, all emergency cards are issued on the basis that the patent is eligible for a medical card on means or undue hardship and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. </p><p>  Medical cards can also be provided on emergency grounds, for a period of six months, where a patient is terminally till. No means test applies and the nature of the terminal illness is not a deciding factor in the issue of an emergency medical card in these circumstances. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible.  </p><p>  Furthermore, the HSE ensures that the system responds to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals in these circumstances.</p></reply>

HCAIs represent a major cause of preventable patient harm and increased healthcare costs.  Since late 2012 the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has been carrying out a monitoring programme against the National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs), 36 of which have been completed.  The most recent Monitoring Reports were published on Wednesday 4th September covering 5 acute hospitals:</p><p> - Mid-Western Regional Maternity Hospital, Limerick;</p><p> - Beaumont Hospital, Dublin;</p><p> - Lourdes Orthopaedic Hospital, Kilcreene;</p><p> - Merlin Park Hospital, Galway;</p><p> - Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore </p><p>  Both I and my Department welcome the publication of HIQA&rsquo;s reports and note the concerns raised in these, and indeed, previous reports about hand hygiene practices particularly among medical staff.  With regard to hand hygiene the findings of the Authority suggest that hand hygiene best practice needs to become more operationally embedded at all levels.  Poor hygiene standards put lives in danger.  Everyone needs to play their part in improving hygiene standards in hospitals; this requires buy in from hospital staff in all areas and visitors. It must be emphasised that it is of vital importance that healthcare workers recognise their personal responsibility to protect patients by maintaining their own good hand hygiene.  I am extremely disappointed to note that despite the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s initiatives to develop an organisational culture of hand hygiene, a significant number of healthcare staff, including doctors, are still not adhering to the basic principles of hand washing.</p><p>  I very much support the HSE&rsquo;s ongoing work through its national programme of activity to raise awareness amongst staff, monitor compliance with national standards and to take action to reduce HCAIs in hospitals. A key element of this programme is the HSE&rsquo;s continuing bi-annual hand hygiene audits which occur in both the acute sector and in the long stay area as well.  Additionally, from July of this year it has become mandatory for all staff to receive hand hygiene training as part of staff induction and an education programme every two years is being put in place.  The HSE audits have shown an encouraging improvement in hand hygiene compliance with a most recent figure of 84% compliance overall. However, there is no cause for complacency as there continues to be significant room for improvement, particularly among medical staff.</p><p>  With this in mind, the Chief Medical Officer of my Department has written to the Chair of the Health and Social Regulatory Forum asking that the Forum consider the matter and submit proposals as to how it might adopt a common approach to raise awareness of hand hygiene in particular and support and reinforce compliance with this very important patient safety issue.</p></reply>

Last month I announced appointments to the NPHDB to replace the transitional Board which had been in place since January 2013. These appointments ensure appropriate professional membership with the necessary capital development expertise and experience in complex healthcare capital projects. Also in August I announced the appointment of members to the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group Board (CHGB). The CHGB will oversee the operational integration of the three existing paediatric hospitals in advance of the move to the new hospital and is also the client for the new hospital, and hence is critically important for the project as a whole. Earlier this month, Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman was selected as CEO of the Children's Hospital Group following an open recruitment process through the Public Appointments Service. </p><p>  With regard to the progress of the capital project, the tender process for the procurement of a new design team is well underway, and the aim is to have the new design team in place by the end of 2013.  Pre-application planning discussions have commenced and the aim is to secure planning permission by December 2014. A review of urgent care centre(s) configuration is almost complete; the number and location of these satellite centres in the Dublin area is a key decision, as the size, activity and infrastructure of these satellite centre(s) has implications for the main hospital brief.   In parallel, St. James's Hospital is leading on the decant and enabling work, and is working closely with HSE Estates and the NPHDB in this regard. </p><p>  The new children&rsquo;s hospital is a priority for me and for this Government. I am confident that the appointments made to the two Boards will ensure the new hospital is completed as swiftly as possible, with optimal design and value for money. </p></reply>

No. 278 of 2013 specify that the amount payable to a general practitioner for administering to an individual in an &quot;at-risk&quot; category an influenza vaccine under the General Medical Services Scheme provided that the influenza vaccine is not administered by the general practitioner (or by another general practitioner in the same practice) on the same day as a PPV is &euro;15.  </p><p>  The vaccine and its administration are free of charge to persons in the &#8220;at-risk&#8221; category who have a Medical Card or GP Visit Card.  In such cases, the &euro;15 fee is reimbursed to the GP by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service.  </p><p>  The following are deemed to be in the &quot;at risk&quot; category and are recommended for Influenza Vaccination:</p><p> - persons aged 65 and over;</p><p> - those with a long term medical condition such as diabetes, heart or lung disease;</p><p> - people whose immune system is impaired due to disease or treatment;</p><p> - residents of nursing homes or other long-stay institutions;</p><p> - persons with a body mass index (BMI) over 40;</p><p> - pregnant women (vaccine can be given at any stage of pregnancy);</p><p> - healthcare workers;</p><p> - carers;</p><p> - people in regular close contact with poultry, water fowl or pigs.</p><p>  Where a Medical Card or GP Visit Card holder is not in the &#8220;at-risk&#8221; category, the vaccine and its administration are a matter of private contract between the patient and their GP.</p><p>  Under the GMS contract, a GP is expected to provide his/her patients who hold a Medical Card or GP Visit Card with all proper and necessary treatment of a kind generally undertaken by a GP.  Where blood tests form part of the investigation and necessary treatment of patients' symptoms or conditions, these should be provided free of charge to Medical Card and GP Visit Card holders.  The HSE also points out that, in many GP surgeries, it is the practice nurse who takes blood samples.  The HSE significantly subsidises the cost of employing practice nurses.</p><p>The HSE is continuing to advise eligible patients who believe they have been inappropriately charged by a GP for routine phlebotomy services, to seek a refund from the GPs in question.    It is appreciated that because of the nature of the GP/patient relationship, it may be difficult for patients to make such complaints.  Where public representatives are made aware of GPs charging GMS patients in error, they may wish to notify the HSE directly.</p><p>  The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new GMS GP contract with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams. </p><p>  Officials in my Department are in consultation with the HSE with a view to drawing up a new contract.  The appropriate arrangements in relation to phlebotomy services will be considered as part of the new contract.</p></reply>

The proposal, which is currently being considered by Member States recommends that Nicotine Containing Products (e.g. electronic cigarettes) below a certain nicotine threshold are allowed on the market, but must feature health warnings. Products above a specified threshold of nicotine are only allowed on the market if authorised as medicinal products, like nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) and would therefore have to comply with the legislative framework put in place by medicinal legislation similar to current NRT products.</p><p>The proposal is being discussed in the European Parliament and Council of Ministers and the Commission hope to have it adopted in 2014. Good progress has been made to date in the negotiations .The main objective of this proposal is to reduce the attractiveness of tobacco products, particularly to children and young people. This Directive will have a very positive impact on the health of Europeans. I have been very supportive of this proposal throughout Ireland's Presidency of the European Union and will continue to advance it at every opportunity  .</p></reply>

Other key provisions included in the Bill:-</p><p>  (i) a prohibition on the unsupervised  use of sunbeds in a sunbed premises;</p><p>  (ii) an exemption for medical purposes;</p><p>  (iii) control on the remote sale or hire of sunbeds (internet  transactions); </p><p>  (iv) sunbed operators, sellers and hirers will be required to notify the HSE;</p><p>  (v) a requirement that sunbed operators provide training for staff; </p><p>  (vi) an enforcement regime and the imposition of penalties for non-compliance; </p><p>  (vii) an obligation on all sunbed operators to provide protective eyewear to users;</p><p>  (viii) a requirement that warning signs be displayed in all sunbed premises;</p><p>  (ix) a prohibition on certain promotional marketing practices;</p><p>  (x) a requirement on operators to ensure that sunbed users are made fully aware of the potential dangers of sunbed use; and a related provision whereby sunbed users are required to sign to confirm that they have been made so aware. </p><p>  I am delighted to be in a position to confirm that the drafting of the Bill has been completed and that the Bill has been notified to the EU Commission under the EU Transparency Directive - a process that will take a minimum of 3 months to complete. Following completion of the Commission's process, the Bill will be published and initiated in the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

SafetyNet is funded by the HSE to provide a basic GP service for the most vulnerable Roma, including Roma children, who would otherwise not have access to GP services. Following a successful pilot phase of the SafetyNet Roma GP mobile clinic between September and December 2012, which welcomed more than 100 members of the Roma community, funding has been provided by the HSE Social Inclusion Department to implement the primary healthcare initiative for another year on the grounds of Tallaght hospital.</p><p>  This service is viewed as a first step in a process of supporting vulnerable service users to access health care and alleviating some of the health inequalities experienced by the Roma population in Ireland.  This initiative is viewed as a short term measure whilst a longer term solution to this matter is found nationally.  The establishment of the service is also in response to the Council of the European Union requesting that all EU countries address the care of the Roma medical needs for those residents in their respective EU countries.  It also ties in with recommendations under the <i>National Intercultural Health Strategy 2007-2012</i>.</p><p>  The annual service costs approximately &euro;23,000 for medical care and a further &euro;11,000.00 towards costs of interpreting, translations and supporting links to community services for Roma who need assistance to apply for social welfare etc.</p><p>  In relation to the other cultural group mentioned by the Deputy, i.e. Irish Travellers, the provision of a GP mobile clinic is not required because most Travellers can avail of GP services through the medical card scheme.  All other groups mentioned by the Deputy are nationalities and all individuals can avail of medical services in Ireland in line with agreed eligibility requirements regardless of nationality.</p></reply>

The HSE either directly provides or contracts disability agencies such as St Michael House to provide a range of disability services through service level arrangements.    </p><p>St Michael's House received over &euro;70 million in 2012 in funding from the HSE to provide a range of services to approximately 1,660 children and adults with an intellectual disability in over 170 centres in the Greater Dublin Area and Navan Co. Meath. </p><p>The HSE and St Michael's House work in close collaboration with regard to the funding and delivery of services to people with an intellectual disability. As a voluntary  agency, St Michael's house are obliged to work within the resources available to  them and in that regard have introduced significant efficiencies over recent  years to remain within budget. The HSE has advised that these changes to date have not resulted in service contraction.  </p><p>The Haddington Road Agreement (HRA) sets out measures relating to productivity, cost extraction and reform which together intends to achieve a required pay bill reduction of &euro;150m identified in the HSE Service Plan 2013. The agreement provides a framework and opportunities for managers within the health services, including agencies such as St Michael's House, to reduce their costs associated with agency and overtime and a wide range of other pay costs, particularly through measures such as additional working hours and revised rates in respect of overtime.   </p><p>The HSE has advised the Department of Health that the recent application of additional budget cuts under the HRA has presented a significant challenge to St Michael's House.   A process is now underway between the HSE and St Michael's House to identify the impact of these budget reductions on services.   The Department of Health has received assurances from the HSE that both organisations are committed to working within the terms of the HRA to ensure that services are impacted upon only as a measure of last resort.  </p><p>In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service issues they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

The paediatric service at Tallaght Hospital will, along with Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin and Children's University Hospital Temple Street, move to the new hospital when it is built. </p><p>Bringing the three hospitals together follows on from the recommendation of the 2006 McKinsey report that Ireland can support only one world-class tertiary paediatric hospital.</p><p>In advance of the move to the new hospital, I believe it is critically important that the three hospitals become operationally integrated. I have therefore established the Children's Hospital Group comprising the two hospitals and the Tallaght paediatric service, appointed Dr Jim Browne as Chair of the Children's Hospital Group Board, and last month appointed a further nine members to the Board. The CHGB will oversee the operational integration of the three existing paediatric hospitals in advance of the move to the new hospital.</p><p>In this regard, it will build on the cooperation and integration already underway among the three hospitals, which are working together as a paediatric network to provide the best possible outcomes for children. This includes transferring children from one hospital to another within the network where necessary for best outcomes. In this context, children requiring specialist orthopaedic treatment are transferred from Tallaght to Crumlin to avail of specialist paediatric care. This equates to 7% of children requiring access to paediatric orthopaedic services, with the vast majority (93%) of children attending Tallaght Hospital paediatric Emergency Department being treated and followed up in Tallaght. This does not represent any downgrading of the paediatric service at Tallaght, the staff of which will continue to play a vital role in the provision of paediatric acute services as part of the Children's Hospital Group and, ultimately, in the new children's hospital. </p></reply>

The Health Service Executive continues a catch up programme for measles vaccination which was completed in secondary schools during the 2012/13 academic year and will commence in primary schools during the 2013/14 academic year. During this campaign the MMR vaccine will be offered to primary level students who have not completed their two dose MMR vaccination schedule. </p><p>  The Health Service Executive have also reported that the 2011-2012 National Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Vaccine Campaign, which provides protection against the main viruses associated with cervical cancer, has been well received.  HSE figures show that almost 86% of first year girls in second level schools have received their three vaccine doses, which exceeds the international target of 80%.

However,  the HSE has discretion to grant a medical card in certain circumstances. Medical card applicants who are unsuccessful following the means assessment, but who indicate that they suffer from a medical condition, are then referred to the Medical Officer for consideration on a medical discretionary basis.  </p><p>  All applications for a Medical Card are assessed under the National Assessment Guidelines. In accordance with these guidelines, all Medical Card applications are first assessed on income grounds. Where an applicant is over the income threshold applicable to them to qualify for a Medical Card their application is considered on discretionary grounds. Discretionary medical circumstances are considered by the Medical Officer within the context of the applicant's household income.</p><p>  In cases where a Medical Card is required in emergency circumstances, such as for terminal illness or for a serious medical issue, an Emergency Medical Card may be issued. Such an application can be initiated through the Local Health Office whose manager has access to a dedicated fax and e-mail contact line to the PCRS. Details of this procedure have been made available to all GPs and Social Workers. Such cards will be issued within 24 hours. </p><p>As before, no means test applies to an application by a terminally ill patient and all terminally ill patients will be provided with a Medical Card number for a period of six months once their medical condition is verified by a GP or a consultant.</p></reply>

It continues to develop oral health information programmes for children, people with oral cancer, people with special needs, older people and the general population. In addition, water fluoridation and the use of appropriate fluorides, including toothpastes, is a major plank of public health policy in Ireland in the prevention and management of tooth decay. At present a University College Cork led research project, "Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth" (FACCT) is being conducted. This will assess the effectiveness of oral health promotion initiatives and inform national policy and planning of future oral health promotion activities.</p><p>  The HSE provides a range of oral health services to children and special needs patients through the Public Dental Service and to medical card holders through the Dental Treatment Services Scheme. Information for the public regarding all available services, including eligibility and entitlement is available on the HSE&rsquo;s website or from local health centres.</p></reply>

In relation to mobility equipment, occupational therapists carry out assessments and review applications in light of the individual's current and ongoing needs, with the priority being to provide functional mobility for indoor and short distance outdoor use.</p><p>All professionals providing community based services, including occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and public health nurses, will be aware of the prioritisation criteria and will provide any necessary and urgent items of equipment following appropriate assessment as soon as possible. However, the health service as a whole has to operate within the parameters of funding available to it and given the current economic environment, this has become a major challenge for all stakeholders, including the HSE, voluntary service providers, services users and their families.</p><p>Additional factors that may impact on the waiting time for the provision of wheelchairs include: - </p><p>Assessment - In order to provide a safe, high quality, value for money and client centred service a comprehensive assessment of need takes place and this may involve a number of professionals. The assessment process may include a physical assessment (such as assessing visual perception, cognitive factors, risk awareness etc), trialling a number of different wheelchairs and involve a number of wheelchair suppliers prior to ordering wheelchair and issuing to client. This process can take a number of weeks depending on, for example, the complexity of the client's physical and sensory needs, the needs of the carer and the environment in which the wheelchair will be used.</p><p>Customisation - Some clients who have very specific needs are much more difficult to accommodate and their chairs may need to be customized for them. The waiting time for customised wheelchairs alone can be 8 - 12 weeks as these wheelchairs are manufactured overseas.</p><p>Assistive Technology - In the case of some children who require Assistive Technology in order to operate the wheelchair, they must be referred to the Assistive Technology clinic in the Central Remedial Clinic in Dublin.  As this is a national service there can be a period of waiting for assessment and fitting of controls.</p><p>In relation to wheelchair repairs, the HSE endeavours to see clients as quickly as possible, however, waiting time for completion may vary according to the kind of repair needed and the availability of parts.  </p></reply>

While raised PSA levels can indicate prostate cancer, they can also arise in cases of certain benign prostate conditions, e.g. prostatitis.  On average, two out of every three men who have a raised PSA level will not, on further examination, turn out to have prostate cancer.  Also, there are cases of prostate cancer were raised PSA levels do not occur. </p><p>An international safety notice issued at the end of June stating that a particular Siemens PSA test kit had a positive bias, i.e. they were reading 20% to 23% higher than other similar tests and relative to the WHO standard.  Upon receipt of this notice, Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown immediately ceased PSA testing using the Siemens test kit. </p><p>An incident management team was set up on receipt of the field safety notice to address any potential risks. The testing kits in question were used at Connolly Hospital between February and June 2013 and 2186 patients were tested during that period.  Of these patients, 162 received a result which may have indicated a need for further investigation.     On 1 July Connolly Hospital wrote to GPs and Urologists informing them of the issue and advising that re-testing was available if required.  GPs and Urologists were then in a position to inform patients and to make a clinical decision on any need for follow-up.  As a further precautionary step, the hospital is reviewing the results of the 162 patients to determine if they feel that any further actions are necessary.</p></reply>

The level of health services to be delivered within the available funding for 2013 has been set out in the HSE National Service Plan for 2013, which I approved in January.  The HSE will provide in the order of &euro;1.5 billion in 2013 to fund health services for children and adults with disabilities, including autism.  This represents approximately 11.5% of the &euro;13.3 billion health budget for 2013.  It should also be noted that while the HSE provides a range of services to adults and children with disabilities, the majority of this funding is distributed through non-statutory agencies who deliver over 80% of all disability services.</p><p>  The Government has decided that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet its fiscal and budgetary targets. The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction. This policy requires the health service to reduce its workforce to 98,938 wholetime equivalent employees by the end of 2013.  However, the HSE can make staff appointments once it remains within its overall employment ceiling and has the financial resources to do so.</p><p>  The particular issue raised by the Deputy is a service matter for the Health Service Executive.  Accordingly I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The HSE either directly provides or contracts disability agencies such as St Michael House to provide a range of disability services through service level arrangements.    </p><p>St Michael's House received over &euro;70 million in 2012 in funding from the HSE to provide a range of services to approximately 1,660 children and adults with an intellectual disability in over 170 centres in the Greater Dublin Area and Navan Co. Meath. </p><p>The HSE and St Michael's House work in close collaboration with regard to the funding and delivery of services to people with an intellectual disability. As a voluntary  agency, St Michael's house are obliged to work within the resources available to  them and in that regard have introduced significant efficiencies over recent  years to remain within budget. The HSE has advised that these changes to date have not resulted in service contraction.  </p><p>The Haddington Road Agreement (HRA) sets out measures relating to productivity, cost extraction and reform which together intends to achieve a required pay bill reduction of &euro;150m identified in the HSE Service Plan 2013. The agreement provides a framework and opportunities for managers within the health services, including agencies such as St Michael's House, to reduce their costs associated with agency and overtime and a wide range of other pay costs, particularly through measures such as additional working hours and revised rates in respect of overtime.   </p><p>The HSE has advised the Department of Health that the recent application of additional budget cuts under the HRA has presented a significant challenge to St Michael's House.   A process is now underway between the HSE and St Michael's House to identify the impact of these budget reductions on services.   The Department of Health has received assurances from the HSE that both organisations are committed to working within the terms of the HRA to ensure that services are impacted upon only as a measure of last resort.  </p></reply>

It is estimated that there are approximately 200 children in Ireland today who may be suitable for a second implant. </p><p>  The HSE has been working closely with Beaumont Hospital to progress plans for bilateral cochlear implantation, and a business case has now been finalised which sets out a number of options for the provision of this service, and estimated costs associated with these.

Nursing and midwifery metrics are operational in a range of sites nationally. </p><p>  In 2012 the HSE Office of Nursing and Midwifery Services led on an initiative to standardise nursing and midwifery metrics across 3 regions &ndash; North West, North East and Dublin North. To date 29 service areas are using metrics and reports in relation to the metrics are available to the relevant Directors of Nursing/Midwifery. Further roll out of this initiative has continued in 2013. </p><p>  Measuring the quality of nursing and midwifery care is complex as there are many compounding factors that exist that impact on quality and patient safety. The aim of the HSE Office of Nursing and Midwifery Services is to support Directors of Nursing and Midwifery to utilise a standardised approach to nursing and midwifery metric measurement that will facilitate measurement, monitoring and trend analysis. Roll out of nursing and midwifery metrics is led by the Directors of Nursing/Midwifery within the relevant service areas. A range of metrics has been developed and roll out is determined by local service priorities.  </p></reply>

The Commission's current legislative proposals are designed to accelerate the achievement of these policy objectives.  Whilst air traffic management is a key element in the overall air transport market and thus impacts on stakeholders such as airports and airspace users, the implications of these proposals relate principally to the thirty seven air navigation service providers across Europe, including the Irish Aviation Authority.     Given the over-riding performance improvement focus of the SES initiative, the main implications for service providers will be the continued achievement of further efficiencies in the delivery of their navigation services to their customer airlines, airports and other airspace users. The Irish Aviation Authority is already one of the most efficient providers, compared to its European peers, and its charges are amongst the lowest in Europe. In relation to the implications for airports, only Dublin Airport exceeds the traffic threshold of  70,000 air transport movements per annum and accordingly other Irish airports are largely unaffected by this Single European Sky legislative package, apart from some general provisions concerning certification requirements with regard to the safety, quality and security of air navigation services (principally air traffic control) provided at these airports. </p><p>  My Department circulated these proposals to a wide range of stakeholders in the Irish aviation sector. The technical nature of the proposals warranted a targeted approach to those stakeholders principally concerned with airspace utilisation and optimisation. Comments were invited from over 40 organisations and comments were received from five.  My Department is in the process of analysing these submissions and envisages that they will be an important and helpful contribution in the negotiations on these proposals.</p></reply>

To assist in setting these limits, my Department issued Guidelines for the Application of Special Speed Limits to all local authorities in January 2011, and the onus is on local authorities to take them into account in relation to any special speed limits which they set.</p><p>  As part of a Direction given by the then Minister in January 2011, all local authorities were requested to undertake an assessment of Special Speed Limits in their functional areas. I do not believe that the local authorities sufficiently engaged with this direction and, in 2012, I announced that a review of speed limits would be undertaken.</p><p>  My Department formed a stakeholder group to progress this Review and the Automobile Association, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority, the National Roads Authority, representatives of local authorities and the National Transport Authority accepted my invitation to participate in the Working Group.

The paper poses a number of questions and covers eight broad areas: Airports; Air Services; Regulation and Governance; Aircraft Leasing and Finance; Aerospace, Education and Training; General Aviation; and Sustainability.</p><p>  A total of 74 submissions were received in response to the consultation, from a wide range of stakeholders. The number and quality of the submissions received is very encouraging and demonstrates the strong interest there is in shaping future aviation policy.  </p><p>  The submissions are currently being reviewed and the intention is that a draft National Aviation Policy Statement will be issued before the end of the year, which will provide further opportunity for stakeholder input before the adoption of the new policy document in early 2014. </p></reply>

In relation to the award of Public Service Obligation (PSO) contracts for the bus market, this falls under the remit of the National Transport Authority (NTA).  The NTA is currently considering how best publicly subvented bus services will be provided in the future. The direct award contracts for the provision of PSO bus market services held by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann expire late next year.  The awarding of the licenses for the services thereafter is a matter for the NTA, and not for Government, but I have kept the Cabinet updated on the process.   </p><p>  Where the NTA proposes to enter into a further direct award contract or contracts for bus services it is obliged to carry out a statutory consultation under section 52 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  Under the legislation, if the NTA proposes to enter into direct award contracts, the relevant section states that  &ldquo;it may only do so where it is satisfied that the continued adequacy of the public bus passenger services to which the contracts relate can only be guaranteed in the general economic interest by entering into such direct award contracts&quot;.  If it is not so satisfied, it must provide for some level of competitive tendering.  As explained above, this is not a decision for the Government or for me.  </p><p>The NTA is conducting its work in accordance with the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 and statutory consultations in relation to the matter commenced on 11th September and will conclude on 11th October. The NTA expects to announce its decision on how it intends to proceed before the end of the year. </p><p>  It should be noted that it will be open to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann to tender for any routes or bundles of routes that are tendered. The contract will go to the best competent tenderer who can provide the best service for the least subsidy. I should be disappointed if the outcome of tendering is anything other than an improvement in services or no reduction in service at the very least.</p></reply>

This contact was initiated by NASA with a view to ascertaining the Search and Rescue capabilities available in Ireland's Search and Rescue Region.  This is a standard approach from organisations such as NASA as they need to factor in these considerations into their operations planning and in particular in the event of a launch failure which may fall within the Irish area of responsibility. </p><p>It is not envisaged that any new systems or equipment will need to be made available to meet any emergencies arising in respect of NASA missions and neither is it envisaged that the State will incur any additional  costs in that regard. The operational cost to the State of responding to any vessels, craft, airplanes or persons in distress at sea is not a charge that is passed on to those requiring assistance.

The Council discussions on this issue on Monday the 16th of September 2013 were of an informal nature and were arranged for the purposes of holding a preliminary exchange of views on the Commission&rsquo;s proposals.  No decision or agreement was scheduled to be reached at this Informal Council.  A wide-ranging discussion was held during which the objectives of the Single European Sky were fully endorsed and supported. There was however a prevailing view that the Commission&rsquo;s proposals are somewhat premature and that insufficient time is being given to allow existing legislative measures to be fully implemented.  In these circumstances, there is accordingly a doubt on the supplementary value of introducing additional legislative measures at this point towards the achievement of the Single European Sky.</p><p>  In relation to further discussions on these proposals in the short-term, the position in this respect remains to be clarified as the Lithuanian EU Presidency already has a comprehensive programme of other important matters on its agenda.</p></reply>

While I understand the concerns expressed by the Deputy of the impact on domestic tourism providers, these are independent decisions made by schools for educational reasons.  While this may lead to some children returning to school in the last week in August, those same children will have other days off during the school year which may allow families the opportunity to take a short break at other times during the year and so provide additional business for the tourism sector during the quieter months.</p><p>  While domestic tourism is really important, I do not believe that a child's education or the school year should be arranged to suit tourism.</p></reply>

There is a growing appreciation that streets should not just be transport corridors, but rather should be places in which people want to live and spend time. To that end, my Department, together with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, launched a Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets (DMURS) in March 2013.    </p><p>  The Manual, which is available on my Department's website , sets out design guidance and standards for constructing new and reconfiguring existing urban roads and streets in Ireland. It aims to end the practice of designing streets as exclusively traffic corridors and instead focuses on their wider use to include for pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users. DMURS emphasises the role of streets as social spaces, where people come first and uses practical examples from Irish cities and towns to show how these issues can be designed for and managed successfully. The transformation envisaged is not to the total exclusion of the car but is rather about achieving a better balance in how our urban roads and streets are designed and used.  In recent years, many local authorities in Ireland have been to the forefront of modern street design that supports sustainability objectives.</p></reply>

There may, however, be costs associated with the required medical examination for certification of fitness to drive.  Given that age-related deteriorations can have a serious impact on ability to drive, the practice of requiring certification of fitness on a periodic basis for older drivers is widely recognised internationally.   I have no role in determining medical charges or matters relating to the scope of medical card cover.   </p><p>  With regard to the correspondent's objection to producing an up to date photo every three years, I can advise that under the new licensing regime, photographs will be captured digitally as part of the processing service by the RSA.

This study asked Member States to comment on the effectiveness of the Directive and its possible extension to include light goods vehicles and cars in the scope of vehicles requiring speed limiters to be fitted.        Ireland has taken the position (expressed through the Road Safety Authority) that there is currently no justification to extend the scope of this Directive to other categories of vehicles.   </p><p>  I understand that the European Commission is currently collating the findings of this study and that no resulting impact analysis or formal proposal has yet been issued.</p></reply>
