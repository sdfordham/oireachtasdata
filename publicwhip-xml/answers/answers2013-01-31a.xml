    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-31a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013013100047#WRA00500"><p>Ireland&rsquo;s electricity system is made up of larger electrical lines (the transmission grid) and smaller electrical lines (the distribution grid).  Small area renewable energy projects feed into the distribution network.  The Distribution System Operator (DSO) and owner in Ireland is ESB Networks.  ESB Networks has a webpage which explains to the public how to connect a microgenerator, which is the main type of small area renewable energy project.  This page includes a connection guide and outlines the steps involved.  It also contains a series of &ldquo;Frequently Asked Questions&rdquo; for those wishing to connect.  The page also contains a document that sets out the specific Irish protection settings appropriate to the ESB Network, known as EN 50438.</p><p>  There is no charge to connect a micro-generator to the ESB network provided it complies with EN50438.  The micro-generator must in addition conform to the conditions governing the connection and operation of micro-generation contained on the ESB webpage.  Generators with an installed capacity of 1MW or less are deemed to be automatically authorised and licensed by the Commission for Energy Regulation under the terms of S.I. 383 and S.I. 384 of 2008 and are subject to the conditions in those orders.  This system was introduced in order to promote microgeneration.  The Department of Environment introduced two statutory instruments that contain planning exemptions for renewable technologies that meet certain criteria.  These were introduced to facilitate microgeneration and are contained in S.I. 83 of 2007 and S.I. 235 of 2008.</p><p>  When microgenerators that connect to the distribution system wish to export electricity, they need to install an import/export meter.  The ESB websites indicate that where a customer requires import/export metering, they can contact ESB for a quotation for this.  The Commission for Energy Regulation previously wrote to all electricity suppliers in Ireland inviting them to introduce microgeneration tariffs for customers exporting to the grid using microgenerators.  To date, the only company to have introduced such a scheme is Electric Ireland (formerly ESB Customer Supply), which offers a tariff of 9 cent per kilowatt hour for domestic customers under specified conditions.</p><p>  In addition, for small area renewable generation projects that can fulfil certain terms and conditions (e.g. have planning permission, have a grid connection and can secure a power purchase agreement (PPA)), the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources operates the REFIT schemes, which are funded from the Public Service Obligation.  Small hydro and biomass projects are included in these schemes.</p></reply>

They are the Kinsale, Ballycotton and Seven Heads gas fields, which are located in the Celtic Sea approximately 50km off the Cork coast.  Ireland does not have any oil producing fields.  In the year to 30 September 2012 total production from all three fields amounted to just under 7.8 billion cubic feet of gas.  Approximately, 6.6 billion cubic feet was produced from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields, and just under 1.2 billion cubic feet from the Seven Heads field.</p><p>  As royalties at a rate of 12.5% are payable in respect of production from both the Kinsale and Ballycotton Fields, my Department receives data on the value of the gas produced from these fields.  Based on the data provided, the value of the gas produced from the Kinsale and Ballycotton fields in the year to end September 2012 was &euro;48 million.  The Seven Heads gas field came into production after the fiscal terms had been revised and accordingly, royalties do not apply.  As a result, while my Department receives data on the volume of gas produced, it does not receive data on the value of that gas.</p><p>  The only other commercial discovery of oil or gas in the Irish offshore is the Corrib gas field, which is estimated will commence production towards the end of next year.  The three gas fields in Kinsale area are nearing depletion and currently supply approximately 5% of Ireland&rsquo;s gas requirements.  It is estimated that the Corrib gas field when in peak production could supply up to 60% of Ireland&rsquo;s gas requirements. </p></reply>

Research by Boston Consulting Group cited in the recent UPC report on Ireland&rsquo;s Digital Future, estimates it will grow from a current rate of about 3% to 6% by 2016.  Research currently underway in the context of the National Digital Strategy will look further at this value and ways it might be enhanced.  Specific examples of the importance and potential of the digital economy can also be cited.  As Deputies are aware there is substantial employment in Ireland in the ICT and digital sectors arising from the presence of world leading companies in these areas based in Ireland.  In addition, smaller indigenous companies are also making an important contribution.  For example, the Digital Hub in Dublin currently caters for 66 digital enterprises, which between them employ some 800 people.  More than three-quarters (78%) of these companies expanded their business operations last year, with 44% hiring additional staff.  Two-thirds are planning to expand their workforce this year.  In addition the National Digital Research Centre (NDRC) has helped to create 155 full-time jobs and 66 part-time jobs by the end of 2012 as a direct result of the projects it has supported.</p><p>  Considerable progress has been made in recent years in both the coverage and speeds of national broadband infrastructure, with a multiplicity of commercial operators providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  The Government has also undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where commercial operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan recognises that the key imperative now is to ensure high speed broadband availability to all.  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020.</p><p>  Encouraging citizens to connect to the Internet is a separate but related challenge, and a number of public and private sector measures are already underway in this area.  The most recent Central Statistics Office (CSO) statistics &ndash; published in December last - show that 19% of households do not have an Internet connection.  That is not to say they cannot get an Internet connection.  CSO statistics indicate that not having an Internet connection is primarily a matter of choice by those households &ndash; with respondents in those households mostly indicating they do not want or need access to the Internet.  The issue therefore is substantially one of demand which underlines the importance of awareness raising.</p><p>  The National Broadband Plan commits to the publication of a National Digital Strategy (NDS) aimed at stimulating demand for broadband services and connectivity.  The NDS will focus on the benefits of digital engagement and will build on existing measures to increase awareness amongst citizens, households and business.  As part of the strategy, I recently appointed David Puttnam as Ireland&rsquo;s National Digital Champion.  An important element of engaging citizens is the development of skills.  The &ldquo;BenefIT&rdquo; schemes operated by my Department have worked in partnership with third sector and not-for-profit organisations and has provided basic skills training for over 70,000 people at over 700 locations nationwide.</p><p>  My Department is also working in partnership with the Department of Education and Skills to roll out high speed broadband connectivity to all second level schools.  This is already facilitating new possibilities for students and could potentially help to stimulate take up in households.</p><p>  The commercial sector also has a strong role to play in stimulating demand for Internet services.  The explosion in the use of smart phones and tablet devices, increased availability of applications such as video-on-demand, and initiatives by Internet services providers to make technology more accessible to targeted segments of society, will continue to impact on the level of take up.  As part of the National Digital Strategy, my Department will work closely with the commercial sector to build on these initiatives, with a view to ensuring that citizens, business and communities realise more fully the potential of a digitally enabled society.  I do not believe that society here is digitally complacent.  The evidence shows that digital engagement continues to grow.  I am, however, very conscious of the further potential and the National Digital Strategy will be looking at ways to add impetus in terms of engagement.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-31a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013013100048#WRB00300"><p>Under Directive 2009/28/EC, Ireland was assigned a legally binding target of 16% by 2020 for the percentage of all energy consumption that must be met from renewable sources.  Ireland intends to meet the overall target through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport, which is a minimum binding target, and 12% renewable heating, which together amount to 16% overall.</p><p>  In terms of the 40% renewable electricity to be achieved by 2020, the ability to meet this is largely determined by the grid connection offers to renewable generators.  The grid connection process is vested in the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  CER published a Gate 3 direction in December 2008, which was specifically designed with the intention of providing for sufficient renewable energy grid connection offers to achieve 40% renewable electricity by 2020.  In addition, the CER published a decision on the connection of small, low carbon renewable generators outside the Gate process (CER 09/99).  This mechanism specifically provides for the ability of small anaerobic digesters, biomass CHP plants, wave and tidal devices and other non-wind renewable low carbon generators to connect to the grid outside of the Gate process by 2020.</p><p>  The Gate 3 grid connection direction includes a list of specific renewable generating projects to receive grid connections.  The vast bulk of these are onshore wind developments.  Hence, onshore wind will make up the bulk of the delivery of the 40% renewable electricity target.  The Government decided in 2012 that an offshore wind feed-in-tariff (REFIT) would not be offered at this time.  REFIT is available as a support from onshore wind projects.  Accordingly, in meeting our legal obligation to deliver the 2020 renewables target, the policy focus and incentive relates to onshore wind.  The REFIT support for onshore wind is significantly less than what would be required for offshore wind.  It is borne by electricity consumers through the Public Service Obligation.</p><p>  In the First Progress Report on the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP), available on my Department&rsquo;s website, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) modelling indicated that 3,521 MW of wind would be needed on the electricity grid by 2020 in order to achieve our 40% renewable electricity target.  This is approximately a doubling on current levels of wind generation.  In addition, the NREAP progress report modelling also forecasts other technologies contributing to our 40% target - 274 MW of biomass technologies by 2020 as well as 75 MW of wave and tidal technology.  It is evident, however, that wind generated electricity is expected to play a pivotal role and this will be overwhelmingly onshore wind.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Ed Davey, and I signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on cooperation in energy last week.  This MoU is a signal of intent.  It gives us an opportunity to fully consider how Irish renewable energy resources, onshore and offshore, might be developed to the mutual benefit of Ireland and the UK.  The MoU commits us to a programme of work and a possible formal Inter-Governmental agreement with the UK if it is considered mutually beneficial to enter such an agreement.</p></reply>

In addition the Department oversees important programmes funded from the Vote, and administers the Corporate Governance function in respect of some 15 commercial and non-commercial agencies and 3 regulators.  These entities have a total employment of some 20,450 and in their own right discharge functions which are critical to the ongoing economic and social development of the country.</p><p>  In addition, in the first half of 2013 as part of Ireland&#8217;s EU Presidency, the Department will have responsibility for a very heavy EU agenda in the areas of Energy and Communications.  As the Deputy will appreciate there are numerous work programmes under the aegis of my Department and Agencies flowing from the broad responsibilities set out above.  In this regard key priorities for me in 2013 are, in brief, as follows:</p><p><i>Energy</i></p><p>  - Delivering Energy Efficiency Strategies, Programmes and Funding Mechanisms for business, public sector and domestic housing.</p><p>  - Ensuring progressive delivery on Ireland&#8217;s legally binding EU renewable electricity, heat and transport targets and supporting the economic development of onshore and offshore renewable energy resources for the domestic and export markets.</p><p>  - Ensuring security of energy supply through encouraging cost effective timely investment in energy infrastructure.</p><p>  - Promoting the competitiveness of energy costs for business and the consumer through actions to address controllable costs, bearing in mind that Ireland has little control over the factors contributing to energy costs given our reliance on imported fossil fuels.</p><p>  - Implementation of the Energy State Assets Divestment Programme in line with Government policy and in cooperation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and NewERA.</p><p><i>Communications</i></p><p>  - Implementation of the National Broadband Plan published in August 2012.</p><p>  - Publication of a National Digital Strategy.</p><p>  - Continued roll out of 100 Mbs scheme to all 2<sup>nd</sup> level schools (to be completed by 2014).</p><p>  - Ensuring the appropriate regulatory frameworks are in place to enable ComReg to properly promote and incentivise continued investment in infrastructure and the provision of competitive products and services.</p><p>  - Publication of a National Digital Strategy in early 2013 aimed at setting out a compelling case for increased digital adoption right across society, with particular emphasis on small businesses, education and citizens.</p><p><i>Broadcasting</i></p><p>  - Completion, consideration and actioning as appropriate of the study on introduction of Public Sector Broadcasting charge.</p><p>  - Consideration of, and policy response, to Broadcasting Authority of Ireland&#8217;s (BAI) review of Public Funding for Public Service Broadcasters.</p><p><i>Postal</i></p><p>  - In cooperation with An Post, maintenance of national network of post offices and postal services, and of a financially viable position for the Company.</p><p>  - Launch of tender and completion of procurement for introduction of National Postcode system.</p><p><i>Natural Resources</i></p><p>  - Promotion and regulatory oversight of off-shore and on-shore mineral and petroleum exploration and extraction.</p><p>  - Progression of EPA study into hydraulic fracturing.</p><p>  - Publication and enactment of the Minerals Development Bill.</p><p>  - Implementation of 2013 Atlantic Regional Seismic Survey.</p><p><i>Other</i></p><p>  - Effective management of the Department&#8217;s Voted Estimates to ensure no overruns in expenditure in 2013.</p><p>  - Implementation of and input into the public sector reform programme.</p><p>  - Efficient and effective discharge of all matters within the Department&#8217;s competence, notably in the areas of Energy and Communications, arising from Ireland&#8217;s EU Presidency and more generally inputting into EU policy, taking full account of Irish interests.</p></reply>

To date, these media have not been subject to a formal regulatory regime akin to that used to &lsquo;regulate&rsquo; traditional radio and television broadcast media, either in Ireland or in other jurisdictions.  There is a range of reasons for this, not least the rapidly evolving nature of the technologies involved, the sensitivities around regulating media and the multi-jurisdictional nature of the Internet.</p><p>  It is important to acknowledge the economic and social benefits that the widespread use of social media have brought to people, communities and to business.  However, some of the issues that have arisen as a consequence of this bear consideration.  These challenges include dealing with harassment and bullying online, as well as issues around defamation, data protection and even copyright.  There has been a very considerable amount of discussion on these matters in the recent past at EU and Council of Europe level, in which my Department has been involved.  Indeed this matter is also the subject of a fundamental debate at EU and national level at present, a fact reflected by the recent decision of the Joint Oireachtas Committee to examine the issue.</p><p>  As Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I have policy responsibility for providing a supportive legislative and regulatory environment to facilitate the development of high quality communications infrastructure and services.  However, I should highlight that I do not have sole responsibility for addressing as to how that infrastructure is used.  Responsibility, in the context of abuse over the Internet in particular, also sits with the Minister for Justice and Equality, and the executive agency of his Department, the Office for Internet Safety.</p><p>  It is clear that there are no simple answers to the challenges posed by the development and abuse of social media, not least because of the international basis of the services and because any possible policy responses fall across a range of Government Departments.  In recognition of this complexity my Department maintains open and regular contact with all Departments and State Agencies with responsibilities in this area.  My Department also monitors international developments with a view to ensuring that domestic policy within its remit reflects best practice and that the regulatory framework is amended as necessary.  In that regard, I look forward to the deliberations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications, and I also look forward to meeting the Committee on this subject.</p></reply>

The Government has also undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where commercial operators have been unable to offer services.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p><p>  The Government, through the National Broadband Plan, which I published on 30 August last year, has recognised that the key imperative now is to ensure high speed broadband availability to all.  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30 Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020.  Ireland is now therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband in Ireland which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country.</p><p>  As a consequence of the recent multi-band spectrum auction conducted by ComReg, new high speed 4G telecoms services will be rolled out by mobile operators and will significantly increase the speeds available across wireless platforms.  In addition, the commercial sector is already investing in high speed fixed line services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  This will ensure that citizens or businesses, wherever they are located, have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business.</p></reply>

The Plan covers all areas, including semi-urban areas of the country.  It commits to high speed broadband availability across the country, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020.  Specifically, it commits to:</p><p>  - 70 Mbps to 100 Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015;</p><p>  - At least 40 Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% - and potentially as much as 35% - of the population, and </p><p>  - A minimum of 30 Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country. </p><p>  It is not possible for me to say how these targets will compare to the speeds that will prevail in other countries.  It is the case, in Europe and elsewhere, that all countries are seeking solutions to the challenge of rolling out high speed services.  It is Ireland&rsquo;s intention to achieve the EU target of 30 Mbps to all, well ahead of the target date of 2020.  In any event, when making comparisons of speeds with other countries, care needs to be taken to compare like with like.  In Ireland we have a highly dispersed low density population which is in contrast to some other countries, for example in Scandinavia, which have a low population density but whose population is not as highly dispersed.</p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70 Mbps to 100 Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.</p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p></reply>

It is estimated that at least 8.4% of the energy in transport in Ireland in 2020 will come from the use of biofuels with the remainder achieved by the increased deployment of electric vehicles.  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme works by obligating large road transport fuel suppliers to bring a certain amount of biofuels to the market. The scheme was introduced with an obligation on fuel suppliers to include at least 4% by volume biofuels in their overall disposal of road transport fuels.  In order to maintain progress towards achieving the 2020 targets, I increased the obligation to 6% by volume with effect from 1 January 2013.</p><p>  Recently, the European Commission circulated a proposal to amend sections of the Renewable Energy Directive.  This proposal is currently being progressed and is one of the major agenda items for the Irish presidency of the EU.  One of the amendments proposed is that no more than 5% of the energy in the transport sector should come from biofuels produced from certain crops.  My Department is currently examining the proposal and its implications for meeting the target of 10% renewable energy by 2020.  However, there are no implications for the current obligation rate of 6% as the overall energy content delivered by the obligation will not breach the proposed 5%. The obligation rate of 6% will remain the same until the end of 2014.  Decisions on further increases after 2014 will be taken after any amendments to the Renewable Energy Directive have been finalised.</p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation has successfully delivered increased amounts of biofuel in Ireland resulting in 145 million litres being placed on the Irish market in 2011.  Of this, approximately 18.5 million litres was produced indigenously from waste material such as used cooking oil.  Though figures for 2012 are not yet available, I understand that the amount of indigenous biofuel on the market increased last year.  The recent increase in the obligation rate along with future increases will see the biofuel market grow to an estimated 500 million litres by 2020.  This will continue to create opportunities for indigenous industry to produce biofuels here in Ireland. </p></reply>

A copy of the MoU is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The MoU we signed affirms the two States&rsquo; commitment to maintaining a strong partnership on energy issues, to achieving closer integration of electricity markets and to maximising the sustainable use of renewable energy resources.  Ireland has the potential to generate far more wind energy than we could consume domestically.  This MoU gives us an opportunity to fully consider how Irish renewable energy resources, onshore and offshore, might be developed to the mutual benefit of Ireland and the UK.</p><p>  The Renewable Directive provides a number of mechanisms that can be used by Member States for the trade of renewable energy, including joint projects and statistical transfer.  Joint projects are where specified projects located in one country may be counted towards the renewable energy target of another. Statistical transfer is where the excess relating to an overachievement of the target by one country may be sold to another country that has fallen short of its target. The mechanisms require an Inter-Governmental agreement to be put in place. Up to now, while electricity could be exported between jurisdictions, the renewable value in terms of target compliance remained in the country where the renewable energy was produced.  The Directive, for the first time, introduced the concept of the trade in the renewable value of electricity.</p><p>  The opportunity to export green power presents an opportunity for employment growth and export earnings as well as increased investment for Ireland.  There are and will be no Government funds allocated for the construction of wind turbines whether output is for internal or external consumption. In particular, Irish consumers cannot be required to finance electricity that is destined for export.  The price that the UK is willing to pay for the renewable power will need to be sufficient to cover any support mechanism needed by project developers and to finance the new transmission infrastructure required.</p><p>  It is important to note that the MoU is an important signal of intent and an interim step.  There is no formal Inter-Governmental agreement under the Directive in place yet.  There are many complex engineering, market, regulatory and policy issues that need to be teased out, discussed and considered prior to making an Inter-Governmental agreement that provides a formal basis for energy trading.  The cost benefit analysis must support that the trading proposition makes sense.  Nevertheless it is clear that there are significant potential economic and employment benefits arising for both jurisdictions.  Both countries have accordingly agreed on an urgent programme of work over the next year to determine the final contents of any formal Inter-Governmental agreement.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the regulation of the gas market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) which is an independent statutory body.  The rise in utility disconnection numbers in recent years has coincided with the economic recession which has caused customer arrears and debt levels to rise.  The CER regularly briefs me on electricity and gas disconnection reports.  I can advise that the Regulator has recently briefed me on the level of gas disconnections.</p><p>  The figures for gas disconnections show that BGE gas disconnections have approximately doubled from 2011 to 2012, while Flogas and Airtricity also show increases in gas disconnections.  It is the view of the CER that the issue of vacant premises, where customers leave premises empty and a utilities debt unpaid, is also contributing to an overstatement of customer disconnections.  However, it is accepted that it is difficult to quantify the precise numbers.</p><p>  In response to the significant increases in disconnections since 2010, a number of measures have been put in place by the CER to address the issue and assist customers that are in financial hardship and facing disconnections.  In line with the CER&#8217;s Code of Practice on disconnection, gas suppliers must facilitate payment options/plans for domestic customers experiencing genuine hardship and, where appropriate, engage with a money advisor acting on behalf of the customer such as the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) or a recognised charity.  This must include offering the customer a prepayment meter if this is possible.</p><p>  Over the past few years the CER has been working with stakeholders to promote the installation of prepayment or Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) meters in order to assist customers through their financial difficulties.  For example, CER is facilitating a new process within St Vincent de Paul (VdeP) which will see its members encourage households at risk of disconnection to opt for a PAYG meter, to manage debt and assist budgeting, instead of the VdeP paying the overdue amount in the first instance.  This is expected to be rolled out from next month.  The CER also intends to engage with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to establish if there is scope to build in PAYG installations to social housing administration processes.  Following a recent review, the CER has decided to extend to 31 December 2013 the obligation on suppliers to pay 50% of the costs of disconnections/reconnection of domestic customers.  </p><p>  The key message for consumers in genuine difficulty is to make contact with their supplier and agree a plan before the unpaid bills begin to accumulate thus obviate the risk of disconnection. </p><p>Implementation of the measures set out in the Government&#8217;s Affordable<font color="#0000FF"> </font>  Energy Strategy is pivotal to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers.  The Affordable Energy Strategy was published in November 2011 and developed by the Inter-Departmental/Agency Group on Affordable Energy (IDGAE) as part of the Department&#8217;s commitment in the Programme for Government to help address energy poverty.  The Strategy is not required to be reinvigorated as it is a comprehensive plan that addresses all the major areas identified to help mitigate energy poverty.</p><p>  There are forty-eight actions identified in the strategy to be implemented over the life-time of the report (3 years).  Five priority measures are identified including a commitment to review the National Fuel Scheme in the context of examining the feasibility of aligning income supports with the energy efficiency and income of the home, the phased introduction of minimal thermal efficiency standards for rental accommodation, ensuring greater access to energy efficiency measures, reforming the eligibility criteria for energy efficiency schemes and the introduction of an area-based approach.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Affordable Energy Strategy provides a framework for building upon the many measures already in place to protect households at risk from the effects of energy poverty, which include the thermal efficiency-based measures delivered through the Better Energy Warmer Homes programme.  Exchequer funding of over &#8364;101 million has been allocated to the programme since 2000 and has successfully delivered energy efficiency measures to 92,563 homes through a combination of community based organisations, private contractors and via an area-based approach.  The Government will continue to support the delivery of energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households in 2013.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme has been allocated Exchequer funding of &#8364;20 million for 2013, which is expected to result in upgrades to over 10,000 homes.</p></reply>

Reform of the eligibility criteria to address households in extreme energy poverty (those who spend over 20% of their disposable income on energy services) was undertaken in 2012.  Prior to this, applicants were considered eligible for retrofit measures if they met defined criteria such as eligibility for the National Fuel Scheme. The IDGAE worked with key stakeholders to establish new eligibility criteria to target those most in need.  International research demonstrates that the elderly and pre-school children are most at risk.  Taking this on board the criteria were revised to include; Fuel Allowance recipients; Job Seeker Allowance recipients (for over six months and with children under 7 years of age) and; recipients of Family Income Support.</p><p>  An area-based approach was introduced in 2012 and Exchequer funding of &#8364;3 million was ring fenced for this purpose. <i></i>  The Fuel Allowance was reviewed by the Department of Social Protection as part of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in 2011 and in the context of the preparations for Budget 2013.  Work is on-going to collect additional data as part of the process to re-define categories of energy poverty and future policy initiatives will benefit from an improved understanding of energy poverty prevalence.</p><p>  The Better Energy Warmer Homes programme is a pivotal element of the Affordable Energy Strategy.  The energy efficiency measures are targeted at low income families and will make a lasting impact on households experiencing energy poverty.  Exchequer funding of over &#8364;101 million has been allocated to the programme since 2000, which has successfully delivered energy efficiency measures to 92,563 homes through a combination of community based organisations, private contractors and via an area based approach.  In 2012 the programme delivered over 12,175 energy saving measures to homes in energy poverty.  Despite the current economic challenges, the Government is committed to continuing to deliver energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-31a.58.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013013100049#WRC00700"><p>Directive 2009/28/EC known as the Renewable Energy Directive, assigns a legally binding target of 16% on Ireland for the share of renewables in energy consumption by 2020.  This target has to be meet across the electricity, transport and heating sectors and a minimum of 10% in the transport sector is required. Ireland intends to meet the target through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heating, which amounts to 16% of overall energy consumption, commensurate with our target.</p><p>  In terms of the 40% renewable electricity to be achieved by 2020, the ability to meet this is largely determined by the grid connection offers to renewable generators.  The grid connection process is vested in the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  CER published a Gate 3 direction in December 2008, which was specifically designed with the intention of providing for sufficient renewable energy grid connection offers to achieve 40% renewable electricity by 2020.  In addition, the CER published a decision on the connection of small, low carbon renewable generators outside the Gate process (CER 09/99.) This mechanism specifically provides for the ability of small anaerobic digesters, biomass CHP plants, wave and tidal devices and other non-wind renewable low carbon generators to connect to the grid outside of the Gate process by 2020.</p><p>  The Gate 3 grid connection direction includes a list of specific renewable generating projects to receive grid connections.  It can be seen that the vast bulk of these are onshore wind developments.  Hence, wind will make up the bulk of the delivery of the 40% renewable electricity target.  In the First Progress Report on the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP), available on my Department&rsquo;s website, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) modelling indicated that 3,521MW of wind would be needed on the electricity grid by 2020 in order to achieve our 40% renewable electricity target.  This is approximately a doubling on the current position.</p><p>  In addition, the NREAP progress report modelling also forecasts other technologies contributing to our 40% renewable electricity target - 274MW of biomass technologies by 2020 as well as 75MW of wave and tidal technology.  Hydro is expected to contribute 234MW in 2020, largely made up of the large hydropower stations and some smaller generators.  There are several very small hydropower stations already operational in the REFIT schemes.  Wave and tidal energy is still at the RD&amp;D stage of development, however, it is anticipated that some early devices will be available by 2020.  The biomass REFIT 3 scheme opened in 2012 and provides for up to 310MW of biomass generated electricity.  The volume of applications received to date has been positive.</p><p>  The target set under Directive 2009/28/EC is 16% of all energy consumption to be from renewable sources by 2020, up from 3.1% in 2005.  At the end of 2012, SEAI estimates that 6.4% of consumption was from renewable sources.  Achieving our 2020 target will be challenging, however I am confident that it can still be reached.  The rapid development of 2nd generation biofuels will be critical in terms of renewable transport, while maintaining our grid development and grid build on track will be essential if we are to double the renewable electricity on our grid in the next 8 years.</p><p>  In terms of transport, over the coming years, we will see an increase in the number of Electric Vehicles becoming available.  To date, in Ireland, only a very limited number of full battery Electric Vehicle models have been available for consumers.  I expect, possibly later this year, to see the introduction of Plugin Hybrid Electric Vehicles.  Plugin Hybrids use both a battery and an internal combustion engine to power the vehicle using two different types of technology.  One is an advanced version of hybrid technology which has been available for some years now, where the vehicle is powered by the battery and the engine takes over as the power in the battery drops.  Unlike previous hybrids, Plugin Hybrids can be recharged by mains electricity between journeys thus reducing the requirement for the engine to do the same.  The other technology uses the engine as a backup generator so that the vehicle is constantly powered by electricity.  In this area, I also expect to see battery technology improve and journey ranges increase.  I would also expect to see vehicles developed that can run on higher blends of biofuels. Most new petrol vehicles can now run on blends of up to 10% biofuel with diesels capable of handling up to 7% biodiesel.</p><p>  Another area where we will see developments is in relation to vehicles being fuelled by gaseous fuels, such as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), biogas and biomethane.  Though CNG is a fossil fuel, it is cleaner than petrol or diesel producing between 11 and 20 per cent lower carbon emissions per unit of energy produced than diesel.  Biogas, which can be produced locally by anaerobic digestion of waste and plant material, can also be used in certain vehicles, including some which run on CNG.  Furthermore, biogas can be further processed to produce biomethane which can be used as a direct substitute for any Natural Gas product not only in the transport sector, but in the heat and electricity sectors also.  Hydrogen is another fuel which is being looked at by some major motor manufacturers as a fuel for the future but it is uncertain when this technology will become widely available.</p></reply>

Exploration investment is encouraged through an active and targeted promotion campaign, the holding of regular licensing rounds and by supporting petroleum research projects that deepen knowledge of the petroleum potential of the Irish offshore.  Last November, I announced that my Department had designed a major state-of-the-art seismic acquisition programme to provide a regional grid of high quality seismic data over our Atlantic frontier basins.  When complete, the survey will add to the understanding of the petroleum potential of our frontier basins and should provide a boost to our efforts to attract a greater share of mobile international exploration investment to Ireland.</p><p>  Maintaining an appropriate fiscal and broader regulatory regime is also a critical success factor.  To that end my Department will continue to work with the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) to ensure the effective development of a new risk assessment based Petroleum Safety Framework in line with best industry practice.  In addition my Department is working with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to streamline the environmental impact assessment of strategic petroleum projects.</p></reply>

During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.</p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  This exercise will identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years and will therefore inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted. It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aids application in respect of any intervention.  The key is to ensure that all businesses and citizens, wherever they are located, have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business in a digital environment.</p><p>  The Plan also sets out a number of additional actions concerning demand stimulation, spectrum policy, the removal of barriers to infrastructure rollout and maximising the use of State assets.  Progress on the rollout of the Plan is being overseen by a High Level Group, which is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives from Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, OPW, NewERA, ComReg and Forf&aacute;s.</p></reply>

Supervision of the grid connection process is vested in the CER.  Aside from microgeneration that meets specified criteria, all applications by wind generators for connection to the electricity network are processed through the Gate process.</p><p>  The CER established the Group Processing Approach known as the &lsquo;Gate&rsquo; process for applications for grid connections.  This means that grid connections in Ireland are processed in batches rather than sequentially.  Within these gates, applications are further divided into groups and sub-groups based on the optimal network required to connect them.  This approach is considered a more efficient process than dealing with applications on an individual basis where projects which are the subject of such applications interact with each other electrically and where large volumes of such applications exist.  The group processing approach allows for a more strategic view to be taken of network requirements and serves to put in place efficient connection solutions to cater for large number of applications and to ensure optimum network development, minimising network costs and, where possible, avoidance of network bottlenecks.</p><p>  To date, CER has put in place 3 'Gates.' Under Gate 1 and Gate 2, 1755MW of connection offers were made and accepted.  Under Gate 3, almost 4000MW of offers issued to renewable generators.  A Gate 3 liaison group involving EirGrid, ESB Networks, CER and industry representatives meets on a regular basis.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s latest estimates are that around 4,000MW of renewable generation is required on the electricity network by 2020 to deliver our 40% renewable electricity target.  The total amount of renewable generation in the 3 Gates is well above that amount.</p><p>  While the take up of Gate 3 offers is not clear at this stage, largely as a result of ongoing consultations on the Single Electricity Market (SEM) Committee scheduling and dispatch rules, even with some fall off, sufficient offers appear to have already issued to ensure that our target can be achieved.  The implementation of Gate 3 requires a significant amount of grid build and grid upgrade, which will be challenging to achieve in the period to 2020. EirGrid&rsquo;s Grid 25 implementation plans are designed to augment and improve the grid in order to connect the Gate 3 grid connection offers and to deliver on our 2020 targets.  Any decision on a future Gate for new wind generators would have to be considered in the context of the processes already underway.</p><p>  Apart from the above, the CER published a decision in 2009 (CER 09/099) that allows for certain renewable, small and low carbon generators to connect to the transmission and distribution grids without going through the full rigours of the Gate process.  This includes small projects, research and development projects and those that qualify as they are deemed to provide benefits of a public nature that merit qualification.</p></reply>

The Government has also undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where commercial operators have been unable to offer services.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p><p>  The Government, through the National Broadband Plan, which I published on 30 August last year, has recognised that the key imperative now is to ensure high speed broadband availability to all.  This is a challenge which faces all Member States and comparisons between Member States can be difficult as measurement metrics differ, and Member States, often experience different barriers to deployment.  The National Broadband Plan commits to ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU's target date of 2020.  Ireland is now moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country.</p><p>  As a consequence of the recent multi-band spectrum auction conducted by ComReg, new high speed 4G telecoms services will be rolled out by mobile operators and will significantly increase the speeds available across wireless platforms.  In addition, the commercial sector is already investing in high speed fixed line services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  This will ensure that citizens or businesses, wherever they are located, have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business in the digital environment.</p></reply>

The European Energy Efficiency Fund (EEEF) was launched in July 2011.  This &euro;265 million fund provides tailor-made debt and equity instruments to local, regional and national public authorities, and public and private entities acting on their behalf.  The EEEF aims at financing bankable projects in energy efficiency, renewable energy and clean urban transport through innovative instruments and in particular promoting the application of Energy Performance Contracts (EPC).  A technical assistance grant support is available for project development services (technical, financial) linked to the investments financed by the Fund.</p><p>  Launched in 2009 under Intelligent Energy Europe, the European Local Energy Assistance Facility (ELENA) initiative provides technical assistance grants (of up to 90% of eligible costs) to local and regional authorities for development and launch of sustainable energy investments.  It consists of four operational windows with the European Investment Bank (EIB), Germany&rsquo;s KfW banking group, KfW, the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).  The ELENA Facility enables the financing of investments both by private and public sources and facilitates connection with financial instruments (such as JESSICA).  Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas (JESSICA), is an initiative of the European Commission developed in cooperation with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB). It supports sustainable urban development and regeneration through financial engineering mechanisms.</p><p>  EU Member States can choose to invest some of their EU structural fund allocations in revolving funds to help recycle financial resources to accelerate investment in Europe's urban areas.  These financial instruments (Urban Development Funds) invest in public-private partnerships and other projects included in integrated plans for sustainable urban development.</p><p>  The pilot phase of the EU-EIB Project Bond Initiative was established in 2012 and aims to revive and expand capital markets to finance large European infrastructure projects in the fields of transport, energy and information technology.  The scope of this pilot phase is to test the project bond concept during the remaining period of the current multi-annual financial framework 2007-2013.  The pilot phase of the initiative will be implemented by the European Investment Bank (EIB), with the objective of stimulating investment in key strategic EU infrastructure in transport, energy and broadband.</p><p>  The breadth of the Funds available for energy efficiency projects highlights the current lack of traditional financing instruments for such projects.

Working Groups and Committees are mainly attended by colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) as the majority of items fall within the remit of that Department.  Officials in my Department liaise regularly with DAFM colleagues on issues falling within our remit to ensure a consistent approach within the wider Fisheries discussions.  On issues of particular importance to my Department officials from my Department and Inland Fisheries Ireland do and will continue to attend relevant meetings.</p><p>  The international dialogue on salmon management has a broader international context and takes place within the remit of the regional fisheries organisation the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO).  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that Ireland will be hosting, on behalf of the EU, the 30th annual General Meeting of the NASCO, in June 2013, during our EU Presidency.   While the EU is a contracting party to NASCO and Member States, Including Ireland attend the negotiations, the event will also involve State delegations from Russia, Norway, USA, Canada and Denmark in respect of the Faroe Islands and Greenland.  There will also be a significant number of Inter-governmental (IGOs) and Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) attending.</p><p>  Work will also continue at EU level on the protection of the European Eel and in respect of the management of eels, the Deputy will be interested to know that, following a public consultation exercise, Ireland&rsquo;s report of the status of eel under the first three years of the Eel Management Plan was submitted to the European Commission in mid-2012.  Feedback on that from the Commission is awaited.  The review of eel stocks in Europe is a shared concern involving many countries on a pan-European basis and we await details of all European reviews to inform future discussions.  </p></reply>

These models vary both in terms of the instruments used and in terms of the level of take which the State seeks to obtain. Some countries, including Morocco, use a combination of instruments, such as: State participation in licences; production royalties; along with taxation, while other countries, including Ireland, take an approach that is principally based on taxing profits.</p><p>  Each country&rsquo;s fiscal system tends to have its own individual characteristics.  While Morocco&rsquo;s terms include a State share in the licence along with royalties ranging from 3.5% to 10%, the terms also provide for an exemption from corporate tax for a ten year period from the commencement of production.  In determining the appropriate approach at a national level a range of factors must be considered, with the principal factor being the relative prospectivity of the area.  Directly replicating the fiscal regime of another country is unlikely to provide the optimum outcome.  Regard must also be had to the approach adopted by countries with whom we are directly competing for a share of international exploration investment.</p></reply>

I can confirm that a group has been established by my Department to examine the degree to which this issue may arise in Ireland when the roll out of 4G services commences later in 2013.  The group comprises officials from my Department, as well as representatives from ComReg, the BAI, RT&Eacute; and the mobile industry and its focus will be on assessing the potential for any disruption to TV signals in households that use &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; television and to identify any possible remedial measures that may be required.  The approaches being developed in other countries, including the UK, will be studied by the group and will help inform the approach that we will take in Ireland.  ComReg has already confirmed its view that any disruption that may arise to TV signals would be capable of being addressed by filters which are available.  It is my intention that an agreed joint strategy should be put in place in advance of 4G roll-out that fully addresses the issues around any potential disruption to consumers&rsquo; television service.</p></reply>

The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce, which I chaired, concluded that large commercial customers generally have access to the high speeds they require.  The Taskforce also noted that approximately one-third of all homes have access to speeds of 100Mbps.  Significant further Private Sector investment is also underway, which will mean that 50% of the population will have access to speeds of 70Mbps &ndash; 100Mbps by 2015.</p><p>  The Government has also undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where commercial operators have been unable to offer services, including the provision of 100Mbps connectivity to second level schools, MANS, the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS).  The Government, through the National Broadband Plan, which I published on 30 August last year, has recognised that the key imperative now is to ensure high speed broadband availability to all.  This is a challenge which faces all Member States and comparisons between Member States can be difficult as measurement metrics differ, and Member States often experience different barriers to deployment.  The National Broadband Plan commits to ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020.  </p><p>  Ireland is now moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country.  As a consequence of the recent multi-band spectrum auction conducted by ComReg, new high speed 4G telecoms services will be rolled out by mobile operators and will significantly increase the speeds available across wireless platforms.  In addition, the commercial sector is already investing in high speed fixed line services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  This will ensure that citizens or businesses, wherever they are located, have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business in a global digital environment.</p></reply>

The purpose of an exploration well is to obtain data on a specific geological objective or objectives.  The depth of each individual well will, therefore, be determined by the depth of the related geological objective.  In relation to the diameter of exploration wells, generally each hole section is drilled using standard diameter drill bits to allow standard diameter casings to be run and cemented into place for wellbore stability and well control purposes.  As the diameter of each casing must be wide enough to fit the drill bit for the subsequent hole section, the diameter of each hole section decreases with depth.  So, at the surface the diameter of the cased hole can typically be in the range of 20 to 30 inches, while at the bottom, over the geological objective, the diameter of the cased hole can typically be in region of 6 inches.</p><p>  The EPA has recently announced the terms of reference for the more extensive second stage of its research into the use of hydraulic fracturing, the final results of which are expected in early 2015.  I can reiterate that until there has been time to consider the outcome of this EPA research, no decision will be made on any proposal for the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration drilling in Ireland.</p></reply>

In November 2012 ComReg announced the results of its successful Multi-Band Spectrum Award (MBSA) process which resulted in a transfer of &euro;450 million, in respect of upfront fees accrued, to the Exchequer on 14 December 2012.  The remainder of the total licence yield of some &euro;855 million will be paid on an annual basis over the duration of the terms of the licences.</p><p>  As part of this process ComReg awarded spectrum rights of use across three critical bands &ndash; the 800Mhz, 900Mhz and 1800Mhz bands &ndash; for the period 2013 to 2030.  These spectrum bands are highly suitable for advanced mobile services due to their excellent propagation properties, which allow for wide area coverage and improved in-building reception.  Liberalised spectrum rights of use were won by the four existing Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), namely: Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd.; Meteor Mobile Communications Ltd.; Telefonica Ireland Ltd; and Vodafone Ireland Ltd.  It is a condition of a Liberalised Use Licence that a minimum 70% population coverage obligation is to be achieved by a licensee within 3 years of its licence commencement date.</p><p>  ComReg set out the process it has adopted for the award of rights of use for radio frequencies in the 800Mhz, 900Mhz and 1800Mhz bands in its information memorandum and associated documents (ComReg document 12/52).  These documents also set out the reasons, analysis and other material relied upon by ComReg in support of its substantive decisions regarding the minimum coverage and rollout requirements for the rights of use to be granted in the award process.  Amongst other things, ComReg considered that actual coverage levels are expected to exceed a minimum 70% population obligation given the competitive nature of the market and the limited risk of roll-back of coverage from the current levels.</p><p>  In this context, the Deputy may wish to note that the four existing mobile operators have achieved coverage levels exceeding those set out in their respective licences.  For example, for 3G services, Vodafone&rsquo;s coverage covers 90% of the population, 5% more than its obligation.  Hutchison 3G, better known as &ldquo;3&rdquo;, covers 96% of the population, 11% more than its obligation.  O2 also covers 90.5% of the population, which is also more than its obligation.</p><p>  ComReg has also advised me that coverage continues to be an important differentiator in the mobile telecommunications market such that any material deterioration in coverage by any one network would undermine that network&rsquo;s attractiveness to its existing and potential customers.  It is also important to emphasise that the coverage proposals were designed to facilitate the possible entry of new operators in a matter that would ensure that &lsquo;cherry picking&rsquo; of high density urban areas would not occur.  While the four Liberalised Use Licences of the Mobile Network Operators are due to commence on 1 February 2013, the timing and extent of each of &lsquo;4G&rsquo; (Long Term Evolution (LTE)) network rollout is, with the exception of the above coverage obligation, a matter for the operators themselves.</p></reply>

Approximately half of the deaths from unintentional carbon monoxide poisonings result from the inhalation of smoke from fires.  Other significant causes are vehicle exhausts and deaths in industrial / commercial settings.  In recent years between two and six people died each year in Ireland from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning in the home, in incidents related to domestic heating or other fossil fuel installations in the home.</p><p>  Carbon monoxide is not just an issue for those using gas as their fuel source.  The incomplete combustion of organic fossil fuels such as oil, coal or wood, as well as gas, is a common cause of carbon monoxide formation, and is responsible for many cases of non-fatal unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning.  In normal conditions, the combustion process will result in carbon in the fossil fuel combining with oxygen in the air to produce carbon dioxide, the same substance we exhale when we breathe.  However, if there is a lack of air for the combustion process or the heating appliance is faulty, carbon monoxide can be produced.</p><p>  Approximately six incidents involving, or potentially involving, carbon monoxide gas have been reported in Ireland in the past 12 months.  The exact number will be known when the report for quarter four 2012 issues from the Commissioner for Energy Regulation (CER) next month.  As investigations into some of the incidents reported last year have not been concluded; it may not possible to determine by next month that they did indeed involve carbon monoxide.  Given the clear need to act to prevent accidents and mitigate risks, I launched the first Carbon Monoxide Awareness Week on the 24 September 2012.  This involved a week which saw a sustained, multi-media publicity campaign to alert people to the dangers and give them advice as to what they should do to be safe. The issue was widely reported on television, on national and local radio and in both national and local press.  </p><p>  Additionally my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has recently revised the Building Regulations so that it will become compulsory to fit approved carbon monoxide alarms to certain types of new building.  A lot of work has been done on the relevant standards that apply to these alarms, both at national and at European level.  The Gas Technical Standards Committee of the National Standards Authority of Ireland is currently working on guidance documentation to assist with proper installation of such alarms.  They also issued a special standard to fill the gap until the relevant European Standard can be enhanced.</p><p>  I should also highlight the commendable work done by the gas industry to raise safety standards and participate in the establishment of a register of approved gas installers.  This has been a hugely important development in improving quality control in gas matters, including reducing the risk posed by carbon monoxide in gas installations.  This &ldquo;joined-up&rdquo; approach to matters relating to carbon monoxide can be well demonstrated by the specific campaign last year to warn the public about gas cookers which could be operated in an unsafe manner, creating a carbon monoxide hazard.  Industry, government, regulator, standards authority and the National Consumer Agency all acted together to identify and promote the risks and the solutions to consumers.  As a result, very many potentially dangerous appliances were identified and made safe.  Finally, I assure the Deputy that I take this matter very seriously, and that I intend to launch this year&rsquo;s Carbon Monoxide Week after the summer.  </p></reply>

This campaign, which was developed with industry, does provide some information in relation to use of ICT by children.  The Department has also engaged in a number of EU initiatives on this subject, including Council Conclusions on the protection of children in the digital world in 2011, and continues to play an important role in discussions in the Council of Europe.  While my Department does not lead on the specific issue of cyber bullying, it is available to assist in any initiative taken forward by the other Departments and continues to engage across all Departments in issues relating to the use of the Internet and ICT generally.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-31a.122.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013013100051#WRE01400"><p>I have no statutory function in the setting of gas or electricity prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated parts of these markets.  Responsibility for the regulation of the retail electricity market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Since 4 April 2011 prices in the electricity retail market have been fully deregulated and business and domestic customers can as a result avail of competitive offerings from a number of electricity supply companies.  Price setting by electricity suppliers is a commercial and operational matter for the companies operating in the retail market.</p><p>  With regard to the regulation of gas prices the position is that up until 1 October 2011 the CER regulated Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential and smaller business customers but price regulation for the latter group ended at that point.  The CER still regulates the Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential customers.  The timing for complete deregulation of the residential segment of the gas market, as has taken place in the electricity market, is an issue under active review by the CER.  In making its decision on gas tariffs, the CER takes account of the need to protect consumers from unnecessary price increases by ensuring that only reasonable legitimate costs are recovered by BGE.  Full deregulation leading to further competition will keep downward pressure on prices for consumers. </p><p>  The Government is most concerned at the impact of higher energy prices on residential and commercial consumers.  It is the case however, that Ireland in the main, is at the mercy of international fossil fuel prices which dictate the retail price of electricity and gas, which is the key factor in the retail price of both electricity and gas. In particular, Ireland is a price taker for gas. My focus is on those elements of energy costs over which policy can exercise some control.  The long term policy responses for Ireland to combat vulnerability to high and volatile gas prices continue to be increasing the use of renewables, better energy efficiencies and reducing the reliance on gas in the fuel mix.</p><p>  Implementation of the measures set out in the Government&#8217;s Affordable<font color="#0000FF"> </font>Energy Strategy is also key to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers.  The Affordable Energy Strategy was published in November 2011 and developed by the Inter-Departmental/Agency Group on Affordable Energy (IDGAE) as part of the Department&#8217;s commitment in the Programme for Government to help mitigate energy poverty.  There are forty-eight actions identified in the strategy to be implemented over the lifetime of the report (3 years).  Five priority measures are identified including: a commitment to review the National Fuel Scheme in the context of examining the feasibility of aligning income supports with the energy efficiency and income of the home; the phased introduction of minimal thermal efficiency standards for rental accommodation; ensuring greater access to energy efficiency measures; reforming the eligibility criteria for energy efficiency schemes; and the introduction of an area based approach.</p><p>  The Affordable Energy Strategy provides a framework for building upon the many measures already in place to protect households at risk from the effects of energy poverty, which include the thermal efficiency based measures delivered through the Better Energy Warmer Homes programme.  Exchequer funding of over &#8364;101 million has been allocated to the programme since 2000 and has successfully delivered energy efficiency measures to 92,563 homes through a combination of community based organisations, private contractors and via an area-based approach. The Government will continue to support the delivery of energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households in 2013.  Better Energy Warmer Homes has been allocated &#8364;20 million for this purpose.</p><p>  There are also a number of avenues open to consumers to try to mitigate rising electricity prices and measures are also in place to assist them.  Accordingly, consumers can, and should, shop around to get the best possible price and service deal from suppliers, and switch supplier if necessary, bearing in mind that all suppliers can and do offer competitive prices and products.  Consumers can also take steps to improve the efficiency of their electricity usage which delivers demonstrable savings, including availing of Government funded measures as already referred to above.  The CER is also working with energy suppliers to ensure that vulnerable customers are protected through, inter alia, the installation of Pay As You Go meters.</p></reply>

The Government has also undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where commercial operators have been unable to offer services.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.  The Government, through the National Broadband Plan, which I published on 30 August last year, has recognised that the key imperative now is to ensure high speed broadband availability to all.  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020.  </p><p>  Ireland is now therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband in Ireland which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country. The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  This will ensure that citizens and businesses, including small businesses, wherever they are located, have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business in a digital environment.   Implementation of the National Broadband Plan will be complemented by the National Digital Strategy to enhance digital adoption which I will publish shortly.  The first phase of the National Digital Strategy will target the small enterprise and the SME sector generally where the current level of online presence may be hindering the sector from availing fully of trading opportunities. SMEs with a strong web presence have been shown internationally to grow twice as quickly, export twice as much and create twice as many jobs as those who have a minimal web presence. </p></reply>

The EEZ is that body of water lying beyond the outer limit of a state&rsquo;s 12 mile territorial sea which may extend to a maximum distance of 200 miles from shore, subject only to the same rights of its neighbours.     The EEZ represents a compromise reached in the long negotiations on the 1982 Convention between those states that wished to extend their territorial seas out to 200 miles and those that wished to maintain the freedoms of the high seas that then applied in these waters.  Although no state is obliged to claim an EEZ, agreement on the EEZ regime allowed coastal states to extend their 12 mile exclusive fisheries zones out to 200 miles.  Within the EEZ they also have rights and duties in relation to the protection of the marine environment, production of energy from water and wind, and the conduct of marine scientific research should they seek to exercise them.  The recovery of oil and gas from the seabed, however, is governed by the separate legal regime of the continental shelf.   </p><p>  Following international agreement on EEZ rules during the law of the sea negotiations in the 1970s, initially Ireland decided to exercise its rights and duties in respect of fisheries only and so declared a 200 mile Exclusive Fisheries Zone in 1977.  Responsibility for protection of the marine environment was extended to 200 miles in 1999 and a full EEZ was established by section 87 of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  The United Kingdom enacted legislation in 2009 enabling the creation of a British EEZ and the two sides are currently in discussions to settle the boundaries between the British and Irish EEZs.</p></reply>

This commitment was demonstrated earlier this month when my colleague the Minister of State for European Affairs, Lucinda Creighton T.D., hosted representatives of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as representatives from other candidate and potential candidate countries, in Dublin for discussions on the EU and the enlargement process.    Ireland fully supports Bosnia and Herzegovina&rsquo;s EU perspective. It should be recognised, however, that the accession process is based on conditionality. The reforms required in order for Bosnia and Herzegovina to submit a credible EU membership application are laid out in the roadmap agreed at the High Level Accession Dialogue with the EU in June 2012. These include reaching political agreement on changing the Constitution in line with the Sejdic-Finci ruling of the European Court of Human Rights, the establishment of an effective coordination mechanism for engagement with the EU, and reforms in the areas of justice and the rule of law. </p><p>  Unfortunately the targets and deadlines of the roadmap have not been met. The lack of progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina in implementing reforms, especially when compared with its neighbours, is a matter for real concern. As a supporter of Bosnia and Herzegovina&rsquo;s EU perspective, I would urge the government, political leaders and citizens of that country to work together to reinvigorate the reform process. </p><p>  The Irish Presidency does not have a direct role to play in the EU&rsquo;s relationship with Bosnia and Herzegovina &ndash; this is now the responsibility of High Representative Ashton and the European External Action Service &ndash; but we will do everything in our power to encourage movement on the country&rsquo;s path to EU integration. However, we must recognise that while we can encourage political leaders to continue their efforts; the EU cannot impose a solution. It is ultimately up to the Government and the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to work to implement reforms and achieve the necessary progress for the country to realise the next steps on its EU path. </p></reply>

A resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish migrants will continue to be pursued by the Government in our ongoing contacts with the US Administration and Congress.     The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which such a resolution can be achieved.  The prospects for such reform would appear to have advanced in the wake of President Obama&rsquo;s re-election. The emphasis he placed on immigration reform in his inauguration address as well as his subsequent speech on the issue on 29 January sent a very positive signal in this regard. The indications of emerging bipartisan support for reform in Congress is also encouraging.</p><p>  Through our Embassy in Washington and in close liaison with Irish-American community representatives, our contacts with the US Administration and Congress continue with a view to ensuring that the interests and concerns of undocumented Irish immigrants are captured in any future legislative deal in this area that emerges.  In this regard, I raised the issue with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during our bilateral meeting on 6 December last and recalled our strong support for comprehensive immigration legislation and the passage of E3 visas for Irish citizens.   The Taoiseach also discussed immigration reform when he spoke with President Obama to congratulate him on his re-election.</p><p>  Much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system as to what any future legislative deal might comprise. It is therefore not possible at this stage to identify an exact timescale in which these may become clear but the area will continue to receive the Government&rsquo;s close attention over the period ahead.</p></reply>

The Act sets out how the tax is to be administered, how a residential property is to be valued for LPT purposes and provides for the making of a Revenue Estimate.   I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are compiling a comprehensive Register of residential properties in the State that will be used to correspond with all property owners.  Based on Census 2011 data, produced by the Central Statistics Office, there are an estimated 1.99 million residential dwellings in the State.  Revenue is currently refining the LPT Register to identify those properties owned by local authorities and approved housing bodies and will liaise directly with these organisations in respect of LPT arising on these properties.  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that some individuals and companies will receive their LPT return electronically via the Revenue Online Service (ROS).  Accordingly, the number of paper returns expected to issue to owners of residential properties will be confirmed over the coming weeks, but is expected to be of the order of 1.6 million.  This general issue of paper LPT returns to property owners will commence in March 2013.  </p><p>  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that LPT is a self-assessment tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the chargeable value of the property.   I would like to clarify that the Revenue Commissioners will not be involved, as a matter of routine, in valuing properties. However, I am advised that they are actively preparing valuation guidance which, taken together with a liable person&rsquo;s own knowledge of their property, will assist them in assessing its value and that these will be made available as soon as possible. The guidance will include drawing property owners&rsquo; attention to the publicly available PSRA property price register which includes some 62,000 of reasonably recent property prices, and a method to help property owners establish average/indicative values for properties in different locations. As I have previously advised the House, where the Revenue guidance is used in an honest manner, the property valuation will not be challenged by Revenue in accordance with its normal Customer Service Charter.  </p><p>  As part of the general issue of LPT returns by Revenue, property owners will also receive an information booklet and a Revenue Estimate of LPT.  The Revenue Estimate is not based on a valuation of each owner&rsquo;s individual property nor should it be regarded as an accurate calculation of the amount of LPT that they should pay.  Once the property owner meets their obligations by valuing their property, submitting their return and advising Revenue of their payment method within the relevant time limits, the Revenue Estimate of LPT notified to them is no longer relevant. On the other hand, where a property owner does not submit an LPT return by the due date, the LPT legislation provides that Revenue can enforce collection of the Revenue Estimate.  If a property owner pays the Revenue Estimate instead of submitting their LPT return they will not be immune from further action.  The property owner is still required to submit a self-assessed LPT return.</p></reply>

However, I have received a number of submissions from, and on behalf of, private coach operators seeking to have this relief extended to them. I will consider these proposals and the level of the rebate in the context of the Finance Bill.  It is worth noting that one of key arguments for introducing a rebate for the haulage industry is the fact that a large quantity of fuel purchased by this industry is purchased abroad thus generating no tax revenue for the State.  A rebate should encourage hauliers to start purchasing their fuel in Ireland thus offsetting some of the costs involved. Such an argument does not exist for the most part for the coach industry. </p><p>  The fuel rebate scheme proposed is governed by the terms of Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 which limits its application to auto diesel used in defined categories of road vehicles.  I will be informing the European Commission of the rebate measure once it is introduced.</p></reply>

The data relating to the public sector includes individuals in receipt of various forms of income from public sources that would not normally be regarded as constituting employment within the public service, e.g. those receiving fees, those on State Boards etc. On the basis of the available tax-based data it is not possible to identify and exclude income from public sources to groups that would not normally be regarded as employed within the public service or to distinguish the earnings of employees associated with typical work patterns.</p><p>On this basis, the total numbers of public sector income earners and private sector income earners, including self-employed earners, who had earnings in excess of &euro;100,000 in the tax year 2010, are 12,500 and 86,900 respectively.

The levy will operate for a period of 4 years only (2011 to 2014) and the legislative provisions giving effect to the levy (section 4 of Finance (No 2) Act 2011) were specifically drafted to reflect this. I confirmed in my Budget 2013 Speech that the levy will not be renewed after 2014.</p><p>  The moneys raised from the pension fund levy are being used to pay for the Government&#8217;s <i>Jobs Initiative </i>introduced<i></i>in May 2011. The measures introduced as part of the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>   include a new 9% VAT rate on certain activities, the halving of the lower rate of PRSI and small amounts of additional current and capital expenditure.  The implementation of a jobs and growth strategy is a key priority of the Government. The measures announced in the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>   are aimed at assisting in employment generation &#8211; providing opportunities for those who are out of work, to restore public morale and confidence in the economy and encourage spending by consumers.</p><p>  The chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. I cannot intervene in this process in respect of the pension fund referred to in the details supplied with the question or other pension funds.  However, the legislation also includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that benefits payable, either currently or prospectively to any member, are adjusted in such a way that the reduction in value of those benefits shall not exceed 0.6% of the market value of the assets accounting for the scheme&#8217;s liabilities to that member.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are two exceptions to the requirement to pay the levy provided for in the governing legislation (section 125B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999).  The first exception provides that the levy will not apply to the assets of occupational pension schemes in respect of employees whose employment is or was wholly exercised outside the State. In other words the levy does not apply to the extent that a pension scheme is intended to provide retirement benefits outside the State.  The second exception provides that the levy will not apply where the trustees of a scheme have passed a resolution to wind-up the scheme and where the business in respect of which the scheme was established is insolvent.</p><p>  I am conscious of the concerns of pension scheme members about the impact of a levy in circumstances where the pensions sector, in common with other sectors in our economy and society, is finding the current economic and financial environment very challenging.  However, much of the value of pension funds is attributable to the rolled up value of generous tax reliefs that pension savings have historically been granted and continue to receive. The purpose of the levy is to improve the economic environment by providing the means to encourage job creation in areas of our economy most likely to deliver that employment quickly.</p></reply>

The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 sets out in detail how the tax is to be administered and provides how a residential property is to be valued for LPT purposes.  The Act also provides for a number of specific exemptions from the charge.</p><p>  An exemption will apply to unfinished housing estates as prescribed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  In determining whether an unfinished housing estate should be prescribed, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government must satisfy himself or herself that the development in question is incomplete to a substantial extent.  Examples of the criteria that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government should take into account in such a determination include the state of completion of roads, footpaths, lighting facilities, water and sewerage facilities within the development as well as compliance with the terms of any planning permission applicable to the development and the extent to which roads, open spaces, car parks, sewers, water mains, drains or other public facilities in the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned.  These criteria are set out in section 10 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012.</p><p>  Properties will not be regarded as relevant residential properties for the purposes of the local property tax, and will not be subject to the local property tax so long as they remain on the prescribed list of unfinished housing estates.  There are no plans to devolve responsibility for compilation of the prescribed list from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to local authorities.  However, elected members may make recommendations on the matter at any time to city or county managers or directly to the Minister.  </p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the rights of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  Equality legislation, which also outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values.  The legislation provides that any school that has this objective may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.</p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that in 2011, I launched a discussion paper on school enrolment.  The &quot;Discussion Paper on a Regulatory Framework for School Enrolment&quot; contains suggestions on how to make the process of enrolling in schools more open, equitable and consistent and is available on the Department website.  I invited education partners and interested parties to submit their views to my Department by the 28th of October 2011.  The feedback from this consultation will help inform the nature and scope of a new regulatory framework for school enrolment. I intend to bring these proposals to Government in due course.</p></reply>

The national arrangements put in place by the National Procurement Service are designed to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money.  In utilising the national contracts, schools are able to take advantage of the NPS&rsquo;s buying power and as a result can purchase supplies at competitive prices.  This facilitates ongoing service delivery within tighter operating budgets.</p><p>  In relation to the potential impact of aggregated procurement arrangements, it is worth noting that such arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money and also facilitates SME access.  While certain categories of goods and services may be suited to single supplier arrangements, it should not be taken that single supplier frameworks are to be accepted as the norm.  The greater use where appropriate of multi-supplier frameworks &ndash; for example the supply of managed print services- can address local supplier issues while also ensuring ongoing cost competitiveness of the framework itself.  Such multi-supplier frameworks can also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions. </p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS over the past 3 years has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  In 2012 the NPS, working with InterTradeIreland, for the first time brought together a number of the lead Government agencies to create a programme of major events for the Island of Ireland. Attendees could avail of educational seminars on a variety of topics ranging from the technicalities of public service procurement to procedures around consortia-building for SMEs.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,000 SMEs nationwide.  Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.</p></reply>

The original 1993 Working Time Directive (93/104/EC), which was transposed into national law by the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, applied to all sectors of activity, both public and private, within the meaning of Article 2 of the Framework Health and Safety Directive 89/391/EEC.  Article 2.2 of that Directive provided for exceptions in respect of certain public service activities, such as the armed forces or the police, and certain activities in the civil protection services.  Therefore, when transposing the Directive, both the Defence Forces and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were excluded from the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  In addition, Regulations exempting the Civil Protection Services from certain provisions of the 1997 Act were also promulgated, i.e. the Organisation of Working Time (Exemption of Civil Protection Services) Regulations 1998 - S.I. No. 52 of 1998.  However, subsequent Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) rulings have indicated that the normal activities of the armed forces, emergency services or civil protection forces are covered by the Working Time Directive.</p><p>  I have not received any formal request to extend the provisions of the Act to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or to the Defence Forces from my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality and Defence.  However, in the context of the revised rosters in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which are currently being piloted, the Department of Justice and Equality has been in consultation with my Department on the question of the application of the Organisation of Working Time Act to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I understand that this work is ongoing in that Department.  The Minister has also advised me that a working group comprising representatives from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are currently examining the application of the Organisation of Working Time Act to the Defence Forces.</p><p>  The 1993 Working Time Directive had excluded the activities of doctors in training and most transport sectors such as air transport, rail transport, road transport, sea transport, inland waterway and lake transport as well as sea fishing and other work at sea.  However, the 2000 Working Time Directive (2000/34/EC) amended the 1993 Working Time Directive to cover most workers in the sectors which had been excluded from that earlier Directive.  Provisions to extend the scope of the Working Time Directive to many of the previously-excluded sectors were then transposed into national legislation under various Statutory Instruments.  These Regulations included the Organisation of Working Time (Inclusion of Transport Activities) Regulations 2004 &#8211; S.I. No. 817 of 2004, the Organisation of Working Time (Inclusion of Offshore Work) Regulations 2004 &#8211; S.I. No. 819 of 2004, the European Communities (Workers on Board Sea-going Fishing Vessels)(Organisation of Working Time) Regulations 2003 &#8211; S.I. No. 709 of 2003.  In addition, Regulations transposing the provisions on Doctors-in-Training were promulgated by the Minister for Health as set out below.</p><p>  With regard to doctors in training, the 2000 Working Time Directive (2000/34/EC) provided for a derogation which would phase-in the maximum 48-hour average working week over a transitional period of five years from 1 August 2004.  This provision was transposed into Irish legislation by Regulations promulgated by the Minister for Health by way of Statutory Instrument No. 494 of 2004 - the European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004 (as amended by Statutory Instrument No. 553 of 2010).  These Regulations implemented a phased reduction from an average of 58 weekly working hours to an average of 48 hours (as provided for under the Working Time Directive) from 1 August 2009 onwards.  The amending S.I. 553 of 2010 in relation to Doctors in Training provided for derogations from the rest breaks and daily and weekly rest provisions, where equivalent periods of compensatory rest are provided.</p><p>  With regard to the Transport sector, the provisions of the amending 2000 Directive were transposed into Irish law by my Department by way of S.I. No. 817 of 2004 &#8211; the Organisation of Working Time (Inclusion of Transport Activities) Regulations 2004.  These Regulations transposed the 2000 Directive in relation to transport workers, with some exceptions, namely those workers performing mobile road transport activities as provided for in Directive 2002/15/EC (i.e. workers subject to tachograph rules), and mobile staff in civil aviation as defined in the Annex to Council Directive 2000/79/EC of 27 November 2000.  The effect of the transposition of those provisions of Directive 2000/34/EC relating to the transport sector was to apply the maximum average working week of 48 hours to mobile and non-mobile transport workers covered by that Directive.  S.I. No. 817 of 2004 revoked the earlier 1998 Regulations (i.e. the Organisation of Working Time (Exemption of Transport Activities) Regulations, 1998 &#8211; S.I. No. 20 of 1998<b>) </b>  which had exempted the transport sector from the rest provisions and weekly working hours provisions of the Organisation of Working Time Act.  However, the exemptions in relation to the rest provisions continued to apply in S.I. No. 817 of 2004, subject to compensatory rest.</p><p>  A number of other Community instruments set out more specific working time requirements for particular sectors or occupational activities, and these take precedence over the provisions of 2003 Working Time Directive (2003/88/EC) which consolidated and repealed the earlier Working Time Directives.  These Community instruments are, in the main, in the transport sector, and my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has given these effect in national law.</p></reply>

The exception to this is where  the employment was subject to a transfer of undertaking, that is, where one company assumes responsibility for another including maintaining the employee&rsquo;s continuity of service.  The purpose of the redundancy payments scheme is to compensate workers, under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 - 2012, for the loss of their jobs by reason of redundancy.  Compensation is based on the worker&rsquo;s length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration.  An eligible employee is entitled to two weeks&rsquo; pay for every year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.</p><p>  In order to be eligible for a redundancy lump sum payment, an employee must:</p><p>- have at least two years continuous service;</p><p>- be in employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts;</p><p>- be over the age of 16; and</p><p>- have been made redundant as a result of a genuine redundancy situation meaning that the job no longer exists and he/she is not replaced.</p><p>  It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all their eligible employees.  Where an employer can prove to the satisfaction of the Department that it is unable to pay statutory redundancy to its eligible employees the Department will make lump sum payments directly to those employees and will seek to recover the debt from the employer.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, in the light of this second medical opinion, that office decided to afford her an opportunity of setting out the complete and up to date grounds of her appeal.  On receipt of her response the relevant Departmental papers will be requested from the Department and the appeal will then be referred to an Appeals Officer for consideration.

The Department has a number of ICT systems which have been developed over many years to enable it to pay multiple groups of clients and manage data in relation to its various schemes.<font color="#FF0000">  </font>These systems reliably deliver over 87 million payments yearly between them. Although developed independently, mechanisms exist on its major systems whereby significant changes made to customer or claim details are automatically notified to other relevant systems.  The Department is working towards consolidation on a single ICT &#8216;platform&#8217; - the Business Object Model implementation - BOMi.  This work is carried out as part of the Department&#8217;s continuous Service Delivery Modernisation programme.  As this programme progresses, all of the Department&#8217;s client and claim-related systems will be integrated on the BOMi platform, ensuring that all client and claim information is fully and automatically available across all of the Department&#8217;s schemes and places of business.</p><p>  Not only does the Department work with the information held by ourselves, we also recognise the value of working closely and collaboratively with other agencies to ensure that social welfare abuse is comprehensively deterred and detected.  Over the last number of years, the Department has engaged in a range of data matching exercises with other Government Departments and public bodies for control purposes.  Data matching is viewed as an efficient and effective mechanism to target control-related activity and the Department is satisfied that it is an effective control tool. </p><p>  The Public Services Card (PSC) was launched last year following a pilot process and its roll-out is well underway.  To date, some 110,000 cards have been issued.  From the Department&#8217;s perspective, as well as combating identity fraud, the PSC will replace cards currently in use, such as the Social Services Card and the Free Travel Card, with a highly secure card.  The robust face-to-face registration process, leading to issue of a PSC incorporating both the person&#8217;s photograph and signature, gives significant assurance as to the identity of the cardholder.  It will reduce the number of people who fraudulently claim to be someone else and will considerably reduce the potential for forgery.</p><p>  For the information of the Deputy, biometric information is information about human body characteristics, such as fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements and it is typically used for authentication purposes.  The PSC will store photographs and signatures.  It could store biometric information although there are no plans to do so at present.</p><p>  The Department has recently introduced electronic signing in local offices, replacing the existing paper-based system.  The new system is designed to improve both the customer experience and the efficiency of the certification process. It is currently in the process of being implemented across the regional network and is now in operation in 33 local offices.  The Department will continue to examine options to provide a range of signing options with a view to further improving the certification process.</p><p>  Social Welfare fraud undermines public confidence in the entire system as well as being unfair to other recipients of Social Welfare payments and taxpayers.  My Department is very conscious of its obligation to protect public money and is determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.</p></reply>

To support the delivery of these essential services, the ring-fencing and prioritisation of places for child care was introduced on Community Employment in 2002. Total CE expenditure on child care amounted to &euro;22.4m in 2012.</p><p>  In order to support the delivery of community child care services there are 2,200 places designated for child care on CE each year; these places support community and voluntary providers of child care.  While the supply of child care places remains constant there has been a reduction in the overall take-up of places.  In 2005 there were 2,045 child care places taken up on CE and in December 2012 this had reduced to 1,696 child care places. Every effort is being made by the Department of Social Protection to encourage take-up of these places.  The Department in collaboration with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) are changing and improving the provision of training and work experience for CE participants who wish to pursue a career in child care.  These changes will provide a more tailored and valuable support to the provision of community child care and provide training to the participant up to FETAC Level 5.  This new Training and Development Programme in Childcare will commence this year.</p><p>  Presently there are 288 schemes with ring-fenced places for child care. There are approximately 27 schemes that provide child care services only, fourteen of these schemes are located in Dublin.  The majority of schemes providing ring-fenced places for child care are not solely providing a child care service, these schemes co-ordinate a variety of places within communities. In most instances child care places are allocated to child care centres which are not directly managed by a CE Sponsor.</p><p>  In addition Budget 2013 provided an additional 2,000 places to CE, the increase in the number of places will be funded from the budget of the Department of Social Protection.  These places will be approved on a phased basis from the end of January to the end of the year, in line with the overall CE budget allocation to Divisions.  Priority will be given to schemes and organisations who are involved in the delivery of community child care services as well as social and health care services.  This is in order to support the provision of these services and offer training qualification and work experience to CE participants.  An allocation of 500 additional places will be reserved for child care support.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s telecommunications market has been liberalised since 1999 and since then has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  The combination of private investment and State interventions such as the National and the Rural Broadband Schemes undertaken to date has resulted in Ireland meeting the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the positive developments, there remains an unacceptable digital divide between rural and urban areas.  A key commitment in the National Broadband Plan, which I published on 30 August last year, is to decisively tackle this divide.  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020.  Ireland is now therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across all regions.   </p><p>  The commercial sector is already investing in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  Undoubtedly, because of Ireland&rsquo;s low population density, particularly in rural areas, and the capabilities of different technologies, it will not always be possible for all parts of the country to experience the same speeds.  The key, however, is to ensure that citizens and businesses, wherever they are located, have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment of 30Mbps availability to all will deliver this.</p></reply>

In addition to planning permission, in order to connect to the electricity grid in Ireland, windfarm developers require a grid connection.  The grid connection process is vested in the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  CER issued the Gate 3 direction in December 2008 (CER 08/260 available at .).  This sets out the list of renewable generators entitled to a grid connection offer under the Gate 3 process.

Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 legally binding target under the Renewable Energy Directive has to be met across the transport, heating and electricity sectors by 2020.  The target is set at 16% of all energy consumed to be from renewable sources, with a minimum of 10% in the transport sector.  Ireland has set out that we intend to meet the target through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heating by 2020, which together amounts to 16% of all energy consumed.  At the end of 2012, 6.4% of all energy consumed was from renewable sources, hence a significant increase is required in the 8 years remaining.</p><p>  Wave and tidal energy has the potential to contribute to our renewable electricity target by 2020, provided the technologies become commercially viable in the period to 2020.  Our National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) includes 75MW of ocean energy contributing to our 2020 target out of an estimated total of 4000MW required to deliver 40% renewable electricity.  This is based on the assumption that by 2020 some early pre-commercial wave and tidal devices will be connected and exporting power to the electricity grid.</p><p>  A range of supports have been deployed since 2009 in support of wave and tidal development.  The Ocean Energy Development Unit in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has been taking forward the development of the sector through administration of a Prototype Development Fund of grants for industry. SEAI has also been progressing the development of a full scale grid connected wave test site off County Mayo, which would complement existing wave testing facilities i.e. the wave tank in Cork and the quarter scale wave testing site in Galway Bay.</p><p>  The cumulative amount of expenditure on Ocean Energy in the period 2009 &ndash; 2013, including the estimated 2013 allocation, is &euro;19.159m.  Other supports for the sector include the development of the Beaufort Laboratory as part of the IMERC facility in Cork, which will see a re-housing of the wave tank facility and will bring together researchers in the area currently based in the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre (HMRC) and the Coastal and Marine Research Centre (CMRC), as part of a broader campus approach with the Naval College, UCC and Cork Institute of Technology, aimed at maximising on marine industrial opportunities.</p><p>  Research in the ocean energy area is ongoing in most universities across the country and ocean energy was recently identified as of 1 of 14 priority research areas by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in their Research Prioritisation Exercise.  SEAI has been allocated funding for ocean energy by my Department this year and will be continuing to offer grants under the Prototype Development Fund in 2013 and to progress development of the grid connected wave test site off County Mayo.</p></reply>

This target has to be meet across the electricity, transport and heating sectors and a minimum of 10% in the transport sector is required.  Ireland intends to meet the target through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heating, which amounts to 16% of overall energy consumption, commensurate with our target.</p><p>  In terms of 40% renewable electricity to be achieved by 2020, the technologies through which this will be delivered has been largely determined by the grid connection offers to renewable generators.  The grid connection process is vested in the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). CER published a Gate 3 direction in December 2008, which was specifically designed with the intention of providing for sufficient renewable energy grid connection offers to achieve 40% renewable electricity by 2020.  The Gate 3 grid connection direction includes a list of specific renewable generating projects to receive grid connections and the type of renewable plant which each generator applied to build. The bulk of these are wind developments, which will play a key role in the delivery of our 2020 target.</p><p>  In addition, the CER published a decision on the connection of small, low carbon renewable generators outside the Gate process (CER 09/99.)  This mechanism specifically provides for the ability of small anaerobic digesters, biomass CHP plants, wave and tidal devices and other non-wind renewable low carbon generators to connect to the grid outside of the Gate process by 2020.</p><p>  Given that at the time Gate 3 was designed, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) anticipated that 5,800MW of renewable generation would be required and that the latest modelling from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) shows that approximately 4,000MW will now be required to meet 40% renewable electricity, it is considered that there is sufficient generation in the existing Gates, even if some projects ultimately don&rsquo;t proceed to build.</p><p>  In order to deliver on our 2020 targets, EirGrid and ESB Networks need to deliver on the implementation of the Grid 25 Plans.  A large amount of grid upgrades and new grid build is required, in order for the projects in the existing Gate to be built out.  Figures from the System Operators indicate that over 13,000MW of renewable generators have applied for grid connection offers additional to Gate 3.  The take up of Gate 3 is not yet known, pending decisions by the SEM Committee on Scheduling and Dispatch and the issuance of updated constraint reports by EirGrid.  The decision about any future Gate will have to be considered in the context of the take up of Gate 3, the delivery of our 2020 targets and the upgrading and development of the Grid and operational changes required to ensure 40% renewable electricity by 2020.</p><p>  At end 2012, the generation figures for renewable electricity in Ireland were 2005 MW, broken down as follows:</p><p> - 1697 MW wind generation</p><p> - 216 MW large scale hydro</p><p> - 21 MW of small-scale hydro</p><p> - 71 MW of smaller renewable sources (CHP, solar and other bio-energy etc.).</p><p>  Over 17% of our electricity consumption in 2012 was from renewable sources.  While we still need to more than double that figure in the next 8 years, progress in recent years has been positive.  The modelling carried out by SEAI for the First Progress Report on the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) indicates the following breakdown of technologies contributing to our 40% renewable electricity target: 3521MW of wind, 274MW of biomass technologies by 2020, 234MW of hydro and 75MW of wave and tidal technology.</p></reply>

As shareholder, however, I do have a strong concern in relation to the ongoing commercial position of the Company and I regularly liaise with the Company in this regard.  An Post has many strengths and has the largest retail presence in the country.  I have impressed on the Company the need to further exploit its unique position in this regard and have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins.</p><p>  I welcome the progress An Post has made towards diversification with its enhanced arrangement with AIB and its agreement with Aviva for the transfer of Aviva Ireland&rsquo;s branch offices personal insurance business book to One Direct.  In the context of the public sector transformation agenda, I will continue to engage with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to consideration, as appropriate, of the post office network for transactional elements of the business of Government Departments and Agencies, and have stressed to my Government colleagues that the network is ideally configured for over the counter transactions.</p><p>  In relation to postal services, the Government&rsquo;s core policy goal for the postal sector is to ensure that Irish customers, both business and residential, enjoy competitively priced, high quality postal services.  The Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011 has put in place a robust and appropriate regulatory framework for the postal services market.</p><p>  While I have overall responsibility for the postal sector, the Act charges the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), as the postal regulator, with the promotion of the development of the postal sector and particularly the availability of the universal postal service, the promotion of the interests of users and the facilitation of the development of competition in the sector.  ComReg is in regular contact with my Department.</p><p>  Under the 2011 Act, An Post is statutorily required, as the designated universal service provider, to provide a universal postal service.  The essential element of this obligation is the collection and delivery of mail to every address in the State on every working day.  The universal service obligation is a form of safety net, ensuring by way of regulatory obligations that a minimum set of services is provided at an affordable price for the benefit of all users, irrespective of their geographical location.  It is a fundamental principle of the regulatory framework for postal services and is an explicit requirement of the EU Postal Services Directive which has provided for the gradual and controlled opening of the postal services market to competition.  The Deputy may wish to note that the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act of 2011 also makes provision for a compensation mechanism, to be met by the postal industry, if it is found that the universal service obligation is an unfair burden on the designated universal service provider.</p></reply>

In terms of telecommunications policy, my Department plays a key role in providing a supportive legislative and regulatory environment within which competition can flourish and private sector investment can take place.</p><p>  Considerable progress has been made in recent years in both the coverage and speeds of national broadband infrastructure, with a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  The Government has also undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where commercial operators have been unable to offer services.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p><p>  The Government, through the National Broadband Plan, which I published on 30 August last year, has recognised that the key imperative now is to ensure high speed broadband availability to all.  This is a challenge which faces all Member States who in turn experience different barriers to deployment.  The National Broadband Plan commits to ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020.  Ireland is now moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country.</p><p>  As a consequence of the recent multi-band spectrum auction conducted by ComReg, new high speed 4G telecoms services will be rolled out by mobile operators and will significantly increase the speeds available across wireless platforms.  In addition, the commercial sector is already making investments in high speed fixed line services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  This exercise will identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years and will therefore inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aids application in respect of any State-led intervention.  A range of technologies are possible in order to deliver the speeds set out in the National Broadband Plan and the technologies used may vary according to circumstances.  This will ensure that citizens or businesses, wherever they are located, have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business in the digital environment.</p></reply>

EU Commission statistics, published on its digital scoreboard website, which compare marketed broadband speeds across the EU 27 ranks Ireland at 84% access in a range between 2-10 Mbps compared to the EU average of 87% in this range.  In the case of speeds at or exceeding 10 Mbps, the EU Commission reports 29% availability over fixed lines in Ireland compared to an EU average of 48%.</p><p>  It can be noted however that the EU Commission reports are based on 2011 data. The more recent ComReg report notes an overall trend of customers contracting at higher speeds.  The proportion of customers contracting at or below 2 Mbps fell from 7% - to 5% of all subscriptions between Q3 2011 and Q3 2012.  I welcome this trend towards higher speeds which is consistent with the commitment set in the National Broadband Plan, which I published on the 30th August last year, to ensure that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020.</p></reply>

The increased deployment of Electric Vehicles will help in this regard but the primary means of meeting this target will be by the increasing use of biofuels.  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme was introduced in July 2010 and works by obligating large road transport fuel suppliers to bring a certain amount of biofuels to the market. This has seen increased amounts of biofuels such as biodiesel and bioethanol being deployed in Ireland.  From the start of this year, I have increased the obligation on fuel suppliers to include at least 6% by volume biofuels in their overall annual disposal of road transport fuels from the previous obligation rate of 4%.  The recent increase in the obligation rate along with future increases will see the biofuel market grow to an estimated 500 million litres by 2020.  This will continue to create further opportunities for the indigenous biofuel industry.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-31a.347.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013013100060#WRO01900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 140 together.</p><p>  My Department&#8217;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management has developed a policy document, <i>Keeping Communities Safe</i> (KCS), which is intended to set the future direction of fire services in Ireland. It sets out a system of national processes and standards for fire service delivery in Ireland based on a risk management approach to fire safety.  The national standards that are proposed in KCS are in keeping with international good practice and are crucial to a consistent approach across fire services in Ireland.  The standards in question are based on an &#8216;area risk categorisation&#8217; system which will be applied across the country by all fire services.  This will result in fire station areas being risk graded across five bands from very high to very low.  The fire service response in terms of numbers of fire appliances and fire crews in an area is then related to this risk categorisation.  Pre-determined attendances (PDAs) indicate the number of appliances that will be mobilised initially in response to calls for assistance to particular categories of incident.</p><p>  Fires in dwellings (other than chimney fires) are categorised as primary fires and two fire engines will be the normal initial response to primary fires (pre-determined attendance).  This may be varied by the incident commander in light of available information.  The first appliance mobilised to an incident would have a normal crew complement of 5 personnel, to include a designated Incident Commander, with 4 personnel on the second or subsequent appliances mobilised from the same station.  I understand that a small number of stations within Dublin currently respond to an incident with 6 personnel in the first appliance . Therefore, the 20% reduction mentioned in the Question s refers to the impact of the proposal on a limited number of stations within Dublin Fire Brigade.</p><p>  In accordance with KCS, the primary responsibility will be on local service management to conduct a risk categorisation process for its functional area.  However, there is specific provision in KCS that in situations where fire services consider it appropriate to put in place arrangements different to the norms set out above such proposals and the supporting case may be included in the fire service&#8217;s discussions with an External Validation Group. This will ensure, as far as possible, that appropriate risk categorisation is applied and any vulnerabilities are addressed.  The draft KCS document is available on my Department&#8217;s web site at , and I intend to publish it as national policy in the near future.</p></reply>

A landlord may not serve a notice of termination on such a tenant except in very clearly defined circumstances such as a failure by the tenant to comply with his or her obligations in relation to the tenancy, where the landlord intends to sell the property within 3 months after the termination of the tenancy or where the landlord requires the dwelling for his or her own occupation or for that of a family member.</p><p>  The employment status of a tenant, or whether the tenant is in receipt of rent supplement, has no impact on the tenant&#8217;s legal rights to remain in the tenancy for the remainder of the Part 4 tenancy and any changes in that status cannot be used by a landlord as grounds for termination of a Part 4 tenancy.</p></reply>

This includes owners of premises which may for the time being be unoccupied, unless the treatment system serving the property has been emptied and de-commissioned. Septic tanks and other domestic waste water treatment systems which have not been emptied and de-commissioned will contain sludge and waste waters which may constitute a risk to public health or the environment.</p><p>  I recently announced my intention to introduce a grant scheme to provide financial assistance to households whose septic tanks and other domestic wastewater treatment systems require remediation or upgrading following inspection under the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012. The scheme will apply to treatment systems which have been registered by the due date of 1 February 2013 and which are deemed to require remediation having failed an inspection carried out under the 2012 Act. Full details of the scheme will be defined in regulations which I will make in advance of inspections commencing later his year.</p></reply>

Accordingly, it is for that Office to decide on the future of these properties and I do not have a role in relation to the matter.  The Garda Commissioner has stated that the revised structures will continue to support the Garda community philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs.  This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of enhanced patrolling arrangements which, in turn, will provide increased Garda visibility as well as maintaining existing Garda links with communities throughout the country.  The objective will be to ensure that the best possible policing service will continue to be provided to our communities.</p><p>  In addition, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has recently acquired a number of vehicles which are being converted into mobile Garda offices and it is planned that they will be assigned to areas where Garda stations have been closed to ensure that members of the public can continue to conduct their business and interact with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Garda&iacute; work closely with all communities to enhance community safety through a wide range of local fora such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch. Neither I as Minister nor the Government will shirk in our responsibility to do everything we can to maintain the strong Garda connection with the Community and to ensure that to the maximum extent possible  resources will continue to be made available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  I am confident that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to provide a professional policing service right across the country in a manner that is effective and is consistent with the highest standards for which the Force is renowned.</p></reply>

In the circumstances the Deputy will appreciate that the specific financial information she has sought is not readily available and I understand that the provision of such information would involve a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources which are required for other purposes.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the station she has referred to is one of the stations identified for closure under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Annual Policing Plan for 2013.  In that regard I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the annual financial saving estimated to arise in respect of the closure of the stations involved is Euro 4,000 per station.  To a large extent this estimate relates to heating and lighting costs and it does not take account of specific repair bills, which will vary from premises to premises.</p><p>  The closure of the station referred to by the Deputy was proposed by the Garda Commissioner in his Policing Plan for 2013 and I would stress that the key objective involved is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than to secure modest cash savings.  In this context the Commissioner has concluded in relation to certain stations that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if the stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In making his recommendations on the closure of Garda stations, the Commissioner reviewed all aspects of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Garda Commissioner has indicated he is confident that the implementation of the restructuring proposals contained in the 2013 Policing Plan will not lead to any diminution in the service provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In that regard he has stated that the revised structures will continue to support the Garda community philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs. This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of enhanced patrolling arrangements which, in turn, will provide increased Garda visibility as well as maintaining existing Garda links with communities throughout the country.</p></reply>

On 25 January 2010 the application was refused by that Office. An appeal was lodged against the decision to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal by the Refugee Legal Service on 10 February 2010 on the applicant's behalf. It was recommended by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal on 13 July 2010 that the original decision of the Commissioner be affirmed. This recommendation was fully considered by officials of the Ministerial Decisions Unit of my Department during which all the papers on file were examined, including the Section 13 report of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. On 25 August 2010 the applicant was informed that his asylum application was refused and that it was now proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.</p><p>  It should be noted that the refusal of refugee status was not challenged by the applicant by way of Judicial Review proceedings. He was legally represented at the time by the Refugee Legal Service.  He was informed of the three options open to him including his right to make a Subsidiary Protection application, pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006, and representations pursuant to Section 3 of the 1999 Immigration Act. A Subsidiary Protection application and representations pursuant to Section 3 of the 1999 Act were made on behalf of the applicant by the Refugee Legal Service on 9 September 2010. A personal statement on behalf of the applicant was submitted by his solicitors on 13 September 2010.</p><p>  It was determined on 8 August 2011 that the applicant was not eligible for Subsidiary Protection and he was so informed on that day. The applicant's case was then considered pursuant to Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 and Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999. A Deportation Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 11 August 2011 and he was informed of this decision on 30 August 2011.  Judicial Review proceedings were lodged challenging both the refusal of Subsidiary Protection and the decision to make a Deportation Order.

In 2010, an estimated 1.3 million tonnes of fish were taken by the fishing fleets of EU member states from the waters around Ireland (ICES Sub-areas VI &amp; VII).  Ireland landed 259,500 tonnes of these fish or 23% of the international landings. The main fish species caught were mackerel, horse mackerel, boarfish, blue whiting, herring, cod, whiting, haddock, saithe, hake, megrim, anglerfish, plaice, sole and <i>Nephrops</i>.  The Irish authorities are not responsible for compiling data on landings or the value of landings of fish by non Irish fishing vessels, except those landing into Irish fishing ports.  Landing data is the responsibility of the flag Member State.   Landing figures for Member States are publically available on the Eurostat website at the following link. .</p></reply>

In 2010 some 5,916 farmers qualified for payment totalling &euro;5,363k, while in 2011 5,584 received &euro;4,972k. Payments to successful applicants for the 2012 Scheme will issue towards the end of February. The intended three year period of the programme expired at the end of 2012. Nonetheless,  and in order to ensure the maximum impact from the scarce resources available, I have decided to focus a new programme on  encouraging milk suppliers who did not take part in the earlier DEP  and potential new entrants to the sector to participate in the Programme.  The closing date for applications to this new Programme is 15 February 2013 and details can be obtained from my Department&rsquo;s website at (www.agriculture.gov.ie) under &lsquo;Farming Sectors/Dairy Farming/Development Programme for Dairying  &rsquo;.</p></reply>

Furthermore it was established that these trimmings were used in the manufacture of burgers which the Department had found to contain significant amounts of equine DNA. The investigation had therefore established a direct correlation between burgers in which a high level of equine DNA was detected and this raw material product. Further tests of the Polish ingredient concerned also showed significant positive results for equine DNA. I am confident that these findings point to a firm conclusion that the raw material in question was the source of equine DNA introduced into burgers manufactured at Silvercrest. Tests on samples taken from Irish food ingredients were negative.</p><p>  Under EU single market rules, meat products from EU approved plants can be traded freely within the Community. EU rules set down harmonised conditions for approval of meat plants in EU Member States. The onus of compliance with EU food safety regulation rests in the first instance with food business operators. This is subject to a series of official controls, which are the responsibility of the competent authorities in the Member State concerned. The authorities in Poland have been informed of the findings of the investigation relating to equine DNA and are conducting their own enquiries. Official contact was via the Polish Embassy, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Chief Veterinary Officer.</p></reply>

The current findings of the official investigation do not show any evidence that the company deliberately used equine meat in their production process. </p><p>  Under food legislation, the company has primary responsibility for the quality and standards of production at the plant and has carried out its own investigation. In the context of possible resumption of production the company has decided, in addition to deep cleansing of the plant, to change its management and to source its raw material from Ireland and the UK. It has also accepted that my Department would intensify its verification role at the plant with permanent Department presence for an initial period of six months, involving also a DNA sampling regime.</p><p>  The details of the arrangements have not yet been finalised and it is not possible at this time to give an accurate estimate of the cost involved. Aside from the cost associated with permanent on-site Department presence, the cost of laboratory analysis of samples from this company during the course of the investigation has already been quite significant and further costs will arise in that regard.

The programme was introduced in January 2010.  Approximately 53,000 children, or 83% of the eligible age cohort, availed of the programme in this first &quot;short&quot; year.  In the school year 2010-2011, the first full year of the programme, in the region of 63,000 children, that is approximately 94% of the eligible cohort, availed of the free pre-school provision.  In the school year 2011-2012 in the region of 66,000 children, or approximately 93% of the eligible cohort, availed of the programme.</p><p>  In the current school year 2012-2013, some 66,000 children have enrolled for the free pre-school provision at this time and this figure may increase as eligible children can still enter the programme.  It is not possible, from the information available to me, to determine the percentage of the eligible cohort that this figure represents, but it is again anticipated this figure will be well in excess of 90%.</p><p>  Pobal, which administers the childcare support programmes on behalf of my Department, compiles an Annual Survey of the Early Years Sector.  According to its 2011 Annual Survey, there are in the region of 4,300 childcare services participating in the ECCE programme and approximately 3,133 of these services responded to the question relating to the number of staff employed.  The results, which did not distinguish between those working with children enrolled for the ECCE programme and other children in the childcare service, show that some 17,123 staff in the 3,133 services that responded were working directly with children.</p><p>  Prior to 2011, the Pobal survey was compiled on the basis of responses from services funded under the National Childcare Investment Programme and the Community Childcare Subvention Programme, and was part of the contractual requirement of its recipients.  In 2011, however, the questionnaire was circulated to a wider group of early years services to include all services participating in the Early Childhood Care and Education programme and in the Childcare Education and Training Support Programme.  In addition, the questionnaire was presented to recipients as a piece of research rather than a contractual requirement.  This change in methodology (the distribution to much larger numbers, the move to anonymous completion and the removal of the contractual obligation to complete the questionnaire) means that the results are not comparable with previous years.</p></reply>

The report contains a range of recommendations to, among other things, reduce the consumption of alcohol in general.  These recommendations are grouped under five pillars of Supply Reduction (availability), Prevention, Treatment, Rehabilitation and Research.   </p><p>  Real and tangible proposals are currently being finalised on foot of the recommendations in the National Substance Misuse Strategy report. These proposals cover all of the areas mentioned in the report, including: legislation on minimum unit pricing which is about setting a statutory floor price per gram of alcohol; access and availability of alcohol - including of course structural separation in retail units where alcohol is sold; and advertising and sponsorship.  Following consideration by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and liaison with other Departments, I intend to bring forward specific proposals for consideration by Government as soon as possible.  In the meantime, work on developing a framework for the necessary Dept of Health legislation is continuing.  For example, in conjunction with Northern Ireland, a health impact assessment is being commissioned as part of the process of developing a legislative basis for minimum unit pricing.  The health impact assessment will study the impact of different minimum prices on a range of areas such as health, crime and likely economic impact.</p></reply>

I established the Special Delivery Unit, as set out in the Programme for Government. The SDU is working to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  There was significant progress during the course of 2012 in reducing the number of patients waiting on trolleys.  In December 2012, there were 23.6% fewer patients waiting on trolleys as compared with the same period in 2011. This equates to more than 20,000 patients whose experience of our acute hospitals has been significantly improved.  </p><p>  Since before Christmas hospitals have seen a significant increase in the number of very sick patients needing admission.  The increase in norovirus in hospitals has been well publicised; we are also seeing high levels of admissions of frail elderly people and of patients presenting with fractures.    However, evidence from the last year has proved that the health system has the capacity to respond to these challenges and to continue to improve emergency care. The situation is being actively managed at a national level, while all staff including consultants, nurses, allied health staff and management is working extremely hard to address the pressures experienced by hospitals since the New Year.</p><p>  In relation to  Beaumont hospital, an intensive work programme has begun between the SDU&rsquo;s liaison officers, the Clinical Programmes and the hospital teams. Regular meetings are continuing and part of the agenda is to monitor implementation  of service improvements.  The SDU is satisfied that  the hospital is engaged in ensuring that emergency patients are seen in a timely manner, focussing on working to achieve the national targets for unscheduled care.</p></reply>

These include clearly documented processes and timelines for the assessment of new medicines in as timely a fashion as possible.  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducts a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) which provides detailed information on the potential budget impact of the medicine.  It also assesses whether the medicine is cost effective at the price quoted by the company in question.</p><p>  The NCPE published its report on the cost-effectiveness of Kalydeco on 21 January. The report concluded that &ldquo;In view of the very high drug acquisition cost, the significant budget impact, the absence of long term clinical data and the fact that the company has failed to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of ivacaftor we cannot recommend reimbursement of ivacaftor at the submitted price of &euro;234,804 per patient per annum.  A mechanism such as a performance based risk sharing scheme and/or a significant reduction in price could facilitate access to ivacaftor treatment for cystic fibrosis patients with the G551D CFTR mutation&rdquo;.</p><p>  The NCPE report is an important input to assist decision making and will help inform the next stage of the process which involves further discussions with the manufacturer of the drug, in accordance with the aforementioned procedures agreed with the pharmaceutical industry.  The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of Kalydeco that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.  The HSE understands that patients, the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland and clinicians are very anxious that a decision be made as soon as possible.  No further comment is possible at this time as the decision making process is ongoing.</p></reply>

I have emphasised to the HSE the high priority the Government and I attach to this issue.  In January 2012, a detailed plan for the achievement of compliance by NCHDs with the Working Time Directive was submitted to the EU Commission.  The plan affirmed Ireland's commitment to achieving compliance with the Directive over a three-year time period.  It committed to implementing the measures necessary, including: the implementation of new work patterns for medical staff, transfer of work undertaken by NCHDs to other grades, and the organisation of hospital services to support compliance.  The Health Service Executive's Service Plan for 2013 specifically recognises the need to address the issue as a priority, stating that there will be a particular focus in the acute hospital service on the achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive amongst the non-consultant hospital doctor workforce, in line with the Implementation Plan submitted to the Commission in 2012.</p><p>  The HSE is currently finalising its National Operational Plan to support the implementation of the National Service Plan 2013.  This will specify in greater detail the actions to be taken during the year in relation to EWTD compliance.  A key priority for the HSE in 2013 will be a further reduction of average weekly hours worked and also a reduction in the duration of shifts undertaken.  S.I. No. 494 of 2004 European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004, which transposed the EU Working Time Directive for doctors in training, provides for:</p><p>  - A maximum 48 hour average working week;</p><p>  - A 30 minute rest break every 6 hours during period on-site on-call</p><p>  - 11 hours rest every 24 hours or equivalent compensatory rest before return to work; and</p><p>  - 35 hours continuous rest per week or twice a fortnight or 59 hours continuous rest per fortnight.</p><p>  The 2010 Contract of Employment for NCHDs, which these staff sign on appointment, reflects the above provisions.  The contract also provides that NCHDs shall not be required to work more than 24 consecutive hours on-site.  A related agreement between the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation provides that the contract is subject to the requirements of the Directive.</p></reply>

The allocation for this Care Group amounts to &#8364;114 million for 2013.  This covers a range of areas including Addiction; Alcohol; Homelessness; Intercultural Health (i.e. Asylum seekers, refugees, migrants etc.); Irish Travellers and Roma; LGBT; and HIV/AIDS,<font color="#FF0000"> </font>together with elements of community development and gender based violence.  The total Traveller health budget for 2011 amounted to &#8364;12.3 million.  This amount does not include costs of health service provision of those mainstream services which members of the Traveller community are entitled to access.  Finalised Traveller health budget figures for 2012 are not yet available but are expected to be approximately 2-5% lower than the 2011 figure, in line with the funding reductions applied as part of the requirement of the health service to meet ongoing financial challenges.  A similar reduction is expected to apply during 2013.  However efforts are being made to protect the funding allocated towards more vulnerable groups as far as possible.</p></reply>

It was a comprehensive study of the health and social status of the Traveller community in Ireland and was carried out by the School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Population Science, University College Dublin on behalf of Travellers, with the direct involvement of Travellers.  The findings of the Study provide a strong evidence base for assessing existing and future service delivery and allowed the identification of a range priorities and means of addressing these.</p><p>  The following priority areas for action were identified to address the findings of the Study: Mental Health; Suicide; Men&rsquo;s Health; Addiction/Alcohol; Domestic Violence; Diabetes; Cardiovascular Health.  The HSE has already put in place measures to address these agreed priority areas and the Traveller Health Advisory Forum within the HSE is in the process of preparing a detailed action plan.

The aim of the SDU is to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  There was significant progress during the course of 2012 in reducing the number of patients waiting on trolleys.  In December 2012, there were 23.5% fewer patients waiting on trolleys compared to December 2011. This equates to more than 20,000 patients whose experience of our acute hospitals has been significantly improved.  Since before Christmas hospitals have seen a significant increase in the number of very sick patients needing admission.  The increase in norovirus in hospitals has been well publicised; we are also seeing high levels of admissions of frail elderly people and of patients presenting with respiratory related illnesses.  However, evidence from the last year has proved that the health system has the capacity to respond to these challenges and to continue to improve emergency care.  The situation is being actively managed at a national level, while all staff including consultants, nurses, allied health staff and management is working extremely hard to address the pressures experienced by hospitals since the New Year.</p><p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

They informed me of their intention to increase premiums by 8%.  I told them in the strongest possible terms that this was not acceptable to me.  They have since announced that the premium increase will now be 6%.  I remain very concerned about the cost of health insurance.  The Government is committed to keeping down the cost of health insurance so that it is affordable for as many people as possible.  It remains committed to protecting community rating, whereby everyone pays the same price for the same health insurance product, irrespective of age or health status. </p><p>  I have repeatedly raised the issue of costs with health insurers as a whole and am determined to address costs in the sector in the interests of consumers.  Last year, I established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and the Department of Health.  This Forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.  The Forum will also give a voice to the insurers in the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model.  I have also made it clear to the health insurers that I believe that significant savings can still be made, the effect of which can be to minimise the need for increases in premiums.</p><p>  Given VHI&rsquo;s very significant share of overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs and to address aggressively the base cost of procedures, including professional fees. Specific areas which I have requested to be addressed include:</p><p>  - Audit  - of the volume of procedures;</p><p>  - Clinical audit &ndash; to determine the appropriateness of procedures being claimed for;</p><p>  - Procedure based payments &ndash; in particular with a view to their extension to the public health sector;</p><p>  - Benchmarking &ndash; to determine the underlying basis for the cost of specific procedures, with a view to driving costs downwards.</p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place, which is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2012 gave effect to a new Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) with effect from 1 January 2013.  This will contribute to the protection of affordability for those who need it most.  It is important to note that the measures contained in the new Risk Equalisation Scheme are designed to result in no overall increase of premiums paid in the market, rather it is intended to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy and the less healthy, as well as the old and the young. </p><p>  Finally, many consumers can make large savings on their health insurance premiums.  I would strongly advise consumers to shop around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs.  For those who have been insured on the same plan for a number of years, it is important to review the level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.</p></reply>

The negotiation process is necessary due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance between the negotiated price and each person's contribution.  The cost of long term residential care in public nursing homes is determined by the HSE.</p><p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund Board have advised that in the period 1st February 2012 to 31st January 2013 the following activity occurred in relation to prices for long term residential care in private and voluntary nursing homes: Number of Private Nursing Homes that obtained NTPF agreement to increase price - 6;  Number of Private Nursing Homes that agreed with NTPF to reduce price - 42.</p><p>  In addition, long term price agreements (ranging from 2 to 5 years) were contracted in 2010 shortly after the introduction of the Scheme in 2009.  This approach was taken to ensure greater long term price stability of the Scheme and also represented value for the tax payer.  Some of these longer term contracts are index linked and the application of inflation clauses applied to a total of 140 nursing homes during the year ended 31st January 2013. Each nursing home's pricing arrangements are, in any event, assessed by NTPF on an individual nursing home basis as current contracts expire and fall due for renewal and renegotiation.  At the 31st January 2013 a total of 426 private nursing homes had pricing contracts with NTPF for the provision of long term residential care.</p></reply>

It should be noted that in total there are 29 agencies under my Department's remit with a total of 236 individuals currently serving on boards.  It is important to note that the boards of each body are appointed in different fashions, with some positions being <i>ex officio </i>positions, some worker directors or others directly appointed by me, or by Government or with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  In almost all cases the legislation provides that a Minister may appoint up to a certain number of individuals.  There is rarely a requirement that all positions be filled, and as is outlined below, there are good reasons why not all positions may be filled.</p><p>My Department advertised new procedures for appointment to boards on Friday 8th April 2011 which provided for any interested party to express an interest in becoming a member of the board of any of the State agencies for which I have responsibility.   All appointments from that date have followed these procedures.  I have received more than 400 expressions of interest since the new procedures were advertised and more than 40 of these individuals have been appointed to various Boards under the Department's aegis.  Given the importance of ensuring the right mix of skills and experience on every board, appointments are not necessarily confined to those who have made an expression of interest.  On becoming Minister, I was particularly concerned that on many of the boards appointed under the previous Government there were obvious skills and experience gaps, and in my appointments to date, I have sought to rectify this.</p><p>It should be noted that I have, from time to time, decided not to fill all existing vacancies.  This is the case with a number of smaller bodies under my Department's aegis, where the scale of the agency's operation would not justify a larger board.   Similarly, in a number of cases where the legislation provides for a very large board I have taken the decision not to fill a number of positions.  Therefore, where there is flexibility under the relevant Act, I have on occasion appointed less than the maximum number of directors.  I have also made considerable efforts to select suitably skilled candidates even if this involved some delay in making the appointment.   I believe that when making appointments to positions that carry terms over a number of years, suitable care must be taken to ensure that appropriate individual are appointed.</p><p>A decision on the separation of Cork and Shannon airports, as envisaged under the State Airports Act 2004 was not made until 2012.  As a consequence, when the terms of appointment of the directors of both boards expired on 31 December 2011, a decision was made then not to fill all vacancies on each board until a substantive decision was made on separation and on the future structure of the DAA. </p><p>On 27th November 2012, the Government confirmed its earlier decision in principle to establish Shannon as an independent autonomous airport and to merge it with a restructured Shannon Development to form a new publicly owned commercial entity.   In light of this decision vacancies on both the Cork and Shannon Airport Authority Boards will be filled during the course of 2013.</p><p><table><tr><th>State Board</th><th>Vacancy Dates From: </th></tr><tr><td>National Roads Authority</td><td>7 October 2012</td></tr><tr><td>National Roads Authority</td><td>31 October 2012</td></tr><tr><td>National Roads Authority</td><td>31 October 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath </td><td>1 June 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath </td><td>1 June 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann </td><td>17  May 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann </td><td>17  May 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Railway Procurement Agency</td><td>1 January 2013</td></tr><tr><td>Railway Procurement Agency</td><td>6 August 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Railway Safety Advisory Council</td><td>16 May 2011</td></tr><tr><td>Railway Safety Advisory Council</td><td>11 May 2010</td></tr><tr><td>Taxi Advisory Committee to NTA</td><td>9 August 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Airport Authority plc</td><td>6 December 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Airport Authority plc</td><td>31 December 2012 </td></tr><tr><td>Shannon Airport Authority plc</td><td>31 December 2011</td></tr><tr><td>Shannon Airport Authority plc</td><td>31 December 2011</td></tr><tr><td>Shannon Airport Authority plc</td><td>31 December 2011</td></tr><tr><td>Shannon Airport Authority plc</td><td>31 December 2011</td></tr><tr><td>Shannon Airport Authority plc</td><td>31 December 2011</td></tr><tr><td>Shannon Airport Authority plc</td><td>31 December 2011</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Airport Authority plc</td><td>31 December 2011</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Airport Authority plc</td><td>31 December 2011</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Airport Authority plc</td><td>31 December 2011</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Airport Authority plc</td><td>31 December 2011</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Airport Authority plc</td><td>31 December 2011</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Airport Authority plc</td><td>31 December 2011</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Airport Authority plc</td><td>31 December 2011</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Aviation Authority</td><td>12 November 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Marine Casualty Investigation Board</td><td>29 December 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Port of Cork Company</td><td>30 September 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Drogheda Port Company</td><td>12 June 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Drogheda Port Company</td><td>14 December 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Port Company</td><td>18 September 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Harbour Company</td><td>30 September 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Harbour Company</td><td>12 June 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Harbour Company</td><td>3 December 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Shannon Foynes Port Company</td><td>29 August 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Port of Waterford Company</td><td>12 June 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Galway Harbour Company</td><td>21 November 2012</td></tr><tr><td>New Ross Port Company</td><td>24 April 2012</td></tr><tr><td>New Ross Port Company</td><td>12 June 2012</td></tr><tr><td>New Ross Port Company</td><td>12 June 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow Port Company</td><td>12 June 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow Port Company</td><td>12 June 2012</td></tr><tr><td>National Sports Campus Development Authority (NSCDA)</td><td>15 November 2010</td></tr><tr><td>National Sports Campus Development Authority (NSCDA)</td><td>23 March 2012</td></tr><tr><td>National Sports Campus Development Authority (NSCDA)</td><td>23 March 2012</td></tr><tr><td>National Sports Campus Development Authority (NSCDA)</td><td>23 March 2012</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Sports Council (ISC)</td><td>14 January 2013</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Driver licence fees have not been keeping pace with inflation since 1989 and, as a result, the driver licence service has been under funded for many years and has had to rely heavily on the Exchequer.   I made the decision to increase fees from 1 January to allow for the service to become self-funding in 2013 and every year thereafter.</p><p>  In respect of people between the ages of 60 and 67, a driving licence may be granted for a period of 1 year or 3 years, together with the unexpired period of a licence previously granted to the applicant, where the application for the licence is required to be accompanied by a medical report and the medical report indicates that the applicant appears to require medical review.  However, where an application does not require a medical report to be accompanied, all licences with a validity period greater than 3 years and less than 10 will be charged &euro;55.   It would have been administratively difficult to apply a different or proportionate pricing regime in these circumstances.  However, I opted to maintain the position that no fee would apply to applicants over 70 years of age.  Similarly, no fee will apply to anyone wishing to change personal details on a licence.</p></reply>

The report  on the public consultation process is available on the NTA's website.  The NTA has also briefed the Cabinet Sub-Committee on the process in October 2012.</p><p>  The public consultation submissions will be considered and taken into account  by the NTA  in coming forward with proposals.  Where the NTA proposes to enter into a further direct award contract or contracts for bus services it is obliged to carry out a statutory consultation under section 52 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  Furthermore, the NTA may only enter into a direct award contract &ldquo;where it is satisfied that the continued adequacy of the public bus passenger services to which the contracts relate can only be guaranteed in the general economic interest by entering into such direct award contracts.&quot;   Accordingly the matter will require further examination before any decisions are taken.</p></reply>
