In the area of Common Security and Defence Policy, the role of the Presidency is now limited to supporting the High Representative and the European External Action Service in this regard.  However, that said, this arrangement provides Ireland with an opportunity to influence the Common Security and Defence Policy agenda.   T  he EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy forms an integral part of the Union&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy. In the area of Common Security and Defence Policy, the role of the Presidency is now limited to supporting the High Representative and the European External Action Service in this regard.  However, that said, this arrangement provides Ireland with an opportunity to influence the Common Security and Defence Policy agenda. </p><p>  Following on from an initiative by Ireland, the EU adopted an Action Plan on EU/UN co-operation.  This action plan provides the contextual backdrop to the adoption as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Council 2013, the enhancement of EU/UN Relations, in particular, through EU engagement and participation in UN Peacekeeping.</p><p>  I, and my Department, hosted a very successful and well attended seminar in Dublin Castle on this subject.  Speakers from the EU, NATO, the UN and, for the first time, the African Union, as well as academia gave informative presentations to over 120 delegates who attended from all over Europe.</p><p>  This seminar informed the follow up discussion at the Informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers who recognised the primacy of the UN in the maintenance of international peace and security and the requirement for the EU to work hand in hand with the UN.  Attendance by the UN at the Informal meeting of EU Ministers for Defence, represented by the Under Secretary General at the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, has cemented this priority into the thinking of the EU. </p><p>  Evidence of the deepening of co-operation between the European Union and the United Nations has resulted in the re-establishment of an EU/UN steering board which now meets on a regular basis.  The most recent meeting took place two weeks ago.  Furthermore at that meeting the UN undertook to provide the EU with a list of capabilities it requires to undertake international peacekeeping operations so as to ascertain how the EU may assist.  As such we now have a concrete process for cultivating closer co-operation between the EU and the UN, partly as a result of this being made a priority of our Presidency.</p><p>  In summary, this priority has and will continue to provide impetus to the Union as a whole to the enhancement of co-operation between the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy and the United Nations.</p></reply>

I am advised that the Red Cross have indicated to my officials that they are satisfied in principle with the Department&rsquo;s proposals. For the purposes of clarity, the Deputy may wish to note that it is not intended to alter the existing corporate governance arrangements of the Society. I anticipate subject to Government approval that a Red Cross (Amendment) Bill will be published during the lifetime of this Government.</p></reply>

I conveyed to the troops our deep appreciation for the outstanding manner in which they continue to perform their duties on overseas service. </p><p>The visit to the troops was part of a comprehensive St Patrick&rsquo;s Day programme in the Middle East. During my visit to the Irish/Finnish battalion&rsquo;s area of operations, I received briefings on the current situation in the region and met with the UNIFIL Force Commander, General Paolo Serra of Italy. I also laid a wreath at the Memorial in Tibnin to the forty-seven members of the Defence Forces who died in Lebanon in the cause of peace. </p><p>When in Lebanon I also met with the Lebanese Minister for Defence, Mr. Fayez Ghosn and we discussed the current security and political situation and the challenges being faced by Lebanon and how their efforts can be supported by Ireland and the international community. I also discussed with him the current conflict in Syria and the refugee crisis, and in particular the number of Syrian refugees in the Lebanon and the supports required by Lebanon from the EU. </p><p>On 12 March 2013, I visited the Golan Heights and I met with Irish Defence Forces personnel who are serving with the UN Truce Supervision Organisation as unarmed Military Observers in support of UNDOF, the UN monitoring force on the Golan Heights. I also met Major General Iqbal Singh Singha from India, the Head of Mission and Force Commander UNDOF. I was briefed on security issues in that area, especially the growing risks flowing from instability in Syria and the impact of the refugee crisis in the region. </p><p>In Israel, I engaged in trade promotion activities, attended a business breakfast organised by the IDA and the Embassy. I also attended the Israel launch of the Ireland-Israel Business Network.The IDA and the Ireland Israel Business Network are following up on contacts made.I attended the 45th anniversary celebration of the Ireland Israel Friendship League where I met with many of the Irish diaspora in Israel. I also attended Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day events held in Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv. In the course of my visit I also attended an Ireland/Israel seminar on road safety where the experiences of the relevant authorities in both States were shared and options for continued engagement in improving road safety were explored. I received a briefing on ongoing developments in the use of unmanned aerial systems for security surveillance purposes. The Defence Forces already use such systems in peacekeeping operations. </p><p>In relation to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, I received briefings and had a number of discussions on the overall political situation, with a number of politicians including both the outgoing and incoming Ministers for Justice in Israel, Yaakov Neeman and Tzipi Livni respectively. Tzipi Livni has been appointed by the Israeli Prime Minister as the lead negotiator with the Palestinians to advance the peace process. </p><p>While visiting Ramallah in the West Bank, I met with Nabil Shaath, a senior Palestinian official and negotiator, with the Minister for Justice of the Palestinian Authority, Mr Ali Muhanna and with NGOs and UN agencies operating on the ground. I reiterated at every opportunity the Irish Government&rsquo;s strong and consistent support for a two State solution resulting in a sovereign State of Palestine existing peacefully alongside a secure Israel and Ireland&rsquo;s support for the recommencement of discussions in respect of the peace process. </p><p>I was also briefed by Mr Kenneth Deane Head of mission of EUPOL COPPS, the EU&rsquo;s police training mission with the Palestinian police, which Ireland has strongly supported. Throughout my visit to the Middle East, I also promoted economic cooperation, high-tech research and innovation, bilateral trade links and tourism. </p></reply>

Of the 439 personnel serving overseas, 427 are Army, 2 are Naval Service and 10 are Air Corps personnel.</p><p>  The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 357 personnel, including the Deputy Force Commander; the EU Training Mission (EUTM) Somalia with 10 personnel, including the Mission Commander; the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) with 8 personnel; the EUFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina with 7 personnel; the NATO-led international security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 12 personnel; and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan with 7 personnel.  Ireland also contributes 23 observers and staff to various United Nations and OSCE missions and 15 other personnel to staff appointments at UN, EU and OSCE headquarters.</p><p>  The current contribution of some 439 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.</p><p>  As regards future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. When considering any particular request, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved are amongst the factors considered. </p><p>  Last month, Ireland received requests from the UN to deploy a small number of additional observers to the UN Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East to the Headquarters of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in Syria.  These requests are currently receiving consideration and a decision will be made shortly.  </p><p>  No other formal request has been received from the UN for Defence Forces participation in additional missions.  However, the UN regularly advises member States of deficiencies in existing or new missions.  In this regard, my Department is also currently considering whether there is the potential for the Defence Forces to contribute to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA).  </p></reply>

The level of participation in extracurricular sporting activities is governed by the exigencies of the service and no distinction is made in favour of any particular sporting discipline.  In the recent past, many members of the Defence Forces, both male and female, have brought great honour to the Organisation, through their success, at the highest level in, for example, Gaelic games, boxing and League of Ireland soccer and this is to be welcomed.</p><p>  Participation in sports and sporting activity forms an integral part of reaching and maintaining the Defence Forces desired fitness profile. As part of an overall structured training programme, a programme of sporting activities is available for members of the Defence Forces to participate in.  This is managed and overseen by the Defence Forces Athletic Association.</p></reply>

In the area of Common Security and Defence Policy, the role of the Presidency is now limited to supporting the High Representative and the European External Action Service in this regard.  However, that said, this arrangement provides Ireland with an opportunity to influence the Common Security and Defence Policy agenda. </p><p>  As part of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Council 2013 I prioritised a number of areas to progress during our Presidency.  These priorities included:</p><p>1. Preparations for the European Council in December 2013, which will include a thematic discussion on security and defence/military capabilities.</p><p>2. Continued development of the Common Security and Defence Policy.</p><p>3. Addressing the impact of the Financial Crisis on Defence, (Pooling and Sharing).   </p><p>4. Enhancing EU/UN Relations;</p><p>5. EU cooperation in the area of Maritime Security and Surveillance;  </p><p>6. Support for Jobs, Growth and Innovation through focusing on the role of SMEs in fostering innovation in the security sector.</p><p>  In relation to progress made during the Presidency, the key event of the presidency was the Informal meeting of Defence Ministers held in Dublin Castle in February.  The Secretary General of NATO, on his first formal visit to Ireland, attended the meeting as did, the UN for the first time and was represented by the Under-Secretary General in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. A range of issues were discussed including the upcoming European Council on Defence, Mali, the Horn of Africa and Partnerships between the EU and the United Nations. </p><p>  To date, two very successful seminars have also been held in Ireland.  The first seminar was on the topic of Regional Organisations Co-Operation with the United Nations in the area of Crisis Management, Peace Support and Peace Enforcement Operations.  The second seminar dealt with the issue of Maritime Security and Surveillance.  The outcomes have been very positive for both seminars and have stimulated debate in these areas at EU and institutional levels.  </p><p>  In summary, the priorities have centred on how Ireland and the Union as a whole can contribute to the enhancement of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy, a critical component of the EU&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy, which is central to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy objectives.  </p></reply>

The Military Archives also provides advice and other services to the Defence Organisation, assisting in the administration and management of its records. From as early as 1924, the Defence Forces undertook to preserve historical documents from that time and since 1990 the Military Archives has been the official place of deposit for such material, including that of the Army Pensions Board, under the terms of the National Archives Act, 1986.   </font><font color="#002100">Associated with the Military Archives is the Military Service Pensions Archive (MSPA) project which, although not currently in the public domain, is a cornerstone of the Government's Centenary Programme.  Approximately 300,000 files relating to the period from Easter Week 1916, through the War of Independence and Civil War comprise this collection.  The files relate mainly to applications by individuals and/or their dependants for the award of pension and gratuities for veterans who served as members of the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Citizen Army, the Hibernian Rifles, the Irish Republican Army, Cumann na mBan, Na Fianna &Eacute;ireann, the National Army/Defence Forces on active service or who were casualties or wounded while on duty during the period from April and May 1916 through to 30 September 1923.  </font></p><p>  It is not possible to accurately record all costs associated with the Military Archives as a proportion of the work that contributes to this important activity is done in the ordinary course of the day to day duties of a wide range of Defence Forces and Department of Defence personnel.  The annual budget for the Military Archives is &euro;50,000 per annum and in addition for 2013 there is a further budget allocation of &euro;100,000 allocated to a digitization project.  Since the MSPA project commenced in 2008, the Military Archives have incurred direct costs of some &euro;1m., including costs associated with the MSPA project.  This figure would not necessarily include full costs of all incidentals and consumables, or all IT support; nor would it include salary costs.  </p><p><font color="#002100">During 2012, 1.5 million views were recorded from 142 countries on the online access to Military Archive services.  This recording of usage began in January 2012 following the launch of the Military Archives website.  In addition, the Military Archives facilitates research by the public, including academic, family and local history researchers.  Demand for this service has grown with 3,383 e-mail or postal queries received by Military Archives in 2012 and 2,869 telephone requests for information.</font></p><p><font color="#002100">The Military Archives is located at Cathal Brugha Barracks, Rathmines, Dublin and is open to the public from Tuesday to Thursday of each week by prior appointment.  On average, the eight available research seats are fully utilised on a daily basis.</font></p></reply>

The required savings of recent years, in both pay and non-pay, have necessitated a flexible and adaptive approach from the Defence Organisation. A key focus has been the prioritisation and maintenance of Permanent Defence Force operational capacity in order to ensure that the Permanent Defence Force retain the capacity to fulfil all roles assigned.</p><p>  Arising from the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in 2011, the Government agreed to stabilise the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel.  </p><p>  The Defence Organisation has recently undertaken further significant re-organisation and reform as a result of the revised strength ceiling.

He did so at the invitation of the EU High Representative and myself to participate in the informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers which was held at Dublin Castle, as part of Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency.  During his visit Mr. Rasmussen expressed his appreciation for the cooperation NATO has had with Ireland since we joined the Partnership for Peace in 1999.  He paid tribute to the contribution Ireland has made to UN-led peacekeeping missions and to UN-mandated missions which are led by regional organizations such as NATO and the EU.    Participation in overseas peacekeeping missions is a key element of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and has been an important dimension in meeting Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations as a member of the UN and the EU.  With the increasing use of more robust Chapter VII missions/operations, in the past number of years, the UN has turned to regional organisations to undertake and lead missions on its behalf. In effect the EU, the AU and NATO, together with other similar such organisations, are now major players in UN peacekeeping. </p><p>  As the House will be aware, Ireland has been contributing Defence Forces Personnel to UN mandated, NATO-led missions since 1997, when we contributed personnel to the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Our forces have and continue to serve in Kosovo and Afghanistan.</p><p>  As members of Partnership for Peace (PfP), Ireland participates in PfP&rsquo;s Planning and Review Process (PARP). As part of this process, Ireland has adopted a range of Partnership Goals aimed at assisting Ireland to meet its UN/EU commitments in the areas of Counter Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED), Cyber Security, Network Enabled Services, etc. Membership of PfP has allowed the Defence Forces to gain access to NATO standards &ndash; which are internationally-recognised as representing best practice for the development of military capabilities.  The Defence Forces participation in PARP will continue as part of our engagement in Partnership for Peace.</p></reply>

High level  representatives from the European Commission, European External Action Service, the European Defence Agency, NATO and national and international academics and practitioners, made presentations at the Seminar.  </p><p>The seminar highlighted the importance of building EU wide consensus and cooperation in relation to security and surveillance in the maritime domain in support of EU Sea Basins Strategies (including the new EU Atlantic Strategy), the Integrated Maritime Policy, the Common Information Sharing Environment and Common Security and Defence Policy.  In meeting the challenges of the 21st   century, the unique aspects of the Union&rsquo;s maritime and surveillance domain was highlighted. The seminar drew lessons from existing EU Sea Basin strategies and the technologies and operational procedures which support collaboration among member States, with a particular focus on EU Navies.  </p><p>  The seminar also highlighted that the EU&rsquo;s seas and oceans provide an essential contribution to our wealth and wellbeing and hold immense untapped economic opportunities, in terms of energy, food and mineral resources.  It is a very significant resource worth protecting.  To achieve these benefits closer cross-sector and cross-border cooperation is required and this was clearly articulated during the seminar.</p><p>  Key initiatives which are now being developed include:</p><p>  The Atlantic Strategy, which will cover the coasts, territorial and jurisdictional waters of the five EU Member States with an Atlantic coastline &ndash; France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.  Preliminary meetings between these five Member States have taken place and work is ongoing regarding the development of this strategy, in which Ireland is playing a key role.   </p><p>  The &ldquo;MARSUR&rdquo; project, involving 13 Member States, including Ireland, will develop the Recognised Maritime Picture exchange network to allow for the sharing of sensitive and confidential maritime information among participating member States Naval Forces in a safe and secure manner. The Irish Naval Service participates in this project.  </p><p>  The Common Information Sharing Environment (an EU Commission initiative) - will allow for the exchange of information across all EU maritime sectors, through the integration of existing maritime systems with the use of modern technologies, in a cost efficient and effective manner.  &ldquo;MARSUR&rdquo; will ultimately feed into this system. </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in this project will enhance information sharing and knowledge transfer between Member States and build working relationships based on &ldquo;mutual trust&rdquo; with other European agencies at the operational level.  This is evident by Ireland&rsquo;s very successful involvement in drug seizures, the success of which is dependent on building partnerships between the various actors in this domain.</p></reply>

Whilst the Defence Forces are not a Principal Response Agency, as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, they provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or severe weather emergency in its Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) role under the muli-agency Framework. At National level, representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, by both my Department and the Defence Forces ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency.  The Defence Forces are also represented on the eight Regional Working Groups that have been established under the Framework and, on an ongoing basis, designated members of the Defence Forces, based around the country, act as Liaison Officers to Local Authorities.</p><p>  In relation to security, primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence (2000) is to provide Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  A wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies and the Defence Forces hold regular coordination and liaison meetings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues.</p><p>  Similar to all other Government Departments, it is imperative that the Department and the Defence Forces take into account the current difficult economic environment we are now operating in. The budgetary situation will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment, including vehicles, upgrades of equipment and different technologies. Within the resource envelope available for Defence, the Defence Forces will continue to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.</p></reply>

In order to sustain a Reserve Force at a strength level of 4,069 within existing resources, gratuities have been withdrawn from members of the Reserve and money previously allocated to gratuities has been redirected into paid training to increase the number of paid Mandays.  This measure has significantly boosted the number of Mandays available to members of the Reserve, rising from 30,000 Mandays in 2012 to 41,500 in 2013.

The Wider Horizons Programme was one of very many successful programmes that the Fund supported over that time. All of these programmes would not have been possible without the support of the international donors to the Fund, the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia and New Zealand to whom we should all be very thankful. I understand the Fund is operating with significantly reduced resources and this, coupled with changes in Northern Ireland, requires it to adapt its approach.    Regrettably despite the remarkable progress made to secure peace on the island of Ireland, some work is still required in those communities that have not previously, or only partially, engaged in peace building and reconciliation activities. Based on the need for this additional intervention the Fund has developed a strategic framework for the period 2012-2015 which has three specific elements which will target very specific areas and groups with a view to embedding the Peace Process in communities that to date have not fully engaged with it.   I understand that the Fund will formally launch its new strategy shortly and I will arrange for a copy to be furnished to Deputy Martin </p></reply>

It is a matter for the President of the European Council to bring it to the European Council for decision. I understand that it is intended to do so in a timely fashion to allow for the necessary arrangements to be made at national level in Member States in good time for the 2014 elections.    The Government does not view the current proposal as providing a basis for further adjustments to the composition of the European Parliament beyond the 2014 elections. In this context, we note the intention of the European Parliament, as outlined in its resolution, to submit, before the end of 2015 and in good time for the 2019 elections, a new proposal for a decision of the European Council, with the aim of establishing a durable and transparent system which, in future before each election, will allow seats to be apportioned amongst Member States in an objective manner, based on the principle of degressive proportionality as required by the Treaty and taking account of any increase in the number of Member States and demographic trends in their population.   The resolution was adopted by a substantial majority in the European Parliament. When the decision of the European Council is taken, it must be consented to by the Parliament.

This decision was taken due to the unfolding financial situation in Cyprus at the time.  This required the presence of the President of the European Commission, Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso and President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy.  It was decided, in agreement with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, that the Summit be rescheduled at the earliest possible opportunity.   From 15-19 April the first round of negotiations took place in Brussels.  The next round of negotiations is scheduled for 24-28 June in Tokyo.    Japan is the EU's 7th largest trading partner globally and the EU&rsquo;s 2nd biggest trading partner in Asia after China.  Conversely, the European Union is Japan&rsquo;s 3rd largest trading partner.  The opening up of Japan to further European trade and investment is expected to generate considerable gains for Ireland and our EU partners.  It is estimated that an EU-Japan FTA could increase the EU&rsquo;s GDP by 0.8% and create more than 400,000 jobs for the EU economy.</p></reply>

Over the past four years, despite the unprecedented economic difficulties facing the country, this Government, and indeed its predecessor, provided significant financial allocations to Ireland&rsquo;s development aid programme. Expenditure on Official Development Assistance (ODA) and its percentage of Gross National Product (GNP) for the past four years is as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div> Total ODA</div></th><th><div>ODA as a % of GNP </div></th></tr><tr><td><div> -</div></td><td><div>&euro;m</div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>628.98</div></td><td><div>0.47%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>657.04</div></td><td><div>0.52%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>675.83</div></td><td><div>0.52%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>722.20</div></td><td><div>0.54%</div></td></tr></table></p><p>One World, One Future restates the Programme for Government commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP to ODA.

Therefore it will be a matter for the relevant State/public body as property owner to calculate the tax due based on its assessment of the market value of its property and submit a completed LPT Return in respect of all properties in their ownership.  The Property Management Service in the Office of Public Works has engaged with the Revenue Commissioners and concluded an exercise to identify all those state owned properties which may be liable for the LPT within its portfolio.  The OPW Valuation Service is currently engaged in assigning these properties to the appropriate tax band and work will be complete in advance of the Revenue deadline.</p><p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that where local authority owned properties are not exempt from LPT, the market value of any such property will be deemed to fall into the lowest valuation band of zero to &euro;100,000 for the period up to and including 2016. This will result in an LPT charge of &euro;45 per property for 2013 and &euro;90 per year for 2014 to 2016. In addition, section 119 of the 2012 Act also gives local authorities until 2014 to pay the 2013 tax.  In common with other liable persons who own multiple properties, local authorities have until 28 May 2013 to file their LPT Returns.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that joint owners of a property are jointly and severally liable for LPT in respect of the property.  I am further informed that the Revenue Commissioners issued one LPT Return for each residential property to the person that the Commissioners designated as the liable person for the property and only one Return should be filed for a property.  Joint owners of a property can, however, decide who should be the designated liable person in respect of the property and requests to change the designated liable person for a property must be submitted in writing to the LPT Branch, PO Box 1, Limerick or by emailing <i><font color="#0000FF">lpt@revenue.ie</font></i>.  Once this person is identified on the Register as an owner of the property, all future LPT correspondence for the property will be addressed to this person and he or she will be required to file the LPT Return and pay the tax due.</p><p>  Accordingly, where one owner of the property files the LPT Return and pays the tax due, this discharges the LPT liability for the property and meets the obligations for the joint owners.  Revenue records will reflect the position regarding the receipt of the Return for each property, the valuation band declared for the property and the payment made and this information will be available to all of the property owners associated with that property so that there can be complete clarity as to status of LPT for that property.  This information is accessed through the Revenue LPT online system using the unique Property ID and PIN so it is important to retain these for future use.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the LPT online system has been developed in such a way as to provide the necessary information to all owners that have been linked to the property and, where the full liability has been paid by one of the owners, the obligations of the joint owners will have been met and no accumulation of arrears of tax will arise.</p></reply>

I am informed by the bank that very substantial funding deficits exist in the various defined benefit schemes.</p><p>  Permanent TSB has advised me that, in response to this significant problem and as part of a review of the overall cost base of the business, it has recently communicated to staff plans to discontinue employer contributions to all the existing defined benefit pension schemes and to commence, in their place, contributions to a new defined contribution pension scheme from 1 June 2013.  I am informed by Permanent TSB that there are currently 1,360 staff in defined benefit schemes in Permanent TSB which will be affected by this move.  Ultimately it is for the trustees of the defined benefit schemes to decide how the schemes will respond to this development but it will most likely result in the relevant defined benefit schemes being wound up and the assets already accumulated being distributed among the members of the relevant schemes in accordance with the requirements of the Pensions Act. I have been informed that the matter may be referred to the Labour Court but that would be an issue for the various interested parties.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware there is a Relationship Framework in place with Permanent TSB which provides the basis on which the relationship between the Minister and Permanent TSB is governed. Under the terms of the Relationship Framework the bank operates as an independent economic entity and matters such as this fall within the purview of the bank.</p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that the Minister for Finance has not been asked, and is not required, under the terms of the Relationship Framework to give approval for a wind-up of Permanent TSB's defined benefit pension schemes.</p></reply>

It would for example be necessary to know the effect of leaving the retirement scheme in question relative to the terms of the scheme rules; how long the farmer was within the scheme; what use was made of the land during the period the farmer was within the scheme and what use is being made of the land since leaving the scheme. In the absence of this information, it is only possible to reply in general terms.  Section 598 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that land which has been owned and used by an individual for the purposes of farming for a period of 10 years, ending with the transfer of an interest in that land for the purposes of complying with the relevant Early Retirement From Farming Scheme, qualifies for retirement relief where an individual disposes of that land. In order to qualify for the relief, the individual must be aged 55 years or over.</p><p>  Currently, full relief from capital gains tax applies where the aggregate consideration for disposals outside the family does not exceed &euro;750,000 and the farmer making the disposal satisfies the conditions governing the tax relief outlined above. Marginal relief may apply where the consideration does not greatly exceed that amount. In the case of disposals by individuals aged 66 or over on or after 1 January 2014, the relief will be reduced to &euro;500,000.</p><p>  If you wish to provide me with the information required and the name and address of the taxpayer in question, I will request the Revenue Commissioners to provide a definitive reply.</p></reply>

There are numerous benefits from the arrangements that have been undertaken. There are efficiency gains from housing &lsquo;legacy assets&rsquo; in a single vehicle, NAMA. Exceptional Liquidity Assistance and the inherent risk associated with short term borrowings has also been removed from the Irish banking landscape. There is also an expected reduction in the underlying deficit by c.&euro;1 billion per annum over the coming years with a reduction in government debt over time. These all need to be taken into account in assessing the benefits of the IBRC liquidation.</p><p>  It is far too early to predict the outcome of the liquidation process and the overall cost for the State in relation to IBRC. It will not be possible to conclude for certain whether the value of the assets to be sold by the Special Liquidators, is sufficient to compensate NAMA for the amount paid for the net IBRC debt that it has acquired, until the valuation of those assets has been completed.</p><p>  As part of the role of the liquidators, the assets of IBRC will be valued independently before being sold.  Any assets not sold to third parties at or above the valuation price will be sold to NAMA at the independent valuation.  This ensures a &lsquo;floor&rsquo; price on the assets of IBRC and that where required, assets with limited sale potential now, can be worked through in the medium term by NAMA rather than sold to the best available third party at any price. This approach ensures a fire sale of assets will not occur. This Government&rsquo;s approach is consistent and focused on the best outcome for the Irish State and its people.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the amount of LPT due is determined by reference to the valuation band based on the market value of the property.  As the siblings are joint owners of the property, they are jointly and severally liable for the LPT.  However, in cases of joint ownership, only one of the owners is designated by the Revenue Commissioners for the purposes of submitting the LPT return form and paying the tax.    For individuals on low incomes the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a system of deferral arrangements for owner-occupiers where there is an inability to pay the tax and certain specified conditions are met.  Owners may qualify to defer all or part (50%) of their LPT liability. </p><p>  In the context of the Deputy's question, where the joint owners are siblings, one owner will be the designated owner for filing and payment purposes.  It is only the gross income of the designated owner, provided he or she is an owner-occupier, that is taken into account to determine if the deferral conditions are met, i.e. there is no aggregation of the gross incomes of all of the joint owners.  In this case, as both incomes are below the individual threshold the designated owner will qualify for a deferral.  To determine whether deferral applies for 2013, the designated owner is required to estimate on 1 May 2013 what his or her total gross income for 2013 will be.  Where a deferral is being claimed on the basis of income threshold, the LPT Return must be completed and the relevant deferral condition selected.</p><p>On 25 April I provided details on the option of deferring payment of LPT based on income threshold in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 69 on 25 April (19691/13).  I am advised by the Commissioners that full details of all deferral options are outlined in the Guidelines on Deferral or Part Deferral of Local Property Tax, which are available on Revenue's website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>  .</p></reply>

Unlike other nicotine products, such as nicotine inhalers, tablets and chewing gum, which are categorised as oral medicines and therefore qualify for the zero-rate of VAT, nicotine replacement patches do not fall into this category and are therefore subject to the standard rate.     While in the UK nicotine patches are liable to a reduced VAT rate of 5%, under the EU VAT Directive it is not possible for Ireland to apply a 5% VAT rate to the supply of nicotine patches.  This is because the VAT Directive only permits Member States to apply two reduced rates of VAT, and as Ireland already applies two reduced VAT rates of a 9% and 13.5%, it would not be possible to apply a 5% rate to nicotine patches.</p></reply>

Instead, its internal communications resources are supported by an external service provider (appointed following a public procurement process) &ndash; currently Gordon MRM &ndash; in order to offer a full press office and communications service (including out-of-hours contacts for the media) across all the NTMA&rsquo;s business areas: Debt Management, National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), National Pensions Reserve Fund, National Development Finance Agency, State Claims Agency, NewERA and, during 2010 and 2011, the Banking Unit. </p><p>  These arrangements were initially put in place during 2010 in light of a significant increase in the volume of domestic and international media queries being received by the NTMA and associated bodies. In September 2012 the NTMA retendered for the provision of these services. A total of five companies submitted tenders. Following the tender evaluation process the NTMA awarded the contract to Gordon MRM in December 2012. </p><p>  The initial contract, in place to end-2012, was based on an hourly rate for services provided. During the term of this contract a 20% reduction in the hourly rate was agreed with effect from June 2011 until the end of the contract. The new contract, which commenced in January 2013, is based on a fixed fee and it is anticipated that this will result in a significant reduction in the overall fees paid by the NTMA.</p><p>  NAMA draws on the NTMA&rsquo;s shared services in a number of areas including its outsourced press office facility.  NAMA reimburses the NTMA in respect of the costs of these services attributable to NAMA.</p><p>  The overall costs incurred for the provision of the services above (excluding VAT) were as follows: </p><p>2010  -  &euro;207,255* </p><p>2011  -  &euro;205,388 (of which &euro;112,353 was charged to NAMA)</p><p>2012  -  &euro;223,723 (of which &euro;142,653 was charged to NAMA) </p><p>2013  -  &euro;24,488 (to end-February) (of which &euro;12,000 was charged to NAMA).</p><p>*  In 2010 costs were not specifically attributed to NAMA. NAMA was charged a proportionate share of the NTMA&rsquo;s third party service costs which included Gordon MRM.</p><p>  In the light of the sovereign debt crisis the NTMA also engaged Powerscourt &ndash; a London based communications consultancy &ndash; for international communications initiatives in the funding and debt management area.  Total costs (excluding VAT) incurred for the provision of the services provided by Powerscourt were as follows:</p><p>2010  -  &euro;160,334  </p><p>2011  -  &euro;74,395 </p><p>2012  -  &euro;10,257 </p><p>2013  -  &euro;12,103 (to end-February).</p></reply>

Joint owners of a property are jointly and severally liable for the tax on the property.  I am informed that the Revenue Commissioners issued one LPT Return for each residential property to the person that the Commissioners designated as the liable person for the property and only one Return should be filed for a property. Joint owners will be required to decide who will file the LPT Return and pay the tax.  On the matter of communication between joint owners, owners will have had to put arrangements in place to address issues such as insurance, payment of utility bills and all other matters associated with the property jointly owned.  The Revenue Commissioners would expect LPT to be handled in a similar manner.  </p><p>  Once the LPT Return is filed and the tax paid, this will discharge the LPT liability for the property.  However, where no Return has been filed and no payment has been made by the relevant deadline, Revenue can pursue collection of the LPT from either owner.</p></reply>

It is the largest extension of the self-assessment system in the history of the State.  As a new service that will have exceptional temporary pressures at particular stages of its initial implementation it is difficult to predict the level of contact that will arise during its introduction and, consequently, the resource required to handle queries from members of the public.    Revenue considered a number of options for the provision of a phone call service to handle queries from members of the public.  It was necessary to ensure that the introduction of LPT would not adversely affect Revenue&rsquo;s capacity to deliver for the Exchequer in relation to their overall priority of maintaining and improving levels of compliance across the range of taxes and duties.  Revenue decided to use a mix of existing staff, staff from the redeployment resource panel, Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) and external resources to deal with Local Property Tax.</p><p>  At the end of April 2013, Revenue had a total of 80 full-time equivalent staff assigned to the Help Line, comprising 59 permanent staff and 21 TCOs.  The permanent staff resource was filled through the internal redeployment of existing staff and the recruitment of some staff from the Public Service Resource panel.  The permanent staff are made up of Assistant Principal, Higher Executive Officer, Executive Officer, Staff Officer and Clerical Officers grades.</p><p>  Revenue is currently in the process of recruiting an additional 35 TCOs to support the LPT Helpline.</p><p>  Following an open competitive tendering process, the contract for call services was awarded on the basis that the service provider would </p><p>  1. Deliver information and assistance to taxpayers having difficulty understanding Local Property Tax (LPT) and completing their returns and making payments.</p><p>  2. Assist taxpayers to navigate a new online system for filing returns and payments for LPT. </p><p>  3. Escalate calls to a Revenue call service where taxpayer specific information is required to resolve the call.</p><p>  4. Make outbound calls to taxpayers with information on their Property Tax queries where requested by Revenue to do so.</p><p>  5. Provide telephony infrastructure and supports to allow direct transfer to Revenue. </p><p>  6. Support services and resources including account management and quality control.</p><p>  The contract also includes the following provisions:</p><p>  -  Private sector employers acting under a public service outsourcing contract will be required to comply with all statutory terms and conditions relating to the employment of people in Ireland, including any registered agreement or Employment Regulation Orders.</p><p>  -  As a matter of public policy, all public contracting authorities will make clear to tenderers their expectation that the statutory industrial relations procedures (LRC or Labour Court) will be utilised for dispute resolution, consistent with domestic and EU procurement law.</p><p>  The service provider must meet Revenue customer service standards and the industry ISO standards. Revenue has provided training and training material to ensure that the standards are achieved.  An Irish language service is provided. The necessary confidentiality and security procedures have been implemented. </p><p>  Revenue&rsquo;s customer service standards state that 100% of calls were answered within five minutes but also states that at peak periods it may take longer.  Revenue is experiencing extremely high volumes of all calls in relation to the Local Property Tax at present.  The Help-Line service is provided on a 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday basis in the normal course.  During peak filing periods the service is provided from 8am to 8pm and may include Saturday. </p><p>  The service commenced on 7 March 2013 and call volumes of 199,834 were handled up to 30 April 2013.  The external service delivery of peak call handling in respect of the LPT provides a flexible, scalable response to an unpredictable demand.  Up until the end of April 2013 the number of staff provided by the service provider ranged from 40 up to 193.</p></reply>

In certain circumstances, debtors are allowed to retain a portion of asset income in lieu of overheads which include staff costs.  NAMA also seeks to obtain charges over a debtor&rsquo;s unencumbered assets and to realise such assets so as to further reduce indebtedness.</p><p>  The position outlined above does not apply to debtors against whom enforcement action has been taken, as their assets and asset income are under the control of insolvency practitioners appointed by NAMA. I am advised by NAMA that, whilst the relevant procedures for the new insolvency arrangements have not been finalised, it does not envisage the new arrangements will have a major material effect on its interaction with its debtors.  In so far as there may be an impact, debtors will be considered on a case-by-case basis after implementation of the new insolvency regime but NAMA will abide by the statutory bankruptcy mechanism in all such cases.</p></reply>

Our policy on bank remuneration is being augmented   following the Review of Remuneration Practices and Frameworks at the covered institutions, conducted by Mercer, that as the remaining institutions still incur losses their respective cost bases need to be reduced further. This is essential if they are to return to profitability, be in a position to support the economy and repay the State&rsquo;s investment through a return to private ownership. On behalf of the Government, I directed the banks to come up with plans as to how they intend to address this issue in a manner that can help meet the State&rsquo;s objectives. I expect the value of those plans to mean a saving of 6% - 10% of total remuneration costs, through reductions in payroll and pension benefits, new working arrangements and structures that deliver efficiency gains.  Tackling the cost base is of course only one of many goals that need to be achieved but combined with other measures will deliver the required results.	</p></reply>

It is a commercial matter for the banks concerned.   Firstly I must point out that it is not true to say that the Irish banks are funded mostly through the ECB; in fact the Irish banks primarily funded by deposits and other types of market funding.</p><p>The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations.  The Central Bank has, however,<i></i>  no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997. </p><p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors, including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding. </p><p>  However, as part of the Central Bank's work on mortgage arrears, lenders were asked to consider all avenues to help customers in arrears, including interest rate reductions.  Currently, several lenders do consider a temporary interest rate reduction but this is on a case by case basis.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Government is very aware of the significant difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage obligations and it has put in place a comprehensive strategy to address the problem focusing on four main distinct areas:</p><p><b>-  Innovative Personal Insolvency Reform:</b> Personal insolvency reform was identified by the Keane Report as a catalyst for addressing the mortgage arrears problem and it indicated that without an effective insolvency system the mortgage arrears problem will not be resolved.   The introduction of the new Personal Insolvency Act provides new statutory insolvency frameworks to allow debtors and creditors reach arrangements on unsustainable mortgage and personal debt.  The legislation provides a legal framework for the resolution of mortgage arrears, as well as other personal debt, and it will provide certainty for borrowers and lenders alike about the consequences of non-payment and failure to reach agreement. It does not preclude, however, borrowers and lenders reaching bilateral agreements to address mortgage or other debt difficulty.</p><p><b>-  Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies:</b> As announced in March 2013, the implementation of the mortgage arrears strategies has further intensified with the Central Bank now setting time bound and measurable targets for the main banks on their progress in resolving, on a durable basis, the position of their mortgage customers who are in arrears on their mortgage. The &#8220;Keane Report&#8221; has already outlined a number of possible options that can be considered by banks to provide a sustainable solution for a mortgage in difficulty on a case by case basis.</p><p><b>-  Comprehensive Advice and Guidance:</b> In addition to existing arrangements, the Government has introduced a range of additional information and guidance resources to assist mortgage holders through what can be a difficult and stressful process.  A dedicated website, <i><font color="#0000FF">www.keepingyourhome.ie</font></i>  , has been put in place to provide general public information on mortgages arrears issues.  In addition, there is a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline, which is established under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, to provide more tailored information to individual callers.  Finally, a panel of accountants has been put in place to provide &#8220;one to one&#8221; independent advice to borrowers who have been provided with a long term forbearance resolution offer by their lender in respect of a mortgage on their primary home.  All of these information services are provided at no direct charge to the users of the service.</p><p><b>-  Keeping families in their homes: </b>As a social housing response, a &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme is now in place on a nationwide basis.  This option will be available to households with unsustainable mortgages and who would qualify for social housing support and meet other appropriate criteria and will allow the family, in the context of an agreed resolution to an unsustainable mortgage, to remain in their home.</p></reply>

Reliefs will continue to be available to those properly qualified to receive them in accordance with those regulations.</p><p>  Given the scale and scope of the scheme, any possible changes can only be made after careful consideration and with regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme and the available resources.</p></reply>

The levy will operate for a period of 4 years only (2011 to 2014) and the legislative provisions giving effect to the levy (section 4 of Finance (No 2) Act 2011) were specifically drafted to reflect this.  </p><p>The moneys raised from the pension fund levy are being used to pay for the Government's <i>Jobs Initiative </i>introduced<i></i>in May 2011.  The measures introduced as part of the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>  include a new 9% VAT rate on certain activities, the halving of the lower rate of PRSI and small amounts of additional current and capital expenditure.</p><p>The implementation of a jobs and growth strategy is a key priority of the Government.  The measures announced in the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>  are aimed at assisting in employment generation - providing opportunities for those who are out of work, to restore public morale and confidence in the economy and encourage spending by consumers.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that receipts to date from the levy amounted to &euro;463 million in 2011 and &euro;483 million in 2012.  This is broadly in line with the amounts anticipated to be collected in those years.  There is no yield from the levy as yet in respect of 2013.  The deadline date for payment of the levy in 2013 is 25 September next.</p><p>  I wished to be satisfied that the legislative provisions giving effect to the pension fund levy do not pose any legal difficulties.

The Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No 15) Order 1981 specifies the degree of disability and defines the qualifying goods.  In this context qualifying goods are defined as goods which are aids or appliances, including parts and accessories, specially constructed or adapted for use by a disabled person and includes goods which, although not so specially constructed or adapted, are of such a kind as might reasonably be treated as so constructed or adapted having regard to a particular disablement of that person.  The provisions of the Order extend to works carried out on homes, including the installation of walk-in-showers, to adapt them to make them more accessible for disabled persons.  The provisions do not apply to the actual construction of a home but would apply, for example, to certain alterations or adaptations that would be necessary to meet the particular needs of the disabled person.  Age is not specifically mentioned in the Order as a degree of disability.</p><p>  Any application under the Refund Order should be made on Form VAT 61A and submitted to the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; Central Repayments Office in Monaghan.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that LPT Returns, personalised letters and an LPT Guide have issued to owners of 1.66 million residential properties either by post or by way of their ROS (Revenue Online Service) inbox.  In the absence of a Register, it is not possible to state the number of residential properties in respect of which Revenue has not issued an LPT Return.  I am advised that there are a number of possible reasons why the owners of certain residential properties have not yet been received LPT Returns, including:</p><p>Where the original LPT Return and personalised letter, which was issued as part of the general issue of LPT Returns, has been sent back undelivered by An Post.  I am advised that there are approximately 26,000 such letters, of which some 9,000 have already been reissued, and work on the others is ongoing.</p><p>Several properties have the same non-unique address, which is not unusual in rural areas.  A further complication in this category is cases where the owners' first names and surnames are the same.</p><p>A property was not reflected in any of the original data sources that Revenue used to establish the LPT Register.  This would largely consist of new residential properties acquired since the start of the year, which are now in use as a residence. </p><p>  As regards the follow up, I am advised that the Commissioners are continuing to refine and build the Register from additional data sources.  They will also re-fresh the LPT Register shortly with the most updated version of the Local Government Management Agency's (LGMA) Household Charge database and they will continue to do this until the LGMA database is handed over to them after 1 July 2013.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, LPT is a self-assessed tax and, in common with other self-assessed taxes, certain responsibilities rest with the taxpayer even where they have not received a communication from Revenue.  I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, most recently in my reply to Questions Nos. 87 and 92 on 1 May (20686/13 and 20652/13), that liable persons, who have not yet received a Return from Revenue, must still self-assess the amount of LPT due, complete and file their LPT Return and pay the tax due.  They should contact the LPT helpline on 1890 200 255 or they can login to LPT online at <i>www.revenue.ie</i> and file a return by clicking on the &quot;I have not received a Property PIN&quot; tab.  There is good evidence on the helpline that people are responding to the message.</p><p>  The process of ensuring that the LPT Register is as accurate and complete as possible will be an ongoing one, given the scale of the task, and will continue beyond the filing deadlines.  I am satisfied that the continuing work of the Commissioners will ensure that all residential property owners are registered for the tax and will be advised of their compliance obligations if they do not come forward of their own accord.</p></reply>

The VAT rating of goods and services is constrained by the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rate on goods and services, such as oral contraceptives, which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.  In addition, Member States may only apply a reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive.  Annex III does include products used for contraception and this is the basis for applying the reduced rate to non-oral contraceptives.</p></reply>

The primary aim at the core of the Five Year Plan is focussed on meeting demographic demands to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers.</p><p>  The 5 Year Plan provides for the following level of additional primary school accommodation in the areas referred to by the Deputy:</p><p>Greystones: 15 additional classrooms will be in place following the completion of the building project for Gaelscoil na gCloch Liath and Greystones Educate Together National School. It is envisaged that this accommodation will be ready for occupation for the 2013/2014 school year.</p><p>Kilcoole: An 8 classroom extension project at Kilcoole National School is contained on the 2015/2016 construction list. This will facilitate the growth of the school to a 24 classroom facility. Pending the delivery of the extension project, my Department has approved the rental of 3 mainstream classrooms to cater for the school's interim accommodation requirements.</p><p>Newcastle: My Department provided funding to St. Francis National School in 2012 to facilitate the replacement of two prefabs with a permanent structure and I understand that the project is currently on site. A project for a replacement school for St. Catherine's Special School, Newcastle is contained on the Five Year Plan and is currently at Stage 2 (b) of the architectural planning process.</p><p>Newtownmountkennedy - A 5 classroom extension at Newtownmountkennedy National School is contained on the 2015/2016 construction list. This will facilitate the growth of the school to a 16 classroom facility.</p><p>  Devolved funding for the provision of an additional 5 mainstream classrooms to cater for the 2013 and 2014 accommodation needs of the Greystones/Delgany area has also been approved by my Department for the following schools:</p><p>- St. Laurences N.S., Greystones - 2 classrooms</p><p>- St. Patrick's N.S.  Greystones - 2 classrooms</p><p>- St. Kevin's N.S. Greystones - 1 classroom</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that I have sanctioned a new school at post-primary level for the Greystones area and I expect this to commence operation in September 2014.  Details of all works funded under my Department's Additional Accommodation and Emergency Works Schemes, including works in schools in Co. Wicklow, are available on my Department Website and this is updated on a weekly basis.</p></reply>

Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments.</p><p>  In 2006 the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills commenced a unique project in relation to biomass energy use in schools to evaluate the suitable application and performance and compatibility of biomass systems.  The evaluation process included school heating requirements in terms of heating demand characteristics, controls, reliability, fuel storage and maintenance and operation and customer satisfaction. The evaluation of the 14 sites that formed the Biomass Deployment Pilot Programme from 2007 to 2009 met the overall objective in that it trialled a number of boiler types for integration into a representative sample of educational buildings which included both new and existing structures.</p><p>  The project was assessed by independent consultants. The pilot highlighted the positive and negative aspects in the challenges of successfully integrating biomass into the school stock. This was not achieved without some issues and the overall level of satisfaction was rated at approx. 56%. The study found that biomass boilers can provide an efficient and renewable form of heating in schools but cannot be deemed an exact fit.  It is also considered that it will prove difficult to match the small schools in the country with biomass heating on an operational and costs basis. The study found that as reflected in the satisfaction rating, biomass systems can require a significant amount of management input on site to ensure that they operate at optimum level and provide reliable heating to the school.</p><p>  One outcome from the project highlighted the potential market for Energy Supply Companies (ESCO) to provide a heat contract to schools based on biomass heating, where the ESCO finances, operates and maintains the system and sells heat to the school. The Department also makes allowances for same in all new school designs via our Technical Guidance Documents, thus ensuring that there are no barriers to an ESCO being developed on a new school site.</p></reply>

The Catholic Patrons have been asked to submit an interim response within three months and a final response with detailed proposals on divesting schools within six months. Options for change will be considered in respect of these proposals. No decision has been made in respect of the patronage of any individual schools at this time.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing arrangements for the coming school year 2013/14 are set out in Circular 0013/2013 which is available on the website. The staffing arrangements also include an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. The appeal criteria are also set out in Circular 0013/2013.The school referred to by the Deputy submitted an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. Having considered the school's application in the context of the published grounds, the Board refused the appeal at its meeting in 27th/28th March 2013. The school was notified accordingly.</p><p>  The Primary Staffing Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p></reply>

Or they may enrol in a mainstream school and attend a special class, or they may enrol in a special school.</p><p>  Where schools have enrolled pupils with special educational needs they may be supported by additional resource/learning support teaching either under the General Allocation Model in primary schools or the school may make an application to the National Council for Special Education for resource teaching hours for pupils with low incidence special educational needs as set out in my Departments Circular 02/05.</p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.</p><p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the rights of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.</p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I announced at the recent Teacher Union Conferences that I will shortly bring to Government draft heads of a bill &ndash; the Education (Admission to School) Bill 2013. I will seek to publish the Bill in draft form to allow a full public discussion, including inputs from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection and the education partners. I also intend to publish draft regulations that I plan to make when the Bill is enacted.</p><p>  In bringing forward these proposals, it is not my intention to unnecessarily intrude into how schools do their business. My policy objective is to ensure that every child is treated fairly and that the way in which schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent. As the Bill and the Regulations will be published in draft form, they will also be subject to a lot of detailed scrutiny before becoming law. I will be reflecting carefully on the views expressed in the consultation process to ensure they strike the right balance between school autonomy and fairness in our education system.</p></reply>

The Government has, nevertheless, explicitly ruled-out the sale of Coillte&rsquo;s land holdings.</p><p>  Instead, the Government determined last year that a concession for the harvesting rights to Coillte forests represented the best option to release value from Coillte in the short to medium term.  A Steering Group was established, comprising the relevant Government Departments and NewERA, to progress this matter and to report back to Ministers on how this could be done.</p><p>  NewERA, on behalf of the Steering Group, has been working closely with Coillte to analyse the various financial, policy and technical issues that would arise in the context of a proposed sale of harvesting rights.  These include all of the concerns that have been raised by various interest groups, including the issue of public access to the forests, replanting obligations to ensure the continued existence of our forests, harvesting policy, the issue of supply of timber to the local saw mills, etc., as well as the implications for Coillte itself:  Depending on the nature and scale of a transaction, the future viability of the company could be called into question by the disposal of its most significant asset.  Therefore, any liabilities to which this might expose the Exchequer must also be quantified.</p><p>  Specialist advisers were engaged by Coillte in late 2012 to further inform this process, and they reported at the end of November last.  Since then, the Steering Group has been considering the results of the analytical work &ndash; this consideration is on-going - and relevant Ministers have been kept informed on progress to date.  I expect the Steering Group to conclude this work very shortly, and to report to Government with its findings and recommendations.  </p><p>  I wish to assure the deputy that, in examining this issue, Government is conscious of the public value that Coillte provides in terms of investment and employment, and that a harvesting rights transaction will only proceed if it makes economic and strategic sense for the Irish people.</p></reply>

As part of this initiative, the CEBs have been involved with approx 2,400 websites which have been set up since summer 2011 using the Getting Business Online website template tool. </p><p>  The CEBs will continue to prioritise online business trade (not simply have a website presence but to have an online trading presence) and going forward the new LEOs will have a strong role in the development of web-enabled services with a focus on increasing the number of small businesses trading online.</p><p>  In addition, the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs includes a commitment to increase the number of businesses trading on line through a new Business On-Line voucher scheme.  This initiative is being led by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  It will support one or more pilot projects in 2013 with the intention of informing a scaling-up of the initiative in 2014.

This rate is aligned to the best average market rate currently available. The changed structure of the allowance is designed to encourage customers to achieve better savings through greater mobility between energy suppliers who can best meet their individual energy needs. </p><p>  The new arrangement represents a significant improvement in the options available for customers.  Customers who do not use their full entitlement each month will be able to carry forward that unused cash credit and draw it down as they wish; this includes customers who wish to switch to a different supplier.  Prior to these changes, customers with Electric Ireland could not carry forward their unused credits if they switched to a new supplier; this acted as an impediment to customers achieving the best value for their particular energy needs.  Under the new arrangement, customers with Electric Ireland who build up cash credits will have those credits refunded if they switch to a different company.</p><p>  As regards the old non-cash units, a number of customers have unused units which they have carried over from 2012.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 86,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013.</p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant. Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme. </p><p>  There is nothing in legislation which prohibits payment of rent supplement to a tenant whose landlord is an officer administering supplementary welfare allowance.

Where these requests are identified, they are given priority by the Department.  In all cases, once it becomes apparent that a person will require the allocation of a PPS Number, I would urge that the application be submitted immediately, rather than waiting until the last minute, in order to ensure that it will be available when required.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 86,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;403 million for 2013.</p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.  However, social welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement payment to a nominated payee such as a landlord on behalf of the tenant.  This arrangement is entered at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the Department.  The department official dealing with the request will take into account all the relevant circumstances of the particular case and the tenant&rsquo;s preference will be accommodated where possible.</p><p>  It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent.  Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated.

Growing numbers of people want to work or may need to work beyond the State pension age as people are living longer.  The abolition of State pension transition removes the retirement condition which acts as an incentive to leave the workforce and has been widely criticised as a barrier to older people remaining in employment.  Recipients of State pension contributory can continue to work.</p><p>  Existing legislation provides that, social welfare supports, such as job seekers benefits, will continue to be available to those who meet the qualifying conditions of the schemes available.  Furthermore, the legislation also provides that for those whose job seekers benefit expires in their 65th year, the payment will continue to be paid up until the age of 66 when State pension becomes payable for those who satisfy the qualifying conditions.</p><p>  There is no statutory compulsory retirement age for employees in Ireland.  In relation to the employment relationship, responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer/employee relationship and the contract of employment.  The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has made rulings in a series of age-discrimination cases concerning Directive 2000/78/EC, which prohibit work-related discrimination on various grounds, including age.  The CJEU has clarified that mandatory retirement ages may be set down by employers within the context of national law, whether by contract, custom and practice or other means, which must be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim, with the means of achieving that aim being both appropriate and necessary.  Enterprise policy and equality issues come within the respective remit of my colleagues, the Minster for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p>  An interdepartmental Working and Retirement Group was initiated to consider the cross departmental policy issues arising that may support longer working and thereby improve the sustainability and adequacy of pensions systems.  The interdepartmental group, established in August 2012, is chaired by the Department of Social Protection, and includes representatives from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Pensions Board.  Further engagement has also been undertaken with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health and Children.</p><p>  The issues under consideration are the broad range of issues impacting on the labour market participation of older workers; enterprise issues, employment and equality law issues; proposals regarding deferral of the state pension, and consideration of occupational pension issues.  It is expected that the Group will prepare preliminary proposals detailing measures which may encourage participation and retention in the labour market of older workers and present proposals to Government in the near future.</p></reply>

Payments to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (DCENR) in respect of the TV Licence have been capped at 2010 levels of expenditure as announced in the National Recovery Programme 2011-2014.  Up to the time of the imposition of the cap on expenditure under this heading, payments were made on a monthly basis using an agreed formula based on a percentage of the Department&rsquo;s customer base.  This took into account the savings to RTE and An Post on costs of administration, enforcement and collection of the licence fees for this cohort of customers.</p><p>  The customer base has grown from 394,030 in 2010 to its current level of 408,626.  To maintain the cap on expenditure, this Department is currently making fixed monthly payments, in line with that paid in 2010, to DCENR despite the increased number of customers qualifying for the scheme.  This measure does not impact, however, on customers&rsquo; individual entitlement to the scheme.  The entitlement to a free television licence commences only after the expiry of a customer&rsquo;s current licence subject to satisfying the qualifying conditions.  The licence when granted is in respect of a full calendar year and therefore no refund would be due for part of a year.  Customers receive their free licence directly from the Department and their entitlement remains valid for as long as they continue to receive the household benefits package.  This arrangement reduces further the administration costs for my Department, DCENR, An Post and RTE as customers previously had to renew their licences annually through the Post Office network.</p></reply>

The first two elements involve the enhancement of the website www.keepingyourhome.ie and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears.</p><p>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders.  This advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.  This panel is available on a county by county basis on the website www.keepingyourhome.ie.</p><p>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender advises the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &euro;250 to an accountant of the borrower&rsquo;s choosing for the provision of this advice.  </p><p>  The advisory framework has commenced with practicing accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.</p><p>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as required by borrowers.  The advisory framework is being monitored on an on-going basis and a full review of the service will be undertaken in June 2013.  The review will be undertaken to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and will encompass all aspects of the service including if participation is extended to other interested parties, the criteria that would be required in terms of relevant qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance etc. All relevant stakeholders will have an opportunity to input to the review.</p></reply>

A 1926 Census Working Group has been formed comprising officials from my Department, the National Archives and the Central Statistics Office.  The group has met to consider how best to enable the publication of the 1926 Census records.  Under current legislation, (the Statistics Act, 1993), census data must be withheld for 100 years.   If the records were to be released before the expiry of 100 years a change in legislation would be required to allow for the early release.  Following discussions with the CSO, the Minister is of the opinion that the extensive preparatory work required to facilitate the release of the data into the public domain can commence in advance of the legal restriction being adressed.  The CSO and the National Archives have agreed to facilitate the preparatory work on the Census records. </p></reply>

The Irish film industry continued to build on its excellent international reputation garnering significant recognition and acclaim as new Irish features were selected for major international festivals and Irish talent picked up awards and received nominations for some of the industry&rsquo;s highest accolades.  </p><p>  Highlights included the Irish short film THE CRUSH that became the 7th Academy Award nominated Irish short since 2002, Irish projects were selected for some of the world&rsquo;s most renowned festivals including Berlin, Sundance, Toronto, Tribeca and Cannes where Rebecca Daly&rsquo;s debut feature THE OTHER SIDE OF SLEEP was selected for the prestigious Directors Fortnight and THIS MUST BE THE PLACE was in official competition.  </p><p>  THE GUARD had an extraordinary year.  Following its world premiere at Sundance, it was selected for numerous prestigious festivals including Berlin, Edinburgh and Tribeca and was phenomenally well received when it was released in Irish cinemas.  It became the most successful independent Irish film in Irish box office history.  </p><p>  The Irish Film Board (IFB) is a statutorily independent agency.  The allocation of support to projects, its staffing arrangements, expenses and other arrangements are matters for the IFB itself.  In fact, details of the IFB's recusal policies for dealing with applications by members of the Board for project support are provided the annual report itself.  </p><p>  On 23 April last, Mr Bill O'Herlihy, Chairman Designate of The Irish Film Board gave evidence before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht in relation to his vision and strategy for the Irish Film Board.  Mr O'Herlihy made a lengthy statement to the committee and answered all questions put to him by the members of the Joint Committee in a frank and forthright manner and to their satisfaction.</p></reply>

Under this Section each planning authority was asked to determine which quarries in its administrative area would, having regard to the dates of implementation of the EIA Directive and the Habitats Directive, respectively, have required an EIA, a determination in relation to EIA, or an appropriate assessment in relation to possible effects on the integrity of a European site, but which were not subject to such assessment/determination. Where a planning authority determined that a quarry comes within this category, the planning authority is required to make a further decision in relation to the planning status of the quarry, including registration status. Flowing from this decision, the planning authority must then either require an application for substitute consent or take enforcement action requiring the quarry to cease operations. The determination of the planning authority that EIA, a determination in relation to EIA, or an appropriate assessment were required but not carried out/made is reviewable by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as is the decision on the planning/registration status. While the process has been challenging for some quarry operators, my Department has engaged extensively with industry representatives to ensure that the provisions, which were required for purposes of compliance with the ECJ judgment, are implemented fairly and consistently. I am considering making a number of small modifications to the practical operation of the 261A process to ensure its effectiveness.  </p></reply>

The Programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of some &euro;29 million in County Leitrim during the period of the Programme. </p><p>  The Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth. A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Leitrim County Council, in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas. These were subsequently appraised in my Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that were more strategically important at that time. </p><p>  The Leitrim Towns and Villages Sewerage Scheme &ndash; Bundle No. 2 (9 Villages &ndash; Drumshanbo, Ballinamore, Carrigallen, Dromod, Glenfarne, Leitrim Village, Mohill, Rossinver and Manorhamilton) was not amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion in the current Programme.   </p><p>  Progress under the Water Services Investment Programme was reviewed in mid-2011 and through this process, consideration was given to any newly emerging priority contracts and schemes submitted by local authorities for addition to the Programme. Leitrim County Council applied to have the scheme (7 Villages &ndash; Drumshanbo, Ballinamore, Carrigallen, Dromod, Leitrim Village, Mohill and Manorhamilton) included in the Programme but again the scheme was not determined as being appropriate by my Department for inclusion in the Programme at that time.  The Council&rsquo;s submission did not request the inclusion of Glenfarne or Rossinver Villages. </p><p>  A revised submission, again not including the villages of Glenfarne or Rossinver, for the inclusion of the scheme into the Water Services Investment Programme was submitted by the Council and a letter issued to them from my Department on 5 April 2013 requesting that the Council undertake a focused review of the Preliminary Report. In particular the Council was asked to take account of recent small scheme funding provided by my Department under the Rural Water Programme (RWP).</p><p>  Under this programme an allocation of almost &euro;1.25 million towards Wastewater Compliance Works to address Environmental Protection Agency wastewater discharge authorisation requirements was notified by my Department to Leitrim County Council in March 2013 .   </p><p>  Responsibility for the administration of the RWP has been devolved to local authorities since 1997. The selection and approval of individual scheme proposals for advancement and funding under the programme, within the overall priorities set by my Department and subject to the block grant allocations provided, is therefore a matter for the water services authorities.  Accordingly, the letter of 5 April requested that the outcomes of this investment should be taken into account in any new submission by the Council. </p></reply>

It will be a matter for the relevant local authority, whether rural or urban, to determine the precise allocation of revenues from the Local Property Tax.   </p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and, a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates. A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.</p></reply>

The local authority finances the transaction by borrowing from the Housing Finance Agency.  The shared owner must purchase full ownership within 25 years.  For transactions commenced on or after 1 January 2003, the annual rent is calculated at 4.3% of the value of the local authority equity and the rent is increased by a fixed 4.5% on 1 July each year. The rent is used to repay the cost of the local authority equity to the Housing Finance Agency and, depending on the level of mortgage interest rates obtaining, may also increase or decrease the capital outstanding on the local authority share at the end of each year.

This will both fill the existing gap at 'board' level in the two organisations and ensure that the two organisations can begin operating as a cohesive whole.  These appointments are being made on the basis of the existing legislation, which in the case of the Equality Authority is the Employment Equality Act 1998.</p><p>  As I indicated when announcing the 14 persons recommended by the Selection Panel for appointment as members designate of the new IHREC, the Selection Panel has reported that it has not proved possible to recruit a Chief Commissioner at this time.  The terms on which this post was advertised included a requirement that the person appointed should not have served on either the Equality Authority or the Human Rights Commission.  The requirement was considered essential to ensure that the new Chief Commissioner would bring balance and neutrality to the position in a sensitive merger context.  The Selection Panel suggests also that the full-time nature of the position and the length of the contract (5 years) may have been issues that militated against a successful recruitment.  The position was designated as a full-time one in view of the Paris Principles preference for full-time Commissioners.</p><p>  I consider this issue requires time for reflection and consultation and that the debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas on the Bill to establish IHREC will be an opportunity to explain the difficulty that has arisen and to invite suggestions.  Therefore, I intend to reflect on how to progress recruitment of a Chief Commissioner in the light of the debate on this issue in the Houses of the Oireachtas. Once the Bill is enacted, I will bring my proposals to Government.</p><p>  I am very grateful to the members of the Panel for their unstinting public service work on essentially a voluntary basis.  I consider that the experience of the process requires a critical review of the selection process set out in the General Scheme of the Bill as published.  The scale of the task as it unfolded required that the Panel engage back-office assistance from the Public Appointments Service (PAS).  In the light of the experience gained, I consider that future selection of persons to serve as members of the IHREC should be vested in the PAS.  The PAS has existed in its different forms since the foundation of the State, to ensure integrity and impartiality in the appointment of civil servants and other public servants and is independent in the discharge of its functions and would thus fully meet the Paris Principles' requirement for a selection process independent of Government.  This is a change in the selection process as originally adopted in the General Scheme which I consider is now required in the light of experience.  I note that use of the PAS was one of the other options considered by the Working Group set up to advise on practical arrangements for establishment of IHREC in its report.</p></reply>

Section 2(2) provides for the offence of assisted suicide.  While acknowledging the tragic situation of the appellant, the Court held that there is no constitutional right to commit suicide or to arrange for the ending of one&rsquo;s life at a time of one&rsquo;s choosing.  The Court further held that it is not possible to identify a constitutional right for a limited class of persons which in this case would refer to disabled persons suffering severe pain arising from a terminal and degenerative illness, who have the capacity to consent and wish to have the assistance of a third party to end their lives.  Submissions to the effect that the prohibition on assisted suicide was discriminatory and contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights were also rejected.

As a consequence of the amalgamation, the Foxford Garda sub-district, which is currently part of the Swinford Garda District, will be amalgamated into the Ballina District. This will not affect the policing service provided to the community of the Foxford Garda sub-district which will be augmented on a 24 hour basis by personnel assigned to Ballina Garda Station.</p></reply>

The position remains as stated:</p><p>  All Personal Insolvency Practitioners (PIPs) will be authorised and regulated by the Insolvency Service of Ireland, in accordance with Part 5 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 - Sections 159 to 169.  In Part 5 of the Act, Section 163 sets out how an individual may make application to carry on practice as a Personal Insolvency Practitioner, and Section 164 the matters which the Insolvency Service must take into account in deciding whether an applicant should be authorised as a PIP or whether authorisation is to be refused.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland will shortly publish the Regulations under Section 161 of the Act in regard to the authorisation and regulation of personal insolvency practitioners. The Regulations will set out the necessary criteria in regard to qualifications. As I have previously stated, I expect that accountants, lawyers and a broad range of financial advisors may wish to seek regulation as practitioners, but it will not be confined to these professions. All potential applicants, in addition to their existing professional qualifications, will have to demonstrate evidence of the applicants' satisfactory knowledge of the provisions of the Act and the law generally as it applies in the State relating to the insolvency of individuals and in particular statutory provisions relating to such persons.</p></reply>

Article 78 of the TFEU provides that the Union shall develop a common policy on asylum, subsidiary protection and temporary protection with a view to offering appropriate status to any third-country national requiring international protection in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement and the 1951 Geneva Convention on the status of refugees.</p><p>  Measures relating to the CEAS are covered by the EU Treaty Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice.  The Protocol allows either Member State to opt into EU measures pursuant to Title V of the TFEU.  The principal EU instruments which comprise the CEAS are the Dublin Regulation and three Directives dealing with reception conditions, asylum procedures and qualification.  At the present time Ireland participates in the Dublin Regulation, the 2004 Qualification Directive and the 2005 Asylum Procedures Directive.</p><p>  The Dublin Regulation provides that an application for asylum (international protection) lodged by a third country national in a Member State shall be examined by a single Member State which shall be determined in accordance with the hierarchy of criteria set out in Chapter III of the Regulation.  These criteria are based on the general principle that responsibility for examining an application should primarily lie with the Member State which played the greatest part in the applicant&rsquo;s entry into and presence in the territories of the Member States with some exceptions designed to protect family unity.  In an area without controls at the internal borders of the Member States, a mechanism for determining responsibility for asylum applications lodged in the Member States was needed in order, on the one hand, to guarantee effective access to the procedures for determining refugee status and not to compromise the objective of the rapid processing of asylum applications and, on the other, to prevent abuse of asylum procedures in the form of multiple applications for asylum submitted by the same person in several Member States with the sole aim of extending his or her stay in the Member States.</p><p>  The 2005 Asylum Procedures Directive contains provisions dealing with:</p><p>a) basic principles and guarantees, including access to the procedure, the right to remain in the Member State pending the examination of the application, the personal interview of an asylum applicant and guarantees for unaccompanied minors;</p><p>b) procedures at first instance, including the examination procedure, prioritisation and acceleration of any examination, inadmissible applications, the safe country of origin concept, subsequent applications and failure to appear; and</p><p>c) procedures for the withdrawal of refugee status and appeals procedures.</p><p>  The 2004 Qualification Directive contains provisions dealing with:</p><p>a) the assessment of applications for international protection, including assessment of facts and circumstances on an individual basis;</p><p>b) qualification for being a refugee, including cessation and exclusion clauses;</p><p>c) qualification for subsidiary protection, including cessation and exclusion clauses; and</p><p>d) the content of international protection, including protection from refoulement, residence permits, access to employment, education, social welfare and health care.</p><p>  My Department and the independent bodies under the aegis of my Department, i.e. the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, have considerable experience in the operation of the legal framework comprising the CEAS instruments in which Ireland participates.  On the basis of this experience I am of the view that this legal framework does allow for a fair and effective system for processing asylum applications that is also robust and capable of preventing the institution of asylum being resorted to for purposes alien to those for which it is intended.</p></reply>

A person convicted upon indictment of theft is liable to imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or an unlimited fine.  There are no plans to amend section 4 of the 2001 Act.</p><p>  I am concerned about the reported practice of some collectors of clothing and bric-a-brac who convey the impression in their promotional literature that they are a charity, when this may not actually be the case.  This may lead some people to donate to such collections in the belief that they are supporting a charity and helping to alleviate hardship. This is unfair both to donors whose intention in donating such items is to help those in need, and to bona fide charities that may lose out on donations as a result. It is an offence under section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 to make gain or cause loss to others by deception.</p><p>  In addition to these existing measures under the Criminal Justice Acts, the Charities Act 2009 also contains measures aimed at preventing the abuse of charitable status. Under section 46 of the Charities Act, it is an offence for an organisation that is not a registered charity to describe itself or its activities in such terms as would cause members of the public to reasonably believe that it is a charitable organisation. This section cannot be commenced until the statutory Register of Charities, also provided for under the Charities Act, is in place.</p><p>  While further implementation of the Charities Act and creation of the Register of Charities have been delayed for financial reasons, the Government remains committed to progressing the implementation of the Act and putting in place a dedicated regulatory framework for charities in line with the provisions of the Act. My Department has been examining how best this can be done in the current financial climate.  As part of this work, my Department recently undertook a consultation on key issues, including the creation of the Register of Charities. The submissions received are currently being reviewed and I look forward to publishing the results in due course and giving a further indication of the Government's timeframe for the introduction of an operational Charities Regulatory Authority and full implementation of the Charities Act 2009.</p></reply>

A contract was signed in October, 2010 with Babcock Marine in the United Kingdom for the provision of two new Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPV&rsquo;s). The acquisition of these modern new vessels, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair on the other vessels in the fleet, will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a satisfactory level and that the most up to date equipment is available to Naval Service personnel. The cost of the provision of the two new ships is &euro;108m, exclusive of VAT. In addition, the cost of providing a weapons system for the ships, similar to the systems on LE Roisin and LE Niamh, is &euro;7.8m, exclusive of VAT.  The construction of the first ship is well advanced in Appledore, UK. In addition, the process of the cutting of steel for the second ship began recently in the shipyard. As per the contract, the first ship is scheduled for delivery in early 2014.  The second ship will follow one year later.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the equipment issued to the Naval Service is in keeping with the most modern requirements and the highest international standards.

This is against the agreed stabilised strength for the Permanent Defence Force of 9,500. No specific weaknesses have been brought to my attention. However, in the context of the current strength of the Permanent Defence Force being below the agreed stabilised strength, it is my intention that targeted recruitment will continue within the resource envelope allocated to Defence.    With regard to the Reserve Defence Force, the total strength at 30 November 2012, the latest date for which figures are available was 4,978. This figure comprises 4,773 Army Reserve and 205 Naval Service Reserve personnel. Up to date strength figures for the Reserve Defence Force will be available once the ongoing process of the re-organisation of the Reserve is complete and I will provide this information directly to the Deputy at that point.</p><p>  A major re-organisation of the Permanent Defence Force has recently been completed. In addition, and in response to the findings of a Value for Money Review which was published in late 2012, the Reserve Defence Force is also being reformed and re-organised. These changes will ensure that the Defence Forces organisational structures are configured to maximise required capabilities. </p><p>  The combination of the measures I have outlined will ensure that the Permanent Defence Force can continue to deliver required operational outputs for all approved Aid to the Civil Power and approved Aid to the Civil Authority requests. The Permanent Defence Force will also continue to meet Government requirements for overseas peace support operations. The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, is also available for deployments in response to emergencies and crises.</p></reply>

However, it is imperative that the Department and the Defence Forces, similar to all other Government Departments, must take into account the current difficult economic environment we are now operating in. The budgetary situation will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment and upgrades. Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service. A particular focus is maintained in ensuring that modern and effective equipment is available for overseas peace support operations. In this regard, the personal equipment, which the individual soldier has at his/her disposal in Lebanon and on other overseas missions is second to none and compares very favourably with the equipment in use by other countries.  <i></i></p><p>  Investment in new equipment and upgrading of existing equipment for the Defence Forces is provided for under various subheads of the Defence Vote relating to Defensive Equipment, Transport, Aircraft, Naval Service Ships and Stores and Communications and Information Technology Equipment. </p><p>  I am advised that the provision allocated in 2013 specifically for the purchase of defensive equipment and ammunition is &euro;26.5m. This allows for the acquisition of a range of priority defensive equipment and munitions such as Force Protection Equipment, a new Ground Surveillance Radar system, a replacement programme for the 12.7mm Heavy Machine Gun and the continued implementation of a Rifle Enhancement Programme for the Steyr Rifle which has been in service for nearly 25 years.  <font color="#FF0000"> </font></p><p>  The Rifle upgrade programme is a multi annual programme which represents one of the most significant investments the Government is making in terms of the impact it will have on Defence Forces personnel at the coal face. The project is currently the subject of a number of tender competitions, the results of which will dictate the value of the programme going forward. The provision for 2013 also provides for the upgrade and refurbishment programme of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal HOBO robots. This is one of the most important current programmes for the Defence organisation given the increased levels of call outs witnessed in recent years by the Defence Forces. </p><p>  With regard to the Naval Service, my Department, in conjunction with the Naval Service, is overseeing the acquisition of two new Offshore Patrol Vessels. The cost of the provision of the two new ships is &euro;108m, exclusive of VAT. In addition, the cost of providing a weapons system for the ships, similar to the systems on LE Roisin and LE Niamh, is &euro;7.8m, exclusive of VAT.The construction of the first ship is well advanced in Appledore, UK.

The second ship will follow one year later.In relation to the Air Corps, there are no plans for the acquisition of new aircraft at present but this has to be seen in the context of significant expenditure on the Air Corps in recent years. </p><p>  I am satisfied that the level of resources and equipment available to the Defence Forces enables the Defence Forces to carry out their roles both at home and overseas in an efficient and effective manner.</p></reply>

In relation to security, primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence (2000) is to provide ATCP which, in practice, means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  A wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies and the Defence Forces hold regular coordination and liaison meetings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues.</p><p>  In relation to ATCA, the Framework for Major Emergency Management sets out the structure for enabling the Principal Response Agencies (An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Health Service Executive and Local Authorities) to prepare for, and make a coordinated response to, major emergencies and the Defence Forces respond within that Framework. Representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, by both my Department and the Defence Forces, also ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency.</p><p>  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is available for deployments in response to emergencies and crises.

The primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State&rsquo;s fishery protection legislation and our obligations as a member of the European Union.  In its fishery protection role, the Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol at any one time.  However, when on patrol Naval Service vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties, often in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners who have primary responsibility for the prevention of people trafficking and drug trafficking respectively.   Naval Service patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps.  The Air Corps&rsquo; Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance within the Irish EEZ using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft which were acquired in 1994 under the terms of the 1991 to 1995 Fishery Protection Programme.  These aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and communication equipment which offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service. The EU has provided funding towards the cost of purchase and upgrade of these aircraft.</p><p>  Funding is available from the EU under the Fisheries Control Programmes to strengthen fishery surveillance systems in Member State countries.  The Naval Service and the Air Corps, through my Department and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, apply on an annual basis for EU funding for projects that enhance their fisheries surveillance role.  In recent years, my Department has received &euro;0.325m (2010) and &euro;1.073m (2011). The ship replacement programme accounted for &euro;0.9m of the 2011 funding.  </p><p>  In relation to maritime surveillance generally, an Inter-Departmental Maritime Surveillance Working Group, chaired by the Department of Transport, was established under the auspices of the Marine Co-ordination Group.  The Working Group is working towards the creation of a common information-sharing environment to enhance safety and security within the Irish maritime domain.</p><p>  In addition, Ireland, along with six other EU Member States, participates in the EU Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &ndash; Narcotics (MAOC-N) which is an international co-ordination force that has led to a greater focus on intelligence exchange amongst countries to tackle large drug shipments by sea.  </p></reply>

Rates of reimbursement, fixed in accordance with UN categories of equipment and personnel, are agreed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Ireland and the UN for each mission.  The only mission for which Ireland is currently entitled to reimbursement of some troop and equipment costs, is the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).    </p><p>  Since 1 January 2012, the total amount received from the United Nations in respect of contributions towards troop and other costs associated with the participation of Defence Forces personnel in UNIFIL is calculated at &euro;13.4m.  The amount currently owing to the Department of Defence by the United Nations is calculated at &euro;9.9 million approximately.  This amount includes &euro;3.5 million in respect of the current UNIFIL mission and &euro;6.4 million in respect of repatriation costs of equipment from the MINURCAT mission in Chad.  The amount owing in relation to the MINURCAT mission is currently the subject of ongoing negotiations with the UN.  Ireland is not entitled to any reimbursement in respect of Defence Forces participation in EU-led missions as all troop contributors to such missions are responsible for their own costs. </p></reply>

Whilst my Department&rsquo;s property portfolio is kept under constant review, as I indicated to the House previously there are no plans for further barrack closures.  In addition to these installations a number of other smaller properties are used by Reserve Defence Force (RDF) Units throughout the country.  As the Deputy is aware a major re-organisation of the Reserve is being implemented which has resulted in a new organisational structure for the Army Reserve based on a &ldquo;Single Force&rdquo; concept where Defence Forces Units have Permanent and Reserve elements. These Units are based in Permanent Defence Force (PDF) installations throughout the country and in 16 locations outside of those installations.  As a result a number of smaller properties currently occupied by the Reserve are being closed and will be disposed of.  In accordance with standard practice my Department has contacted the various Government Departments and State Agencies to establish if those bodies have an interest in acquiring any of these properties.  When my Department has exhausted all possible sales to other State Agencies and Government Departments the remaining properties will be disposed of by public tender/auction with the proceeds being used to fund the upgrading of Defence Forces equipment and infrastructure.  As a result of these closures there will be some small savings on utilities and maintenance but it is not possible to quantify those savings at this stage.  However, this new model for the Reserve will offer significant advantages in terms of training, improved interoperability and will enhance the overall capability of the Defence Forces.  These changes will reduce direct expenditure on the Reserve by &euro;11 million, whilst maintaining the budget for Reserve training activity.</p><p><bu>FULLY OPERATIONAL MILITARY INSTALLATIONS</bu></p><p><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Installation</th></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Kilworth Camp, Kilworth </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Naval Base, Haulbowline</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Collins Barracks </td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>Finner Camp, Bundoran </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cathal Brugha Barracks</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>McKee Barracks</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>St. Bricin's Hospital </td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>Renmore Barracks</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>Defence Forces Training Centre, Curragh Camp</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>Stephens Barracks</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>Sarsfield Barracks</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>Aiken Barracks, Dundalk</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>Gormanston Camp</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>Custume Barracks, Athlone</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>Glen of Imaal</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kilbride Camp</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This is intended to assist those farmers, who had forgotten to submit their application as happens in many instances every year.  In some instances, farmers are unaware that they had forgotten to submit their application until they are informed that no application has been received when they make enquires about the non-issue of their payments during the autumn.       </p><p>  In order to be in position to carry out this process, it was necessary to provide that 2013 SPS forms together with entitlement related applications should be submitted directly to the Department&rsquo;s Single Payment Unit, Portlaoise.  </p><p>  Forms may be submitted on-line, hand delivered or returned by post in the pre-addressed envelope sent out to every 2012 applicant under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme.  An Express Post receipt is attached to each return envelope sent out and provides an acceptable proof of postage for retention by the applicant.  A registered post receipt is also an acceptable proof of postage if such is required by my Department.</p><p>  The submission of on-line Single Payment Scheme application forms has increased dramatically since the introduction of this facility in 2007 and amounted to over 65,000 applications in 2012 about half of all application forms.  I am hopeful that the upward trend in the number of such applications will be maintained this year and I strongly urge farmers to use this option themselves or with the assistance of an approved agent.  Such applications are easily traced, are acknowledged electronically and are more readily processed for payment.</p><p>  The change in the procedure for the submission of paper applications will mean that many application forms will be received on an earlier date in the Single Payment Unit than in previous years.  This in turn will greatly assist the early scanning of forms and the issuing of acknowledgements to farmers and indeed the processing to completion of such applications.</p></reply>

As a result, my Department is obliged to ensure that individual payments will not issue until all aspects of a farmer&rsquo;s application are in order, all outstanding documentation provided and all queries resolved.  In most instances where payments are outstanding there remains an outstanding query on the application.  These queries are being resolved on an ongoing basis and officials in my Department will have contacted the applicants concerned with the intention of issuing payment as soon as possible.

Results of inspections are provided to the farm operators within 5 working days.  Results are also reported to my Department and to other interested parties such as Inland Fisheries Ireland.  Overall results and trends are published annually.  Notices to treat are issued to operators if lice levels are found to be above treatment trigger levels.</p><p>  These protocols are considered to be more advanced that those operated in other jurisdictions for the following reasons:</p><p>- The inspection regime is totally independent of the industry.</p><p>- Data obtained as a result of inspections is published and made widely available.</p><p>- Treatment trigger levels are set at a low level.</p><p>  In 2008, the State introduced a new Pest Management Strategy, supplementing the control regime already in place.  This has resulted in a steady decline in average sea lice numbers on farmed salmon since its inception.  </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s sea lice protocols have been the subject of detailed investigation by the EU Commission in response to a complaint from a member of the public in respect of the effects of sea lice on wild salmon.  On 11 October 2012, the Commission closed its investigation of this complaint in the State&rsquo;s favour following its examination of all relevant matters.  The Commission has also indicated that it regards the sea lice protocols operated in Ireland as representing best practice internationally.</p><p>  Fish farm operators are required to comply fully with directions to treat fish and with other directions regarding lice control.  In situations where treatment has not been sufficient to bring lice levels below treatment trigger levels the operators have been directed to take additional measures.  These actions include additional sustained treatments, early fallowing of sites and accelerated harvesting.  My Department is advised by the Marine Institute that fish farm operators have complied with all directions issued on this matter.</p></reply>

Responsibility for these Regulations rests with my colleague, Deputy Phil Hogan, Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  These Regulations transpose the EU Nitrates Directive into law in Ireland with the objective of the Regulations being the protection of ground and surface waters including drinking water sources, through the application of measures to reduce the risk of nutrient enrichment from Agriculture to water.</p><p>  The unusually wet weather in 2012 resulted in reduced fodder being available on many farms for last winter. The cold and wet weather in the early part of 2013 led to greatly reduced grass growth this Spring, culminating in an acute shortage of fodder.</p><p>  Clearly the long-term answer to recent fodder shortages is increased grass production as soon as possible.  I have asked the advisory services to prioritise advice to farmers in the period ahead and to focus on the optimum use of fertiliser in generating feed for the national herd.</p><p>  I understand that sales to date this year of fertiliser are running significantly behind the corresponding levels of recent years. This indicates that, in the short term at least, there is significant scope for farmers to increase fertiliser usage, where appropriate, taking their location, soil fertility and other relevant factors into account, without exceeding the limits set out in the Nitrates Regulations.</p></reply>

Substantial work has been undertaken on the identification of the forestry assets involved, the determination of their value and the consideration of a number of issues associated with the proposed sale of the harvesting rights. The future management of the estate, the maintenance of existing amenities and public access to recreational land are some of the issues being considered as part of the analysis.</p><p>  I am aware that Coillte currently manages 10 Forest Parks and over 150 recreation sites throughout Ireland and that their forests provide a range of recreational opportunities for the general public continuing a long tradition of open access to state owned forests.  I am also conscious that such recreational facilities are also very valuable resources as tourism attractions in the various regions.  In view of the importance of such recreational opportunities for citizens for ongoing recreation and for visitors during their stay in Ireland, any sale will take account of public access to recreational land. As stated by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in his contribution to the D&aacute;il debate on this issue on 26th February last, it is the Government&rsquo;s intention that appropriate provisions would be included in any sale of Coillte harvesting rights to allow for the maintenance of the company&rsquo;s current open forest policy.  While the consideration process is at an advanced stage, no decision has been taken, as yet. The outcome of the overall analysis will be considered by the Government upon its completion.</p></reply>

In 2012 I announced the provision of more than &euro;30 million to fund the latest round of research projects, &euro;7M of which is climate related<b>. </b>  The Department continues to monitor ongoing research both nationally and internationally in an effort to find suitable mitigation technologies and approaches. </p><p>One of the larger projects my Department has funded is the '<i>Gaseous Emissions and Land Use Network - GHG Ireland'</i>  . This network aims to bring together, for a 4 year initiative, all principal investigators working in the field of agricultural climate change research. The main focus of the network is to improve our understanding of carbon stock changes in agricultural soils so that we can contribute to the development of a more robust inventory, and underpin future accounting for these categories. My Department, together with Dept of Environment Community and Local Government, has put a huge effort into negotiating a more favourable outcome on this decision.</p><p>  There is close co-operation between my Department and the EPA to ensure that our respective environmental research programmes on greenhouse gas emissions are complimentary. Ireland is also engaged with the EU Joint Programming Initiative - Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change (JPI-FACCE).  The first multi-country research under the JPI FACCE programme was launched at the start of 2013.  Ireland is involved with other EU countries, and the USA, Canada and New Zealand also participate.   </p><p>  Ireland is a founder member of the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases which was established in December 2009. The objective of this Alliance is to pool the resources of like-minded countries and so enable the agriculture sector to continue to reduce emissions. The work of the Alliance is focused on three Research Groups; Livestock, Crops and Rice. Teagasc represent Ireland on the Livestock and Crops Research Groups. </p><p>  In recent years, a number of important reports have been initiated on these issues including the project <i>'Celticflux'</i>   was funded by the EPA under STRIVE. It provided measurement and modelling of greenhouse gas fluxes from grasslands and a peatland in Ireland; a hedgerow mapping project by Teagasc where all mature hedgerows wider than 2m have been mapped.  This project found that approximately 450,000 Ha, or 6.4%, of the country is covered by hedgerows, individual trees, small woodland patches and scrub - nearly the equivalent area of Co. Tipperary. This map database will be freely available via the Teagasc website in the near future</p><p>  An<b><i> '</i></b><i>Additions and refinements to the Irish forest carbon accounting and reporting tool'</i>   project which involves multidisciplinary collaboration between several national institutions, and will focus on applying improved estimates of CO<sub>2</sub> emission factors to afforested organic soils and organo-mineral soils; refining the modelling of soil carbon stocks and changes in mineral soils using a spatial framework; detecting deforestation and disturbance events from medium resolution hypertemporal optical satellite imagery and characterising them using higher spatial resolution optical and microwave images; developing methodologies to investigate the fate and management of forest deadwood carbon pools after disturbance events; and constructing algorithms to quantify changes to deadwood carbon.</p><p>  The combined outputs from these research activities will be assimilated into CARBWARE, thereby improving the national reporting capacity. Close collaboration with the Irish GHG network will ensure standardisation of outputs, with delivery of geodatabases derived from the research to support DAFM and Forest Service forest management.</p><p>  The results of this research, allied with data on land and forestry activity that is supplied by my Department through the Central Statistics Office, inform the work of the Environmental Protection Agency which has responsibility for the development and maintenance of the national inventory for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  One of the most important components of this inventory is the estimation of carbon sequestration of Irish land use.</p><p>  Clearly, Ireland is deeply committed to research that is aimed at improving parameters of production, environment, and socio-economics. It is vital that the results of this research are implemented with the help of our stakeholders in agri-food, so that we can guarantee the supply of sustainable food into the future. while combating climate change.</p><p>  International and EU Focus:</p><p>  At the highest international level, the Department of Agriculture has actively participated in meetings and conferences of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) over the past number of years.  Throughout this process, Ireland has been the main driver within the EU for a UNFCCC decision on agriculture and is leading the EU effort which seeks the establishment of a work programme on agriculture.</p><p>  Ireland has also been raising the issue of agriculture at EU Commission level. In this regard Minister Hogan and myself as well as officials of our two departments, have worked closely together. We both met with the Commissioner for Climate Change in September 2011 and both our departments have continued to press the issue in 2012. In October the Commission said that they &#8220;understand and acknowledge&#8221; the &#8220;nature and carbon efficiency of the agriculture sector in Ireland, as well as its importance on economic and social grounds&#8221;. This represents a significant step forward for Irish agriculture following a great deal of work in the past 18 months.  </p><p>  Ireland, through my Department currently holds the lead negotiator role for the EU on agriculture for the UNFCCC sessions. The Bonn session, in June 2013 during our Presidency of the EU, presents an opportunity to further raise the profile of agriculture both within and outside the EU, with the aim of advancing the discussion further, including to Ministerial level at the next UNFCCC Conference of the Parties in Warsaw next November.</p><p>  It is important to acknowledge the help and assistance of the D/ECLG, as lead Department on climate change, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Teagasc and the EPA in this regard. Significant advances have been made as a result of a great deal of work by all concerned. There is a lot more work to do, but we are seeing some positive movement at UNFCCC and EU levels and I can assure you that we are fully committed to continue this work in meeting the challenges ahead.</p></reply>

The effects of the spread of the virus will depend on the stage of pregnancy when adult animals are infected. Further spread to unaffected herds/flocks in northern and western counties is very likely to occur during the 2013 vector season but should have relatively little impact in non-pregnant livestock.  </p><p>  It is generally impractical to attempt midge control measures except for valuable breeding stock and it would be hoped that a strategy of exposure of non-pregnant animals may in fact be beneficial pending the development of an effective vaccine.  Exposed animals develop a strong immunity and are unlikely to suffer any ill-effects if exposed to the virus on a subsequent occasion.  If this viral infection becomes endemic the ill-effects are likely to be confined to pregnant sheep that have not been previously exposed as there is no evidence of clinical disease in adult sheep. Based on Australian experience in vaccinating against a similar virus/disease (Akabane virus infection) it is anticipated that vaccination is likely to be an effective tool in control of the SBV infection. A commercial vaccine is in development and my Department is monitoring developments closely.</p></reply>

In light of the continuing difficulties being experienced last week, I extended the duration of the scheme until 10<sup>th</sup>  May. I also confirmed that maize silage is eligible under the scheme. I am pleased to note that since the introduction of this Scheme that significant quantities of fodder have been imported and are reaching those in most need.</p><p>  In terms of EU payments, it will be recalled that my successful approach to Commissioner Ciolos for agreement to making an advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment was prompted by the very wet weather experienced throughout last summer. Mindful of ongoing difficulties, I have decided that a formal request should again be made to the EU Commission seeking agreement to pay an advance from 16 October of the 2013 Single Farm Payment which, it being the first day of the new EU financial year, is the earliest potential payment date and almost 2 months ahead of the standard timeline.  Payments under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme are scheduled to begin issuing in September 2013.  </p><p>  Under the EU Regulations governing all area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check of all applications, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any agri-environment payment can issue.</p><p>  2013 advance payments under REPS and AEOS cannot be made until SPS applications are submitted and validated and a cross check between the area contained in the agri-environment application and the SPS application is successfully completed. Successive EU audits have made it absolutely clear that compliance with both these requirements and EU Regulations must be strictly adhered to and eligibility conditions met before any payment issues. </p><p>  While my Department commits to commencing agri-environment payments as early as possible, due to the requirement to complete these administrative checks it I expect that the 2013 agri-environment scheme payments of REPS and AEOS will commence in the final quarter of 2013.</p><p>  Approximately 1,500 payments AEOS payments have issued  over the last 10 days, while close to a further 600 AEOS payments valued at just over &euro;1.3m is expected to issue within the next week.</p></reply>

The aims and objectives of the project are to:</p><p>- Provide information to the public on child care proceedings in the courts;</p><p>- Conduct research on these proceedings in order to promote debate and inform policy-makers;</p><p>- Make recommendations to address any short-comings in the child care system identified by the research;</p><p>- Assist in the implementation of these recommendations;</p><p>- Promote confidence in the child care system.</p><p>  The project pursues its aims and objectives by attending the courts where child care cases are heard in order to report on those proceedings while protecting the anonymity of the children and their families, in accordance with a Protocol drawn up by its Director. The CCLRP will publish reports of child care cases for the public and all relevant stake-holders at a frequency and in a form to be determined by the Director.It will also collect and analyse data from the proceedings, publish reports on the nature and outcomes of the child care proceedings and promote a public debate on the issues raised through seminars and conferences.</p><p>  The project is in its early stages and it would be unwise to reach any firm conclusions based on the very limited information available at this stage. The CCLRP is scheduled to run for five years to seek to determine a range of issues such as that mentioned by the Deputy.  Officials from my Department are in touch with the project team and I understand that the intention is for the project to publish its first interim overview report in Autumn 2013. At this time it may be possible to identify any emerging issues requiring policy consideration.</p><p>  I am not entirely clear as to the origin of the figures quoted by the Deputy. However I can confirm that Court Services statistics indicate that 2 Care Orders and 22 Interim Care Orders were granted in Donegal in 2011. The HSE's Review of Adequacy Report for the same period indicates that the total number of children in care in Donegal in 2011 was 161 (2.6% of child population). This figure is broadly in line with percentages in other parts of the country.</p></reply>

This funding supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth work sector.  The Youth Service referred to by the Deputy administers a number of youth projects under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme and one Youth Information Service and the allocation provided by my Department for these projects is &euro;511,465 in 2013.  Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, which amount to &euro;5.393 million in 2013, my Department has tried to ensure in the determination process for the allocations that front-line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people, are protected as far as possible from the impact of any necessary reductions in funding.</p><p>  There is no doubt that the current budgetary situation is challenging for many organisations.  In considering how best to manage within the allocations available, organisations are being asked to consider the scope for reducing administration costs and other overheads and to work closely with their local VEC that administers the funding on behalf of my Department, in order to maintain the front-line services for young people particularly for those young people who may be disadvantaged.  My Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year.  The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and will, <i>inter alia</i>, promote co-ordination between Government Departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.</p></reply>

The purpose of foster care inspections is to review compliance with regulations and standards for all children.  HIQA's inspection methodology includes interviewing HSE managers and social workers, a sample of children, carers and birth parents and review a range of files, including complaints.</p><p>  Foster care services in the HSE Dublin North West Area have been inspected by HIQA on three occasions since September 2009, most recently in October 2012.  Progress was noted particularly in the area of foster care assessment, approval and training with all general foster carers approved and significant improvements in the area of relative foster carers.  Some 96% of children in foster care had been visited by a social worker within the preceding six months.  Notwithstanding such progress, I was concerned to note that inspectors found that some deficits identified previously had not been rectified.  Allegations made against a small number of foster carers had not been fully resolved.  Inspectors found that there were inadequacies in systems to assess risk and to investigate and take timely action in response to concerns.  File keeping, data collection and analysis were also found to be lacking. </p><p>  The inspection also found that sufficient foster carers have not been recruited within the area.  This has provided difficulties in making placements and matching children with particular needs with the most suitable carers.  Recruitment of foster carers is of concern more generally.  It is intended to conduct a national recruitment campaign in the coming months.  An Action Plan to address the weaknesses identified was prepared by HIQA.  In order to ensure the Action Plan is fully implemented, I have asked the HSE to set up a high-level oversight process to be led by the Head of Quality Assurance to ensure implementation of all the HIQA recommendations. This group is now established and includes Dr. Valerie O'Brien of UCD who has researched extensively in the area foster care.  The group will report to me on progress on a monthly basis.  I expect to receive the first of these reports shortly.  Recently, I met Mr. Gordon Jeyes, who is Chief Executive Designate of the Child and Family Support Agency, to review the actions under way to address the critical issues identified.</p></reply>

Approximately 68,000 children are availing of the ECCE programme in the current school year.  Children are eligible to avail of the free preschool year if they are aged more than 3 years and 2 months and less than 4 years and 7 months at 1 September in the relevant year.  Children born between 2 February 2009 and 30 June 2010 will qualify for the free preschool year in September 2013 and children born between 2 February 2010 and 30 June 2011 will qualify for the programme in September 2014.  As the child referred to by the Deputy was born in July 2010, he is below the age range for eligibility for the programme in the 2013-14 school year.  If a child qualifies for the free preschool year and is also eligible to enrol in primary school, it is a matter for the parents to choose which option they wish the child to avail of.  The objective of the ECCE programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  To achieve this, services participating in the preschool year are expected to provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  For this reason, it is appropriate to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will qualify.  There is no provision under the programme to enrol children who are below the qualifying age.</p></reply>

The Authority is obliged to fully satisfy itself of the fitness of any persons or body of persons to provide and undertake adoption services.  This is covered in some detail by the Adoption Act, 2010 (Accredited Bodies) Regulation 2010.  The Authority is examining a number of issues in relation to accredited agencies in general, including  the levels of fees being charged by Irish agencies in relation to international norms.  The Authority has indicated that the level of fees being charged by one agency, ARC,  is in line with international norms.  However, the Authority has asked ARC to amend the fee payment schedule to produce a more balanced staged payments structure.  The Authority will advise me of the outcome of this examination in due course.  My Department is examining the role of accredited agencies under the Adoption Act 2010, including the issue of operating costs.  I am anxious to ensure such agencies are underpinned by sustainable financial structures which operate within international norms for adoption.  Most importantly, all fee structures should be set at an appropriate level and deliver transparency for all the parties involved.</p><p>The Health Service Executive is continuing a drive to reduce the time taken to submit claims to private health insurance companies. It should be noted that the non timely completion of paperwork does not cost the HSE &euro;61m, as the money does get paid. However, it is acknowledged that there is a timing issue and that is what the HSE is focused on. The number of days taken for consultants to complete forms has reduced from an average of 62 days in 2010 to an average of 44 days in 2012 representing an improvement of 29%. The HSE target is 14 working days for consultant sign-off. The percentage of overall insurance debt that is within HSE / Consultant control has decreased from 61% in 2010 to 47% in 2012.</p><p>  The HSE is focused on:</p><p> - Continued roll-out of the Electronic Claims Management System in its hospitals. Twelve sites are currently using the electronic claims system representing 51% of overall national claims. Over 80% of claims will be electronic by the end of Dec' 13. This system will address the deficiencies of the paper based process and will also ensure that standardised work practices are implemented across hospitals.</p><p> - Obtaining compliance with the commitment set out in Section 5 (vii) (a) of the document <i>Consultants - Implementing the Public Service Agreement</i> that was issued by the Labour Relations Commission on the 17<sup></sup>Sept 2012. This required &#8220;a commitment from all consultants to fully complete and sign private insurance forms within 14 days of receipt of all relevant documentation&#8221;. </p><p> - Intense focus by Acute Hospital Management on improving the collection of this key source of funding.  </p><p>  Significant progress has been made in the last two to three years and there is a plan in place to significantly improve the process further. This will encompass hospital processing and consultant sign-off. There remains a significant challenge in improving the speed of payments from insurers and this is something which the HSE is engaging on with both the insurers and the Department of Health.</p></reply>

The application is being considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed last year by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines.</p><p>  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of pirfenidone and concluded that, at the submitted price, pirfenidone is not cost-effective for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. </p><p>  The NCPE report is an important input to assist decision making and informs further discussions between the HSE and the manufacturer of the drug. The HSE is currently in negotiations with the manufacturers of pirfenidone and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further while these negotiations are ongoing.</p><p>  The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of pirfenidone that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. The HSE understands that patients and clinicians are very anxious that a decision be made as soon as possible. </p></reply>

In 2002 the Forum on Fluoridation, which was established to review this policy, concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. </p><p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects. It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population. The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by the World Health Organisation; the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Service and the Surgeon General of the United States; the World Dental Federation; the International Association for Dental Research; the Royal College of Physicians of England and by major international scientifically validated reviews in many countries. The effects of fluoridation on health and related matters are kept under constant review.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the non timely completion of paperwork does not cost the HSE &euro;61m, as the money does get paid. However, it is acknowledged that there is a timing issue and that is what the HSE is focused on. The number of days taken for consultants to complete forms has reduced from an average of 62 days in 2010 to an average of 44 days in 2012 representing an improvement of 29%. The HSE target is 14 working days for consultant sign-off. The percentage of overall insurance debt that is within HSE / Consultant control has decreased from 61% in 2010 to 47% in 2012.</p><p>  The HSE is focused on:</p><p> - Continued roll-out of the Electronic Claims Management System in its hospitals. Twelve sites are currently using the electronic claims system representing 51% of overall national claims. Over 80% of claims will be electronic by the end of Dec' 13. This system will address the deficiencies of the paper based process and will also ensure that standardised work practices are implemented across hospitals.</p><p> - Obtaining compliance with the commitment set out in Section 5 (vii) (a) of the document <i>Consultants - Implementing the Public Service Agreement</i> that was issued by the Labour Relations Commission on the 17<sup></sup>Sept 2012. This required &#8220;a commitment from all consultants to fully complete and sign private insurance forms within 14 days of receipt of all relevant documentation&#8221;. </p><p> - Intense focus by Acute Hospital Management on improving the collection of this key source of funding.  </p><p>  Significant progress has been made in the last two to three years and there is a plan in place to significantly improve the process further. This will encompass hospital processing and consultant sign-off. There remains a significant challenge in improving the speed of payments from insurers and this is something which the HSE is engaging on with both the insurers and the Department of Health.</p></reply>

As part of the process of developing these proposals, the Department is continuing discussions with various Departments. </p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has considered these proposals and I intend to bring forward specific proposals for consideration by Government as soon as possible.</p><p>  In the meantime, work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing.  For example, in conjunction with Northern Ireland, a health impact assessment is being commissioned as part of the process of developing a legislative basis for minimum unit pricing. (Scotland commissioned a similar assessment before drafting its legislation on minimum unit pricing.)  The health impact assessment will study the impact of different minimum prices on a range of areas such as health, crime and likely economic impact.</p></reply>

I met with the Irish Epilepsy Association in January and explained this position.</p><p>  It is also important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine. All of the generic medicines on the Irish market are required to be properly licensed and meet the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board.</p></reply>

These include the HSE's National Infection Control Action Plan, launched in 2007 and a National Surveillance System to collect data and provide information to monitor HCAIs; the establishment of the Clinical Care Programme for HCAIs also supports this aim.</p><p>    In relation to the recent Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) reports on four hospitals my Department and the HSE recognise that the HIQA inspection of hospitals against the National Infection Prevention and Control Standards is an important element of the overall strategy to reduce HCAIs in the delivery of healthcare in Ireland.   With regard to hand hygiene the findings of the Authority suggest that hand hygiene best practice needs to become more operationally embedded at all levels.  I must emphasise that it is of vital importance that healthcare workers recognise their personal responsibility to protect patients by maintaining their own good hand hygiene.</p><p>  To improve hand hygiene a series of actions are in place, a key element of which is the HSE's continuing bi-annual hand hygiene audits which occur both in the acute sector and in the long stay area as well. Additionally, from July this year it will be mandatory for all staff to receive hand hygiene training as part of staff induction and a hand hygiene education programme as continuous training. </p><p>Other actions include:</p><p>- the existing 2005 guidelines on hand hygiene are being revised and will be published this year;</p><p>- a hand hygiene e-learning programme is being piloted in Dublin North East;</p><p>- a training video for staff on the WHO 5 Moments for hand hygiene concept and national participation in the WHO's annual Hand Hygiene Day on 5th May 2013 with all hospitals engaging in local initiatives;</p><p>- revised hand hygiene posters were introduced across the system in the summer of 2012;</p><p>- a major section on website on hand hygiene;</p><p>- in collaboration with the Department of Education an educational programme for schools - E-Bug;</p><p>- a monthly national HCAI implementation group monitors and reviews all HCAI activity in the health system.</p><p>  The four hospitals audited by HIQA are now being asked to develop quality improvement plans that prioritise changes necessary to fully meet the National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections.  These plans must be published by the hospitals concerned on the Internet within six weeks of the publication of HIQA's reports.  The hospitals in question will receive a letter indicating general outcomes and lessons to be learned.</p><p>    With regard to the prevention of the spread of MRSA  it should be noted that the number of cases of MRSA has fallen by 55% between 2006 and 2011 (from 592 to 263 cases) and the downward trend is holding per statistical returns to date (a drop to 242 cases (59% decrease) to end-2012 (provisional figures)).   Individual hospital MRSA rates are also collected and published &ndash; annually for 2006 and 2007 and quarterly from 2008 onwards. These results provide a good benchmark into the future to enable us to measure effectively the progress of each hospital on their performance in infection prevention and control.  The data can be used by individual hospitals to monitor their progress in the control of HCAIs and the regular reports  allow for public assessment of that progress.</p><p>    Finally, officials of my Department  are currently working on the Licensing of Health Facilities Bill which will provide for a mandatory system of licensing for public and private health service providers.  The legislative proposals are being prepared broadly in line with recommendations made in the Report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance and are designed to improve patient safety by ensuring that healthcare providers do not operate below core standards which are applied in a consistent and systematic way.  The intention is to have a proportionate system which has the confidence of the public.  Standards and other requirements will be enforceable through inspection and imposition of sanctions as necessary.  Licensing will be targeted at areas which are not currently subject to regulation.  It is expected that outline proposals for the new system of licensing should be finalised in the near future.</p></reply>

The National Substance Misuse Strategy envisaged a minimum unit price for alcohol products only - complemented by a range of other measures in the supply and prevention areas - in order to deal with the misuse of alcohol. It is likely therefore, that these would have a positive influence on the demand for non-alcohol products relative to alcohol products.</p></reply>

I am advised that, in 2012, ninety cochlear implants were carried out with 42 children receiving implants and 48 adults.  In addition to providing the surgical services, the programme provides a comprehensive assessment service to potential candidates and a rehabilitative service to those actually implanted. </p><p>  In 2009 a National Review of Audiology Services was carried out by the HSE, to examine the services provided to children and adults nationwide, and to formulate a national plan for the services. The report of the National Audiology Review Group, published by the HSE in 2011, provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services, from new-born screening to assessment and management of adults and children with hearing problems, including cochlear implantation. Two of the main recommendations in the report include the national rollout of a universal new-born hearing screening programme and the establishment of a bone anchored hearing aid programme. The report also included a recommendation that continued ring-fenced financial support be provided for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children. </p><p>  While no dedicated programme for simultaneous or sequential implantation is being carried out in Ireland at this time, some bilateral implantation has already occurred for patients, mainly very young children with certain medical conditions such as a history of meningitis or blindness. It is estimated that there are approximately 200 children in Ireland today who may be suitable for a second implant. The HSE has advised that it is working closely with Beaumont Hospital to progress plans for both simultaneous and sequential bilateral implantation. The development of the service will require additional resources for Beaumont and these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 Estimates process.   </p><p>  I can confirm that Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch intends to meet with the Happy New Ear campaign group later on this month. </p></reply>

My Department is in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  There are 639 intern posts available for the July 2013 intake.  In recent years all EEA graduates from Irish medical schools, who sought an intern post and who met the eligibility requirements, were accommodated.  The HSE remain confident that this year will be no exception.</p></reply>

The Scheme provides support to individuals, not to nursing homes. In order to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme all private nursing homes, and voluntary nursing homes which previously received funding for long-term residential care under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, must negotiate and agree a price for the cost of long-term nursing home care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  This is necessary due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above individuals&rsquo; contributions.</p><p>  The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State. The NTPF negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process.</p><p>  The NTPF assesses nursing home process under four criteria:</p><p>- costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;</p><p>- price(s) previously charged;</p><p>- local market price, and</p><p>- Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.  An NTPF pricing agreement is in place with the nursing home referred to by the Deputy.

The decision to offer smear tests to women aged 25 and over was made following very careful consideration of the benefits to the population and the potential risks to individual women. This involved both Irish and international experts in cervical cancer and screening who examined international evidence and experience as part of the process.  The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that cervical screening at a population level is only offered to women aged over 25. National cervical screening programmes in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England have all changed the screening age from 20 to 25 in recent years. This measure was taken to prevent too many young women undergoing unnecessary treatment and side effects. </p><p>  Changes in the cells of the cervix are extremely common in women under 25. In the vast majority of cases, these changes will settle and go back to normal by themselves. If the screening age was lowered to invite women under 25 for smear tests, young women could be subjected to unnecessary treatment that may have potential long-term negative effects on their health and fertility.  Cancer of the cervix is extremely rare in women aged under 25. The average age in Ireland for the diagnosis of cervical cancer is 46. In 2010, 310 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer and of these women, just three were aged under 25.  </p><p>  I would encourage all women aged under 25 to be vigilant about their health and go immediately to their family doctor (GP) if they have any concerns or symptoms such as abnormal bleeding. In such cases, it is not a smear test through a screening programme that is needed, but a biopsy. Her GP will make arrangements for her to have one, through a hospital service. Early detection of cervical cancer, particularly in younger women, is important in effectively treating it.  The best way to prevent cervical cancer in women younger than 25 is to encourage 12-18 year olds to avail of the free HPV vaccination being offered to all secondary schoolgirls.</p></reply>

Under the Scheme, nursing home residents contribute towards the cost of their nursing home care based on their means, and the HSE pays the balance.  The person's contribution towards the cost of their care is calculated based on 80% of their income  and 5% of their assets per annum. If the person is a member of a couple, the assessment is based on half of the couple's combined income and assets. It was announced in Budget 2013 that the asset contribution will be increased from 5% to 7.5% per annum.  The legislation underpinning the Scheme must be amended before this change can take effect.</p><p>  The Scheme contains several important safeguards which ensure that both the person in the nursing home and their spouse/partner, if applicable, are adequately provided for:</p><p> 1.  Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.</p><p> 2. The first &euro;36,000 for a person's assets, or &euro;72,000 for a couple, is not taken into account during the financial assessment.</p><p> 3. The principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of a person's time in care. This three year cap can also apply to family farms/businesses in certain circumstances.</p><p> 4. Where an individual's assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is the optional Nursing Home Loan element of the scheme.</p><p> 5. Individuals keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.</p><p> 6. If there is a spouse/partner remaining at home, s/he will retain 50% of the couples income, or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.</p><p> 7. Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment. These allowable deductions include health expenses.</p><p> 8. There is a financial review mechanism which takes account of the fluctuating value of assets and the fact that cash assets will naturally deplete over time as payments are made to the nursing home etc. </p><p>  If a person avails of the Nursing Home Loan, the money advanced by way of the loan must be repaid as follows:</p><p> - If the repayment arises because of the death of the person in care, it must be repaid within 12 months of the date of death. Otherwise interest will apply from the date of death.</p><p> - If the repayment arises because the property is sold/transferred during the person in care&rsquo;s lifetime, it must be repaid within 6 months of the date of the sale/transfer, otherwise interest will apply back to that date.</p></reply>

This means that on-duty ambulance crews are at their stations or in their vehicles during a shift, rather than having to be summoned to the station in the event of a call-out. Therefore, crews can respond to an emergency call immediately, instead of the average time of over 20 minutes for a vehicle to leave the station under on-call. This change, which was sought by both staff and the NAS, has obvious benefits for patients and response times and represents a clear improvement in service. </p><p>  The NAS intends to introduce on-duty rostering and dynamic deployment of emergency resources, on a phased basis, across the entire Cork and Kerry region. So far, on-duty and dynamic deployment arrangements have been successfully introduced across County Cork, most recently in West Cork.  The NAS informs me that planning for the next phase, in South Kerry, can now be progressed. This phase will include ambulance stations in Caherciveen, Killarney and Kenmare. As in each phase to date, any decisions on the best model of service for South Kerry will be preceded by detailed consideration of activity, geography, demographics, location of acute hospitals and other facilities, supporting services, wider NAS developments and learning from previous phases, as well as public, clinical and community leader engagement.</p><p>  The HSE is currently considering the most appropriate model of service delivery for South Kerry, to replace the current on-call, static deployment model and the operation of resources in isolation.  No decisions have so far been made and a number of matters need to be progressed before deliberations in relation to South Kerry can be finalised. These include public, staff and clinical (including GP) consultations, continuing national reconfiguration of the control and dispatch system and the ongoing roll-out of the Intermediate Care Service for inter-facility patient transport in the region.  A final model will emerge once this process is completed. </p><p>  In light of the above, all stakeholders should take advantage of the opportunity to participate in the consultation process, as the most effective and appropriate forum to engage with the HSE and the NAS in relation to proposals for changes in emergency service delivery in South Kerry. </p></reply>
