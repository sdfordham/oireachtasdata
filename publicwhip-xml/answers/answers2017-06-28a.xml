When the UK leaves the EU, an alternative aviation agreement between the UK and the remaining 27 EU Member States will be required. </p>  <p>  I have had a number of meetings with my EU counterparts, UK counterparts and the European Commissioner on Brexit, most recently at the Transport Council in Luxembourg.  These meetings were extremely useful in promoting an understanding of transport and tourism Brexit implications for Ireland. </p>  <p>  The full implications for Ireland of the UK leaving the single aviation market will only become apparent as formal Brexit negotiations develop. </p>  <p>  The aviation sector is critical to Ireland.  As an island nation with an open economy, air connectivity is essential for our trading relationships, for all of our industries especially tourism, manufacturing and retail, and for our participation in the global economy generally.  Ireland's priority for aviation will be to protect a fully liberalised and deregulated market in order to ensure no erosion of our connectivity or disruption to airlines, airports, business, tourism and personal travel.</p>  <p>  In advance of formal negotiations on the specifics of an alternative aviation agreement between the UK and the European Union, it is clear that the consideration may be given to possible transitional or interim arrangements to ensure that existing traffic rights are agreed in a timely fashion.  In this manner if a replacement agreement cannot be agreed within the timeframes specified by Article 50 any such arrangements will help to bridge the gap between a withdrawal agreement and an agreed future relationship with the UK to bring certainty to the aviation sector and ensure continuity of vital air services.</p></reply>

Preparations for the dialogue are at an early stage and I am sure the Deputy can appreciate that there will a considerable level of organisation and scheduling required if we are to have the type of meaningful dialogue and exchange of ideas that I think we all want. </p>  <p>  In advance of this dialogue, I have invited representatives of all CI&Eacute; trade unions, as well as ICTU, to meet with me and explain their issues of concern as expressed in recent months.  Invitations issued last week and the meeting will take place in early July.  I believe this meeting will provide unions with an opportunity to voice their views to me directly in relation to any issues of policy concern they might have. </p>  <p>  I think the type of dialogue with stakeholders that I am about to initiate comes at an important time in terms of how we want to shape our public transport services.  There are a number of important initiatives underway which will directly impact and influence the development of public transport in future years.  I think it opportune that all those with an interest in public transport are given an opportuntity to voice their views and ideas for the future.</p></reply>

The public consultation process was launched with the publication of a <i>Rail Review 2016 Report,</i>which examined the funding required to support the heavy rail network now and into the future, together with a consultation document &quot;The Role of Rail in Ireland and Funding its Delivery&quot;.  The report provided an analysis of the company's financial situation, some funding solutions and proposals to grow passenger numbers.</p><p>Over 300 submissions were received by the NTA in response to that consultation process which have now all been examined and the NTA is preparing a report of those submissions.</p><p>In advance of that, no decisions have been taken regarding matters such as the future of individual rail lines or investment in the company and its relevant infrastructure.</p><p>As noted within the <i>Rail Review Report,</i>its analysis predates the finalisation of the National Planning Framework which is being developed at present under the leadership of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It is obvious that, once agreed by Government, the approach which that Framework adopts toward land-use planning and settlement patterns for the country will have significant impacts on the potential of rail and other transport infrastructure and services into the future.  I look forward to the finalisation and adoption by Government in the coming months of the new National Planning Framework, which I believe will form an important context for my consideration of issues raised by the <i>Rail Review Report</i>and any recommendations I will bring to Government.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-28a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062800074#WRA02100"><p>​The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  The economic reality of recent years has meant significant reductions in roads budgets across the board and this resulted in some grant programmes being curtailed, including the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes, in order to protect funding for road maintenance and repair and this remains the position in 2017.  </p>  <p>  While the Capital Plan 2016-2021 does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network it will take some years yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network.  There is, therefore, limited scope at present for funding for projects under either the Specific or Strategic Grant Programmes.  </p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under those Grant Programmes are assessed by my Department on a case-by-case basis, with particular consideration given to higher cost Bridge Rehabilitation Works, significant safety schemes and improvement works that promote employment.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and the Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.</p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement local authorities in their spending in this area.</p></reply>

It is proposed that these facilities would be located at Swords, Finglas, Dunboyne, Liffey Valley, Naas Road, Carrickmines, Woodbrook and Greystones.  The Strategy indicates that further development of local park and ride facilities will also be considered at appropriate locations on the rail network in the outer parts of the Dublin metropolitan network and hinterland.</p><p>In addition, the NTA recently launched the <i>BusConnects</i>initiative which proposes a radical transformation of the bus system in Dublin that will involve, inter alia, the development of a network of 'next generation' bus corridors and a complete redesign of the network to be accompanied by a network of bus-based park and ride sites at strategic locations.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, a mid-term review of the Capital Plan is currently underway and in my Department's submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform I have sought a significant increase in funding for public transport investment to support these initiatives.  The extent to which the park and ride network - both the rail-based and bus-based network - can be rolled out will be dependent on the level of additional funding that may become available for public transport following the completion of the mid-term review of the Capital Plan.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-28a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062800074#WRA02700"><p>​As I outlined in my response on 10 May last I decided recently that my Department should conduct an internal review of the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973, as amended.  Such a review is timely, given the age of that Order and the subsequent changes to international law since 1973, particularly as regards the transport of dangerous goods by air.</p>  <p>  In the first instance this will be an internal review in my Department, to identify the options available for updating various aspects of the Order.  Given that so many aspects of the current Order require review, taking into account legislation at EU level and internationally at the International Civil Aviation Organisation, it is likely that implementing the recommendations of the review would require a new Statutory Instrument to replace existing legislative provisions.</p>  <p>  In addition to compatibility with EU and International law, other issues that may be examined in the review would be the role of other Ministers and agencies in the granting of exemptions under the order, the legal definitions of civil aircraft and state aircraft, the requirement for permits for each individual aircraft operation, the application of the order to Irish registered aircraft outside of Irish airspace, issues related to the carriage of firearms by certain categories of law enforcement officers and finally the provisions of the order relating to monitoring, enforcement, inspection and offences.</p>  <p>  I would then envisage a public consultation taking place in order to ensure that any proposed changes are considered in an open and transparent manner.  I would hope it is possible to begin this wider public consultation process before the end of the year.</p></reply>

Maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority over the next period and the bulk of the roads capital budget, approximately &euro;4.4 billion, is earmarked for such essential work with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already underway.  In this context it was not possible to include a range of projects in the Plan (including the N2 Clontibret to the Border scheme) given the overall funding envelope available. </p>  <p>  The Capital Review is now underway and a number of local authorities (including Monaghan County Council) have made submissions to my Department outlining the case for funding for roads and my Department is making a strong case for additional funding, including the development of a project pipeline for road schemes.  While there is a strong case for additional funding for the transport sector, there are a multitude of possible national, regional and local projects around the country, the cost of which far exceed available funding and unfortunately, this means that only a limited number can be put forward for funding.</p>  <p>  The final decisions on allocations are, however, matters for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and Government as a whole.</p>  <p>  Concerning the A5 scheme, as outlined to the Deputy in my reply to PQ 12318/17 of 8 March 2017 and PQ 23352/17 of 16 May, the planning and implementation (including the design) of the A5 project is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland authorities.  As the Deputy is aware, the Stormont House Agreement and Implementation Plan - A Fresh Start - reaffirmed the Government's commitment to provide funding of &pound;50m for the A5 project and committed an additional &pound;25m to ensure that Phase 1 of the project (Newbuildings to north of Strabane) can commence as soon as the planning process in Northern Ireland has been concluded.</p></reply>

Within Ireland, individual counties may compete for domestic visitors.  Research carried out for Tourism Ireland indicates that the level of awareness of Ireland's county boundaries is low among potential overseas visitors, and therefore expenditure by public or private entities on marketing an individual county to consumers in overseas markets is unlikely to provide an adequate return on investment.     </p>  <p>  I am delighted that National Geographic Traveller has named Donegal at the top of its list of 'coolest places to visit' in 2017.  Donegal features prominently in Tourism Ireland's global marketing activity.  For example last autumn, filming took place at places like Malin Head, Fanad Lighthouse, Glenveagh National Park and Slieve League in Donegal for Tourism Ireland footage of the Donegal section of the Wild Atlantic Way.  Tourism Ireland has rolled out a series of Wild Atlantic Way advertising campaigns in overseas markets over the past year, in which Donegal has featured.  </p>  <p>  Donegal, and the accolade received from National Geographic Traveller, are highlighted on Tourism Ireland's suite of international websites as well as through Tourism Ireland's social media platforms.  Donegal continues to be extensively promoted through a series of Wild Atlantic Way adverts and will feature in the upcoming Star Wars film providing a superb promotional opportunity.  Tourism Ireland also works with overseas travel, lifestyle and special interest media as part of their overseas promotional programme.  I understand that Tourism Ireland recently provided details of such campaigns to the Deputy. </p>  <p>  Donegal Airport certainly benefits from a very scenic approach and the recent publicity it received is welcome, both for the airport and the county.  Tourism Ireland has, since 2015, supported direct access to regional airports through its Regional Air Access Cooperative Fund.  This provides for funding to be made available where it is matched by carriers or airports in order to exploit marketing opportunities for direct access.  I understand that Donegal Airport has availed of this fund in the past and would encourage it do so again. </p>  <p>  I understand that Aer Lingus has announced they are interlining routes to Donegal (Carrickfinn) from Schipol Airport in Amsterdam and Charles de Gaulle in Paris.  Tourism Ireland and Aer Lingus are trialling a new interlining initiative (to the end of October 2017) to make it easier for French and Dutch visitors to fly into Donegal Airport (Carrickfinn).  This new pilot scheme means that visitors can travel Charles de Gaulle/Dublin/Donegal or Schipol/Dublin/Donegal with tickets issued all the way through and baggage transferred automatically all the way through to Donegal airport (so there is no need to reclaim luggage at Dublin and check in again for onward travel to Donegal).  Tourism Ireland will promote the new scheme.  </p>  <p>  In 2016, F&aacute;ilte Ireland invested &euro;1.7m on marketing the Wild Atlantic Way and, along with the local authorities from Donegal to Galway, have co-funded a marketing campaign in Great Britain in 2017 in which Donegal features heavily.</p></reply>

Addressing urban congestion on both the strategic road network and locally in certain locations is an important theme in the Strategy.  The measures proposed are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region.</p><p>The Strategy does not include the implementation of the Leinster Outer Orbital during its lifetime.  Large scale projects proposed in the Strategy include the DART Expansion Programme, New Metro North, and various other light rail projects.  While funding is provided in the Capital Plan to commence construction of new Metro North and to progress electrification of the Northern line to Balbriggan, these projects will not be delivered in the short to medium term.  Therefore, the most realistic option to meaningfully tackle congestion in the short to medium term is to radically improve the bus system to deliver a step change in performance across the GDA and to complement that improved public transport system with a network of park and ride sites.</p><p>In this connection, the NTA launched <i>BusConnects </i>last month. <i>BusConnects </i>involves a suite of measures to transform Dublin's Bus System including the development of a network of &quot;next generation&quot; bus corridors with segregated cycling, a complete redesign of bus network, development of three bus rapid transit routes, simpler fare structure, and a cashless payment system.  This initiative is currently at public consultation stage and I look forward to it being progressed.</p><p>I must also highlight that already planned projects for the period 2015-2018 which include Luas Cross City, the Phoenix Park Tunnel, additional bus fleet and bus lane infrastructure, small scale interventions on the M50 and numerous other measures will go some way to addressing growing travel demand.  However, we must look to a greatly strengthened bus system as the basis for tackling congestion.  This requires a step-change in funding and I have made a strong case for increased public transport investment as part of the Mid-Term Review of the Government's Capital Plan.</p></reply>

These programmes are administered by the National Transport Authority and fund projects such as bus lanes, green routes, cycle lanes, safety measures for pedestrians/cyclists and to upgrade public transport infrastructure and facilities to help improve transport accessibility.  Over &euro;70m has been allocated over the period of the Capital Plan for projects under the Regional Cities and Accessibility programmes.  </p><p>The public transport needs of Cork will be kept under review in the context of on-going public transport planning and available funding.  The Deputy will be aware that a mid-term review of the Capital Plan is currently underway.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  The economic reality of recent years has meant significant reductions in roads budgets across the board and this resulted in some grant programmes being curtailed, including the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes, in order to protect funding for road maintenance and repair and this remains the position in 2017.  </p>  <p>  While the Capital Plan 2016-2021 does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network it will take some years yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network.  There is, therefore, limited scope at present for funding for projects under either the Specific or Strategic Grant Programmes.  </p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under those Grant Programmes are assessed by my Department on a case-by-case basis, with particular consideration given to higher cost Bridge Rehabilitation Works, significant safety schemes and improvement works that promote employment.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and the Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.  It is important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement local authorities in their spending in this area.</p></reply>

This cross-sectoral Plan will set out the challenges to meeting emission reductions targets for the entire economy and chart a clear and quantified path towards Ireland's long-term objective of transition to a low-carbon, and climate resilient economy by 2050.  In relation to the transport sector, a wide range of measures are considered, with the focus on securing a shift to public transport in appropriate, particularly urban, areas, speeding up the expected transition to alternative fuels or technologies, and targeted behavioural change.</p>  <p>  The continued development of public transport and active travel modes will be a key element in providing an effective and sustainable transport system for the future.  My Department's commitment to reducing dependence on the private car in favour of more sustainable forms of travel where feasible is clearly demonstrated by funding important infrastructure and behavioural change programmes to promote visibility and uptake of alternative modes of transport.  As the Deputy is aware, I have made and continue to make a strong case for public transport investment to be increased and accelerated to address our forecast growth in transport needs as part of the mid-term review of the Capital Plan. </p>  <p>  We must equally ensure that the capacity of our transport system to respond to the challenge of reducing emissions is not undermined.  Delivery and maintenance of high quality road infrastructure is crucial for the efficient transportation of all vehicles, not least buses, coaches and bicycles. </p>  <p>  Transport policy is developed to best serve the needs of society and the economy through safe, sustainable and competitive transport networks and services.  We are working hard to embed the imperative of securing cleaner, lower carbon transport emissions at the core of policy making.</p></reply>

Implementation of the proposals contained within the Recommendation is a matter for the Company and its employees. </p>  <p>  In terms of its PSO services, the Deputy is aware that those services are improving and expanding and that the taxpayers' contribution to those services is similarly increasing due to the increases I secured in Budget 2017.  I have committed to seeking further increases in PSO funding in this year's Budget subject, of course, to the overall resources available.</p></reply>

The introduction of the 7 year age limit is one such condition, as is the requirement that the possibility of follow-on investment was foreseen in the company&rsquo;s original business plan.</p>  <p>  Revenue further advise me that, as a facility to companies that are considering raising investments under the incentive and as an administrative measure, they provide what is known as &ldquo;outline approval&rdquo; to companies in advance of the shares issuing.  This is where Revenue is prepared to express the opinion that a company would be regarded as a qualifying company once the conditions of qualification are met.  There is no requirement for a company to obtain outline approval prior to issuing shares however, and the actual entitlement to the relief can only be determined after a company has raised its capital and issued shares.  Therefore, until the company has actually issued shares to investors it is not possible for Revenue to determine whether or not relief under the EII scheme is due.</p>  <p>   The current backlog on processing applications for EII outline approvals is 3 months, while the backlog on actual EII claims is about 2 months.  I am informed by Revenue that procedures have been put in place to reduce these backlogs.</p></reply>

There are currently 324 claims ready for settlement and I understand that these have been validated by the State Claims Agency.  The process for bringing these claims to the High Court for approval has commenced but a date has yet to be agreed. </p>  <p>  In relation to the 35% gap, it is expected that a proportion of the balance of claims will be met from the proceeds of the distribution of Setanta&rsquo;s assets on completion of the liquidation process.  However, it is not possible to say definitively at this stage what proportion of the claims this will amount to, but current indications are that this is unlikely to be sufficient to cover the full amount.</p>  <p>  In this regard, in 2014, a preliminary assessment was carried out by Towers Watson who indicated that the Liquidator would not be in a position to meet more than 30% of claims out of the assets of the liquidation.  The Liquidator has informed the Department that as the Supreme Court has now made its judgment, it will be necessary for a new report to be commissioned to provide updated figures.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy should note that the forthcoming legislation based on the recommendations of the Review of the Framework for Motor Insurance Compensation in Ireland will amend the relevant Insurance Acts to ensure 100% of third party motor claims will be covered in any future motor insurance insolvencies.  However, it  does not provide for 100% compensation for Setanta policyholders.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>- be without one or both legs;</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p><p>The Scheme and qualifying criteria were designed specifically for those with severe physical disabilities and are, therefore, necessarily precise.  </p><p>The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the fuel grant, the scheme cost approximately &euro;65m in 2016.  This figure does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p><p>The disability criteria for the tax concessions available under the scheme have changed over time.  When the scheme was first introduced in 1968, the legislation only allowed for one medical ground.  In 1989, four new medical grounds were added and in 1994, one new medical ground was added. </p><p>I recognize the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities.  The relief has been maintained at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  From time to time representations are received from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria.  While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  They do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices vary across the market and consumers are accordingly free to choose whatever product best meets their needs with price obviously being a relevant factor.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the other factor which is relevant to this matter is that insurance company&rsquo;s price in accordance with their own past claims experience, and this may be another reason why there is a limit on cover for bicycle insurance.</p></reply>

Many of these locations are of considerable interest as tourism destinations and attract significant volumes of both domestic and foreign visitors annually.  The provision of adequate car and coach parking facilities, and indeed visitor-facing infrastructure generally, to serve this tourism demand is therefore a priority at many locations. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the need to provide these facilities for visitors, it is also clear that the provision in particular of carparking has to be treated with considerable caution having regard to the aesthetic and landscape sensitivity of historic sites, the potential presence in many cases of underground archaeology and the general risks to fabric involved in bringing large volumes of visitors into close proximity with sometimes fragile buildings.  In certain cases, the provision of carparking within large formally designed historic landscapes can be at odds with the sensitive management of such locations and can only be located where they do not create an adverse visual impact.   Equally, at certain small rural sites where visitor numbers are not significant, the correct approach will be that no adjacent parking, or at most a single layby, is the appropriate response.</p>  <p>  No two sites are the same and each one poses unique challenges.  Accordingly OPW approaches any proposals to provide new or extended carpark facilities with some caution having regard to the impact these developments bring, the needs of heritage protection and a sustainable approach.

Public contract details, therefore, are held by the individual contracting authority concerned. </p>  <p>  This public procurement process is facilitated through the national eProcurement portal www.etenders.gov.ie which is managed by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP).</p>  <p>  The information requested by the Deputy will not be available within the time allowed.  An analysis of the tender notices published on eTenders is required in order to identify the procurement categories and locations requested.  The information will issue directly to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  In relation to the steps being taken to ensure SMEs can access a greater share of publicly advertised tenders by the government.  Public Procurement is governed by EU and National rules.  The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers the best value for money.  It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour particular candidates on grounds such as organisation size, locality, nationality etc., and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.   </p>  <p>  However, there is a recognition at EU Level of the need to promote and facilitate SME participation in public procurement.  The new EU Directives on Procurement, transposed into Irish law in May 2016, are intended to make it easier for businesses and SMEs to tender for public sector procurement contracts.  Measures specifically designed to improve access for SMEs and start-ups include:</p>  <p>  - financial capacity criterion is generally limited to twice contract value - there are no centrally imposed requirements for a minimum turnover.  Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority  concerned.  This is because the contracting authority is in the best  position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract.</p>  <p>  - discretion to divide public contracts  into lots, with the proviso that opting not to divide a contract into lots must be explained in the procurement documents or the report on the procurement process.</p>  <p>  - electronic methods of communication are mandated in parts of the tender process.</p>  <p>  - the introduction of the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD), a self-declaration form aimed at reducing red tape for suppliers </p>  <p>  - provision for &ldquo;consortia bidding&rdquo; may assist SMEs to participate in procurement procedures where they would not have the relevant capability or scale if they were to bid as sole tenderers </p>  <p>  - explicit provision for pre-market discussion with suppliers and independent experts, subject  to  safeguards against distorting competition or violating transparency and non-discrimination principles </p>  <p>  - reductions in the time limits for receipt of tenders by approximately 30% compared to the position under the 2006 Regulations </p>  <p>  - Member States are required to report back to the Commission every 3 years on SME participation in public procurement </p>  <p>  A number of these measures had been accelerated into policy in 2014 in advance of the transposition of the new Directives by Circular 10/14 - Initiatives to assist SMEs in Public Procurement - issued by the OGP. </p>  <p>  The reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.  The OGP works with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.  It does this by facilitating quarterly meetings of an SME Advisory Group, which have been chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for public procurement, so that the voice of Irish SMEs (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) can be heard by Government.  SMEs are also encouraged to register with the Government's eTenders portal so that they can be notified of upcoming tendering opportunities.</p>  <p>  The OGP works with the SME industry representative bodies as well as the Department of  Enterprise and Innovation, InterTrade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to promote the engagement of SMEs in public procurement.  Evidence of the work and co-operation in the area can be seen in events such as "Go-2-Tender" workshops and "Meet the Buyer" events.</p>  <p>  The data analysed by the OGP and published last September (2014 Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis Report) indicates that 95% of the State's expenditure is with firms within the State and the majority of spend analysed is with SMEs. </p>  <p>  The OGP will continue to proactively engage with business and strive to enhance the significant measures already in place to support SME access to public procurement opportunities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-28a.207.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062800078#WRE00700"><p>Under existing rules, all EU higher education students are treated the same as a national from the country in which they seek to study.  Depending upon the negotiated terms of Brexit there may be future implications for Irish students studying in the UK.  My Department is keeping this matter under constant review and it is my stated intention to seek to have the best outcome for our students. </p>  <p>  A principal concern of mine is to protect to the greatest extent possible student mobility between Ireland and Northern Ireland, the UK and within the EU and to support our strategy to increase non-EU student flows.  I am particularly concerned to facilitate the continued feasibility of the UK as an option for our further and higher education students.</p>  <p>  With such issues in mind a key part of my approach has been to engage on Brexit-related matters at political and institutional level.  I have met my counterparts Peter Weir and Simon Hamilton of the NI Executive, and recently met with the UK&rsquo;s Secretary of State for Education, Justine Greening.  I also met the former Minister of State for Exiting the EU, David Jones, the UK&rsquo;s Opposition Spokesperson on Brexit, Keir Starmer, as well as members of the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain.  I have also had meetings with Ministers from other EU Member States and with representatives of the EU Commission at which our priorities and concerns were raised.</p>  <p>  In relation to Irish students currently studying in Higher Education Institutions in the UK and those planning to do so in the coming years, the UK Government have outlined that the EU referendum outcome and the triggering of Article 50 will not lead to any immediate change to the immigration status of current EU students, including those that are on courses in this academic year (2016&ndash;17).  </p>  <p>  It has also been outlined in separate statements from across all UK nations (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) that current university students from the EU and those applying to courses starting in 2017&ndash;18 will not see any changes to their loan eligibility or tuition fee status.  This position will apply for the full duration of the course, even if the course finishes after the UK has left the EU.  For students looking to study in Scotland, this position has been extended to those enrolling for 2018&ndash;19.</p>  <p>  Separate statements from across all UK nations confirm that current EU students, including 2016&ndash;17 entrants, will remain eligible to receive loans and grants to fund their studies for the duration of their courses.</p>  <p>  EU students attending universities in England and Wales who are eligible under current rules to receive loans and grants from the Student Loans Company will continue to do so for the duration of courses they are currently enrolled on.  This has been confirmed by the Student Loans Company for England, and by Universities Wales for Wales. </p>  <p>  Under EU law, students from EU member states applying for undergraduate degrees at Scottish universities are currently eligible for free tuition.  For EU students attending a university in Scotland, the Scottish government and Universities Scotland have confirmed that there has been no change in current funding arrangements.  This means that eligible EU students already studying in Scotland, including those that commenced their studies the current academic year (2016&ndash;17) will continue to benefit from free tuition and, for those who meet the residency requirement, associated living cost support.</p>  <p>  In Northern Ireland, the Department for the Economy has issued a statement confirming that EU nationals who are currently receiving student loans from Student Finance Northern Ireland, including those that started courses last autumn (in the 2016&ndash;17 academic year) will continue to receive these loans and grants until they finish their course.</p>  <p>  The following is the position for EU students applying for a course starting in 2017&ndash;18:</p>  <p>  - In England: The Government has outlined that EU students applying to start a course in England in 2017&ndash;18 will continue to be eligible for tuition fee loans and for 'home' fee status for the duration of their study.</p>  <p>  - In Wales: The Education Secretary has announced that EU nationals who intend to begin studying in the academic year 2017&ndash;18 will also continue to receive financial support.</p>  <p>  - It has also been confirmed in a statement from the Scottish Government that students starting courses in 2017 at universities in Scotland will continue to receive free tuition and other support for the full duration of their course.</p>  <p>  - Similar announcements have been made in respect of EU students applying to universities in Northern Ireland.  Student Finance Northern Ireland has said that EU nationals currently in higher education and those who intend to begin studying from 2017 who are assessed as eligible to receive  loans and/or grants, will continue to receive these until they finish  their course. </p>  <p>   EU students applying for a PhD starting in 2017-18:</p>  <p>  It has been confirmed by the UK Government that EU nationals starting courses in the next academic year (2017-18) will continue to be eligible for Research Council PhD studentships to help fund their studies for the full duration of their course.  This will be the case even if the course finishes after the UK has left the European Union.</p>  <p>  The foregoing is the most up-to-date information available to my Department in relation to the implications of Brexit on EU Students (including Irish students) currently studying or wishing to study in Higher Education Institutions in the UK in the coming years.</p>  <p>  However, to ensure the utmost clarity for each individual student, I would advise all prospective Irish and other EU students to contact the higher education institution they are planning to apply to, or which they are already attending, in order to absolutely confirm its policy with regard to fees and tuition support for 2017-2018 and into the future.</p>  <p>  My Department, as with all Government Departments, is continuing to engage with these matters and to plan for scenarios that might arise out of the EU-UK Brexit discussions.  We will continue to contribute to the EU preparations for negotiations and to assist with those negotiations to the greatest extent possible.  This includes engaging on education-related aspects of the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK and the issues identified in the EU Guidelines recently published that set out the priorities for the negotiations for the EU.</p></reply>

This review was undertaken in 2016. </p>  <p>  This comes on top of existing requirements, which include a requirement that all HEIs submit Annual Accounts, an Annual Governance Statement and Statement of Internal Control to the HEA and that each HEI signs a financial memorandum with the HEA each year that outlines the ongoing responsibilities of the institution in relation to financial reporting.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills and the HEA are considering whether any additional measures may be necessary to further strengthen governance in the future. </p></reply>

The HEA allocates this funding as a block grant to the institutions.  As autonomous bodies, the internal disbursement of this funding, along with any funding it receives from private sources, is a matter for the individual institution.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides a range of services for students in HEA funded higher education institutions, including supports provided by Access Offices.  In particular these offices co-ordinate pastoral and academic supports for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Among the supports administered by the access offices, in conjunction with student services is the Student Assistance Fund.</p>  <p>  The Student Assistance Fund is managed by the HEA on behalf of my Department.  The Fund is allocated annually to the universities, the institutes of technology, the colleges of education and a number of other higher education institutions.  The objective of the Fund is to provide financial assistance to full-time undergraduate or postgraduate students in need of such support.  The Fund is intended to support students whose participation in higher education would otherwise be at risk as a direct result of financial difficulties.</p>  <p>  The Fund is designed to support students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds with on-going needs for financial support and students with other circumstances giving rise to short or longer-term financial difficulties, including family responsibilities, bereavement, family difficulties, accidents or health problems.  In all cases, institutions are responsible for targeting the available resources at those students most in need.</p>  <p>  Student services and associated activities are an integral part of the whole student experience at third level.  Student services support each individual student achieve his/her intellectual, cultural and social potential while supporting and complementing the formal academic programme.  Student services can fall under a number of headings, particularly &lsquo;Welfare and Guidance&rsquo; which includes counselling services, health promotion, careers service, multi-faith, racial and ethnic cultural support.</p>  <p>  AHEAD, the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability is an independent non-profit organisation working to promote full access to and participation in further and higher education for students with disabilities and to enhance their employment prospects on graduation.</p>  <p>  The HEA supports AHEAD with an annual grant towards the cost of the activities of the organisation.  In 2016, AHEAD, in partnership with the National Learning Network (NLN), published a report called &lsquo;Mental Health Matters&rsquo;.  This report is a study into the experiences of students with mental health difficulties in higher education in Ireland and a mapping of best practices in supporting these students.  The report found that the majority of HEIs have services supporting students with mental health difficulties and some institutions have dedicated services for students.  It also found that students were generally positive about their experience of these services.  Some key recommendations from the report were: </p>  <p>  - A whole of campus strategic response is required to meet the needs of students with mental health difficulties.</p>  <p>  - The promotion of mental health awareness should be as part of induction for students.</p>  <p>  - The provision of mental health awareness training at an institutional level for academic and all other staff including part-time/adjunct staff.</p>  <p>  - A move towards a flexible approach to teaching across programmes to bring greater flexibility to learning and assessment to improve access for all students. </p>  <p>  Implementation of recommendations is being progressed by AHEAD and partners and a follow-on conference/seminar is planned for later this year.</p>  <p>  Fund for Students with Disabilities </p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities allocates funding to further and higher education colleges for the provision of services and supports to full-time students with disabilities from PLC up to doctoral level.  The Fund aims to ensure that students can participate fully in their academic programmes and are not disadvantaged by reason of a disability.  It also supports students from Ireland to study on approved courses in in Northern Ireland, the UK and other EU countries.  </p>  <p>  The total allocated under the FSD in 2015-16 was &euro;10.4m.  There were a total of 10,486 students supported under the fund. </p>  <p>  Beneficiaries of the Fund for 2015-16 with a mental health condition were as follows: </p>  <p>  - 91 out of 1362 total students in Further Education and </p>  <p>  - 956 out of a total of 8920 students in Higher Education. </p></reply>

This will benefit approximately 1,100 post graduate students who meet the eligibility criteria for the special rate of maintenance grant.</p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme is now open for applications for the 2017/18 academic year.  This earlier opening date will facilitate earlier decisions for students on their grant applications and therefore provide students with greater certainty about the financial support that will be available to them. </p>  <p>  In addition to this specific measure targeted at postgraduate students, I also secured an additional &euro;4.5 million in Budget 2017 for other new access measures that will benefit target groups such as lone parents, travellers, mature students, and students with disabilities. </p>  <p>  The new measures being introduced as a result of Budget 2017 will complement the existing student supports that are already in place.  In total my Department will invest approximately &euro;450 million in access supports in the 2017/18 academic year.

The 2017 scheme includes an amendment to the income threshold for the special rate of grant which has increased from &euro;22,703 to &euro;23,000.  This change reflects the recent budget increases to the Old Age Contributory Pension and ensures that qualifying families dependent on welfare, will continue to qualify for the highest grant support possible.</p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children.  In 2017, the highest income threshold for a family of less than 4 dependent children, is &euro;54,240.  In addition to this and in recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may be increased by a further &euro;4,980 for each additional family member attending college at the same time.</p>  <p>  The income thresholds and rates of maintenance grant under the Student Grant Scheme are announced annually as part of the Budget process.  No changes to the rates or thresholds were included in Budget 2017.  However, in line with the Programme for Government commitment, provision was made to reintroduce maintenance grants for the most disadvantaged postgraduate students.</p></reply>

As part of Budget 2014, SOLAS have ceased making payments to Institutes of Technology (IoTs) and apprentices pay the full pro rata Annual Student Contribution.  These arrangements mean that apprentices are treated the same, on a pro rata basis for the proportion of a full academic year they spend in IoTs, as full time students in terms of the annual student contribution.  Typically an apprenticeship block is one third of an academic year, meaning that most apprentices pay &euro;1,000 (one third of the full ASC of &euro;3,000) as their ASC for that period.</p>  <p>  However, unlike full time students, apprentices are paid a training allowance by SOLAS for phases of their training spent in IoTs.  This allowance ranges from &euro;293 to &euro;647 per week depending on the trade and phase of the apprenticeship programme.  This is the equivalent to their net take-home pay on the job, and is not subject to tax or PRSI.  Such allowances are not available to students in the IoTs.</p></reply>

The Teachers Conciliation Council is part of the scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for Teachers and was set up to deal with claims and proposals relating to the Terms and Conditions of employment of teachers.  The Council is composed of representatives of teachers, school management, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  The Teacher Exchange scheme is open to primary teachers who are registered with the Teaching Council, have completed probation and who wish to exchange their posts for educational purposes.  Educational purposes would include enabling teachers in primary schools to gain experience of teaching in different types of settings.  The concept is that teachers will gain a different experience, enrich their knowledge and understanding of their professional work and share this understanding with colleagues.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Circular the minimum period for which an exchange may occur is one year and the maximum is five years. </p>  <p>  In 2016 the scheme was reviewed under the auspices of Teachers Conciliation Council and to facilitate this review the maximum period for which an exchange may occur was extended to allow applicants a sixth year of exchange in the school year 2016/17.  Following a request from teacher representatives that a voluntary transfer scheme for Primary Teachers be considered it was decided to extend the maximum period for which an exchange may occur for one further year.  Therefore the period for which an exchange may occur for those teachers in their fifth or sixth year of exchange was extended for one further year subject to other provisions of the circular being complied with, i.e. application by the teacher to his/her Board of management and the approval of the Board of Management being obtained. </p>  <p>  The proposal for a voluntary transfer scheme is currently under consideration in my Department.</p>  <p>  The number of teachers who availed of the teacher exchange scheme in the school year 2016/17 is 232 of which 10 are in their sixth year of exchange.</p></reply>

They include the likely impact of such a move on the peace process, the possible value of recognition as a symbolic gesture, the likely impact on other initiatives and perception by other actors, and the likely effect on Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing influence on the issue.  In addition, should I decide to recommend early recognition to the Government, then as an essentially symbolic action the timing of such a move would also be a matter of careful judgement.</p>  <p>  I will be carefully considering all these factors in the coming period.

It also inherently involves violations of the rights of the occupied population, in terms of seizure of land, discriminatory treatment and other restrictions.  The same wide range of tactics are also used by the Israeli authorities to advance this process under a cloak of legality, including planning laws, zoning, military use, national parks etc.  None of these measures can alter the fact that the whole process is illegal.</p>  <p>  The Government has consistently and repeatedly conveyed these concerns to the Israeli authorities, and highlighted them in our interventions at EU, UN and international level.  I will continue to avail of every appropriate opportunity to pursue these issues.  It is beyond the means of my Department, however, to attempt to track and take action on every report of specific decisions involved in this process.</p>  <p>  Our concerns over these policies are most acute in relation to the West Bank, where they are making impossible the achievement of a peace agreement and the establishment of a Palestinian state.  By contrast, it is generally acknowledged that any comprehensive peace between Israel and the Arab states will involve the return of the Golan area to Syria.</p>  <p>  My primary focus in relation to Syria at present is of course on the appalling violence, destruction and slaughter afflicting the Syrian people across much of the rest of the country.</p></reply>

The amendment means that community sports clubs are now only liable for rates on buildings or part of buildings that are used for the generation of income.  The position now is that buildings that are used for the sale of alcohol or food, retail outlets etc. will be rated but buildings that are used purely for community sport will be exempt such as team dressing rooms, referees room, administrative offices and machine and equipment stores.  This change in the legislation was widely welcomed as it has brought greater equity and clarity to the sporting sector.</p>  <p>  Regarding the treatment of other community organisations under the valuation legislation, the position is that Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act, 2001 also provides for the exemption from rates of community halls which are used by community-based and not for profit organisations such as theatre and drama groups.  To be classified as a Community Hall, the premises needs to be used for purposes which are not for profit or gain and involve participation by inhabitants of the locality generally and are used for purposes which are of a recreational or otherwise of a social nature. </p>  <p>  As the existing exemption provisions cover all qualifying community organisations, it is considered that a change in the legislation to provide for further exemptions is not warranted at this time. </p></reply>

Part 4 of the Act makes provision for the operation of the Garda Diversion Programme under the general superintendence and control of the Garda Commissioner.  The aim of the Diversion Programme is to divert any child who accepts responsibility for his or her criminal or anti-social behaviour from committing further offences, or engaging in further anti-social behaviour, primarily by administering a caution to such a  child and, where appropriate, by placing him or her under the supervision of a juvenile liaison officer.  </p><p>To support the operation of the Diversion Programme, my Department, through the Irish Youth Justice Service, funds some 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects around the country.  These projects are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people who have become involved in criminal or anti-social behaviour.  In 2016, some &euro;12m was allocated by the Irish Youth Justice Service to Garda Youth Diversion Projects and a number of other youth justice community based projects around the country.  Similar monies will be expended in 2017.  In addition, monies secured from the Dormant Accounts Fund supported the establishment of ten new projects in the period 2015/2016.</p><p>A table setting out the number of Garda Youth Diversion Projects by county in each of the years 2015 and 2016 and to date in 2017 follows.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>33</td><td>36</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>99</td><td>106</td><td>105</td></tr></table></p></reply>

I am assured by the Commissioner that Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with the overall policing arrangements and operational strategies are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of resources and the best possible policing service is provided to the general public. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>This plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that just under 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division. </p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the following table, as provided by the Commissioner, the number of new Garda recruits assigned to each Garda Division from 2015 to date in 2017.</p><p><b>Number of newly  attested Garda allocated</b><table><tr><th>DIVISION</th><th>DIVISIONAL HQ</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017<br /><br />(to date)</th></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.

The HSE Mental Health Division has prioritised the provision of seven-day services as a key priority for 2017.  </p>  <p>  The HSE Mental Health Division&rsquo;s first priority is to ensure that all areas provide access to a weekend service for people currently attending the service.  In recognition of this, it set up a Service Improvement Project with a dedicated Project Manager resource in November 2016. </p>  <p>  This project is focused on a more detailed mapping of current provision at weekends and extended hours including uptake of the service.</p>  <p>  The HSE Mental Health Division is also examining other options such as a phone helpline for people who are attending or have attended the Specialist Mental Health Services in the past.  This would enable people in need of advice to obtain this immediately from a mental health professional. </p>  <p>  In March 2017, HSE presented proposals for the extension of seven day Mental Health services coverage to Minister McEntee.  This included identification of gaps in the current service.  HSE advised that the extension would take the form of extra staff being added to existing Mental Health teams to facilitate increased out-of-hours coverage.  This plan is currently being finalised.</p>  <p>  From 2012 to 2016, around &euro;115 million was added to the HSE Mental Health Budget.  This is a significant increase and the Government is strongly committed to further increasing our mental health budget annually, as resources allow, to expand existing services.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 made allowance for an additional &euro;35 million for services to be initiated in 2017.  Key priorities to be addressed in the HSE's 2017 Service Plan include youth mental health, further improvement to CAMHs and adult services, older people's mental health services and further enhanced out-of-hours response for those in need of urgent services.  Recognising the time lag in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services, it is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with this increased allocation will be &euro;15 million.  There will also be a further additional spend of &euro;9.5 million in mental health associated with increased pay rates, bringing the total budget to over &euro;850 million.</p></reply>

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.</p><p>In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services.  The Inpatient/Daycase and Outpatient Plans<font color="#001FE2"> </font>which<font color="#001FE2"> </font>have now been published and are currently being implemented<font color="#001FE2">, </font>focus on reducing as much as possible within existing resources the number of patients waiting 15 months or more for inpatient and daycase treatment or outpatient appointment by the end of October.  The Scoliosis Action Plan aims to ensure that no patient who requires scoliosis surgery will be waiting more than four months for surgery by the end of 2017.</p><p>Under these Plans, since early February, over 14,700 patients have come off the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List, nearly 52,000 patients have come off the Outpatient Waiting List<font color="#FF0000"> </font>and 136 scoliosis<font color="#FF0000"> </font>surgeries have taken place.  </p><p>In addition, the NTPF has advised that under the ongoing Daycase Waiting List Initiative over 2,700 patients files have been transferred to private hospitals under this Initiative, over 750 patients have accepted an offer of treatment in a private hospital and that 230 patients have received their procedure.</p><p>In addition, in November 2016, the HSE launched the Strategy for the Design of Integrated Outpatient Services 2016-2020.  This strategy seeks to improve waiting times for outpatient services in the long term by restructuring referral pathways and utilising technology to improve service delivery.</p></reply>

It is important to note that the Act will not establish the location of the Supervised Injecting Facility (SIF).  However, it is envisaged that the first such facility would be established in Dublin city centre, where there is a significant, recognised problem of public injecting.  In line with the experience in other countries which have established such facilities, it is expected that the location will be carefully selected to address, most effectively, the requirements and concerns of the service users and the wider community.</p>  <p>  The HSE has been tasked with establishing the SIF in 2017 and has established a working group to gather data, consider possible options and to undertake public consultation before any decision is made on a specific location.  Local stakeholder engagement and consultation will be critical to the success of any pilot facility.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that it will cost in the region of &euro;1.5m a year to run the SIF.  The HSE has been allocated &euro;750,000 in 2017 to set up the facility before the end of the current year. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health has been informed that the HSE working group will make recommendations on programme design and governance structures to the HSE Social Inclusion Governance Group (SIGG) to inform an appropriate procurement process.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Committee has discussed overdose cases identified by Emergency Departments where Fentanyl has been mixed with or mistaken for other opioids, such as heroin.</p>  <p>  Another key mechanism is the HSE public alert system for adverse events due to drugs.  The HSE remains vigilant for the possibility of Fentanyl entering circulation in Ireland.  I am informed that the HSE last issued an alert for Fentanyl on 28 July 2016, arising from a number of drug-related deaths in Dublin and Cork.

The opportunity presented by this fund may allow forest owners to invest this revenue in other parts of their farm or to invest in other non-farm activities. </p>  <p>  Another option for forest owners is to hold onto their woodland and manage it themselves.  This option is also being promoted by my Department where &euro;250,000 has been allocated in 2017 to a pilot project to test the feasibility of Knowledge Transfer Groups(KTG) for forestry.  The aim of this initiative, which is already underway, is to empower forest owners with the knowledge to become forest managers.  Furthermore, in November 2016 my Department signed a contract to develop a forest management template to help forest owners achieve certification for their forests.  For many forest owners, the KTG and certification projects will help make the option of retaining ownership and managing their own forests an attractive option to consider.</p></reply>

Within this mix of options, grants and premiums are deliberately favoured towards broadleaves.  For example, the native woodland categories receive the highest level of grant and premium available. </p>  <p>   Within areas planted with Sitka spruce (typically under Grant and Premium Category 3(GPC3)), various rules apply to mitigate any environmental impact and promote positive attributes.  For example, such areas require a 10% additional broadleaf requirement, whereby native trees are positioned alongside public roads, along water setbacks and visible landscape edges, to soften any negative impact.  Afforestation within GPC3 is subject to adherence to a wide range of measures, ranging from checks regarding protected habitats and species, to required setbacks along public roads, dwellings, watercourses and archaeological sites, to requirements regarding drainage and cultivation, fertiliser application, to contingency planning. </p>  <p>  In addition, any application for planting under GPC3 is subject to the requirements under the Forestry Regulations SI191 of 2017, whereby a full assessment is required by the Forest Service.  This assessment includes evaluation by a professional forester, referral to third parties such as NPWS, Inland Fisheries Ireland and local authorities, the application of Appropriate Assessment and EIA screening, and public consultation.  The Forest Service can also seek further information if this is needed to enable the assessment process to proceed.  Other procedures and requirements, such as the Land Types for Afforestation system, the Acid Sensitivity Protocol and the Freshwater Pearl Mussel Requirements, also apply.  </p>  <p>  These and other measures ensure that any afforestation, including that with sitka spruce, is undertaken in a way compatible with the protection of the environment.  Given the improvements made to rules governing the establishment of new forests following the introduction of the new environmental requirements my Department does not envisage setting limits to the planting of Sitka spruce.</p></reply>

Section 7 provides for the attachment and varying of conditions to a licence or approval and also for the revocation of a licence. Sections 26-29 set out a range of penalties that can be imposed.  These sections of the Act provide flexibility to the Minister in terms of attaching environmental conditions to an approval or licence and enforcing those conditions. </p>  <p>  Together, the above provisions are designed to integrate the protection of the environment and legal requirements under various relevant Directives and transposing legislation, into the central decision-making process regarding licences, approvals and grants by the Department.  This is reflected in the scope of the Act, as follows; &ldquo;.... to make further and better provision in relation to forestry, to provide for the development and promotion of forestry in a manner that maximises the economic, environmental and social value of forests within the principles of sustainable forest management,....&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  In this context, the new Environmental Requirements for Afforestation document was introduced in December 2016.  This document consolidated relevant environmental safeguards into a single coherent document dealing exclusively with afforestation, taking onboard more recent developments in relation to regulation, research and changes in forest practices.  This document includes specific measures to ensure the protection of water quality when establishing new forests such as the introduction of new water features requiring setbacks. </p>  <p>  The commitment of my Department to protecting and enhancing water quality and aquatic life is demonstrated by: (i) its operation of the Native Woodland Scheme, which includes a strong focus on the use of native woodland, both new and existing, in this regard; (ii) the Woodland for Water model; and (iii) the Felling and Reforestation Policy, which sets out measures that are available to ensure that forests are appropriately restructured post-clearfell, to reflect water and other environmental sensitivities on-the-ground.</p></reply>

Where specific environmental considerations are identified, the application is simultaneously referred to one or more statutory consultees, primarily the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), Inland Fisheries Ireland, the relevant Local Authority and An Taisce.  Comments submitted by statutory consultees are subsequently considered by the Forest Service of my Department when making a decision regarding whether or not to seek further information, to approve the application (typically with specific conditions), or to refuse it.  Furthermore, under the European Union Guidelines for State aid in the agricultural and forestry sectors and in rural areas,<b></b>afforestation applications in NATURA 2000 sites must be agreed with the relevant authority - in Ireland this is the NPWS.</p><p>Apart from consultation with statutory consultees, the licensing process regarding the establishment of any new forest is subject to other rigorous checks and balances and undergoes careful planning and assessment by professional foresters.  For example, the Forest Service implements Appropriate Assessment Screening, as required under the Habitats Directive, to consider if a new afforestation application has the potential to significantly impact on a qualifying interest of a NATURA site (i.e. an SAC or SPA).  Where there is a possibility of this, or where uncertainty exists, the Forest Service seeks a NATURA Impact Statement and subsequently undertakes Appropriate Assessment, to either rule out the potential of a significant impact, or to identify appropriate mitigation measures that will eliminate any risk.</p><p>Notice of all applications for afforestation is placed on my Department&rsquo;s website, showing townland, area of the site, etc.  In addition, site notices are now required at the proposed entrance to the site in accordance with the new Forestry Act, and submissions from members of the public are considered during the decision-making process.</p><p>Furthermore, all new forests must be established in compliance with national and EU legislation and the Department&rsquo;s requirements as set out in the Forestry Standards Manual, Scheme Documents, Code of Best Practice &ndash; Ireland and the suite of environmental guidelines, including the new Environmental Requirements for Afforestation.  Other procedures, such as sub-threshold EIA screening, the Acid Sensitivity Protocol and the Forestry and Freshwater Pearl Mussel Requirements, also apply.  Only projects which receive prior written approval from the Department in line with Statutory Instrument No. 191 of 2017, and in compliance with sustainable forest management, can proceed to planting.</p><p>My Department considers its existing consultation process, both with the public and with statutory consultees, to be wide-ranging and robust.  Given the level of consultation that currently exists with An Taisce, Inland Fisheries Ireland and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, my Department does not consider any additional oversight by these bodies to be necessary.</p></reply>

In finalising its Code, the BAI included the principle that all children&rsquo;s commercial communications for fast food products, outlets and/or brands must display an acoustic or visual message stating &lsquo;should be eaten in moderation and as part of a balanced diet'. </p>  <p>  This Code makes specific provision for rules regarding the advertisement of foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) and is scheduled for review over the next 12 to18 months.  It is my understanding that the BAI intends undertaking research as part of the review and will have regard to the experience in Ireland since the Code&rsquo;s introduction.  As part of the review process, the BAI will also consider regulatory practices in other jurisdictions and plans to consult extensively with relevant stakeholders including the Department of Health, who have primary responsibility for promoting WHO protocols. </p>  <p>  In addition, the BAI participated in a working group, established by the Minister for Health in 2015, to develop rules for marketing communications for food including HFSS on digital media.  The working group has now concluded and a draft code has been submitted to the Department of Health for consideration. </p></reply>

Transport Infrastructure Ireland have developed guidelines for Rural Cycle Scheme Design: these guidelines also reference Greenways.  Projects funded by this Department must comply with these guidelines, or in the case of urban based greenways, with the Cycle Manual and the Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets (DMURS).  These designs include a requirement to have the gradient of the Greenway limited to 5% and are thus suitable for cyclists but also make for very attractive walking routes.</p>  <p>  The experience on completed Greenways is that near towns and villages pedestrians significantly outnumber cyclists, by up to a factor of 2 to 1, whilst on the more remote sections these figures reverse and cyclists outnumber pedestrians to the same degree.  The great strengths of Greenways are that they are multi-functional and provide access for all. Most Greenways are suitable for those in wheelchairs and pushing buggies and prams.</p>  <p>  Signage on both the Waterford Greenway and the Old Rail Trail in County Westmeath has a code of conduct for all users that should be heeded.  The importance of sharing the route with all users is emphasised and use of a bell by cyclists to alert pedestrians to their presence is recommended.  Experience to date has been very positive for all users.</p>  <p>  The public consultation document on Greenways is currently live and I would hope the Deputy will submit his thoughts before the closing date of July 14th.  The consultation paper is available on my Department's website.  We are interested in receiving a wide input of views from the public and interested parties in order to inform the development of future strategy in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

Funding of &euro;2.6bn has been prioritised for essential 'steady state' maintenance and asset renewal of the public transport network and &euro;4.4bn is earmarked for essential maintenance and strengthening works on the road network.  A further &euro;600m in the Capital Plan relates to  PPP projects and &euro;860m is targeted at progressing a limited number of new roads projects.  The remaining &euro;1bn of the total allocation available for public transport is being invested to help address growing congestion driven by the recovery and population growth.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, a mid-term review of the Capital Plan has been initiated and I will be making the case for increased funding for land transport in that context.  In addition, the role of heavy rail in Ireland's transport sector is currently under review.  As noted within the <i>Rail Review Report</i>, its analysis predates the finalisation of the National Planning Framework which is being developed at present under the leadership of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It is obvious that, once agreed by Government, the approach which that Framework adopts toward land-use planning and settlement patterns for the country will have significant impacts on the potential of rail and other transport infrastructure and services into the future.  I look forward to the finalisation and adoption by Government in the coming months of the new National Planning Framework, which I believe will form an important context for my consideration of  issues raised by the <i>Rail Review Report </i>and any recommendations I will bring to Government in this regard.</p></reply>

The level of engagement involved will be determined for each child and family by the needs identified in each case.  It is not possible to provide a complete overview of all of the engagements between Tusla and children as this can be a once off or short term engagement or may involve a more sustained and targeted service for the child.  Tusla regularly publishes performance and activity data about its services.  However, this data is indicative of the use of these services only and is not intended to reflect all possible engagements that Tusla undertakes as part of its broad remit.</p>  <p>  Tusla's  Child Welfare and Protection Services  provide an example.  In  March 2017, Tusla reported that there were 25,384 open cases, where each case represents a child in receipt of social work services.  This number does not capture engagements with all referrals to Tusla of child welfare and protection concerns, of which there were 47,399 during 2016.  Referrals are the subject of a preliminary enquiry and/or an initial assessment and in many instances this will involve engagement with a child and their family through, for example, family supports.  In addition, Tusla provides a range of services which may involve working with children and families, including  domestic violence services, adoption services, Education Welfare Services and Family Support Services.  Data on a range of service performance indicators is available on Tusla's website (www.tusla.ie) and are published on a monthly, quarterly and annual  basis. </p></reply>

Expansion of ECCE was also given significant consideration by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare which reported in July 2015.  Senior officials from the Department of Education and Skills contributed to the discussions on an upper age limit for the scheme, taking a child centred approach.</p>  <p>  The initial Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme had one entry point (September) from when children could begin pre-school, and children had to be aged between 3 years and 2 months and 4 years and 7 months by the September to avail of the free pre-school year (i.e. 38 weeks).  The programme was then expanded beginning in September 2016 by reducing the age of eligibility to 3 years and by increasing the number of entry points to three throughout the programme year (September, January and April).  This means that children can begin to avail of their free place on the pre-school programme as soon as possible after they reach the age of 3.  </p>  <p>  The upper age limit for the free pre-school programme is set at 5 years and 6 months, meaning that if a child is going to be older than 5 years and 6 months at the end of a pre-school year (i.e. end of June) they are not eligible to avail of free pre-school in that year.  This upper age limit was set in consultation with the Early Years Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills to comply with legislation relating to the age range of children beginning primary school and to ensure that children transition into primary school with their peers.  Therefore the maximum number of free pre-school weeks to which a child is entitled depends on their date of birth, and the age at which they start primary school.  On average, children will benefit from 61 weeks, a significant increase on the previous provision of 38 weeks.  It is estimated that access to the average 61 weeks of ECCE reduces the cost of childcare by &euro;4,000 per child. </p>  <p>  The eligibility for ECCE from age three using multiple entry points was also a recommendation in Right from the Start, the Report of the Expert Advisory Group on the Early Years Strategy, published in 2013.  The objective of this recommendation was to ensure that all children could access free pre-school from as near as possible after their third birthday until they started primary school.  This would ensure that children and families had access to care and education in these formative years. </p>  <p>  My Department does its best to ensure, in so far as is possible, the equitable treatment of all children and families who apply for childcare funding under the ECCE Programme.  In order to ensure objectivity and fairness it is essential that clear rules exist for the scheme and that they are applied in a fair manner.  The rules for all the Department&rsquo;s childcare schemes are clearly published to ensure transparency and consistent application.  An essential component of the scheme&rsquo;s rules is an eligibility date to ensure that the scheme can be administered and budgeted for in an appropriate manner.</p></reply>

The most common situation is where a minor has been awarded substantial damages by a court and has special housing or care needs.  If a house is being purchased from his funds, the house must be registered in his own name and it is necessary for him to be taken into wardship so that the legal formalities on his behalf in this regard can be complied with.</p>  <p>  Neither my Department nor Tusla has a role with Wards of Court, who are the responsibility of the Courts Service.  If a child or young person in the care of the State is a Ward of Court he or she receives services and supports based on the Statutory Care Plan developed following an assessment of needs, carried out  on coming into care and reviewed in accordance with the Child Care Regulations 1995.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be referring to children who are the subject of a Care Order, sought by the Child and Family Agency under Section 18 of  the Child Care Act, 1991.  Tusla has this information in relation to each individual child to whom it applies but does not collate the figures at a national level.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to know that Ireland has a high level of stability of placement for children in care and compares well with neighbouring countries.  Latest figures available on placement stability show that in December 2015, 132 children in care were in their third placement or higher during the previous 12 months.  This represents 2% of the overall number of children in care.

This figure has risen every year since and now stands at just under 36,000, with 60% of parents also getting carers allowance in respect of their child.  All parents in receipt of DCA also receive the annual carers support grant in June each year.  Recently, eligibility to the medical card was extended to all children in receipt of the allowance.</p>  <p>  A review of the operation of the DCA scheme was undertaken in 2012, and lead to the introduction of a revised application process with a revised application form which has increased the percentage of applications that are awarded initially to over 75%, significantly more than before the application processes were revised in 2013.  Eligibility can be more easily established if the application form is fully completed and any supporting documentation is provided with the initial application.  The numbers of applications referred to the Social Welfare Appeals Office has reduced in recent years and while the percentage allowed on appeal is significant, this is due in many cases to new information being presented at appeal which was not previously available. </p>  <p>  Processing times for DCA are currently not meeting the target of having 70% of applications processed within 15 weeks.  Currently it is taking up to 18 weeks on average to finalise an application.  This is due to a number of factors.  </p>  <p>  First, there has been a significant increase in the volume of applications.  The numbers applying for DCA have doubled since 2010, when the Department took over administration of the scheme from the HSE.  The increase in volume over recent years has been consistently in the 15-20% range per annum.</p>  <p>  Secondly, following a high court ruling in 2016, there is now a need for the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors to provide the deciding officer with a more detailed opinion on the child&rsquo;s eligibility for the scheme and for the deciding officer in turn to provide more detailed reasons for their decision when communicating this to the customer.  These factors have resulted in the time taken to finalise applications increasing significantly and as a result the numbers being processed have reduced and the timescale to finalise each application has increased.</p>  <p>  In response to the current situation, additional deciding officers are being assigned to the scheme and will take up their positions shortly.  Once these extra resources are in situ and operational, the extra processing capacity should allow for an improvement in processing times. </p>  <p>  This matter is being kept under ongoing review.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In November 2014 the Board of the Citizens Information Board decided to restructure the CIB/MABS networks.  In October 2016 the Board decided that the new structure should be regionally based.

This is similar to other EU and OECD jurisdictions where such measures feature.</p>  <p>  These measures were introduced to protect young people from welfare dependency by providing young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  Should a young jobseeker on a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment participate on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.  This rate will be further increased to &euro;193 per week from September 2017.  In addition, recipients of jobseekers allowance under 26 years of age   who have dependent children are not subject to the reduced rates.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring my Department identifies effective measures to incentivise and support young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  The best way to do this is through engagement processes and by incentivising them to avail of educational and training opportunities, thereby enhancing their employment prospects.  </p>  <p>  The CSO&rsquo;s latest monthly unemployment figures report that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for persons aged 15-24 years was 11.7% in May 2017.  This is a decrease of 3.3 percentage points, from 15% in May 2016.</p>  <p>  With effect from March, rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s payments were increased for claimants of all ages as a result of measures introduced in Budget 2017.  I have no plans for any further increases in rates at present.  Any such changes could only be considered in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

In this context, my Department intends to consult with local authorities and other key stakeholders in the coming weeks, as part of the broader review process.</p>  <p>  At a strategic level, under the new 20-year National Planning Framework, there will be an emphasis on managing and utilising State lands to deliver housing and to ensure an active and healthy market for development land.  In this regard, an important policy intervention in the delivery of new housing supply under Pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland is the development of State-owned lands for mixed-tenure housing, particularly in the major urban areas, where demand is greatest.  On 27 April 2017, details of some 2,000 hectares of land in public ownership were published, with the potential to deliver up to 50,000 homes nationally.  In practical terms, the development of sites such as these will mean accelerating social housing delivery and securing more homes for sale and rent at lower and more affordable price points.</p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland also commits to the introduction of an affordable rental scheme to enhance the provision of affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  As set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector, this commitment is now to be progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones.  Lands held by local authorities in such zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, and in particular targeting middle-income households, in mixed-tenure developments.</p>  <p>  The question of the criteria to apply to determine eligibility for affordable units is currently under consideration.</p></reply>

Section 8(4) of the Building Control Act 1990 provides that a Building Control Authority may serve an Enforcement Notice requiring that such steps as are necessary to ensure compliance with the Building Regulations, including Part B - Fire Safety, be taken within a specified period.  An Enforcement Notice may be served at any time up to five years from the completion of the Building Works.  Under the Building Control Regulations, Building Control Authorities are required to maintain a register of any enforcement notices served by them, including brief particulars of the contents of the notice, which must be made available for public inspection. </p>  <p>  Under the Fire Services Acts of 1981 and 2003 local authorities are designated as fire authorities in their respective functional areas and have extensive statutory powers of inspection and enforcement.  Section 20 of the Act provides that the appropriate fire authority may serve a Fire Safety Notice on the owner or occupier of any building which appears to the authority to be a potentially dangerous building.  Section 20 of the Act provides that a Fire Safety Notice in relation to a building may prohibit the use of the building, or a specified part of the building, unless or until specified precautions are taken to the satisfaction of the fire authority.</p>  <p>  In response to the tragic fire in Grenfell Tower, the immediate focus of attention has been on life safety issues.  In that context, I requested that each local authority, as a matter of urgency, review their multi-storey social housing units to ensure that all early warning systems, including alarm and detection systems and means of escape including corridors, stairways and emergency exits are in place and fully functional. </p>  <p>  In order to raise awareness amongst private landlords, including landlords of households in receipt of social housing supports and rental assistance, the Residential Tenancies Board has been asked to remind all landlords of their statutory responsibilities and obligations as landlords to ensure that their properties fully comply with fire safety requirements.  The RTB placed a notice to this effect on its website and will be writing  individually to all registered landlords providing detailed information in the coming days.</p>  <p>  A Building Control Management System (BCMS) alert was issued to all registered users of the BCMS to remind those involved in works to existing or new buildings of the need to remain vigilant in relation to compliance with the Building Regulations and in particular to Part B Fire Safety.  It was issued to 57,000 registered users including builders, assigned certifiers, designers and owners.</p>  <p>  I also met with Dublin&rsquo;s Chief Fire Officer to discuss fire safety and life safety issues in light of the London tragedy.  I also requested that the management board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) convene and assess the readiness of the fire authorities to respond to emergencies.  In response to this request, the NDFEM Board has confirmed to me that the recent report of the Directorate&rsquo;s External Validation group found that the public are well served by the developed arrangements in place for fire services in Ireland, and concluded that the available evidence provides for confidence regarding the capability of fire services to respond to emergencies.  A further meeting with all of the national Chief Fire Officers will be convened shortly. </p>  <p>  I have  tasked the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management with co-ordinating a high-level Task Force to lead Ireland&rsquo;s re-appraisal of fire safety in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire.  The further issues to be considered, in addition to those outlined above, include: </p>  <p>  - The preliminary survey of the use of cladding products on residential buildings over 18m (6 storeys) being undertaken by fire services in Dublin is to be extended to the rest of the country and to cover buildings in all categories over 18m in height.  The results to be reported to my Department by 19 July.  </p>  <p>  - My Department is to meet with the local authority Chief Fire Officers in the coming weeks to review current activities and to plan for further fire safety initiatives in prioritised areas of action.</p>  <p>  - Responsibility for fire safety in buildings of all kinds (other than dwellings) is placed by Section 18 (2) of the Fire Services Act 1981 on the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; of each building.  In order to assist those in both the public and private sector who hold this responsibility, consideration is being given to the publication of a guide on undertaking Fire Safety Assessments as provided for in Section 18 (6)(a) of the Act.  This will facilitate persons having control of buildings to demonstrate that they are complying with their statutory responsibilities.</p>  <p>  - I will be updating my  Cabinet colleagues on the post Grenfell Tower fire situation and highlighting the implications of fire safety responsibilities in buildings across all sectors, both public and private.</p>  <p>  - A renewed focus is to be placed on the preparations of local authorities, working with the Principal Response Agencies and others, for large scale evacuation and operation of rest centres under the aegis of the Framework for Major Emergency Management.</p>  <p>  - I will consider all issues emerging, including regulatory arrangements, in line with developments.</p></reply>

The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property. </p><p>In recognition of both the critical demand for units and the potential the RLS has to offer, an additional &euro;26m was assigned to fund the scheme in 2017, which brings the total amount available this year to &euro;32m.  This additional investment in 2017 means that delivery under the scheme can be accelerated and up to 800 vacant properties can be brought back into use as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists this year.</p><p>Individual targets have been communicated to each local authority to ensure that the objective of 800 units for 2017 is achieved, and local authorities have been provided with delegated authority to enter into contractual arrangements in respect of that number of units.  The RLS targets for each local authority are set out in tabular form below. </p><p>My Department will be closely monitoring this activity to ensure that the scheme works well; that the funding available is utilised effectively; and ultimately, that new social houses are delivered using the scheme in 2017.  If a local authority is in a position to secure more units through the scheme than their target, this is welcomed and funding will be provided accordingly.  The RLS has potential to deliver social housing quickly and for low level investment in comparison to new build projects and I expect local authorities, working together with AHBs, will successfully deliver the scheme this year.</p><p><b>2017 RLS Targets per Local Authority</b><table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>RLS Target 2017 </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan County Council</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Council</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown   County Council</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Council</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County   Council</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Laois County Council</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim County Council</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City and   County Council</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Longford County   Council</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County   Council</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon County   Council</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County   Council</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary County   Council</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City and   County Council</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath County   Council</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>800</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The levy will be applied by planning authorities, commencing on 1 January 2019 in respect of sites which were vacant and on the vacant site register during the year 2018 and will subsequently be applied on an annual basis thereafter, as long as a site remains on the vacant site register in the preceding year.</p><p>Planning authorities are empowered to apply an annual vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of vacant sites, exceeding 0.5 hectares in area - with reduced or zero rates of levy applying in specific circumstances &ndash; which, in the planning authority&rsquo;s opinion, were vacant or idle in the preceding year, in areas identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development.  The 3% rate of vacant site levy is consistent with the rate applied to derelict sites under the Derelict Sites Act 1990 and is considered reasonable, without being over-punitive, for the purposes of incentivising the activation of such sites for residential or regeneration purposes. </p><p>It is also worth noting that all levies due on an individual site will remain a charge on the land concerned until all outstanding levies due are paid.  Accordingly, under the vacant site levy provisions, there will be a cumulative effect associated with not activating a site for development purposes for each year that a site remains vacant or idle.</p><p>The proceeds of the levy raised on vacant sites will be used by planning authorities for the provision of housing and urban regeneration development in the local area in which vacant sites are located.  No more than 10% of the levy monies received by planning authorities may be used on their collection and administration costs.  At this time, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the annual levies that may be raised by planning authorities in the implementation of the levy.</p><p>My Department issued general guidance to planning authorities  on the implementation of the vacant site levy in July 2016, by way of Circular Letter PL 7/2016, entitled Implementation of the Vacant Site Levy, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>Planning authorities are presently engaging in the necessary preparatory work, prior to the application of the levy with effect from January 2019 in respect of sites identified on the register in 2018.  As required under the Act, this includes the identification of specific vacant sites for entry on the register as well as the registered owners of the sites in question along with undertaking a site valuation.  Vacant site registers were established in January 2017 by planning authorities and the registers will be populated as the preparatory work progresses during the year.  My Department will monitor the implementation of the levy by local authorities to ensure that it is being fully utilised, in line with its intended purpose. </p></reply>

The Group consists of representatives from my Department, the Departments of Finance and of Jobs, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Residential Tenancies Board, and Dublin City Council.</p>  <p>  The anticipated output of the Group will be a report on the appropriate regulatory approach for short-term tourism-related lettings and the identification of the necessary amendments to legislation required to effect such regulation.  It is expected that the report will be finalised in Q3 2017. </p>  <p>  In addition to establishing a working group to consider short-term lettings, my Department has been engaging with AirBnB over the last number of months to explore the possibilities for a collaborative agreement, under which practical steps may be put in place to ensure that, where there are risks that short-term letting may result in the removal of significant numbers of properties from the rental market, planning requirements are respected.</p></reply>

There are currently more than 23,000 households in receipt of HAP, including more than 7,000 households that were previously supported by Rent Supplement.  On average in 2017, 330 new households are being supported by HAP each week.  The nationwide roll-out of the HAP scheme was completed following its introduction on 1 March 2017 to the Dublin City, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown Local Authority areas.  Eligible households in all 31 Local Authority areas can now avail of the scheme.  HAP has been particularly successful in the South Dublin County Council (SDCC) area, where it has been available since 1 October 2014, and currently supports over 1,760 tenancies. </p>  <p>  The Government increased the maximum rent limits available under the HAP and Rent Supplement schemes across the country with effect from 1 July 2016.  Furthermore, additional flexibility above the existing HAP rent limits was made available to all HAP local authorities from the same date.  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  It is a matter for the local authority, South Dublin County Council in this case, to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis. </p>  <p>  The Homeless Pilot of the HAP scheme has been operational since February 2015 across the four housing authorities in the Dublin Region, and is being implemented through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE).  The focus of this pilot scheme is to transition qualified households from emergency accommodation, including hotels, into private rented tenancies.  Additional discretion of up to 50% above rent limits is available to assist in housing homeless households in the Dublin Region, and 88% of all homeless households have benefited from some level of this homeless specific discretion.  The additional discretion available to homeless households recognises the difficulty this cohort of households face in sourcing and securing properties in a highly competitive rental market.  This proportion of households utilising discretion in the Dublin City Council administrative area reflects the DRHE's role in processing HAP applications for all eligible homeless households, across the four Dublin local authorities.  When homeless households are excluded, the use of discretion of HAP in the Dublin City area is similar to that of SDCC, with 1.2% of all households supported  utilising the discretion available.</p>  <p>  At the end of Q1 2017, 14.4% of the total number of households across the country being supported by HAP were benefiting from the additional flexibility that was provided to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limits.  Excluding homeless households, 9.6% of all households being supported were benefiting from the additional flexibility and in those cases the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 14.3% above rent limits provided. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  I am satisfied with how the scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

In these circumstances it is vital that the health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised.  There are a number of physical and medical standards laid down in the Defence Force Regulations and associated Administrative Instructions.  These requirements are based on the professional advice of the Medical Branch and having regard to the nature of the job, the duties of military service and the training exercises undertaken by members of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The Director of the Medical Branch has advised that applicants who have chronic medical conditions are at a higher risk of suffering from symptoms related to those conditions due to the exigencies of military service.  Entry criteria for enlistment to the Permanent Defence Force are, therefore, based on the selection of personnel who are not likely to require medical support and whose pre-existing medical status could not reasonably be foreseen to be subject to aggravation by service with the Permanent Defence Force.</p>  <p>  Each individual&rsquo;s medical condition is examined taking into account a detailed/documented history of the condition and its extent, including remissions, exacerbations, and any other associated conditions.  In the specific context of a chronic medical condition such as asthma the sufferer is placed at a higher health risk.  Accordingly, an applicant who is suffering from Asthma would be found to be below Defence Forces Medical Standards and would therefore be ineligible to enlist in the Defence Forces as a Recruit or Cadet.</p>  <p>  If a serving member developed a sthma after induction to the Defence Forces, he/she would not be found to be below Defence Forces Medical Standards, unless very severe, but would be given a Medical Classification Code reflective of a chronic but intermittent medical condition.</p></reply>
