    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-30a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000056#WRA00700"><p>We are confident that the European Council&rsquo;s adoption of the EU&rsquo;s negotiating Guidelines on April 29 gives Ireland its strongest hand going into these complex negotiations.  The unique circumstances of Ireland have been recognised as part of the negotiations from the outset. </p><p>The Irish Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, including the Good Friday Agreement which already exists, is recognised and protected within the context of the Article 50 negotiations leading to a withdrawal agreement.  The Good Friday Agreement is an internationally recognised Treaty, registered with the UN.  This is a key distinguishing factor regarding what is a unique political and constitutional framework on the island of Ireland.</p><p>As the Government has consistently said, the only way for us to influence this process and protect our national interests, including with regard to Northern Ireland and the Common Travel Area, is to win the understanding and support of EU partners for Ireland&rsquo;s unique concerns.  From the outset, these concerns have been recognised as part of the negotiation Guidelines, and we have achieved this understanding through the extensive programme of outreach and engagement undertaken with our EU partners.</p><p>There will be a separate agreement on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU, which is likely to cover a broad range of policy areas, including trade, and which is likely to take longer to conclude than the EU-UK exit agreement.  Depending on the nature of this agreement, which is subject to negotiations, approval by each Member State may be required in accordance with their own domestic procedures.</p><p>It is also important to remember that the future relationship agreement will require ratification by <i>all</i>EU27 Member States, including Ireland. An EU-UK exit agreement will be approved by a majority in the European Council, therefore no one member state will be in a position to block or veto a deal.  Even if it were possible to veto a deal, it would not mean that the UK would not leave &ndash; Under Article 50, it would simply mean that the UK would depart without appropriate arrangements in place.</p></reply>

On 22 May, the Council of Ministers at 27 adopted a decision authorising the beginning of the negotiations, which are expected to start soon after the UK general election.</p><p>The negotiating directives under which the talks will be conducted reflect Ireland's unique concerns - support and protect the achievements, benefits and commitments of the peace process; avoid a hard border; and protect the Common Travel Area. </p><p>Now that the terms on which the negotiations are to be conducted have been established, the Government has stated its intention to intensify its focus on the economic implications of Brexit, including on domestic policy measures to reinforce the competitiveness of the Irish economy; to protect it from potential negative impacts of Brexit; and to pursue all possible opportunities that might arise. </p><p>Work is under way on a paper, which will be published in due course and which will draw on the extensive work already being undertaken across Departments, including sectoral analyses, and will reflect the core economic themes of my speech to the Institute of International and European Affairs of 15 February, including:</p><p>-  sustainable fiscal policies to ensure capacity to absorb and respond to economic shocks, not least from Brexit;</p><p>-  policies to make Irish enterprise more diverse and resilient, to diversify trade and investment patterns, and to strengthen competitiveness;</p><p>-  prioritising policy measures and dedicating resources to protect jobs and businesses in the sectors and regions most affected by Brexit;</p><p>-  realising economic opportunities arising from Brexit, and help businesses adjust to any new logisitical or trade barriers arising; </p><p>-  making a strong case at EU level that Ireland will require support that recognises where Brexit represents a serious disturbance to the Irish economy. </p><p>Policy decisions in support of these objectives will be reflected in, inter alia, the annual Budgetary process; the forthcoming National Planning Framework 2040; the new 10-year National Capital Plan; the review of Enterprise 2025; and sectoral policies and investment decisions in areas such as agriculture, enterprise, transport, communications and energy. </p><p>In taking this important work forward, the Government will continue to engage with stakeholders, including through the All Island Civic Dialogue process. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-30a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000056#WRA01900"><p>The resolution of the Middle East conflict, and the ending of the occupation of Palestinian territory by Israel, is an important foreign policy priority for Ireland and for the Government, and has been a principal focus of my own work at the EU Foreign Affairs Council and in the UN and other international fora.</p>  <p>  I have continued to argue to maintain an EU and a broader international focus on the Middle East Peace Process, despite the many crises elsewhere in the region.  The 50th anniversary of the beginning of the occupation, which we will reach in a few days, strongly reinforces the argument I have been making, that the status quo of the continuing occupation is unacceptable, and that a solution to the conflict is as urgent as ever.</p>  <p>   I therefore strongly supported the initiative led by France in 2016, which concluded at the Paris Conference, which I attended in January this year.  The conference produced an important restatement of international consensus behind a two state solution to the conflict, but was unable to impart renewed momentum to the peace process.</p>  <p>  The interest shown by President Trump last week in brokering a peace between the two sides was certainly welcome, and it remains to be seen what follow up there is to this. Ireland, and I am sure the EU, will provide any assistance we can.</p>  <p>  I believe the wider international community, including the EU, must do more to encourage and press the current governing majority in Israel to recommit to the peace process, and also to bolster the waning belief of Palestinians that the political path can bring results.</p>  <p>  Finally, in order to preserve the space on which an agreement can be built, I believe that Ireland and our EU partners need to continue the engagement we have made to defend the two state solution on the ground, and resist the ongoing Israeli settlement project which is deeply damaging to the prospects for peace.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-30a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000056#WRA02200"><p>The target turnaround period for Passport Express renewal applications is fifteen working days.  The Passport Express service operates in partnership with An Post and this revised target has been in place for over a year.  It is a target rather than a stated guarantee of service delivery.</p>  <p>  The fifteen working day target is communicated very clearly on the website and in all promotional materials of An Post including Passport Express receipts and on the website of my Department.  The Passport Service also promotes messages on turnaround times in all customer contacts, including on social media and via stands at travel exhibitions.  I regularly provide information and guidance on turnaround times in responses to parliamentary questions, through frequent written updates for Members and correspondence with those who have queries.</p>  <p>  I want to reiterate that the target for renewals is fifteen working days - in other words, effectively three weeks.  It is not fifteen days, ten days or any other period. An Post is kept apprised on a regular basis of any fluctuations in average turnaround times. </p>  <p>  The average turnaround time for Passport Express renewals is currently fifteen working days, in line with the published target. </p>  <p>  All applicants are advised on notes accompanying the passport application form to check current turnaround times online on website of my Department. First time applications take longer due to the need for extra security checks.  The turnaround times are updated weekly.  Applicants who do not have sufficient time to make a Passport Express application are advised to book an appointment online and to submit an application in person at the Passport Office in either Dublin or Cork. </p>  <p>  In all cases, applicants are advised not to book travel unless in possession of a valid passport.</p>  <p>  I recently launched the Online Passport Application Service, which allows adult citizens to renew their passports online from anywhere in the world at any time of the day or night, without any paperwork or witnesses.  The turnaround time for the online service is ten working days plus postage time and the response from online applicants has been very positive so far.  I urge deputies to encourage all eligible applicants to avail of this fast, secure and convenient facility.  A promotional campaign on social media and on public transport is underway which should lift the numbers further.  As more applicants avail of the service, the efficiency gains will help improve turnaround times more broadly. </p>  <p>  I have repeated the advice I have provided today on many occasions in this House. Despite this and the public information efforts it is clear that a number of people continue to use an incorrect channel and this results in follow-on requests and representations to expedite applications.  I have asked therefore the Passport Service and the Communications Unit in my Department to look at further steps in the coming weeks to help improve public awareness of best practice in submitting passport applications.  This complements the ongoing advertising campaign to promote use of the new online passport application service.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-30a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000057#WRB00500"><p>Since 29 March last year my Department has required all first-time passport applicants aged eighteen and above who are resident in Ireland to hold a valid Public Services Card.  This requirement also applies to the small number of adult passport applicants whose last passport was issued before 1 January 2005 and has since been reported as lost, stolen or damaged.</p>  <p>  This measure has been an important step in protecting against fraud and identity theft and in upholding the integrity of the Irish passport.  It also ensures that the identity of first-time applicants for Irish passports continues to be verified to a high standard.</p>  <p>  The impact on adult first-time passport applicants is that they no longer need to supply a certified copy of a document such as a driving license or student card for identification purposes.  The card also dispenses with the current requirement for additional proof of name.  Proof of address is still required.  The introduction of the requirement has had no significant impact on customer service or on the processing time for first-time passport applications.</p></reply>

In general terms, all of our diplomatic Missions across the EU are working extensively on the UK exit issue as are a number of embassies further afield.</p>  <p>  At Headquarters the key Divisions of European Union Division and the Ireland, UK and Americas (IUKA) Division, both headed at Second Secretary General level, have been assigned additional resources.  The European Union Division contains a dedicated team focused exclusively on the EU-UK negotiations, led by a senior officer at Counsellor level.  Within the IUKA Division, there is a Brexit-specific policy co-ordination function now in place and there are teams focused on Northern Ireland and on wider British-Irish Relations; their duties include Brexit related issues.</p>  <p>  Many business units of the Department at its headquarters in Dublin are involved as part of the strategic response to the UK exit and staff numbers have been augmented, for example in the Legal Division, the Trade Division and the Policy Planning Unit.  There is also an intra-Departmental senior management group focusing on issues relating to the UK exit, chaired by the Secretary General and comprising senior officials from across all relevant business units of the Department.  </p>  <p>  A number of officers are seconded to the Department of the Taoiseach and working on EU matters, while two officers are seconded to the International and EU Relations Division of the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  In relation to citizen services there has been a marked increase in demand for passports and citizenship via foreign birth registration from applicants in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. In response to this and a significantly increased seasonal demand, we have recruited over 300 temporary and full-time clerical officers to meet demands for our Passport and Consular Services and these additional resources have been assigned to our Dublin, Cork and London operations.</p>  <p>  Overseas, specific additional senior diplomatic posts have been assigned to our Embassies in London, Berlin and Paris as well as the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels.  The Permanent Representation in Brussels has a unit dedicated to managing our response to this issue comprising a Counsellor, First Secretary and Third Secretary. </p>  <p>  Berlin and Paris each have had senior diplomats assigned to the embassy teams with a specific Brexit remit. London has augmented both its diplomatic staff and its administrative teams. </p>  <p>  These measures, which comprise the initial phase of our response to the UK decision to leave the EU, remain under review as the Government carries out its work in response to the UK referendum decision and as preparations for the forthcoming negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU intensify.</p></reply>

Subsequently, on 3 May, Minister of State McHugh convened a discussion in my Department&rsquo;s Headquarters on the challenges facing the undocumented Irish community in the US.  This event took place on the eve of the Global Irish Civic Forum in Dublin and brought together leading figures who are committed to this issue, including a number of our Senators and representatives of Irish Immigration Centers, as well as the deputy head of mission in our Embassy in Washington, and a representative of families of undocumented citizens abroad.</p>  <p>  Minister of State McHugh also recently announced an additional &euro;50,000 funding from the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme budget for the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres, which provides authoritative advice and vital services to our undocumented citizens in the US. </p>  <p>  Issues around immigration and the undocumented are an important element of the work of Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic representatives in the US.  Our Embassy in Washington and our six Consulates across the United States work with Irish immigration centres on a daily basis in providing support to Irish citizens. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputies of the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to pursuing these matters on behalf of our citizens in the US. </p></reply>

Drought continues to worsen in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, where 13 million people are facing crisis levels of food insecurity.  Somalia continues to face a significant risk of famine, and famine has already been declared in parts of South Sudan.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to prioritise this region in our humanitarian response.  The Horn of Africa crisis was discussed at the recent meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 15 May which I attended.  The EU has regularly emphasised the need to address the root causes of the humanitarian crisis, to work for peaceful resolution of conflicts in the region and to respect international humanitarian law. </p>  <p>  Unhindered access to populations in need and the safety and protection of aid workers are essential. Providing safe havens within conflict zones is extremely difficult, especially where the warring parties do not prioritise the protection of civilians.  Such safe havens require a mandate from the UN Security Council where political will is often lacking.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has provided &euro;120 million in humanitarian assistance in the Horn of Africa region since 2012, including &euro;29 million in 2016 and &euro;17 million so far this year.  Our assistance supports our UN and NGO partners&rsquo;response, with particular focus on improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, food and treating malnutrition. </p>  <p>  Together with EU and UN partners, we will continue to monitor the situation closely and to advocate internationally for respect for international humanitarian law and the safe delivery of assistance to those most in need.</p></reply>

I will respond to questions 68, 96 and 99 together.  On his recent trip to Saudi Arabia, the President of the United States signed a significant arms deal with the Kingdom.  Saudi Arabia, like a number of other states in the region, is a party to the conflict in Yemen.  The war has now entered its third year, at a considerable cost to the civilian population.  </p>  <p>  I have consistently, and repeatedly, made known to this House my view that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Yemen.  I am aware of comments made during the US visit to Saudi Arabia, that more military pressure is needed to get the Houthis to enter into peace negotiations.  My clear view, however, is that what is most needed in Yemen is for those with influence in the region to put pressure on the parties to the conflict to make the concessions required for a peace agreement.  </p>  <p>  A solution to the conflict in Yemen would not only bring relief to the Yemeni population, but would also have positive, stabilising effects in the wider Gulf region.  It would also mean that the Yemeni Government and its neighbours could focus on fighting the terrorist groups that have strengthened their presence in Yemen since the war began. </p>  <p>  The longer the war continues, the longer the suffering of the civilian population.  The conflict has had a terrible impact on what was already the poorest country in the Gulf.  The current cholera outbreak is one example of the knock-on consequences that the fighting is having on civilians.  This epidemic is impacting children in particular, reflecting the fact that conflict often has the most devastating effect on the most vulnerable groups in society.</p>  <p>  My officials engage regularly with their US counterparts on a variety of Arms Control, Disarmament and non-Proliferation matters.  With regard to arms transfers to Saudi Arabia, and to the problems posed by arms transfers to conflict regions generally, our efforts are concentrated on universalisation and implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty, which we strongly support.  The US has signed the Treaty, but not yet ratified it.  Ireland regularly encourages all States who have not yet acceded to the Treaty as full members to do so.  We also participate actively in EU demarches to non-members to this effect, and will continue to do so.  </p>  <p>  Finally, regarding Syria and Iraq, the US has undertaken a number of operations in Syria and Iraq since the establishment of the Global Coalition to counter ISIS in 2014.  Ireland does not oppose the legally sanctioned participation of countries in operations mandated under UN Security Resolution 2249.  These operations are aimed at the liberation of Syrian and Iraqi populations under the control of Daesh, or ISIS, a terrorist group which a UN body has charged with the crime of genocide against the Yazidi population.</p></reply>

Irish officials discuss India-Pakistan relations with their counterparts from those countries on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  The EU, including of course Ireland, continues to support the reconciliation process between India and Pakistan over Kashmir with a view to finding a lasting resolution to the situation, particularly through dialogue, and by involving as far as possible the Kashmiri people in this process.  The EU also advocates for accountability of armed forces responsible for abuses against civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir.  Both India and Pakistan are important friends of the EU: India and the EU formed a Strategic Partnership in 2004, and Pakistan and the EU agreed a five Year Engagement Plan in 2012.</p>  <p>  The EU Missions in New Delhi maintain an ongoing comprehensive discussion on India-Pakistan relations, including the situation in Kashmir, which resulted in a detailed report with recommendations earlier this year.  While the EU is committed to working to improve the climate between the two countries, it was agreed that the EU should assess the political and human rights situation in Kashmir separately from India-Pakistan relations and cross-border terrorism. </p>  <p>  No humanitarian funding has been provided directly by Ireland to programmes responding specifically to Kashmir, however broader humanitarian funding has been provided to both India and Pakistan.  For example, in 2016 the Start Fund allocated &euro;816,000 to NGOs to address the humanitarian impact of extreme weather events in India.  Irish Aid is one of three donors to the Start Fund along with the UK and the Netherlands.  In Pakistan, this year the Irish Government has allocated &euro;400,000 to Tr&oacute;caire to support communities who have returned to their homes after being displaced by the earthquake which struck near the border with Afghanistan in October 2015.</p>  <p>  The EU and UN also contribute humanitarian aid to this region.  In 2015 &euro;3.4 million was allocated by the EU Commission to provide psycho-social support and livelihood means to people affected by conflict in Jammu and Kashmir and the north-eastern states, as well as health and protection services to communities in remote settlements in Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also the eighth largest donor (over US$179 million in total) to the UN Central Emergency Relief Fund, which has provided over US$193 million (in the 2006-2017 period) to support humanitarian organisations working to assist vulnerable and crises affected communities in Pakistan.</p></reply>

An executive agency of the Department of Justice, the Northern Ireland Prison Service, has operational responsibility for prisons, while the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland retains certain responsibilities around separation.</p>  <p>  Prison issues feature regularly in my discussions with the Secretary of State and with successive Northern Ministers of Justice.  I will continue my discussions on prison issues with the next Minister for Justice following the restoration of the Institutions.  The Northern Ireland Executive last summer agreed to implement the recommendation of the Fresh Start Paramilitary Panel that a review of the separated regime in Maghaberry be established.  This would, I believe, involve assessing how the separated regime impacts on the operation of the prison itself.  </p>  <p>  My Department engaged fully in the Paramilitary Panel&rsquo;s consultation process.  </p>  <p>  I look forward to that review panel being appointed and to seeing their work completed.  That cannot happen until the new Executive is established and a Minister of Justice is in place.  Clearly the sooner an Executive is formed the better.</p>  <p>  I believe that such a review opens up an opportunity to address genuine concerns regarding separation, including such issues as association on the landings and access to education.  I know the Deputy and a number of colleagues have strong concerns about these and related issues.  It may open a wider discussion on other potential reforms in the prison service.</p>  <p>  My officials at the Secretariat in Belfast continue to monitor prison issues closely and to meet with the range of agencies responsible for prisoner issues in Northern Ireland, including the Department of Justice, the Northern Ireland Prison Service, the Prison Ombudsman, and on non-devolved aspects, with officials from the Northern Ireland Office.</p></reply>

This represents Ireland&rsquo;s single largest response ever to a humanitarian crisis. Our funding has supported those in need within Syria as well as Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan. We work with UN and Red Cross partners, and as well as NGO partners, to ensure that our funding reaches the most vulnerable. These partners provide humanitarian supplies and urgently-needed health, education, water and sanitation services, as well as implementing measures to protect women, children and vulnerable families.</p>  <p>  Through our annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response in Syria. </p>  <p>  At the pledging conference for the Syria crisis in Brussels in April, I committed to providing at least &euro;25 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria in 2017.  This pledge is in line with Ireland's expenditure on this crisis in 2016, when we exceeded our pledge of &euro;20m.</p>  <p>  We have already begun to fulfil our 2017 pledge, having provided funding to the UN Humanitarian Country Based Pooled Funds in Jordan and Lebanon in February. We are currently preparing an additional disbursement to partners in the region. </p>  <p>  The Government remains strongly committed to supporting those affected by the Syria crisis. I had the opportunity to visit Lebanon and Jordan in February where I met with Syrian refugees who are benefitting from Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance.  I witnessed first-hand the immense needs within the region and also the impact of the support that Ireland is providing.  We will continue to provide that support and to work with our international partners in the search for a political solution to the crisis.</p></reply>

Despite having the world&rsquo;s largest proven petroleum reserves, Venezuela&rsquo;s population faces a shortage of food and medicines.</p>  <p>  While there have been long-running demonstrations against President Nicolas Maduro, the most recent wave of protests began in January 2017.  They worsened following two Supreme Court rulings in March rescinding the constitutional powers of the National Assembly. While these rulings were since largely reversed, it remains the case that the Court has declared the National Assembly in contempt of the Constitution and suspended its right to pass legislation.  My EU counterparts and I discussed the situation in Venezuela at the Foreign Affairs Council on 15 May.  Ireland and other EU member States have condemned the use of force in Venezuela and have called for the fatalities of recent weeks to be fully investigated.  We have urged both the Government and opposition to seek peaceful and democratic solutions to the crisis and called on the Government to facilitate external agencies in addressing the urgent needs of the Venezuelan population.</p>  <p>  Our view is that the establishment of a clear electoral calendar and the full restoration of the country&rsquo;s democratic institutions will be critical to achieving a settlement to the crisis and we have urged the Government to engage in dialogue with the National Assembly and other involved parties. </p>  <p>  While Ireland does not have diplomatic representation in Venezuela, officials at my Department and our accredited Embassy in Mexico will continue to follow the situation closely and use any bilateral contacts with the government or opposition to urge a peaceful settlement to the crisis. </p></reply>

This document was drafted with the Department of the Taoiseach and in consultation with all relevant Government Departments.</p>  <p>  The document reflects the findings and outcomes of the extensive preparatory work and consultations undertaken to date by the Government at EU level and on the island of Ireland, including through the All-Island Civic Dialogue.  It focuses in particular on the withdrawal negotiations, which are anticipated to get underway in the coming weeks.  It also looks ahead to the future relationship negotiations and the issues that will need to be addressed in this second phase of the negotiations.</p>  <p>  A priority for the Government over recent months has been to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s interests &ndash; as set out in the comprehensive document &ndash; are fully reflected in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position.  The Government has undertaken an intensive campaign of engagement with EU partners and the EU institutions to ensure our specific concerns were fully recognised.  For my part, I have had nearly 100 engagements on Brexit since the referendum with EU partners, including with each of my EU counterparts. </p>  <p>  This campaign of engagement has delivered for Ireland.  I welcome that the Negotiating Guidelines adopted by the European Council on 29 April and the more detailed negotiating directives adopted by the General Affairs Council on 22 May deliver on the objectives the Government identified in its comprehensive document published earlier this month.</p>  <p>  In particular, the EU Guidelines and the directives express the goal of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including the need for flexible and imaginative solutions to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.  They also recognise the bilateral agreements and arrangements between the EU and the UK, including the Common Travel Area.  Additionally, the directives address the need to take full account of the situation of Irish citizens residing in Northern Ireland who will continue to enjoy rights as EU citizens and the need to address issues arising from Ireland&rsquo;s unique geographic situation, including the transit of goods to and from Ireland via the UK.</p>  <p>  Ireland also fully supports the phased approach that has been adopted by the EU, which foresees that discussions on the future EU-UK relationship will get under way as soon as sufficient progress has been made on the EU&rsquo;s key priorities under the withdrawal process &ndash; notably citizens&rsquo; rights, the UK&rsquo;s financial settlement and border issues, including in relation to Ireland. </p>  <p>  My immediate focus &ndash; and that of my Government colleagues &ndash; will therefore be on working with our EU partners to ensure a positive start to the negotiations with a view to ensuring that swift progress can be made on the withdrawal issues.  In this regard, it is also important that the UK comes to the table with an open mind and a constructive approach.  This will be vital in ensuring that we can move on to discussing in parallel the future EU-UK relationship, including in relation to trade, as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to play a central role in preparing and supporting these efforts.  Given the cross-cutting nature of the EU-UK dossier, a number of Divisions are very closely engaged with this issue, as are our Missions, under the overall direction of the Secretary General.  The European Union Division contains a specific team dedicated to the EU-UK negotiations, which will take the lead on the Article 50 process within the framework of the whole-of-government approach to Brexit, which is led by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representation to the European Union in Brussels will also play a key role.  Resources both at home and in our Permanent Representation in Brussels, as well as in our Embassies in London, Paris and Berlin, have been reinforced. We are therefore well placed, both in terms of our preparedness and in terms of our core priorities, for the upcoming negotiations which will be long and complex. </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s policy for international development, <i>One World One Future</i>, defines the goals and priorities that guide all decisions on Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation programme.  Our aid is untied and provided wholly on the basis of need.  Our policy clearly commitments us to making progress towards the UN 0.7% target as economic conditions allow.  The current Programme for Government reiterates this position, and sets out our ambition to make progress towards the UN target as resources permit.</p><p>Last month the OECD published the official ODA figures for 2016. Ireland&rsquo;s total contribution to ODA in 2016, increased by some 12 % on the 2015 levels, to almost &euro;724 million. This is the third consecutive year of growth in ODA volumes, and is a very clear demonstration of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to increasing resources to our Aid Programme as economic conditions allow.  The OECD also confirmed that last year we reversed the trend of a declining ODA / GNP percentage.  Ireland&rsquo;s percentage rose to 0.33% for 2016, up from 0.32% in 2015. For the current year we have increased the budget allocation to ODA by &euro;10 million on the 2016 level.</p><p>The 2018 estimates process is due to commence shortly.  And while the decision on final allocations to ODA, as with all public expenditure, will ultimately be a matter for Government, and will be made in the context of available resources and the competing budgetary demands facing Government, I can assure the Deputy that, I and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, will be making the strongest possible case for an increase in ODA for next year.</p><p>The challenge now is to continue to make sustained, manageable progress in meeting our commitment towards moving towards the UN target, while ensuring our aid programme continues to focus relentlessly on the core objectives of eradicating global hunger, reducing extreme poverty and providing humanitarian assistance to some of the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable people. </p></reply>

Turkey was the main topic of discussion at the Gymnich on 28 April, where I, along with other EU Foreign Ministers, expressed my deep concern at the situation in Turkey.  We agreed that it is important to keep the lines of communication open with Turkey and that our engagement must be open and frank.</p><p>The State of Emergency has been renewed three times since it was first imposed on 20 July in the immediate aftermath of the attempted coup last year.  I have called for the measures taken under the State of Emergency to be proportionate and urged the Turkish authorities to revert to ordinary procedures and safeguards as soon as possible and return to a sense of normalcy.  Although the attempted coup was an attack on democracy, and we cannot underestimate the impact that this and terrorist attacks have had on Turkey, the fundamental rights of citizens must be respected, whatever the level of threat.</p><p>The scale of detentions and dismissals of public servants, including teachers, civil servants, judges and academics, as well as the ongoing media crackdown, is a cause of grave concern and was highlighted by the Amnesty report, &lsquo;<i>No end in sight: Purged public sector workers denied a future in Turkey&rsquo;</i>published on 22 May.  People have been dismissed or detained due to their alleged association with the Gulenist movement, which President Erdo&eth;an blames for masterminding the coup, or, in many cases, given no reason for their removal from office.  I fully agree that a fair and swift appeals procedure must be established to allow those dismissed to have their cases heard.</p><p>I have repeatedly voiced my serious concerns about the impact of the deteriorating situation on the lives of the Kurdish population in Turkey.  I have called for the rights of all minorities in Turkey, including the Kurdish minority, to be respected.  Late last year, the two co-chairs of the pro-Kurdish HDP and other members of the Turkish parliament were arrested &ndash; I made a statement on 4 November highlighting that this was a very worrying development and had a negative impact on democracy, human rights, freedom of expression and the rule of law.</p><p>My officials met with Mr Faysal Sar&yacute;y&yacute;ld&yacute;z, an MP in the pro-Kurdish HDP party on 18 May, when he raised, <i>inter alia</i>, the case of his imprisoned colleagues.  It is my understanding that eleven HDP MPs are still in custody, while four have been released on bail.</p><p>I have previously expressed my concerns at the conditions of all those in detention in Turkey and repeat that it is critically important that the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial are respected.</p></reply>

The increasing tensions in the south-east of the country are deeply troubling, and I am also gravely concerned at the mounting threat to civil society by breaches of human rights and democratic norms. </p><p>I have called for the rights of all minorities in Turkey, including the Kurdish minority, to be respected at every opportunity, including in this House, at the Council of Europe, and at meetings with my EU colleagues, most recently at the Gymnich on 28 April.  I have also repeatedly called for a resumption of dialogue to allow the political process on the Kurdish issue to resume. </p><p>On 4 November I issued a statement expressing my serious concern at the arrest of the two co-chairs of the pro-Kurdish HDP and other members of parliament.  I made clear that this was a very worrying development and had a negative impact on democracy, human rights, freedom of expression and the rule of law.</p><p>My officials met with Mr Faysal Sar&yacute;y&yacute;ld&yacute;z, an MP in the pro-Kurdish HDP party on 18 May, when he raised, <i>inter alia</i>, the case of his imprisoned colleagues.  It is my understanding that eleven HDP MPs are still in custody, while four have been released on bail.  I have repeatedly expressed my concerns at the conditions of all those in detention in Turkey and that it is critically important that the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial are respected.</p><p>My statements on developments in Turkey have been brought to the attention of the Turkish authorities, and I raised the issues of democracy and human rights, including the scale of those dismissed and detained since last July, with the Turkish Minister of the Economy when I met him on 25 April.  I will continue to use every appropriate opportunity to highlight my concerns on these issues. </p></reply>

This meeting formed part of the Government&rsquo;s continued programme of extensive engagement with EU partners to emphasise Ireland&rsquo;s unique set of priorities with regard to Brexit.</p>  <p>  The meeting with Mr. Verhofstadt provided an opportunity to take stock on key aspects of the Article 50 negotiations process and I underlined the importance of maintaining close co-operation with the European Parliament given that MEPs will be required to consent to the withdrawal agreement concluded between the EU and the UK.  I also explained Ireland&rsquo;s specific issues and concerns relating to Northern Ireland, the Common Travel Area and the depth of our trading relationship with the UK.  I was pleased to see that there is a strong acknowledgement of our unique concerns in the European Parliaments resolution on Brexit adopted by an overwhelming majority of MEPS on 5 April.</p>  <p>  During my visit to European Parliament on 9 February, I also met with Gianni Pittella, President of the Socialist and Democrats Group, the Irish MEPs and other key MEPs, including Elmar Brock, the EPP&rsquo;s coordinator on Brexit and David McAllister, Chair of the Parliament&rsquo;s Foreign Affairs Committee.  These meetings where another opportunity to set out Ireland&rsquo;s concerns regarding Brexit to who influential members of the European Parliament. </p>  <p>  More recently, on 16-17 May, the Minister of State for European Affairs, visited the plenary session of the European Parliament to hold a series of Brexit related meetings with key MEPs, including some involved in the Parliament&rsquo;s Brexit Steering Group Committee and with Guy Verhofstadt. </p>  <p>  These meetings provided a further opportunity for Minister Murphy to underline the Irish approach to the Brexit negotiations, emphasising our key priorities, and to learn more about the Parliament&rsquo;s work and preparedness for the negotiations. </p>  <p>  It also provided an opportunity for the Minister to thank the MEPs personally for their role in the adoption of the European Parliament&rsquo;s resolution on Brexit, which, as I said, contains a very strong acknowledgement of Ireland&rsquo;s unique concerns on Brexit. </p></reply>

I have noted that this deterioration has particularly targeted those who express dissent or criticism of the Bahraini Government.</p>  <p>  Ireland attaches a high priority to safeguarding human rights defenders, and has continually advocated for freedom for civil society actors to operate in a safe and enabling environment, without repression.  I am aware of the clashes that took place this week in the Bahraini village of Diraz, of the shootings, mass arrests and destruction of property.  Preventing people from expressing their views does not quash people&rsquo;s grievances; it only reinforces them.  I call on the protesters and the Bahraini authorities alike to exercise restraint, for the protesters to express their views peacefully and for the authorities to permit them to do this.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about human rights issues in Bahrain, in particular around civil liberties, are regularly conveyed to the Bahraini authorities.  In March, officials from my Department met with an official from the Bahraini Embassy in London to discuss the human rights situation in Bahrain.  Ireland&rsquo;s (non-resident) Ambassador to Bahrain met with the Bahraini Deputy Minister for International Affairs, Abdullah Bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, at the beginning of this year and they discussed human rights.</p>  <p>  My officials also raised ongoing human rights issues with Bahrain in the context of Bahrain&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review, which took place in Geneva at the beginning of the month.  In advance of this review, in early February the Irish Mission to the UN in Geneva supported an event by the Bahrain Center for Human Rights.  Ireland also made specific reference to Bahrain in our Item 4 (Human Rights situations that require the Council's attention) Statement at the Human Rights Council in Geneva last September, expressing concern about &ldquo;restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly and association aimed at silencing the voice of civil society and human rights defenders in countries including&hellip; Bahrain&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Further, my Department, both here in Dublin and in Geneva, engages with a number of Irish and international NGOs on human rights issues in Bahrain.  For example, in October 2015, the Bahrain National Institution for Human Rights came to Ireland on a training visit, which included meetings with Irish human rights and civil society organisations.  Officials from my Department also met with this group, and set out Ireland&rsquo;s support for human rights promotion across the Middle East region.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the situation in Bahrain, and will continue to call on the Bahraini Government to make good on their stated commitment to make progress in the area of human rights.</p></reply>

My Department works closely with the Department of the Taoiseach in regard to NSMC matters and the Taoiseach co-chairs the NSMC Plenary meetings with the Northern Ireland First Minister and deputy First Minister.</p>  <p>  The NSMC is supported by a standing Joint Secretariat in Armagh, staffed by members of the Irish and Northern Ireland Civil Services, with staff costs met separately.  There are nine officers from my Department currently working there.  In addition to servicing the Council which meets in Plenary, Institutional and Sectoral formats, my officials in the Joint Secretariat also perform other important functions focussed on advocacy for North-South co-operation.  They are involved in developing networks of contacts, actively pursuing our priorities for advancing cooperation, as well as analysing and reporting on the progress of such cooperation, including on the work of the North-South Implementation Bodies.  My officials in Armagh also play a co-ordinating role across Government in encouraging and advancing cross-border co-operation in all Departments.</p>  <p>  As the formal mechanism for bilateral discussions between the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, the NSMC has a crucial role to play in the Brexit discussions and the negotiations ahead.  The most recent NSMC Plenary meetings in July and November 2016 saw the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive agree on a number of important common principles for dealing with Brexit on an all-island basis, scoping out the sectoral implications of Brexit for Ireland, North and South, and agreeing to work together to optimise North-South planning in the phases preceding and following Brexit.  For this reason especially, I hope that a new Executive can be formed soon and that the NSMC discussions can resume quickly thereafter so that the Executive can represent Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests, including in relation to the upcoming EU-UK negotiations.  </p>  <p>  In regard to British-Irish Council (BIC), the Government provides support in a number of ways, with lead responsibilities for the BIC held by the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>  <p>  In terms of practical support, my Department seconds an experienced diplomat to the permanent secretariat of the BIC, based in Edinburgh.  This officer jointly heads the secretariat along with an official nominated by the UK government in London.  As well as funding the salary and related costs for this official, my Department also makes a financial contribution towards the secretariat&rsquo;s running costs. </p>  <p>  At the Department&rsquo;s headquarters at Iveagh House in Dublin, responsibility for the British Irish Council is assigned to the Ireland, UK and Americas (IUKA) Division.  This is supported further through engagement as appropriate by our diplomatic missions and offices in London, Edinburgh and Belfast, given that the BIC&rsquo;s membership consists of Ireland, the UK, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. </p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the Department of the Taoiseach, which provides Ireland&rsquo;s representatives to the BIC&rsquo;s central co-ordination group and leads on preparations for BIC Summit meetings, at which Ireland is represented by the Taoiseach.  At these summit meetings, the Taoiseach is always accompanied by a minister or ministers responsible for the policy areas being discussed, along with officials from his Department and my own.  Throughout the year, ministers and officials also participate in meetings related to the BIC&rsquo;s twelve policy work streams, which involve direct engagement by a number of different Government Departments.  </p>  <p>  Established in the context of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the British Irish Council provides Ireland and all member administrations with valuable opportunities to engage with each other and make progress on the various policy work streams.  The summit meetings since the UK referendum of June 2016 have also included specific and valuable conversations on the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU, thereby providing a clear capacity for discussion of key strategic issues.</p></reply>

The situation is being closely monitored by officials in my Department and by the Embassy of Ireland in Mexico, which is accredited to Colombia. I reiterate that I unreservedly condemn any intimidation, violence, or discrimination perpetrated against those seeking to defend their rights, whether in Colombia or elsewhere.</p>  <p>  I firmly believe that the Colombian peace process, which aims to create a virtuous circle between peacebuilding and respect for human rights, provides the framework in which the endemic violence and impunity which has afflicted Colombian society can successfully be addressed. However, we know from our own experience in Ireland that peace processes are complex, challenging and can suffer unexpected setbacks.  Officials from my Department regularly engage with human rights defenders and civil society leaders active in Colombia, including those involved in the energy and mining sector. In November 2016 and March 2017, they hosted delegations from Peace Brigades International to discuss the worrying increase in violence against local leaders and human rights activists in Colombia to which the Deputy refers. Furthermore, officials from our Embassy in Mexico regularly interact with organisations working to promote and defend human rights in Colombia. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland is a founder member and one of the largest contributors to the EU Trust Fund for Colombia. We have committed to providing &euro;3 million in funding over the lifetime of the Fund, which aims to support the implementation of the peace agreement. In keeping with Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights internationally, we have advocated a strong human rights perspective for the Fund in discussions regarding its strategic direction. </p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland has provided more than &euro;5 million to international and local civil society organizations in Colombia since 2009, including to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and Christian Aid, amongst others. Ireland regularly raises issues relating to human rights directly in Bogot&aacute; and via the UN and European Union. We will continue to prioritise such issues as the agreement between the Government of Colombia and the FARC is implemented in the months and years ahead.</p></reply>

Over seven million people in the DRC and 2.3 million people in CAR need humanitarian assistance.  Just last week, a report was issued by the Norwegian Refugee Council which stated that in 2016, more people were newly displaced in the DRC than anywhere in the world, even Syria.  Nonetheless, regrettably, these humanitarian crises are slipping from the international agenda and are severely underfunded.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a clear focus on forgotten crises in our humanitarian response and we have maintained consistent support to the crises in CAR and DRC in recent years.  Earlier this month, I approved an additional &euro;6 million for these two crises.  This funding has already been provided through contributions of &euro;3 million each to UN managed DRC and CAR Humanitarian Funds.  These funds allow donors to pool their contributions to support the humanitarian efforts of NGOs and UN agencies on the ground, who are best placed to respond.  This ensures that the most urgent needs can be met quickly, be they for food, shelter, health or protection for the most vulnerable. </p>  <p>  This 2017 allocation brings our total humanitarian assistance to DRC and CAR since 2012 to over &euro;32 million and &euro;25 million respectively. We will continue to keep these evolving crises under review.  I expect that further funding for the crisis in the Central African Republic will be allocated in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Total bilateral trade was worth approximately &euro;1.96 billion in 2015, with the balance, &euro;1.6 billion, greatly in Ireland&rsquo;s favour.  Total trade in goods in 2016 was worth &euro;840,729, of which exports accounted for &euro;821 million, with medical and pharmaceutical products, and food ingredients as the principle exports.  Trade in services figures for 2016 are not yet available.  The economic relationship with Saudi Arabia therefore has considerable benefits for the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  Last November, I led a trade mission to the Gulf, accompanied by a diverse range of Irish companies, some of which are seeking to enter the Gulf markets for the first time and some of which are seeking to strengthen their position in those markets.  I undertook a large number of engagements in support of these companies, and I saw first-hand the interest that Irish companies have in the Saudi market.</p>  <p>  The economic partnership that we have with Saudi Arabia does not prevent us from raising human rights issues in the appropriate channels.  For example, on my November visit to the Kingdom, I had a meeting with the Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Dr Nizar Madani.  We had a discussion around human rights, including the position of women in society and the use of the death penalty.  The Irish Embassy in Riyadh raises human rights issues directly with the Saudi authorities including, most recently, issues around religious freedom and the death penalty.  We also raise human rights matters in conjunction with other EU missions in Saudi Arabia.  Further, officials from my Department here in Dublin raise specific human rights cases with the Saudi Embassy in Dublin when the need arises.</p>  <p>  Regarding the parts of the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the UN, the UN is a forum for dialogue and partnership, for all 193 of its Member States.  At the core of Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the UN is our belief in shared responsibility, and that the values of our foreign policy &ndash; peace and security, justice, equality and sustainability &ndash; must remain at the centre of the work of the UN. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the UN and his staff interact with all member states on a wide range of issues, including our national priorities across the three pillars of the UN&rsquo;s work, namely, peace and security, development, and human rights.  We recognise that no State by itself can resolve the vast challenges the world faces.  We therefore see great merit in an inclusive UN, where all member states have a voice and an opportunity to contribute to its work.</p>  <p>  Since 1947, the rules of procedure governing General Assembly elections provide that UN elections take place by secret ballot.  The well-established convention among the 193 Member States of the UN is that votes are not publicly disclosed, as to do so could seriously damage the management and conduct of sensitive international relations between States of very different views and political backgrounds.  It would also likely seriously disadvantage smaller States.  Accordingly, I do not propose to abandon a practice that has been in place for over six decades and observed by all previous governments.  To do so would be harmful to Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to engage at the UN, and harmful to our capacity to conduct sensitive international relations.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that in the election to the Commission on the Status of Women, the Asia-Pacific Group put forward five States for five seats on the 45-member Commission, which produces non-binding conclusions on an annual basis.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a very strong record on promoting the rights of women and girls at the UN.  We are a leading voice in this field and we currently chair the Commission for the Status of Women.</p>  <p>  We will continue to maintain relations with Saudi Arabia: economic, for the benefit of our economy and trade; and diplomatic, to facilitate our continued engagement with the Kingdom on human rights and also on other matters as they arise.</p></reply>

The target is currently being met despite large volumes of applications.  It has been in place for over a year and is communicated very clearly in all An Post promotional materials and on my Department&rsquo;s website as well as in public communications.  My Department also keeps An Post apprised of any fluctuations in the average turnaround time. I would be grateful to the Deputy if he would provide me with details of Post Offices where inaccurate turnaround times are being advised and I will have any such cases examined in conjunction with An Post.</p>  <p>  It is very important that applicants choose the most appropriate channel, depending on their individual circumstances. Passport Express should only be used by those who are travelling in three weeks or more.  Anyone renewing a passport who needs to travel in under fifteen working days should either apply online or by appointment at the Passport Office in either Dublin or Cork.  The Online Passport Application Service enables adults to renew their passports within ten working days, plus time for postage, without the need for paperwork or witnesses.  This is a fast, secure and convenient way to renew a passport and I urge Deputies to encourage all eligible applicants to make use of it. </p>  <p>  Anyone whose travel plans do not allow time to apply online or through Passport Express should make an appointment on the Department&rsquo;s website to submit an application in person at the Passport Office in Dublin or Cork.  Applicants who need their applications processed within three working days and have proof of travel pay an additional fee.</p>  <p>  Expediting significant numbers of Passport Express applications is not a realistic option.  Having staff locate individual applications among the 80,000 or so that are being processed at any one time during busy season is time-consuming and disruptive given the limits of the existing processing system. It would also have possible knock-on consequences for other applicants.  It is neither equitable nor operationally efficient to process certain applications ahead of others in the same queue.</p>  <p>  I do appreciate that there are situations in which people are faced with genuine emergencies that require them to travel abroad.  In limited circumstances, such as the illness or death of an immediate family member abroad, a Passport Express application can be expedited ahead of the fifteen working day target without any additional charge.  Anyone who finds themselves in such a genuine emergency and does not have an application already in the system will be accommodated without an appointment at the public offices in Dublin and Cork.</p>  <p>  It is best practice in all cases to apply for a new passport in plenty of time and to allow at least six weeks for a passport to be processed in case any issues such as incomplete documentation arise. </p>  <p>  First-time applicants in particular should note that their applications will take longer to process due to security considerations and the complex checks involved.  This is widely publicised and advised on the Passport Express receipt. At the moment, the average turnaround time for these applications is 24 working days - four days over target. </p>  <p>  I strongly advise that applicants check the remaining validity on passports before booking travel, paying particular attention to the validity of children's passports, which are shorter.  My Department provides a free e-mail renewal reminder service to all passports holders, available on our website.  I urge Deputies to join me in promoting that service so that people can avoid the stress of making last-minute applications. </p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government highlights this priority, with specific reference to implementation of the All-Party D&aacute;il motions relating to the Dublin Monaghan bombings.</p>  <p>  The 17 May marked the 43rd anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, which saw the biggest loss of life in a single day during the Troubles. </p>  <p>  I was glad to participate on behalf of the Government in the commemoration ceremony on that day, to stand - along with other Deputies - in solidarity with the victims of the appalling attacks in Dublin and Monaghan, 43 years ago.  As I said in addressing the commemoration ceremony, the Government is determined to continue - and to complete - our efforts to seek the truth of those awful events of 17 May 1974.</p>  <p>  The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings that was adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May last year has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  The Taoiseach has raised the issue with Prime Minister May, emphasising the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the D&aacute;il motions.  I have also raised the matter on a number of occasions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, and am actively engaging with the British Government on an ongoing basis, as are my officials. </p>  <p>  In our discussions, I have advised Secretary of State Brokenshire that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin Monaghan atrocities.  I have also underlined to the Secretary of State that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and emphasised the urgent need for a response from the British Government.</p>  <p>  Secretary of State Brokenshire has acknowledged the importance that the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann attach to this case, but indicated that the British Government is still considering how it could respond in a way which would adequately address the motions and be consistent with its obligations.</p>  <p>  Further to these discussions, I wrote to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 17 May this year, to formally reiterate the request on behalf of the Irish Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the expectation of a timely response to the all-Party Motions on the Dublin Monaghan bombings.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to pursue this matter with the British Government, urging them to provide a satisfactory response to the motions that have been adopted by this House.  The Taoiseach and I will also continue our engagement with party leaders in the Oireachtas on the issue.</p>  <p>  There are many families throughout these islands and beyond who continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one, but also with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events.  Accordingly, the establishment of a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement, is a priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  There has been intensive engagement on legacy issues as part of the current talks&rsquo; process in Belfast that will resume after the UK general election on 8 June.  In these discussions, I have been very clear on the urgent need to achieve progress, so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and to support broader societal healing and reconciliation.  I have also emphasised in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties, the need to ensure that legacy inquests are properly resourced, and urged all with responsibilities in relation to the legacy inquests to move forward as quickly as possible to implement the helpful proposals of the Lord Chief Justice.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue its intensive engagement with the British Government and the political parties to move forward with the Stormont House legacy framework, and I hope that this can be achieved in the period immediately ahead.</p></reply>

Membership of these bodies is an important aspect of Member State engagement at the UN and many view participation in these bodies as part of their responsibilities as UN members.</p>  <p>  UN bodies have differing rules of procedure governing elections, and it is necessary for Member States to follow these rules. In certain circumstances voting is limited to members of particular bodies.  For example, only members of the Economic and Social Council are eligible to vote in elections to its subsidiary bodies, including the Commission on the Status of Women.</p>  <p>  Many of the 193 Member States of the UN present candidatures for election from time to time. In some instances it is the State itself which stands for election, for example in seeking to join the Human Rights Council.  In other cases, Member States nominate individuals for UN positions.  An example of this would be for membership of UN human rights treaty bodies. </p>  <p>  Many factors are considered by my Department when reaching decisions regarding elections to UN bodies.  Where candidatures are for the appointment of individuals to a UN body, a candidate&rsquo;s relevant professional experience and academic qualifications; ensuring equitable geographic representation of the body in question; and gender balance are among the criteria given consideration in advance of an election. </p>  <p>  In relation to the election of Member States to UN bodies, the need to ensure equitable geographic representation is also of importance.  However, in many cases this element may be regulated by the rules of procedure of the relevant body, with a particular number of seats allocated to each regional group in advance.  Other factors of importance which are considered in advance of such elections include Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relationship with the Member State in question, as well as their track record at the UN and their record of achievement or progress on issues relevant to the body to which membership is being sought. </p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland attaches significant weight to the principle of rotation.  It is essential to securing representation from a cross-section of the membership over time that a wide range of States have the opportunity to secure positions to allow for the airing of the broadest possible range of views, something which is important for the legitimacy and proper functioning of the UN.  This can affect most acutely small countries, such as Ireland, or those with fewer resources.</p>  <p>  The candidature of a Member State or State representative cannot be assessed in isolation.  It is important, therefore, to assess the merits of candidatures relative to each other in deciding how Ireland&rsquo;s vote is to be cast.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-30a.130.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000059#WRD00500"><p>As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is determined to ensure that all aspects of the Agreement are fully respected through the process of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union, and thereafter.  Our priority is to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement and the overall integrity of the settlement is not in any way disturbed by the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union.  All provisions of the Agreement must be respected, including those relating to human rights.</p><p>As a result of intensive political and diplomatic engagement by the Government, our EU partners and the EU institutions are fully aware and supportive of the importance of respecting the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and protecting the gains of the peace process.  On 29 April the European Council adopted Guidelines for the EU-UK negotiations which include a strong acknowledgment of the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland and explicitly recognise the importance of preserving the achievements, benefits, and commitments of the Good Friday Agreement.  This is further strengthened by the statement agreed by the European Council on the same day, acknowledging that the Good Friday Agreement provides for an agreed mechanism whereby a united Ireland may be brought about and that, in accordance with international law, the entire territory of such a united Ireland would thus be part of the European Union.  Therefore, the EU approach in the negotiations will be to ensure that the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement will not be negatively impacted by the Article 50 process and the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU and that the primacy of the Good Friday Agreement is fully taken into account.</p><p>Under the Good Friday Agreement the people of Northern Ireland have the right to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British or both.  The protection of the unique status of Irish citizens in Northern Ireland is one of the Government&rsquo;s objectives in the EU-UK negotiations, and importantly this has been explicitly referenced in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating directives that were adopted by the General Affairs Council on 22 May, which state that <i>&ldquo;full account should be taken of the fact that Irish citizens residing in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy rights as EU citizens.&rdquo; </i></p><p>The withdrawal agreement should therefore contain no impediment to Irish citizens in Northern Ireland accessing programmes and services across the EU to which they are eligible, including those as may be provided for in any arrangements on the future relationship between the EU and the UK. </p><p>The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland law, including through the incorporation into law of the European Convention on Human Rights, is one of the key principles underpinning the Good Friday Agreement.  It is important to be clear that the European Convention on Human Rights is separate and distinct to the European Union.  The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU has no impact on its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Even after the UK leaves the EU, there remains a continuing obligation on the British Government to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law, as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.  In this regard, I welcome the clarification in the UK Government&rsquo;s White Paper on withdrawal from the EU that it has no plans to leave the European Convention on Human Rights.</p><p>On 13 February, I convened a Sectoral Dialogue on Human Rights under the Good Friday Agreement to hear the views of civil society, North and South, on the possible implications of Brexit for this pivotal chapter of the Agreement.  This was a very valuable exchange and a number of key themes emerged, which have been communicated publicly, and which will inform the Government&rsquo;s approach in this area.  Further detailed work will be needed, with the committed support of all with responsibilities in this area, to ensure that the UK departure from the European Union does not adversely affect the human rights provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>Finally, I would also note that the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland is a headline priority for the Government in the EU-UK negotiations.  As the most tangible symbol of the peace process, the open border is essential to social and economic well-being on both parts of the island and to the further normalisation of relationships, following the difficult decades of the Troubles.  The avoidance of a hard border will require flexibility and creativity on the part of both the UK and the EU, and this is acknowledged in the Guidelines agreed by the European Council on 29 April.  As provided for in the Guidelines, the EU&rsquo;s approach will provide for the objective of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, consistent with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations as an EU Member State and fully respecting EU law.</p><p>The inclusion of the specific references to Ireland&rsquo;s key priorities in the EU negotiating guidelines highlights their acceptance by our EU partners as shared priorities for the European Union in the negotiation process with the UK.  We are not under any illusions about the challenge and complexity of these negotiations and have engaged in detailed and ongoing planning in order to prepare for them.  </p><p>In the forthcoming negotiations, the Government will pursue, together with our EU partners, an outcome that protects our headline priorities and Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental interests, including to ensure respect for all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement. </p></reply>

Migration has featured on the agenda of almost every European Councils in the same period and will be on the agenda of next month&rsquo;s European Council too.  It has also featured prominently on the Foreign Affairs and Justice and Home Affairs&rsquo; Council agendas.</p>  <p>  The EU has responded to the crisis by adopting a range of measures to deal with this mass movement of people.  These have included engaging with countries of origin and transit to address the root causes of migration including through bespoke Migration Compacts; agreeing a plan to relocate migrants from Italy and Greece across the Union; the launching of Operation Sophia to disrupt people smuggling in the Mediterranean; and substantial financial assistance to countries hosting large numbers of migrants.  EU Heads of State and Government concluded a landmark migration deal with Turkey in March 2016, which has resulted in a very substantial reduction in the number of migrants risking their lives at sea to enter the EU from Turkey.  </p>  <p>  In the past year the focus has shifted from Turkey to the so-called Central Mediterranean Route, with some 181,000 migrants crossing from Libya to Italy in 2016. In March 2017, EU leaders issued the Malta Declaration, which sets out the EU&rsquo;s commitment to assist Libya, with a strong focus on capacity building.  This includes training, equipment and support for the Libyan national coast guard and other relevant agencies, as well as seeking to ensure adequate reception capacities and conditions in Libya for migrants, including through working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration.</p>  <p>  The migration crisis is being driven variously by war, political instability, corruption, economic deprivation and human rights abuses.  These need to be addressed in a holistic and strategic way incorporating immediate and long-term measures, both of which are part of the EU&rsquo;s ongoing migration strategy.  </p></reply>

Both Governments agreed on the need for intensive engagement to address outstanding issues and commitments to ensure the early establishment of an Executive.  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, both Governments have a role to play in supporting the effective operation of the devolved institutions, and in upholding both the letter and the spirit of the Agreement as a whole, in the interests of all in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  In this context I am representing the Government in the currently paused talks&rsquo; process in Belfast.  The talks have two objectives.  Firstly, to allow the political parties to reach an agreement on the formation of a new Executive.  Secondly, to address the implementation of outstanding issues from previous Agreements. </p>  <p>  Since the talks began in early March, good work has been done collectively by the five parties and there has been encouraging movement across a range of areas, but a number of key issues remain still to be resolved.  As part of my engagement with the Secretary of State and with each of the parties over eight weeks of talks&rsquo; so far, I have strongly emphasised the critical importance of forming a new Executive so that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests can be effectively represented, as part of the process of the EU-UK negotiations which are about to commence.  I very much hope that the necessary agreement between the parties will be reached on the formation of the Executive as soon as possible, so that it can directly represent the interests of Northern Ireland in these negotiations which are of major significance to its citizens. </p>  <p>  Following the announcement of the general election in the UK, I held further contacts with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties.  There was a widespread view that given the demands and constraints of the election campaign, the best course would be to pause the talks until after the general election takes place on 8 June.  This pause was agreed on 27 April.</p>  <p>  The new legislative deadline for forming the Executive is 29 June.  There will therefore be a sufficient opportunity after June 8 for the talks to resume and for the parties, with the appropriate support and involvement of the two Governments, to re-engage on the urgent task of forming a new Executive and taking forward the implementation of outstanding commitments from previous Agreements.</p>  <p>  I believe there is a shared determination on the part of all parties to renew their engagement on the key issues in the talks, once the UK general election has taken place.  The Irish Government will continue, in cooperation with the British Government, to support and facilitate the parties in their efforts to reach agreement.  It is critically important to see devolved Government restored and working effectively in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland, in particular in the context of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union.</p></reply>

While there is always scope for exploring the expansion of areas of cooperation and the work of the North South Bodies, in line with the Good Friday Agreement, such expansion must of course obtain the agreement of the Northern Ireland Assembly. </p><p>All the North South Bodies are continuing to operate effectively, making a considerable contribution towards economic growth right across the island and demonstrating what can be achieved when we pool our resources in key strategic areas.  For instance, Tourism Ireland and InterTradeIreland are playing continuing and central roles in supporting the all island economy.</p><p>Tourism Ireland is driving record tourism numbers and spend to this island.  InterTradeIreland is building vital exporting capacity among our small and medium enterprises and assisting SMEs in navigating the challenges of Brexit through its new advisory service and is carrying out important research into various trade scenarios.</p><p>We are already seeing greater cooperation in term of working on sporting events, such as the 2023 Rugby World Cup bid and both parts of the island are jointly hosting the Women&rsquo;s tournament this year. </p><p>The Radiotherapy Unit at Altnagelvin Hospital is now operational and is a flagship examplar of the benefits to citizens of North South cooperation.  This jointly funded Unit is now providing access to Radiotherapy Services to over a half million people across the north west of the island. Paediatric cardiac care on the island is also benefitting from strong collaboration between the respective Health Departments, North and South. </p><p>The Government remains engaged with the political parties in Northern Ireland.  I am hopeful that, after talks resume following the UK General Election on 8 June, a new Northern Ireland Executive can be put in place by 29 June and that North South Ministerial Council meetings will recommence at the earliest opportunity thereafter to enable further important engagement on progressing all-island cooperation in general and on addressing the challenges of Brexit.  </p></reply>

As regards throughput generally for incoming passengers to Dublin Airport, information supplied by the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) in relation to queue times for arriving passengers at the Airport shows that over 90% of all travellers are processed through immigration control in a matter of minutes with the percentage figure being even higher for passengers of EU nationalities.  This is in the context of passenger numbers at Dublin Airport reaching record levels last year with almost 28 million passengers using the Airport.  </p>  <p>  However, there are specific pressure points outside of the control of the immigration authorities that can create some delay.  Typically, this arises when a very high number of flights arrive within a specific time period (which happens at Terminal 1 in the late evening period) and the consequent increased passenger numbers within these peak times, can impact on queuing times over these periods.  This situation is compounded when, in addition to scheduled arrivals, delayed flights also land during these peak periods. </p>  <p>  Additional staff have been recruited for the Airport and the allocation of immigration personnel is designed to have the maximum number of staff on duty during these peak periods so that all available immigration booths are operational at these times.  The number of available booths is a function of the physical infrastructure at the Terminal.  Every effort is made by immigration officers to exercise their function as speedily as possible consistent with the requirement to protect our borders and facilitate legitimate travellers. </p>  <p>  While the immigration authorities at Dublin Airport have no control over the number of flights or their arrival times, they have an excellent relationship with the Dublin Airport Authority and air carriers and work closely together across a number of fronts to address capacity and queue management issues where they arise, to alleviate congestion and maximise passenger throughput thus ensuring that waiting times are kept to a minimum.  </p>  <p>  I might add that a procurement exercise has been recently completed for the deployment of a permanent electronic-Gate facility at Dublin Airport.  The new electronic Gates are expected to be available for use by passengers in the Autumn.  However, while the introduction of the electronic gates should contribute overall to increased immigration processing capacity, the facility is primarily an immigration control facility rather than a queue management tool aimed at addressing spikes in passenger arrivals.   </p></reply>

This is the first step of the visa application process.</p><p>The applicant must then print off the two page summary sheet, sign and date it, and along with all the required supporting documentation, submit the application to the appropriate office.  Full contact details for the appropriate office are on the summary sheet.  However, this documentation has not yet been received by the Honorary Consul in Manila and therefore the application cannot be processed.  </p><p>The INIS website (<i>)</i>contains comprehensive guidelines to assist the applicant with the application process.  The information contained on the website is for guidance purposes only and does not limit the discretion of the Visa Officer in dealing with individual applications.</p><p>Such applications, where the sponsor is an Irish national, can normally be expected to be dealt with within 6 months of receipt of all the required documentation as set out in the Policy Document on Non-EEA Family Reunification.  This is a business target which reflects the detailed assessment that is required to be carried out in relation to applications for family reunification.  It does not constitute a legal obligation and such applications may take longer due to the individual circumstances of the application or to the number of applications within the visa category and the resources available to process them.  </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited<font color="#000080">.  </font></p><p>In addition, applicants may themselves e-mail queries directly to INIS (<i>visamail@justice.ie</i>).</p></reply>

One of the conditions attached to an applicant being granted permission to remain in the State for the purpose of the examination of their application is that they do not leave or attempt to leave the State without the consent of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  This condition is provided at section 16(3)(a) of the Act.  An applicant who contravenes this condition will be guilty of an offence and will be liable on summary conviction to a class D fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month or both. </p>  <p>  The Act is not aimed at tacking abuses of EU Free Movement per se.  However, in order to protect the integrity of the Common Travel Area, Section 81 of the Act amends the Immigration Act 2004 to provide that an immigration officer may refuse permission to land to a person who had permission to be in the United Kingdom within the previous 12 months and who travelled to Ireland from there for the purpose of extending his or her stay in the Common Travel Area.  Section 20(1)(e)(ii) of the Act provides that an immigration officer or a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may arrest an applicant without warrant if  the officer or member suspects, with reasonable cause, that the person has acted or intends to act in a manner that would undermine any arrangements relating to the Common Travel Area.</p></reply>

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is being commenced on a phased basis.</p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission, must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced.  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service (DSS) and this work is ongoing.</p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016.  These provisions were brought into operation in order to enable the process of recruitment of the Director of the DSS to begin.  The recruitment and appointment of the Director of the DSS, and the appointment of DSS staff, is a matter for the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health) with the approval of the Minister for Health.  My Department does not have any statutory function in relation to the recruitment and appointment of the Director.</p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the key preparations will be put in place during the remainder of this year under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for commencement orders for the remaining provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 that fall under my remit to be made on a carefully phased basis when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options.  It is not possible at the moment to provide an exact time line for the finalisation of these commencement orders, not least because we will need to have the Director of the DSS in place to fully ascertain the time-line.  The post of Director was advertised by the Public Appointments Service on 7 April and it is expected that the Director will be in place during the summer.</p>  <p>  However, my firm intention is that the necessary arrangements will be in place to enable commencement of the substantive provisions of the Act early in 2018.</p></reply>

The making of valuations for rating purposes is his sole responsibility.  I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no functions in this regard.</p>  <p>  A valuation for commercial rates purposes is an estimate of the Net Annual Value (NAV) of a property, at a specified valuation date, on the assumption that the occupier is responsible for the payment of commercial rates and for insuring and maintaining the property.  The term "net annual value" has a legal definition set out in Section 48 of the Valuation Act 2001 as the rent for which, one year with another, the property might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes payable in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant.</p>  <p>  Estimating the NAV of a rateable property is an evidence-based exercise.  In this regard, I am advised that the Valuation Office assesses relevant market transactions including details of various rental transactions.  In accordance with the valuation legislation, best practice internationally and well-established valuation principles and case law arising from the independent Valuation Tribunal and the higher Courts, various valuation methodologies may be used in assessing the evidence available to the Valuation Office in order to arrive at the NAV of a rateable property.  The most common method used is the "comparison" method which, as the name implies, employs direct comparison with other similar properties.  In the absence of direct comparative evidence of value, two other methods may be used.  The first of these is what is known as the "receipts and expenditure" method of valuation where trading accounts are analysed to arrive at the rent which a hypothetical tenant might be reasonably expected to expend on the property.  This method is used in particular to value certain classes of properties such as licensed premises, hotels and service stations by reference to the trading data associated with the particular property.  Another method of valuation used from time to time, depending on the particular circumstances and type of property involved, is the "contractor's method", where the notional cost of construction, allowing for depreciation as appropriate, and the value of the site are used to arrive at the net annual value.  This is provided for in Section 50 of the Valuation Act 2001, as amended.</p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of exemptions from rates, the basic premise of valuation legislation is that all buildings and land used or developed for any purpose, including constructions affixed thereto, are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001, as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act, 2015.  There is a specific list of 22 property types across a wide range of usages which are exempt from rates under Schedule 4, where they are described in detail.  I am advised by the Commissioner of Valuation that these categories have also been the subject of interpretation through cases before the independent Valuation Tribunal and the Higher Courts.</p></reply>

Combatting these groups remains a priority for the Government and the Garda Authorities.  The Garda&iacute; continue to take a range of actions against these groups and to disrupt their activities, and they have had many successes in this regard.  The Garda&iacute; continue to work very closely with their police and security counterparts in Northern Ireland in tackling this threat.</p>  <p>  Attacks such as the recent bomb in Manchester are a reminder that no state can be considered immune from the threat from international terrorism.  The current assessment of the threat here is that while a terrorist attack here is possible, it is unlikely and there is no specific information in relation to any threat to Ireland from international terrorism.  The level of threat is kept under constant review.  The authorities here remain in daily contact with their counterparts in the UK, the EU and beyond.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Taoiseach chaired a meeting on 25 May to review the State's arrangements and level of preparedness in the event of a major terrorist attack here.  Taoiseach and I as well as a number of other Ministers with relevant responsibilities attended, along with the Garda Commissioner, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and senior officials.  The meeting was briefed on the current threat assessment by the security authorities.  </p>  <p>  The House will understand that it is not the practice to disclose the detail of security arrangements that are in place, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has considerable operational capacities in countering terrorism and in responding to critical incidents.  There is, in particular, a highly-trained and well-equipped special intervention capability in the Emergency Response Unit that is supported by the regional Armed Support Units and the range of other resources across the Garda organisation.  The considerable skills and resources of the Defence Forces are also available in support to the civil power when and where needed.</p>  <p>  The Garda authorities are engaged in intensive, ongoing work aimed at preventing any attack taking place here.  In this regard they work closely with the Defence Forces.  Detailed preparations have also been made in the event of an attack.  Other agencies also have plans in place to deal with the outcome of major incidents.  Of its nature, much of this work cannot be disclosed publicly, but the Deputy should be assured that it goes on relentlessly.</p>  <p>  The Garda Authorities continue to work closely with their EU and other international counterparts in responding to the shared threat of international terrorism.  The Government is committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources to enhance their connectivity to a range of EU and other international resources and a significant programme of work is ongoing in this regard supported by dedicated funding.  This includes connecting to the Schengen Information System, developing the processing of travel-related data and mechanisms for the exchange of criminal fingerprint and DNA data.  </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that overall national emergency management arrangements are in place, involving all the different agencies of the State.  Co-ordinated by the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning and the Office of Emergency Planning, all the various agencies and bodies continue to work closely together in supporting co-ordinated responses to any incident that might arise.</p>  <p>  Of equal importance is the ongoing work to counter radicalisation.  It is important to ensure that in the context of attacks such as that in Manchester, our Muslim community is not unfairly stigmatised.  The Garda&iacute; have developed a strong model of community-level interaction with minority communities in the State, including our Muslim community, and will maintain that interaction in order to serve those communities and to ensure that vulnerable individuals within those communities can be supported appropriately.</p></reply>

Section 15 of the Act provides that the Minister may, in her absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  The statutory conditions are that the applicant must -</p><p>- be (i) of full age, or (ii) a minor born in the State,</p><p>- be of good character,</p><p>- have had one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a further total residence in the State amounting to four years,</p><p>- intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation,</p><p>- have, <font color="#212100">before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows-</font></p><p><font color="#212100">(i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and</font></p><p><font color="#212100">(ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.</font></p><p>Section 16 of the Act provides that the Minister may, in her absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations (defined as being related by blood, adoption or affinity to a person who is or is entitled to be an Irish citizen); where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the UN Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons.  There is no right or entitlement to have any of the conditions waived even where the applicant comes within the certain circumstances outlined, it is entirely at the Minister's discretion.</p><p>It is open to any individual to lodge an application for a certificate of naturalisation if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Act.  A determination on whether an applicant satisfies the statutory criteria attendant to naturalisation can only be made after an application is received and I understand no application for naturalisation has been received on behalf of the individual concerned.  </p><p>All applications are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.  While most cases are now generally processed within six months, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p><p>Detailed information on Irish citizenship and naturalisation, as well as the relevant application forms, is available on the INIS website at www.inis.gov.ie.  The website also contains guidance on the completion of an application for naturalisation.</p></reply>

Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State, 2,622 through the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, 1,040 (519 by the end of 2016 and the remainder in 2017) under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focussed on resettling refugees from Lebanon, and the balance through a variety of mechanisms.  Some elements of this intake, such as the relocation strand, come with a time limit of two years and other elements are not time limited.  </p>  <p>  As regards the resettlement strand of the Programme Ireland had taken in 519 of the original commitment of 520 by the end of 2016 a year ahead of schedule.  Last year the Government doubled its commitment under resettlement to 1,040 and the total to have arrived from Lebanon under refugee resettlement now stands at 779.  The remaining 261 persons to arrive under resettlement have been selected and assessed and are expected to arrive later in the year.</p>  <p>  In terms of the relocation aspect of the IRPP, allocations under the relevant EU Council Decisions are composed of three elements: </p>  <p>  - an intake from Greece of 1,089 asylum seekers</p>  <p>  - an intake from Italy of 623 asylum seekers and </p>  <p>  - an allocation of 910 asylum seekers which has not yet been assigned to either Italy or Greece.</p>  <p>  Ireland will meet in full its commitment to Greece.  459 of the allocation of 1,089 are already in the State and a further 320 have been assessed and are awaiting transportation.  A further mission to assess the next 100 is scheduled to take place in Athens next week and missions to fill the remaining 210 places under this strand of the Programme have been scheduled with the Greek authorities between now and September 2017.  However, as explained in responses to a related parliamentary question tabled by the Deputy last week, Italy, unlike Greece, will not permit security assessments to be undertaken by other States on its territory.  Accordingly, Ireland has been unable to undertake security assessments on its territory of the asylum seeker cohort eligible for relocation to Ireland.  It has therefore not been possible for Ireland to take asylum seekers from Italy.  Intensive efforts are ongoing to resolve this, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level, including through the European Commission.  A solution may yet emerge from a recent meeting held in Rome between senior officials from Ireland and Italy. </p>  <p>   In terms of the unallocated portion contained in the two EU Council Decisions referred to above, which in the case of Ireland amounts to  910 persons, Ireland cannot access this component until a decision is taken at EU level to allocate these numbers as between Greece and Italy.  It is understood that the European  Commission are examining allocating this "unassigned" portion and if they do Ireland will immediately work towards relocating them. </p>  <p>  Ireland is doing everything it can to give effect to the EU relocation Decisions and what can unambiguously be said is that, should it be the case that despite all Ireland's efforts, the relocation mechanism does not permit Ireland to take in sufficient numbers of asylum seekers under relocation, then the Government commitment to take in 4,000 people remains and Ireland will take in these numbers through other mechanisms should this prove necessary.</p></reply>

This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original vetting disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.  Furthermore, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date.  Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform that Deputy that at present, 80% of overall vetting applications are being processed by the National Vetting Bureau in five working days.  This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-Vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations.  The e-Vetting system is available to all registered organisations and the Garda Authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-Vetting system to do so.  In circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is largely obviated. </p>  <p>  That said, there are certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  Section 12(3)(A) of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that two or more relevant organisations can enter into a joint written agreement in relation to the employment, contracting, permitting or placement of an person to undertake relevant work or activities thereby providing for only one of the organisations being required to conduct vetting in respect of that person.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I have been advised by the Commissioner that as of the 31 March 2017 there were 378 Garda with 20 Garda Reserves and 31 civilians attached to the Donegal Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>This plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that just under 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide 17 of whom were assigned to the Donegal Division.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end -  an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; including Community Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division including the Donegal Division in the coming years.  To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates a new recruitment drive was launched by the Commissioner earlier this month with a closing date of 1 June.  The competition is being undertaken by the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner and applications should be made to<i>www.publicjobs.ie.</i></p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p><p>For the Deputy's information, I have set out in tabular form the strength of the Donegal Division in the years 2011, 2014 and 2016 as provided by the Commissioner.</p><p><b>Donegal

Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>The redevelopment of Donegal Garda Station is included in the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021, which I launched in October 2015, and I understand from the Garda authorities that proposals to extend and upgrade the Station have now been agreed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The OPW is currently progressing planning and tender documents and it is envisaged that a planning application will be lodged shortly, after which a six week consultation period is required.  The tender for the works is expected to issue once planning permission has been granted.  I further understand that the OPW is currently engaged in securing alternative accommodation for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the period during which the planned works are to be carried out.</p><p>In relation to Garda vehicles, I can inform the Deputy that ,between the years 2011 to 2014 the numbers of Garda vehicles in the Donegal Division fell from 71 to 60.  However, as at 25 May 2017, the latest date for which figures are currently available, the number of Garda vehicles in the Division stands at 71.  The recent increase in vehicle numbers is a consequence of the significant Government investment in the Garda fleet. As the Deputy will be aware, some &euro;46 million is being invested in the Fleet over the lifetime of the Capital Plan 2016-2021.  The actual expenditure in new and replacement vehicles over the period 2013 to 2016 was in the region of &euro;40 million.  This works out at average expenditure of &euro;10 million per annum compared to an average of &euro;1.6 million over the three year period 2009 to 2011 for example. </p><p>I have been advised by the Commissioner that as of the 31 March 2017 there were 378 Garda with 20 Garda Reserves and 31 civilians attached to the Donegal Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, at the request of the Policing Authority, is carrying out a review of the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities.  The Authority has informed the Inspectorate that the review should take account of:</p><p>-  the changing environments in rural, developing urban and suburban areas;</p><p>-  the views of local communities;</p><p>-  the allocation to and deployment of Garda resources at the local policing level, including the use of the Garda Reserve, Garda facilities and Garda equipment; and</p><p>-  relevant recommendations made in previous Inspectorate reports.</p><p>The review will be comprehensive including a consultative process with local communities.  It is the view of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate that the review should be completed within the first half of 2018.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. </p><p>This plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner that, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, 17 newly-attested recruits were assigned to the Donegal Division.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end -  an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; including Community Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Donegal Division, in the coming years.  To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates a new recruitment drive was launched by the Commissioner earlier this month with a closing date of 1 June.  The competition is being undertaken by the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner and applications should be made to <i>www.publicjobs.ie.</i></p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>- be without one or both legs;</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p><p>The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Scheme.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p><p>The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the grant assistance towards the cost of fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;65 million to the Exchequer in 2016.  This figure does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p><p>I am aware that the Ombudsman has made comments regarding the eligibility criteria of the Disabled Driver and Disabled Passengers Scheme.  The Ombudsman stated that, in his opinion, the criteria were narrowly focused and prescriptive.  The Scheme and qualifying criteria were designed specifically for those with severe physical disabilities and are, therefore, necessarily precise.  </p><p>I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities.  I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria.  While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-30a.257.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000061#WRF00900"><p>I am conscious of the difficulties that the absence or withdrawal of flood insurance cover can cause to householders and businesses alike, and that is one of the reasons the Government has been prioritising investment in flood defences over the last number of years in order to minimise the risk of flooding.  </p>  <p>  However, the provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept as they need to adequately provision to meet those risks.  In my role as Minister for Finance, I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation, and neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. </p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.  This in turn should lead to the increased availability of flood insurance.  To achieve this aim, there is a focus on:</p>  <p>   - prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities,</p>  <p>   - development and implementation of plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes, and</p>  <p>   - improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas. </p>  <p>  While it is not possible for me to comment in detail on individual cases without the full facts,  I am advised by the OPW that following the severe flood events in Dublin of October 2011, the Camac catchment in which Kilmainham is situated, was prioritised in the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme being undertaken by the OPW.  While no overall cost-beneficial solution was found for the Camac catchment within the CFRAM study, OPW has proposed to Dublin City Council (DCC) that DCC carry out a further assessment on a more localised basis.  I am informed that this work is now being progressed by DCC and South Dublin County Council with assistance and funding provided by OPW. </p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland has informed me that its members, since 1 June 2014, have factored data on all completed flood defence schemes, provided by the OPW, into its assessment of flood risk within these areas.  This information has been provided as part of an information sharing arrangement entered into between OPW and Insurance Ireland (Memorandum of Understanding).  The nature of this arrangement is such that it should lead to a greater availability of flood cover in previously higher risk areas, and at better prices. </p>  <p>  The most recent Insurance Ireland survey of approximately 85% of the property insurance market in Ireland indicates that of the 16 completed defence schemes, 90% of policies in areas benefiting from permanent flood defences include flood cover, while 77% of policies in areas benefiting from demountable defences include flood cover.  The particular issues in relation to the remainder of policies is actively being explored with the insurance industry through a working group in which the OPW, the insurance industry and the Department of Finance participate.  Further meetings of this group are scheduled this month.</p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.  In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance and believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.</p></reply>

As outlined for Deputy Doherty in PQ number 24 of the 18/05/2017 the Commission&rsquo;s guidance on the implementation of the &lsquo;unusual event clause&rsquo; in the preventative arm of the Stability and Growth pact (SGP) allows for exceptional spending directly linked to unusual events outside of the control of Government, if this spending does not endanger fiscal sustainability in the medium term.  This clause is granted on the basis of individual case-by-case assessments and, to date, has only been granted to six Member States in light of refugee-related costs and to three Member States following submissions based upon security-related expenditure.  It should also be noted that any Member State availing of this clause must still meet their SGP obligations when the additional spending on the unusual event provided for in the clause is excluded. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, any application for leniency under this clause would require that Ireland demonstrate that the British exit from the EU has had a &ldquo;major impact on the financial position of the general government&rdquo;.  Objectively, no such material impact on Ireland&rsquo;s general government balance has been observed to date.  This is not surprising given that the negotiation on the terms of the UK exit have yet to commence in substance and will not conclude until 2019.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the European Commission has repeatedly emphasised that budgetary discipline is assessed against reference values that do not differentiate amongst different types of expenditure.  Any deficit-financed expenditure must be repaid through future taxes.  Any rule that grants special treatment to certain kinds of public expenditures could create incentives for creative accounting. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless Ireland will explore existing and possible future EU measures that could potentially assist Ireland in mitigating the effects of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal on specific Irish businesses and economic sectors.  Ireland will also, in light of developments, continue to make a strong case at EU level that the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal represents a serious disturbance to the Irish economy overall and that we will require support. </p></reply>

Work was carried out in the Department to assess the potential economic and financial sector implications arising, including the study, published in November 2015, under the ESRI-Department of Finance research programme, entitled 'Scoping the Possible Economic Implications of Brexit on Ireland'.  The Department's work has been carried out within the whole-of-Government arrangements overseen by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  Following the result of the UK referendum, work has been intensified across the whole of Government level, including in my own Department, to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are protected in the negotiations at EU level and to ensure that Ireland will be in position to mitigate the negative economic impacts arising from Brexit.  In my own Department, a Brexit Unit was established in July 2016, within the EU and International Division, to oversee and coordinate this work and to act as a key liaison point with the Department of the Taoiseach, in particular.  In addition, the Department of Finance staff complement in the Irish Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels has been strengthened.  The challenge which we face as a result of Brexit is mainstreamed across all divisions of my Department and this is reflected in business planning. </p>  <p>  The Department of Finance contingency work is ongoing and rightly continues to examine all scenarios, including the scenario of the UK leaving the EU without an agreement in place.  This work is an important input to the whole-of-Government work being overseen by the Department of the Taoiseach.  In accordance with its role, my Department continues to monitor the economic impacts and carry out relevant analysis, and to frame budgetary policy advice in this new context.</p>  <p>  We know from our own published research that the potential impact on the Irish economy is significant.  The medium to long term economic impacts of a &lsquo;hard Brexit&rsquo; with reversion to the WTO trade rules are set out in the November 2016 joint paper with the ESRI &lsquo;Modelling the potential macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;.  Looking at the effect ten years after a UK exit, a hard Brexit scenario results in the level of GDP being almost 4 per cent below what it otherwise would have been in a no-Brexit scenario.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that the full impact of the UK's exit is only expected to materialise over time.

It is a key Government strategy to support the growth of and investment in this important sector of the economy.  As the Deputy will be aware, there are already significant Government measures to support the financing needs of SMEs and these will be available to assist SMEs deal with the effects of Brexit.  These include the SBCI, the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices and the Credit Review Office.  </p>  <p>  Advisory supports in relation to business planning, such as those provided by the Local Enterprise Offices and Enterprise Ireland, will be particularly important in assisting SMEs that may be adversely affected due to Brexit and will help raise awareness of both private market and State  supports in this regard.</p>  <p>  Viable Irish SMEs can access sustainable, flexible and appropriately priced finance through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).  The SBCI uses an on-lending model; this means it does not lend directly to SMEs, rather it rather it channels its funds though partner financial institutions, known as on-lenders.  The SBCI currently has eight on-lending partners, three bank and five non-bank.  To the end of December 2016, the SBCI has lent &euro;544 million to 12,593 SMEs supporting 67,150 jobs with 84% of loans being used for investment purposes.  The SMEs who received SBCI finance are from a variety of business and economic sectors and are spread across every region of the country.  The SBCI is currently seeking to broaden its distribution capability and market coverage by adding new on-lenders and is working to develop innovative products, thereby serving to meet the needs of Irish SMEs and drive competition in the SME finance market. </p>  <p>  I have met with the Chief Executive of the SBCI in the context of a Cabinet Committee meeting concerning Brexit related issues.  Additionally, officials from my Department are working closely with the SBCI, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Enterprise Ireland to examine Brexit mitigation policy measures to assist SMEs to deal with the effects of Brexit.  Given the uncertainty concerning the post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU, the Deputy can rest assured that my Department will continue to monitor and address Brexit related issues facing Irish SMEs on an ongoing basis. </p></reply>

I chaired the meeting since the Minister for Finance is the Governor for Ireland of the EIB - this mirrors the position pertaining in the other 27 EU Member States.  My Cabinet colleagues, the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Education and Skills were also at the meeting, along with representatives of a range of relevant Irish Agencies.  The EIB was represented by its President Werner Hoyer, Vice-President Andrew McDowell and a number of the senior management of the EIB.  </p>  <p>  The terms of reference for the Group are:</p>  <p>  a) to raise awareness in Ireland of new EIB products and platforms;</p>  <p>  b)to encourage a strong pipeline of projects from Ireland for consideration by the EIB;</p>  <p>  c) to review the  scope for enhanced cooperation between EIB and Irish authorities;</p>  <p>  d) to examine the scope for further improving financing conditions for Irish small and medium-sized enterprises and</p>  <p>  e) to examine opportunities for using EIB financing and technical assistance to address housing, transport and other infrastructure investment requirements;</p>  <p>  The Financing Group builds upon the already strong relationship between the Irish Authorities and the EIB over recent years which has seen a significant deepening and widening of support for Irish investment projects in terms of increased amounts of funding and a wider range of areas covered by this funding.  This outcome was an important objective for the Government in its engagement with the Bank and I am pleased with the achievements secured to date. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has identified and prioritised four headline challenges in relation to Brexit: minimising the impact on our trade and economy, protecting the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining the Common Travel Area with the UK and securing Ireland&rsquo;s future in a strong European Union.</p>  <p>  The Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 is currently under review to ensure that capital spending is fully aligned with national economic and social priorities while remaining consistent with the Programme for Partnership Government objectives.  To support these objectives, there are proposed projects included in the Capital Plan which have the potential to exploit opportunities or address vulnerabilities in a given sector which may arise as a result of Brexit.  However, due to the limited fiscal space the opportunities for securing infrastructural project funding are somewhat constrained and, in addition, the Government will be challenged with determining priority projects given competing demands on its finite resources.  Following the outcome of the review of the Capital Investment Plan Government will agree on which projects will be approved.</p>  <p>  I met with the EIB in Luxembourg on 23-24 May, along with Minister Donohoe, in the second formal meeting of the EIB Ireland Financing Group.  We specifically covered the issue of Brexit in our meeting with the Bank, which again involved President Hoyer and Vice-President McDowell. At that meeting, it was agreed that the work of the Group, and its three sub-groups which met on a number of occasions earlier this year, should continue, while a number of specific action points were agreed for intensive follow-up engagement over the coming weeks and months:</p>  <p>   - the Irish authorities and EIB to explore potential financing options for delivering Metro North, drawing on EIB's knowledge and experience of financing similar projects in other countries.   </p>  <p>   - to engage in exploratory discussions in relation to EIB's knowledge and experience of different user-pay PPP or concession type models for delivering infrastructure projects - but without prejudice to decisions on project selection that will only be taken by Government following completion of the mid-term review of the capital plan, or the review of policy in relation to the future use of PPPs or concessions that is currently underway as part of the mid-term review.</p>  <p>   - to explore, partly in relation to mitigation of the impacts of Brexit on the Irish economy, the potential for EIB to become involved in funding measures to provide access to finance for the enterprise/agriculture sectors: a follow-up meeting is to be arranged in Dublin in June with relevant Departments and Agencies.</p></reply>

Accordingly, I established the Cost of Insurance Working Group and appointed Minister of State Eoghan Murphy as Chair.  This Working Group is examining the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance and identifying what short, medium and long-term measures can be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  The initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.</p>  <p>  In parallel with implementing the motor insurance recommendations, the Working Group in its second phase is examining the Employer Liability and Public Liability Insurance sectors.  The Working Group is building upon the previous work done in the motor phase in order to determine how it can be applied in the employer liability and public liability insurance claims areas particularly in relation to:</p>  <p>   - Personal Injury data and information</p>  <p>   - Effects of legal costs and litigation processes on insurance costs</p>  <p>   - Current claims compensation arrangements and cost of claims</p>  <p>   - Impact of unlawful activity on insurance sector</p>  <p>  The Working Group is also considering the impact of the cost of insurance on the competitiveness of particular business sectors, the impact of health and safety issues on the cost of insurance and other market issues.  </p>  <p>  The Working Group is continuing to meet on a regular basis to examine issues related to Employer Liability and Public Liability insurance.  The Working Group has held extensive consultations with a range of stakeholders including the Hotels Federation of Ireland, IBEC, ISME, the Vintners&rsquo; Federation of Ireland (VFI), the Licensed Vintners&rsquo; Association (LVA), the Retail Grocery Dairy &amp;amp; Allied Trades Association (RGDATA), Chambers Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority, the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) and the Law Society of Ireland.  A submission has also been received from the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association (IFA).  I would invite further submissions from interested parties to insurance@finance.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the final results of the second phase will take the form of an addendum to the existing Report.  As with the first phase, the aim is for all relevant bodies and stakeholders to work together in order to deliver fairer premiums for businesses without unnecessary delay.  </p>  <p>  As it is likely that public liability and employer liability risks are a factor in the rising cost of insurance for marts, any recommendations emerging from this review should be of relevance to the mart sector. </p></reply>

Irish pension income is taxable under Schedule E, as set out in section 19 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, and foreign pension income is taxable under Schedule D, as provided for in section 18 of the TCA. </p>  <p>  An individual who is tax resident in Ireland is liable to Irish tax on his or her worldwide income and gains in the tax year.  Where appropriate, a credit against Irish tax may be due under the terms of a double taxation agreement in respect of foreign tax paid on foreign source income and gains that are assessable here.  The level of credit available will depend on the source of the income, and the terms of the individual double taxation agreement.</p>  <p>  Schedule E income, such as Irish pensions and employment income, is subject to tax under the PAYE system, with the appropriate credits applied and tax deducted at source.  Schedule D income, such as foreign pensions, is not taxed under PAYE and so must be declared separately to Revenue, and the appropriate tax paid over.  Taxpayers who are tax resident in Ireland and who have foreign source income which has not been declared to Revenue should arrange, without delay, to provide Revenue with the necessary details so that their tax affairs can be regularised.</p>  <p>  A taxpayer who has income taxed under the PAYE system (such as an Irish pension) and who also has non-PAYE income (such as a foreign pension), may, where the non-PAYE income does not exceed &euro;5,000 for 2016 (or &euro;3,174 for prior years), request Revenue to reduce their annual PAYE tax credits and rate band entitlements, so that the tax on their non-PAYE income is deducted by their pension provider or employer.  Any such taxpayer is not considered a chargeable person and is not required to file an annual tax return.  A taxpayer whose non-PAYE income exceeds this amount, or who does not request Revenue to reduce their tax credits to take account of that income, is a chargeable person and must file an annual tax return declaring the income.</p>  <p>  I would point out that individuals aged 65 and over can avail of the age exemption limits. In order to qualify for this exemption a single individual&rsquo;s income in the year of assessment must be less than &euro;18,000 or in the case of a married couple or civil partners, &euro;36,000.

It also included a rigorous programme of enforcement action, underpinned by legislative changes that I have introduced over a number of Finance Acts to strengthen Revenue&rsquo;s powers for dealing with this kind of fraud.  In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to find a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels, which was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom from the beginning of April 2015.</p><p>Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against fuel fraud, and the relevant authorities in the State work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border enforcement structures, to tackle the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of this criminal activity.  Revenue also works in close cooperation with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat the illicit fuel trade.</p><p>Between 2013 and 2016, the quantity of auto diesel released for consumption increased by 24 per cent, but the quantity of marked gas oil fell by 5 per cent.  In the first four months of 2017, auto diesel released for consumption showed a rise of 2.2 per cent, while marked gas oil was lower by 5.2 per cent.  While there is a range of considerations influencing the levels of demand for these fuels, Revenue advises me that the combination of rigorous supply chain controls and enforcement action on their part has diminished the availability of marked gas oil for laundering.  This is borne out by the fact that the oil laundry uncovered in December 2016, in County Monaghan, was the first detected since 2014.</p><p>Revenue has undertaken research to assess the impact of the strategy to combat the illegal fuel trade.  Revenue published an analysis (available at <i></i>) in January 2015 of oil market trends and, on the basis of a comparison of extrapolated pre-2013 trends with actual results for 2013 and 2014, estimated that the strategy pursued in recent years may have saved the Exchequer between &euro;150m to &euro;200m in 2014.  Updated analysis published by Revenue (available at<i></i>)  in April 2017 shows that the impact of Revenue&rsquo;s compliance initiatives may be contributing to a further uplift in receipts from diesel of up to &euro;35m per annum (based on 2016 levels of trade).</p><p>I understand that the industry view is that the measures implemented to date have been successful in significantly curtailing fuel fraud in Ireland.  I am advised that Revenue conducted a national random sampling programme in January 2016, to obtain an updated picture on the extent of the fuel laundering problem. The programme involved a random sample involving nearly one in ten of the 2,500 holders of auto fuel trader licences.  Road diesel samples were taken from all of the traders in the programme and tested for the presence of the new marker.  No evidence of the new marker was found in any of the fuel samples tested.  The random sampling programme was repeated in 2017 and, again, no evidence of the marker was found.  The results of the sampling programmes are available at <i></i>.  This represents further persuasive evidence that the strategy pursued in recent years has been successful in addressing and curtailing significantly the fuel fraud problem.</p><p>I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against fuel fraud has achieved a considerable degree of success, and am assured that action in this area will continue to be a high priority for them.  In addition, I can assure the Deputy that full consideration will be given to any further proposals for legislative change that may be put forward by Revenue which would enhance their capacity to deal effectivity with fuel fraud and criminality.</p></reply>

A summary of these measures and their impact is set out in the table below.<table><tr><th>Tax-Head</th><th>Carryover effect &euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>Income Tax</td><td>-69</td></tr><tr><td>Universal Social Charge </td><td>-55 </td></tr><tr><td>Capital Acquisition Tax</td><td>-3</td></tr><tr><td>Excise Duties </td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>Capital Gains Tax</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Section 110 and Fund Changes* </td><td>-15</td></tr><tr><td>Tackling offshore tax evasion*</td><td>-30</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>-172</td></tr></table></p><p>*The carryover is calculated as the difference between the effect on a full year and that on 2017.  For example, in relation to Section 110, it was estimated at the time of Budget 2017, that these changes would yield &euro;50 million in 2017 and &euro;35 million is a full year, which equates to a negative &euro;15 million carryover into 2018.  While the yield from tackling offshore evasion would result in one-off yield in 2017 of &euro;30 million, and therefore represent a negative carryover of &euro;30 million in 2018.</p><p>The carryover impact of Budget 2017 current expenditure measures is outlined on Page 36, Table 9 of the Expenditure Report 2017. Based on the estimate at that time, there is an additional cost of &euro;473m arising in 2018 from the carryover impact of certain Budget 2017 expenditure measures.  This amount would need to be met from the available fiscal space or from reprioritisation of expenditure.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that carryover costs impact the fiscal space in the year in which they arise.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. </p>  <p>  The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Scheme.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.</p>  <p>  The criteria to qualify for the Scheme are necessarily precise and specific.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and fuel grant provided for members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;65 million in 2016.  This does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities and that the relief has been maintained at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria.  While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

The proposal to transfer the playing fields was the subject of discussion between the Congregation and previous ministers.  Counter proposals were put to the Congregation regarding future ownership of the fields but these were not accepted.  The Congregation has recently written to me indicating its willingness to engage further with my Department on how the transfer could proceed and be reckoned as a redress contribution. </p>  <p>  To date the Congregation has paid &euro;21.2 million of its pledged cash contribution and has indicated that it intends to pay the remaining &euro;8.8 million either later this year or in 2018.  Completion of this contribution is vitally important as it will help to ensure that Caranua, the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund, will have the full &euro;110 million in cash contributions offered by the religious congregations available to it.  This will enable Caranua to provide much needed supports to former residents who are in need of assistance. </p>  <p>  I appreciate that the Christian Brothers wish to follow through on their commitments.  It is however, a matter for the Congregation to make its own decisions in regard to how it will fund the remaining element of its pledged cash contribution and I have no role in that process.  It would, however, also be very disappointing if the educational needs of current and future generations of children were compromised in achieving this goal.  I would hope that the Congregation takes this fully into account during their deliberations.  My Department is writing to the Congregation on the matter of the proposed sale of land adjacent to the school referred to by the Deputy, seeking clarification on a number of relevant matters including the current status of the proposed sale and whether consideration was given to future educational needs prior to the decision being taken to dispose of the land. </p>  <p>  I am not privy to any agreement that may have been made between the Congregation of Christian Brothers, the Edmund Rice Schools Trust and the authorities of any particular school in regard to school playing fields.  I should note also that there is no agreement in place between my Department and the Congregation in regard to the transfer of its playing fields and associated lands to any new ownership structure.</p></reply>

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers. </p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. </p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers.  The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.  </p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.  </p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servants and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all.  It would also not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean that we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on.</p>  <p>  In education, there is a well-established increment system.  Teachers are not paid equally. For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching.  Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the recently published analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission.  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of public service pay talks.  My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, invited the Public Services Committee of ICTU to discussions on public service pay and a continued approach to the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation and these discussions are now underway.</p></reply>

Allocations issued to all schools on 7th March and details have also been published on the NCSE website at: <i>http://ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Special-Education-Teacher-Allocation-Primary-2017_18-updated-30_03_2017.pdf.  </i></p><p>This new model will give greater autonomy to schools to allocate resources to the pupils who most need these resources, regardless of their diagnosis.</p><p>No school will receive an allocation for the support of current pupils with complex needs which is less than the allocation they had received to support pupils with low incidence special educational needs in the preceding year.  This means that schools can continue to support students in line with their needs.</p><p>In circumstances where a parent is dissatisfied as to the extent of additional teaching support which has been allocated to their child under this new model for 2017/18 school year, the parent should raise the matter with the school Principal in the first instance.  Where a parent is dissatisfied with the manner in which the issue is addressed by the school Principal, the parent should raise the matter directly with the Board of Management of the School, who are the body which has responsibility for the management of the school.</p></reply>

The plan should include time-bound targets for the development of independence skills. </p>  <p>  A reply from my Department to the parent in question will issue shortly, in relation to the correspondence received.</p></reply>

The Agreement also applies to teachers employed in Designated Community Colleges, Community and Comprehensive Schools and Voluntary Secondary Schools who are TUI members.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2013 and 2015 as set out in Section 3 of the Circular applies to all other teachers employed in such schools.  The circular is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and can be accessed at:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>As is the norm with public service collective agreements, the Lansdowne Road Agreement was negotiated with trade unions which are recognised as representing staff in the public service (including teachers).  It is normal practice in the public service that the decision of the trade union recognised as holding representative rights for a particular grade or sector will determine the position for all relevant staff in that grade/sector.  This context does not allow for acceptance or rejection of collective agreements by staff on an individual basis.</p><p>Accordingly, there is no proposal at this time to treat teachers separately based on the fact that they are not a member of a trade union.  However, since the announcement of the ASTI ballot result my Department has received a number of queries from both ASTI members and teachers who are not members of a trade union about union membership.  Therefore, having regard to the circumstances of the dispute with the ASTI, this is an issue that I will keep under review going forward.</p></reply>

No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the NCSE that an application for LITH support was received after the allocation process for 2016-2017 concluded; heretofore, that application would have been considered for the 2017/18 allocations process.  All schools, including the school in question, have received their allocation under the new model for 2017/18. The SENO has explained the new process to the parents of the child in question in a recent email.  The SENO has also had discussions with the school principal in relation to same.   </p>  <p>  In circumstances where a parent is dissatisfied as to the extent of additional support teaching time which has been allocated to their child from within a schools allocation, the normal course of action open to a parent would be to raise this matter with the school Principal in the first instance, and to request that additional teaching be provided to their child.</p></reply>

A value was then proportionally applied to the school.</p><p>The school had based responses to Section 3 on the entire school, as opposed to 2nd Class only.</p><p>The Educational Research Centre (ERC) was asked to review this matter and advised that having reviewed the data, the effect was that the social context/disadvantage allocation for the school had been greatly inflated due to the fact that the incorrect denominator was used by the school to report numbers based on the whole school.  </p><p>Whereas this problem was not identified during the data checking process prior to the model being finalised, without being aware of the circumstances pertaining to individual schools, it would have been impossible for data checking to identify such a problem.  </p><p>Having reviewed the circumstances of the school which had come to the attention of the Department, the ERC also reviewed the position of social context allocations for other schools who had received very high social context allocations in their profiles.</p><p>The quality assurance technical check revealed that an over allocation of resources had been made for seventeen schools which had also used the incorrect denominator, including the school referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question. </p><p>The ERC recalculated the profiles for all of these schools, based on the correct proportionate application of the survey data, and new allocation letters issued to all of the effected schools at the earliest possible opportunity, in May 2017.</p><p>In relation to the school referred to by the Deputy, this school has received an allocation of 93.13 hours for September 2017, which is a very significant allocation for a school of this size.</p><p>The school profile, when revised to correct for the error, indicated that the allocation which would be required for this school should be 82.50 hours, based on the school profile. </p><p>However, as all schools will receive an allocation at least equivalent to the allocation they received in the 2016/17 school year this school has been allocated 93.13 hours.  </p><p>My Department must treat all schools equally in relation to the allocation process and where incorrect data was supplied by the school and used in the allocation it was incumbent on my Department to correct this matter. However, it is important to point out that the amendments arose as a result of incorrect information supplied by the school.</p><p>Whereas the date for submission of an appeal to the NCSE has closed, should the school wish to seek a review of this allocation decision, they should write to my Department regarding this matter.  </p></reply>

The Department of Education and Skills invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling: </p><p>- 63% of students to attend mainstream schools</p><p>- 26% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and</p><p>- 11% to attend special schools.</p><p>Some students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there.  This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p><p>Enrolment in an ASD special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports. </p><p>Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that: </p><p>- S/he has ASD</p><p>- S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p><p>The NCSE has informed the Department of Educational and Skills that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special classes placements to meet existing demand in the Kildare area for the forthcoming school year. </p><p>There are currently 59 ASD special classes in the Kildare area, including 6 Early Intervention classes, 41 primary ASD classes and 12 post primary ASD classes.</p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned.  The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p><p>The NCSE has not currently identified the need to establish an ASD special class in the area referred to by the Deputy.

What this means, in practical terms, is that the school must register with the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s online system subsequently following the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s instructions in relation to deducting and paying over tax, as appropriate, for the contractor carrying out the works.  No tax liability will arise for schools if they comply fully with this requirement.   </p>  <p>  The grant approval letter also advises schools that the Revenue Commissioners has prepared a Guidance Note to assist them in this matter and that this is available on the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; website.  My Department's website also has a link to this document.</p>  <p>  It is a mandatory requirement for schools to confirm to my Department, in writing, in their individual Forms of Acceptance for the Grant that they will comply with this requirement.  Subsequently, at all stages of the grant draw-down, schools must confirm to my Department, again in writing, that they have adhered to this requirement.  The grant for the building project cannot be drawn down unless these confirmations are received from a school. </p>  <p>  Given the imperative to provide my Department with the written confirmations outlined, my Department is not aware of any school facing a tax liability for a failure to comply with the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; requirements.  </p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing arrangements for the 2017/18 school year (Circular 0017/2017) were published recently.</p>  <p>  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.</p>  <p>  The staffing schedule includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.  Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0017/2017. </p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy submitted an appeal for consideration by the Appeals Board for the April 2017 meeting of the board under the EAL criteria.  The Appeals Board determined that this appeal was unsuccessful.  The school has been notified accordingly.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final.</p>  <p>  My Departments Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 set out details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools. </p>  <p>  The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for schools, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p>  <p>  No school, including the school to which the Deputy has referred, will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. </p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  This represents a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. </p>  <p>  In relation to the school referred to by the Deputy in his question, this school had a General Allocation Model allocation of 40 hours for the 2016/17 school year, which combined with 33.15 resource teaching hours allocated to the school by the National Council for Special Education, gave a total allocation of 73.15 additional teaching hours for the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  As the profiled allocation for this school did not indicate an increased allocation requirement for the school for 2017/18, the school has maintained its existing level of allocation.</p>  <p>  The special education teaching allocation for this school for 2017/18 is 73.15 hours.</p>  <p>  There has therefore been no reduction to the special education teaching allocation for this school as a result of the introduction of the new allocation model.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has announced the commencement of an independent appeals process through which schools may appeal the allocation made to their school if they believe the data upon which the allocation is based is incorrect or has been incorrectly used.</p></reply>

This performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification.</p>  <p>  For the past twenty years my Department's Building Unit has been using a process called the DART approach to develop policy, sustainability and energy efficiency in educational buildings.  This acronym focuses on four key areas, namely; Design, Awareness, Research and Technology. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Building Unit Technical Guidance Documents set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency and they are based on solid energy research projects.  Schools that are designed and built in accordance with my Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents for schools must achieve an A3 Building Energy Rating.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s policy is supported by a strong research programme with forty eight research strands at various stages.  One of the research strands in the above programme is for the introduction of Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB) Schools.  This standard will be introduced for all new school buildings in line with the new Building Regulations.  A nearly zero-energy building means a building that has a very high energy performance. </p>  <p>  Another research strand is the Energy in Education Programme and energy website at www.energyineducation.ie</p>  <p>  The Energy in Education Programme, a collaboration between the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and my Department, supports schools in delivering practical guidance in how to manage their energy use effectively and achieve savings.  Providing a web-based energy management portal for schools was seen as a key aspect of the Energy in Education Programme. </p>  <p>  The most recent research strand in response to the Draft Mitigation Plan 2017 involves my Department and SEAI embarking on a School Energy Efficiency Upgrade Pilot Programme for existing schools.  During the first phase of the pilot, participating schools have been assigned an Energy Auditor who visited the school to identify specific opportunities to improve energy efficiency and provide a detailed report to the school. </p>  <p>  Based on the auditor&rsquo;s report a number of schools were selected to participate in the second phase of the pilot.  These selected schools will have projects implemented to upgrade the school&rsquo;s energy efficiency, while reducing costs.  These improvement works are currently out to tender for completion this year and will be 100% funded under the pilot programme, which is supported by SEAI and my Department.  The projects will be used to develop and demonstrate best practice models in energy efficiency upgrades in a range of typical school buildings.</p></reply>

The Agreement also applies to teachers employed in Designated Community Colleges, Community and Comprehensive Schools and Voluntary Secondary Schools who are TUI members.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2013 and 2015 as set out in Section 3 of the Circular applies to all other teachers employed in such schools.  The circular is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and can be accessed at:</p><p>As is the norm with public service collective agreements, the Lansdowne Road Agreement was negotiated with trade unions which are recognised as representing staff in the public service (including teachers).  It is normal practice in the public service that the decision of the trade union recognised as holding representative rights for a particular grade or sector will determine the position for all relevant staff in that grade/sector.  This context does not allow for acceptance or rejection of collective agreements by staff on an individual basis.</p><p>Accordingly, there is no proposal at this time to treat teachers separately based on the fact that they are not a member of a trade union.  However, since the announcement of the ASTI ballot result my Department has received a number of queries from both ASTI members and teachers who are not members of a trade union about union membership.  Therefore, having regard to the circumstances of the dispute with the ASTI, this is an issue that I will keep under review going forward.</p></reply>

The appeal was refused by the Appeals Board on the basis that the grounds of the appeal did not warrant the allocation of an additional post for the 2017/18 school year.  The school has been notified accordingly.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final.</p>  <p>  The published staffing arrangements include the provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolment for the following September, in this case September 2017.  If the school in question is experiencing a rapid increase in enrolment it is open to the school to submit an application to the Primary Allocations Section of the Department for consideration for developing school status.</p></reply>

This Budget represents the start of a major reinvestment in education, and the first phase of implementation of the Action Plan for Education, aimed at becoming the best education system in Europe within a decade.  The budget provides for over 2,400 additional teaching posts for our primary and post primary schools next year.

Schools will be frontloaded with resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils who need such support. </p><p>Allocations based on the school profiles were issued to all schools, including the schools referred to my the Deputy on 7 March.  </p><p>The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p><p>No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p><p>An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools. This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. </p><p>The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government. </p><p>The NCSE has published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: www.ncse.ie. </p><p>Schools who wished to submit an appeal were asked to do so by March 31 2017. </p><p>The NCSE has confirmed that an appeal has been received from Togher Girls school but no appeal has been received from Togher Boys school. </p><p>The appeals are currently being processed and it is intended that schools will shortly be notified of the outcome.  </p><p>Schools could appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017/18 allocation.</p><p>DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.  </p><p>In advance of any submission of an appeal, schools were asked to read carefully the DES Circulars and in particular the relevant sections, which relate to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.</p><p>The model will also allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. </p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs have also now been published and are available on my Departments website.</p><p>The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants.</p></reply>

My role as Minister with regard to development contributions is to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority.  </p>  <p>  Section 48(2)(b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides that a development contribution scheme, applied by a planning authority in respect of its functional area, may make provision for payment of different contributions in respect of different classes or descriptions of development.  The Act also requires that schemes state the basis for determining contributions and that they have regard to the actual estimated cost of providing the various classes of public infrastructure and facilities.  The level of contribution, and the types of development to which development contributions should apply including any exemptions from charging in specific circumstances if that is deemed appropriate, are therefore determined at local authority level, in accordance with the powers vested in elected members in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department issued statutory guidelines to planning authorities in January 2013 under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act on the implementation of development contribution schemes.  Adherence to a consistent cost allocation methodology outlined in the guidelines is strongly recommended.  The guidelines further advise that, in deciding within the non-residential categories of development works how costs are to be attributed, the intensity of infrastructural usage by different categories of, for example, employment related activity should be taken into account. </p>  <p>  The majority of development contribution schemes adopted by planning authorities currently provide for charges in respect of certain agricultural buildings or development within their functional areas.  I understand that the draft scheme currently in preparation by Kerry County Council proposes to apply development contribution charges for new farm buildings (excluding silos, yards, silage bases and slurry pits or towers), on the basis that they are a form of commercial development, with such charges being required for the purpose of contributing towards the provision of roads and transport infrastructure and facilities. </p>  <p>  Section 48(4) of the Act of 2000 requires planning authorities to publish a draft development contribution scheme for public consultation, while section 48(5) provides that the Minister may make recommendations in relation to a draft scheme.  However, it is ultimately a matter for the elected members of a planning authority to adopt a development contribution scheme as a reserved function, having regard to any recommendations made by the Minister and the Chief Executive's report on the public consultation process. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the existing statutory and policy framework in this regard strikes the right balance between ensuring a transparent and broadly consistent levying of development contributions across the country, while also affording each local authority sufficient flexibility and discretion in the application of development contributions within their own respective functional areas.</p></reply>

This is in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, the SEA Directive.  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process. </p>  <p>  In light of the SEA requirement, it is likely that while the proposals for revisions to the Guidelines will be available shortly, the Guidelines will not be finalised and come into effect until early 2018.  In the meantime, the current Guidelines remain in force.</p>  <p>  When finalised, revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts. </p></reply>

The Government decided that 80% of the estimated LPT liability in each local authority area for a given year is retained in that area to fund public services, notwithstanding any local variation decisions.  The remaining 20% of LPT is re-distributed to provide equalisation funding to those local authorities that have lower property tax bases, due to the variance in property values and density across the State.  This reflects the fact that local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, public service demands, infrastructure and income sources.</p><p>In accordance with decisions taken by Government regarding the distribution of LPT funding, every local authority has a minimum level of funding available to it known as the LPT baseline.  Equalisation is the process that ensures that every local authority&rsquo;s LPT allocation is brought up this baseline. T he LPT funding baseline in 2017 is linked to previous General Purpose Grant amounts and Pension Related Deductions retained by authorities in 2014. </p><p>Funding for equalisation purposes is provided via the Local Government Fund.  The shortfall between the 20% contribution from all local authorities and the total amount required for equalisation is met by the Exchequer.  LPT allocations amounts and the distribution of equalisation funding in the years 2015 to 2017 are published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following weblink: .</p><p>My Department keeps the allocation mechanism under review to ensure equitable treatment of all local authorities.

With the completion of the HAP roll-out and the ending of the scheme&rsquo;s pilot phase on 1 March 2017, I signed a Ministerial Direction instructing local authorities to continue to offer HAP tenants access to other forms of social housing through the transfer list. This refreshed Direction ensures that following completion of the HAP pilot phase, HAP tenants still get all the benefits of HAP and are no less likely to get a different form of social housing support.</p>  <p>  The practical operation of transfer lists is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their scheme of letting priorities.  The setting of such schemes is a reserved function of the local authority and as such, is a matter for the elected members. I understand that the majority of HAP households do avail of the option to be placed on a transfer list. Since its statutory commencement in September 2014, some 356 households (at the end of Q1 2017) had transferred from the HAP scheme to other forms of social housing support.</p>  <p>  The information on the dedicated HAP website, www.hap.ie, reflects the legislation and states that any HAP tenant who wants to access other social housing supports may do so through the transfer system as operated by their respective local authority. </p></reply>

The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda originally set out in the Social Housing Strategy 2020, a review of the income eligibility limits for social housing supports is scheduled to commence later this year.</p></reply>

HAP is deemed to be a social housing support under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.  As a long term housing support, an assessment of housing need must be completed in order for a household to qualify for HAP.  Any household with an identified housing need is eligible for HAP.The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provide that subject to conditions, a housing authority shall deal with such an application within a period of 12 weeks. Local authorities will prioritise housing needs assessments for those in greatest need and average waiting times are significantly shorter that the statutory maximum in many areas.</p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector.  The earliest date a HAP payment will issue to a landlord is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority.  Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities.  This HAP Shared Service Centre (SSC) manage all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC.  On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP Shared Service Centre within 1 working day of receipt. Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.</p>  <p>  More than 22,000 households are currently in receipt of HAP support, with more than 17,000 separate landlords and agents involved in providing accommodation to those households.  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  In general, I am satisfied with the operation of the HAP scheme and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. </p></reply>

This funding allows AHBs  access to early working capital (up to 30% of the relevant costs) for the purchase, construction or refurbishment of units which will then be made available for social housing purposes under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).  Low interest rate borrowings are available to AHBs from the Housing Finance Agency and other private finance streams to support the financing of the balance.  The AHB effectively uses the CALF approval for the capital injection of up to 30% and the ongoing commitment of lease income under the Payment and Availability Agreement to leverage the balance finance required.</p><p>Once an AHB has secured the property and signed the Payment and Availability Agreement with the local authority, they use the lease income to service the borrowings.</p><p>Properties made available under the CALF scheme are used to accommodate households from the local authority waiting list.  Leased properties are allocated to tenants, in accordance with the relevant local authority's allocation scheme.</p><p>The relevant AHB has confirmed that the contracts for the acquisition of these new build units have recently been signed and the transaction is due to close in the next few weeks.

Accordingly Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, includes the objective that, by mid-2017, hotels will only be used in limited circumstances as emergency accommodation for families.</p>  <p>  To meet this objective, in addition to providing for long-term housing needs, housing authorities are pursuing the delivery of a range of additional and enhanced family-focused facilities which offer a greater level of stability than is possible in hotels, while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  Such arrangements will facilitate more coordinated needs assessment and support, including on-site access to required services, such as welfare, health, housing services and appropriate family supports.</p>  <p>  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless accommodation and related services rests with individual housing authorities.  Accordingly, specific information in relation to the number of families accommodated in individual facilities in Dublin is a matter for the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.</p>  <p>  Negotiations in relation to the leasing and refurbishment costs of family hub projects across Dublin are on-going and the details are therefore commercially sensitive.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive has indicated that it is not in a position to release this information as to do so would compromise their negotiating position during this process.</p></reply>

The purpose of the SSHA is to capture the total number of households qualified for social housing support across the country whose social housing need is not being met, in order to better understand the level of need for such support. </p>  <p>  From 2016, in line with a commitment given under the Social Housing Strategy 2020 published in November 2014, the SSHA will be carried out an annual basis.  Previous Summaries were carried out every three years and it is considered that moving to an annual basis is essential in order to better target the significant investment being made in social housing in the coming years.  The SSHA is an important exercise that provides essential information about the profile of applicants for social housing support, in order to better inform policy and the delivery of appropriate social housing supports.</p>  <p>  Under the annual SSHA process, all housing authorities are required to review certain households who are on their housing list but who are not in receipt of housing support.  This is to ensure that the details of the applicant households are up to date and accurate and that they remain eligible for, and in need of, social housing support in accordance with the criteria set down in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 as amended by the Social Housing Assessment (Amendment) Regulations 2016. </p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there is a workload involved in assessing households for the purposes of the SSHA.  However, while each housing authority is required to make a return in relation to the assessments carried out in its administrative area, it is not a requirement that a full assessment is carried out for all households.  Rather each authority is required only to review those applications for support that have not been reviewed in the previous 12 month period. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that all applicants for social housing support have an ongoing responsibility to ensure that the relevant housing authority is kept reasonably up to date as regard changes in their circumstances (e.g. income, employment status, additional children, etc.) that may effect their eligibility for support.</p></reply>

Within these constraints, the Department is focusing on prioritising the filling of critical posts. </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.  The staffing needs for all areas within the Department, including Maternity Benefit, are continuously reviewed, taking account of workloads, management priorities and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that additional staff have been assigned to this Department&rsquo;s Buncrana office and that further additional staff are being assigned over the coming weeks.  These measures should enable the section continue to meet the Departmental standard processing times for the Maternity Benefit scheme once the claims that have been delayed are processed.</p></reply>

Each person referred to the JobPath service is allocated a personal advisor who provides intensive individual support and assistance.  When a jobseeker with JobPath finds employment, they will be supported by the JobPath Company for at least the first 13 weeks and up to a year until they are settled in the job. </p>  <p>  This is in contrast to the T&Uacute;S and Community Employment (CE) schemes that provide part-time employment and training opportunities in local communities as a stepping stone back to employment for people on a range of Social Welfare payments including those on long term unemployment payments.  I should emphasise that T&Uacute;S and CE do not, nor are they intended to, provide full-time sustainable employment.</p>  <p>  Jobseekers can only participate with one activation scheme or service at a time; this is to allow the scheme and service providers time to work with the participants to achieve the best outcome for the person.  It also ensures that all places available on activation supports are managed efficiently.  However, people who on the date of their referral to JobPath have a written offer with a start date within four weeks for CE or T&Uacute;S will be facilitated to take up their placement and that is a matter for the officials in my Department, the JobPath companies have no role.  </p>  <p>  The person concerned has been engaged with the JobPath service since March 2017 and has agreed a Personal Progression Plan with their personal advisor, which includes a schedule of activities, actions and job-focused targets. </p>  <p>  The referral period for the JobPath service is typically for a year.  At the end of the 52 weeks, if the customer has not been successful in finding suitable employment they may, subject to an assessment by an Intreo case officer, may apply for other activation supports such as CE or T&Uacute;S. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

There are currently 3,200 in receipt of the diet supplement of diet supplement at a cost of &euro;4.6 million in 2017.</p><p>Following the outcome of a review of the costs of healthy eating and specialised diets by the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute commissioned by the Department during 2013, the scheme has been closed to new applicants from 1 February 2014.  This independent research showed that the average costs across all of the retail outlets of the diets supplemented under the scheme can be met from within one third of the minimum personal rate of social welfare payment, i.e. the SWA rate which was then paid at &euro;186 per week.  The weekly rate of SWA has recently increased to &euro;191 further to Budget 2017.  The diet supplement scheme was discontinued for new applicants on the basis of this evidence and I have no plans to reverse this decision.</p><p>Existing recipients continue to receive the diet supplement at the current rate of payment for as long as they continue to have an entitlement to the scheme or until their circumstances change.  This measure ensured that nobody was immediately worse off by the closure of the scheme. </p><p>The weekly increase provided in Budget 2017 delivers on the commitments as outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government &ndash; to increase the State Pension and to support an increase for people with disabilities.  For this reason arrangements were put in place (by way of S.I. No. 71 of 2017)<i></i>so that the effect of the Budget 2017 increase on weekly social welfare payments will not impact on the payment of diet supplement to existing customers.  </p><p>In cases of particular hardship, officials continue to have the legislative power to award a SWA payment in cases of exceptional need.  Any person who considers that they may have an entitlement to financial support should contact their local Community Welfare Service who may be able to offer assistance.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is designed to be a temporary fixed-term activation intervention.  The programme assists participants to enhance and develop their skills, competencies and confidence to enable them to compete for jobs in the open market.</p>  <p>  CE is open to participants aged up to 65 years of age who meet the current eligibility criteria.  A pilot initiative was announced in December 2015 to enable those aged 62 or over to extend their participation beyond the standard maximum participation limits providing the eligibility conditions are met.  Participants are allowed to participate on a continuous basis up to the State Pension age, subject to satisfactory performance on the scheme and to annual approval by the Department.  The places allocated for these participants within each individual CE scheme are limited to 7% of each scheme&rsquo;s overall budgeted places. </p>  <p>  Following the recent publication of my Department&rsquo;s report, An Analysis of the Community Employment Programme, I signalled my intention to review the rules governing the participation of older people on schemes within the next three months.  The over-62 pilot will be considered in that context.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is a condition of the receipt of this payment that a recipient must be capable of, available for and actively seeking full time employment.  The Department of Social Protection selects jobseekers on a random basis for referral to Jobpath.

The Rural Social Scheme provides part-time employment and training opportunities in local communities as a stepping stone back to full employment. </p>  <p>  At the end of participation on the Jobpath programme, jobseekers who have not been successful in finding employment may then submit an application for a work placement on the RSS or alternatively, subject to an assessment by the Intreo Case Officer, may apply for other activation support programmes such as Community Employment or TUS. </p>  <p>  In the current circumstances the person in question must complete the JobPath programme.</p></reply>

Social impact assessment (SIA) is an evidence-based methodology which estimates the likely distributive effects of policies on household incomes, families, poverty and access to employment.  The analysis is generated through the ESRI&rsquo;s tax/benefit microsimulation model, SWITCH.  The model simulates the impact of budgetary changes on a representative sample of households from the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions.  </p><p>The main analysis of potential policy measures is undertaken in the context of the Tax Strategy Group papers.  The Social Protection Package papers include social impact assessments of a range of illustrative social welfare budgetary measures, including PRSI measures.  These papers are published on the Department of Finance&rsquo;s website at <i>.  </i></p><p>Aside from this, social impact assessments using SWITCH are used on a regular ongoing basis in relation to potential policy options, packages and to assess the cumulative impact of budgetary policies.  For instance, the Department&rsquo;s Comprehensive Review of Expenditure contained a range of analysis using SWITCH.  This is available on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s website at: <i>www.per.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/Social-Protection-CRE-Submission.pdf</i>.  </p><p>My Department publishes the social impact assessment of budgetary measures shortly after the Budget is agreed.  This is to inform public understanding on the cumulative effect of budgetary welfare and tax policies on income distribution and social equality. Previously published assessments of Budgets 2013 to 2017 are available on the Department&rsquo;s website at: <i>www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Examples-.aspx.</i></p></reply>

The balance is assessed at 34% and this constitutes the weekly value of benefit and privilege to the claimant. This weekly value is deducted from the maximum personal rate applicable (generally &euro;100 per week) to determine the level of weekly entitlement.  Where the level of entitlement as calculated is at least &euro;1 per week and less than &euro;40 per week, a minimum rate of &euro;40 per week is payable. </p>  <p>  There are two exceptions to this rule. No assessment is made where a son or daughter and his or her spouse / civil partner / partner is living with his / her parents.  In addition, where a person returns to the parental home having had an independent life elsewhere in Ireland or abroad for an appreciable length of time e.g. at least three years, the assessment in this case is &euro;7 per week.

The table below estimates the additional cost of increasing the duration of maternity benefit above its current 26 week duration at the current weekly rate of &euro;235.</p><p><b>Estimated annual cost of increasing the duration of maternity benefit based on 2017 rates</b><table><tr><th></th><th>Weeks/&euro;</th><th>Weeks/&euro;</th><th>Weeks/&euro;</th><th>Weeks/&euro;</th><th>Weeks/&euro;</th><th>Weeks/&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>No. of additional weeks</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated cost (&euro;m)</td><td>10</td><td>20</td><td>30</td><td>40</td><td>50</td><td>60</td></tr></table></p><p>These estimates are on a full year basis and assume that any increase in duration is implemented at the beginning of the year.  It should be noted that this costing is subject to change over the coming months in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients for 2017.</p><p>The Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016 which was enacted in July 2016 introduced a new scheme of paternity leave and an associated social welfare payment of paternity benefit from 1 September 2016.</p><p>Approximately 12,750 paternity benefit claims have been awarded since the commencement of the scheme in September.  This would indicate a take up of around approximately 19,000 in a full year.  However there were approximately 7,500 paternity benefit claims awarded in the first four months of this year from 1 January 2017 to 26 April 2017.  This would indicate a take up of around approximately 22,500 in a full year.  However neither figure takes account of the fact that fathers can take their paternity leave up to 6 months after their child is born.  For example, fathers whose child was born on 28 February 2017 can take their leave at any time up to 1 September 2017.  As such, current figures for paternity benefit claims awarded do not include fathers who will apply and take their leave in the remaining months available to them.</p><p>Given the flexibility afforded to fathers and the scheme cycle it will be 18 months from the commencement of the scheme before the department will have an accurate figure for the take-up of paternity benefit in a full year.  The estimates below are based on this proviso.</p><p>The estimated additional cost of extending the duration of paternity benefit is approximately &euro;5.5 million for each extra week.  The table below estimates the additional cost of increasing the duration of paternity benefit above its current two week duration at the current weekly rate of &euro;235.</p><p><b>Estimated annual cost of increasing the duration of paternity benefit based on 2017 rates</b><table><tr><th></th><th>Weeks/&euro;</th><th>Weeks/&euro;</th><th>Weeks/&euro;</th><th>Weeks/&euro;</th><th>Weeks/&euro;</th><th>Weeks/&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>No. of additional weeks</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated cost (&euro;m)</td><td>5.5</td><td>11</td><td>16.5</td><td>22</td><td>27.5</td><td>33</td></tr></table></p><p>These estimates are on a full year basis and assume that any increase in duration is implemented at the beginning of the year.

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided a significant annual saving and allowed my Department to protect other core social welfare payments such as the State pension. </p>  <p>  The number of bereavement grant claims in 2013 was 23,716, and this represented an increase of approximately 4% on 2012.  Based on a similar yearly increase each year since 2013, it is estimated that the number of bereavement grant claims that might arise in 2018, were the scheme to be re-introduced, would be in the region of 28,858, with that number likely to increase in future years.  The estimated cost of re-introducing the grant at a rate of &euro;850 for 28,858 recipients would be &euro;24.53 million.  </p>  <p>  Any decision to reinstate the Bereavement Grant would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that there are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease. </p>  <p>  Additionally, the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  Under the SWA scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with funeral and burial expenses.  The Government has provided &euro;31.5 million for exceptional and urgent needs payments in 2017. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Relevant groups, not normally considered to be unemployed, include economically inactive lone parents, people with disabilities, and the adult dependants of unemployed people, all of whom might benefit from closer attachment to employment and the labour market.  A range of policy reforms has been taken affecting these groups, and further reforms are being considered in consultation with representative bodies for those involved.

Each CIS is established as a limited company, with a voluntary board of management (Board of Directors).  The powers and responsibilities of each Board are outlined in the company&rsquo;s Memorandum and Articles of Association and underpinned by Company Law.  Boards of Directors are responsible for ensuring that the company delivers its aims and objectives, using available resources to best effect.  </p>  <p>  In accordance with the principles of good governance, each CIS Board is accountable to CIB for the funding it receives.  CIB in turn is accountable to the Government for its substantial annual grant of public monies and for ensuring that the services made available under its remit are delivered to a consistently high standard to all who need and rely upon them.  </p>  <p>  In 2017 CIB is set to receive &euro;54 million of State funding, of which &euro;13.8 million is allocated to the network of 42 CIS services.   </p>  <p>  Effective accountability is dependent on establishing clearly defined roles and responsibilities against which achievement and success in service delivery can subsequently be measured.  For this reason, there are annual service agreements in place between CIB and each of its delivery partner services, setting out the commitments both parties make to each other, including the range of services to be provided.  The agreements cover generic items such as service delivery, governance, financial controls, HR practices, reporting guidelines, evaluation and monitoring and enable CIB to assess if quality services and best value are being delivered across the network.  It also enables CIB to identify where service weaknesses or gaps exist.  </p>  <p>  In the circumstances, it would be irresponsible of CIB not to ensure that each CIS has in place adequate working governance arrangements to manage and monitor its expenditure on the basis that its funds are entirely comprised of taxpayers&rsquo; money. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

One of the main priorities for the Department is to build on achievements already made to integrate services into a new service delivery model and streamline the applications process for all schemes. </p>  <p>  In general, there is no delay in processing jobseeker benefit claims in Intreo Centres if the relevant claim application forms and supporting documentation are completed, as required by the customer, in a timely manner. </p>  <p>  Seasonal workers should apply for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit as soon as they become unemployed.  Initially, when a person makes an application for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, 3 waiting days apply and payment is made from the 4th day of the claim.  If, however, a person makes a repeat claim for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit within 26 weeks of their previous claim, the repeat claim links to the earlier claim and no waiting days apply.  </p>  <p>  School educational sector workers, who are employed on a temporary basis and who have previously been in contact with the Department, are issued with a repeat jobseeker&rsquo;s application form and holiday form in advance of the school holiday periods.  This advance process facilitates an efficient service to these customers and allows for speedy processing of their claim when the period of unemployment actually arises.  However, it is important to note that educational sector workers are still required to sign on for each period of unemployment.</p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that prompt processing of all claims remains a priority for my  Department.  Each scheme area is monitored on an on-going basis and processing procedures are reviewed to ensure that claims are paid to customers as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

This has been due to volatility in the stock markets, increasing liabilities arising from the demographic pressures of increasing life expectancy, low interest rates and regulatory requirements.  Essentially the cost of providing benefits has increased at a rate that has not been covered by the level of the employer and employee contributions to pension schemes and the investment returns earned.  In addition, accountancy standards, which make pension liabilities very apparent on a company&rsquo;s balance sheet, contribute to the pressures under which DB schemes are operating.</p>  <p>  During the financial crisis the decline of DB schemes accelerated to the extent that the whole sector was at risk.  At that stage a series of legislative amendments was brought forward to alleviate the situation.</p>  <p>  The ongoing decline of defined benefit schemes over the past two decades has seen the number of schemes subject to the funding standard decline from 2,031 in 2000 to approximately 660 such schemes now.  Despite its decline, the DB sector is still a very important sector with assets under management of approximately &euro;62 billion and membership comprised of 100,000 pensioners, 125,000 active members and 435,000 deferred members.</p>  <p>  Whilst a very significant number of DB schemes have closed in recent years, in most cases they are replaced by Defined Contribution (DC) schemes, generally by agreement between employer and employee representatives.</p>  <p>  I intend to bring further proposals forward to alleviate the problems in defined benefit schemes in the forthcoming Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.</p>  <p>  I have made pension reform a priority for my term as Minister for Social Protection.  To this end I can confirm my intention to publish and start implementing an Action Plan for the reform of pensions over the coming months. </p>  <p>  The rate of supplementary pension coverage in Ireland is estimated at 35% of the working population when the private sector is considered in isolation.  If measures are not taken to address this low rate of coverage, many future retirees will experience unwanted reductions in their living standards when they reach retirement. </p>  <p>  To deal with this situation, as well as a range of other reform measures, this Action Plan will set out proposals for a transition from the current and purely voluntary supplementary pension system to one which will automatically enrol eligible employees into a quality assured DC retirement savings system.  This reform, where the saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out, will encourage long term saving and asset accumulation amongst those who may otherwise suffer a reduction in living standards at retirement and will increase the wellbeing, financial security, and independence of future retirees. </p>  <p>  Following the publication of this Action Plan and in order to guide future Government decisions, the detailed evidence building and consultation required to deliver automatic enrolment will be undertaken over an initial project planning phase.  This work is needed to inform fundamental choices regarding the preferred operational structure and organisational governance for the new system as well as design elements such as the required contributions, financial incentives and target membership.  Correctly positioning/designing each of these will be critical to the success of any system.  Decisions on each of these matters will be required to determine costings for the system.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, there are still a number of mothers that will receive their first payment up to 3 to 4 weeks after they commence their maternity leave.  The number has reduced to 700 at 29 May, down from 1,100 based on a count at 22 May.</p>  <p>  Additional staff have been assigned and staff from other sections are also supporting maternity section on a temporary basis.

However, claims are processed by reference to the &lsquo;commencement of maternity leave date&rsquo; as this ensures as many new mothers as possible have their claim awarded by the time they take their maternity leave. The departmental standard requires 90% of maternity claims to be processed before the start of the leave date.

Both Governments agreed on the need for intensive engagement to address outstanding issues and commitments to ensure the early establishment of an Executive.  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, both Governments have a role to play in supporting the effective operation of the devolved institutions, and in upholding both the letter and the spirit of the Agreement as a whole, in the interests of all in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  In this context I am representing the Government in the currently paused talks&rsquo; process in Belfast.  The talks have two objectives.  Firstly, to allow the political parties to reach an agreement on the formation of a new Executive.  Secondly, to address the implementation of outstanding issues from previous Agreements.    </p>  <p>  Since the talks began in early March, good work has been done collectively by the five parties and there has been encouraging movement across a range of areas, but a number of key issues remain still to be resolved. </p>  <p>  As part of my engagement with the Secretary of State and with each of the parties in the discussions in recent weeks, I have strongly emphasised the critical importance of forming a new Executive so that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests can be effectively represented, as part of the process of the EU-UK negotiations which are about to commence.  I very much hope that the necessary agreement between the parties will be reached on the formation of the Executive as soon as possible, so that it can directly articulate the interests of the people of Northern Ireland in these negotiations which are of major significance. </p>  <p>  Following the announcement of the general election in the UK, I held further contacts with the parties in Northern Ireland.  There was a widespread view that given the demands and constraints of the election campaign, the best course would be to pause the talks until after the general election takes place on 8 June.  This pause was agreed on 27 April.</p>  <p>  The new legislative deadline for forming the Executive is 29 June.  There will therefore be a sufficient opportunity after June 8 for the talks to resume and for the parties, with the appropriate support and involvement of the two Governments, to re-engage on the urgent task of forming a new Executive and taking forward the implementation of outstanding commitments from previous Agreements.</p>  <p>  I believe there is a shared determination on the part of all parties to renew their engagement on the key outstanding issues in these talks, once the UK general election has taken place.  The Irish Government will continue, in cooperation with the British Government, to support and facilitate the parties in their efforts to reach agreement.  It is critically important to see devolved Government restored and working effectively in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland, in particular in the context of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-30a.771.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000069#WRO02600"><p>The Government&rsquo;s firm position is that the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent Agreements must be implemented in full, and this is reflected in the Programme for Partnership Government.  The Agreements, and the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.  The Government will continue to work tirelessly for that full implementation in both letter and spirit.</p><p>In this context I have been representing the Government in the talks&rsquo; process in Belfast.  The talks have two objectives.  Firstly, to allow the political parties to reach an agreement on the formation of a new Executive.  Secondly, to address the implementation of outstanding issues from previous Agreements.</p><p>Since the talks began in early March, good work has been done collectively by the five parties and there has been encouraging movement across a range of areas, but a number of key issues remain to be resolved.  While I am under no illusions about the challenge of resolving the core issues that remain outstanding in the talks, I believe there is a shared determination on the part of all parties to renew their engagement on the key issues in the talks, once the UK general election has taken place. </p><p>In terms of outstanding commitments, respect for linguistic diversity and the Irish language are important elements of the Good Friday Agreement.  An Irish Language Act in Northern Ireland, to be enacted by the British Government, was provided for in the St Andrews Agreement in 2006.  Successive Irish Governments have advocated in favour of an Irish Language Act and continue to do so.  Regrettably to date, there has been no agreement within the Executive to take forward what is now a devolved matter.</p><p>In the Stormont House negotiations in late 2014, while I and other Irish Government representatives advocated for this commitment being honoured and implemented, regrettably it was not possible to reach agreement for such an explicit undertaking.  Nevertheless, in the text of the final Stormont House Agreement (December 2014), the Government and the British Government, recalling the commitments from previous Agreements, endorsed the need for respect for and recognition of the Irish language in Northern Ireland.</p><p>In the current talks&rsquo; process in Belfast on outstanding commitments from previous Agreements, I have stated clearly to the British Government and the political parties, the Government&rsquo;s continued and clear support for a statutory basis for the Irish language in Northern Ireland, as envisaged under the St Andrews Agreement.  In my discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, I have also underlined the leadership role that both Governments must play in ensuring that all provisions of previous agreements are appropriately respected and that the focus remains on achieving full implementation.</p><p>On a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, which is envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement, the Government advanced the view during the 2014 Stormont House talks, that a Bill of Rights could set out precisely and formally the rights upon which a shared society for Northern Ireland could be based.  While there was not sufficient consensus to take this forward at that time, the final Agreement did provide that the parties commit to: &ldquo;<i>serving the people of Northern Ireland equally, and to act in accordance with the obligations on government to promote equality and respect and to prevent discrimination; to promote a culture of tolerance, mutual respect and mutual understanding at every level of society, including initiatives to facilitate and encourage shared and integrated education and housing, social inclusion,  and in particular community development and the advancement of women in public life; and to promote the interests of the whole community towards the goals of reconciliation and economic renewal.&rdquo;</i></p><p>As reflected in the Programme for Partnership Government, the Government remains supportive of and continues to advocate for the advancement of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.  Indeed, the continued value of a Bill of Rights in the context of Brexit was one of the themes which emerged from the All Island Civic Dialogue sectoral on Human Rights under the Good Friday Agreement which I convened earlier this year.</p><p>A North South Consultative Forum is a further important outstanding element envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement.  In 2008, the then Government sent proposals for such a Forum to the Northern Ireland Executive, but there has been no substantive response.  Between 2009 and 2011, three consultative conferences were hosted in Dublin to support the establishment of the Forum.  While the issue remains on the agenda of the North South Ministerial Council, the Northern Ireland Executive has not been able to give its assent to the establishment of the Forum.  </p><p>The St. Andrews Agreement provided for a review to identify additional areas for North South cooperation.  Again the Government supported a provision in the Stormont House Agreement on this commitment.  The Taoiseach has raised the issue at successive Plenary meetings of the North South Ministerial Council.  However, taking new areas of cooperation forward would require approval in the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly and this has not as yet been forthcoming.</p><p>The Stormont House Agreement provides for regular review meetings with the participation of the Government, the British Government and the Executive party leaders.  At the last two Review Meetings &ndash; most recently in December &ndash; I specifically raised the outstanding commitments from other agreements and suggested regular consideration of them at future Review meetings to ensure that they remain on the political agenda.</p><p>The Stormont House Agreement also importantly provides for a comprehensive framework to deal with the difficult legacy of the Troubles.  In the discussions in the recent talks in Belfast, I have been very clear on the urgent need to achieve progress, so that these legacy institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and to support broader societal healing and reconciliation.  I have also emphasised in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties, the need to ensure that legacy inquests are properly resourced, and urged all with responsibilities in relation to the legacy inquests to move forward as quickly as possible to implement the helpful proposals of the Lord Chief Justice.</p><p>Also as provided for in the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government will continue to pursue the establishment of a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane as agreed by the British and Irish Governments in the Weston Park Agreement of 2001.  This is something which the Government continues to bilaterally raise with the British Government and highlight at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.</p><p>The political talks in Belfast will resume after the UK general election on 8 June and I expect that all participants will spare no efforts in seeking an agreement to form an Executive and to resolve outstanding issues, including in relation to the legacy of the past.  The Irish Government will continue, in cooperation with the British Government, to support and facilitate the parties in their efforts to reach agreement.  It is critically important to see devolved Government restored and working effectively in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland.  </p><p>The Government views as a solemn responsibility our role and mandate as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government will continue to work with the British Government and the political parties to fulfil the full promise of the Good Friday and subsequent Agreements and to advance political stability, reconciliation and economic prosperity in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government&rsquo;s focus and responsibility is to ensure that all aspects of the Agreement are fully respected in the context of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union.</p>  <p>  Human rights protections form a vital part of the institutional underpinning for the peace settlement.  There is a very specific framework of human rights protections under the Good Friday Agreement, and the protection of human rights in Northern Ireland - including through the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) - is one of the key principles of the Agreement.   </p>  <p>  In Northern Ireland, the human rights provisions of the Agreement support the confidence and willingness of all communities to participate in the agreed political institutions of the Agreement and ensure that every citizen is guaranteed equal status and equal protection under law.</p>  <p>  The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU has no impact on its obligations under the Good Friday Agreement or the ECHR.  Even after the UK leaves the EU, there remains a continuing obligation on the British Government to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law, as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.  In this regard, I welcome the clarification in the UK Government&rsquo;s White Paper on withdrawal from the EU that it has no plans to leave the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>  <p>  In its White Paper on legislating for withdrawal from the EU, the British Government has indicated that the provisions of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights will not be applied as part of British law after it leaves the European Union, but that the removal of the Charter from UK law will not affect the substantive rights that individuals already benefit from in the UK.</p>  <p>  A range of significant rights and equality protections are, in practice, given effect through EU regulations and directives, such as in the area of employment law and equality rights, as well as being enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  Consequently, the departure of the UK from the EU will have a significant impact on the human rights landscape in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The changes in Northern Ireland law flowing from the UK&rsquo;s departure from the European Union will require careful consideration, including to ensure that the vital human rights provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are not disturbed. </p>  <p>  On 13 February, I convened a Sectoral Dialogue on human rights under the Good Friday Agreement to hear the views of civil society, North and South on the possible implications of Brexit for this pivotal chapter of the Agreement.  This was a very valuable exchange and a number of key themes emerged, including:</p>  <p>  - The importance of upholding the Good Friday Agreement chapter on rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, as an integral part of the Agreement as a whole.</p>  <p>  - The value of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland as referred to in the Good Friday Agreement, in mitigating some of the potential impacts of Brexit for Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  - The value of a Charter of Rights for the island of Ireland as referred to in the Good Friday Agreement.  This would also support the provision in the Agreement on equivalence of rights on the island.</p>  <p>  Each of these themes demonstrate that human rights are central to the peace process and must be protected and sustained, regardless of the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the European Union.</p>  <p>  On 14 February, I held a bilateral meeting in Dublin with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  I reminded the Secretary of State of the unique circumstances that pertain to Northern Ireland, given the political and constitutional settlement of the Good Friday Agreement.  In this regard, I noted to the Secretary of State the range of issues raised in the Sectoral Dialogue on the human rights provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  I also emphasised to the Secretary of State the duty on both Governments to ensure the integrity of the Agreement in this and all other aspects, whatever the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the European Union.</p>  <p>  In the crucial area of human rights it is important that both Governments do all they can to engender confidence by demonstrating their commitment to both the letter and spirit of the Agreement.  As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles including in the area of human rights.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to work closely with the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the protection of human rights remains at the heart of civic life, politics and ongoing societal change in Northern Ireland.  This includes the continued incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights in Northern Ireland law as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Government will also ensure that all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement are respected in the EU-UK negotiations, and continue to be proactive in working to mitigate all impacts of Brexit on the island of Ireland, consulting and working closely with civil society, North and South.</p></reply>

In light of its exceptional circumstances, this case has seen an exceptional level of high-level political engagement, investment in terms of person-hours, consultation with third parties worldwide, and consular visits and trial monitoring.  </p><p>The Government has been doing everything possible to secure this citizen&rsquo;s release.  We have supported petitions for him to be returned to Ireland under Egyptian Law 140; we have appealed for him to be released under the Egyptian President&rsquo;s &lsquo;Youth Amnesty&rsquo; Scheme, and we have stressed in all contacts the humanitarian dimensions of the case as grounds under which we believe he should be released.</p><p>The Taoiseach has had a series of direct and personal contacts with President el-Sisi on this case.  He has met him face-to-face on two separate occasions.  He has spoken to him by phone numerous times.

What we can do and what we are working very hard to do is to secure Ibrahim&rsquo;s release by the Egyptian authorities at the earliest possible time so that he can return home to his family in Dublin, and to provide every possible consular support for Ibrahim&rsquo;s welfare while he remains in detention.  All of the sustained and focused actions that have been taken by the Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our Embassy in Cairo throughout this case have been aimed at furthering these two objectives, and importantly, avoiding any action that could be counterproductive or detrimental to this citizen&rsquo;s best interests.<b></b></p><p>While there is precious little to be positive about in this long-running and difficult matter, I do note that the court case in which this man is accused is now, at last, underway in earnest and moving forward.

However, he has repeatedly said that he cannot consider using these powers while the case remains before the courts.  President el-Sisi has consistently made clear to the Government that he is anxious to resolve this issue as soon as he can, and that he will be able to intervene in the case once the trial has ended.  </p><p>The Irish Government cannot intervene in a case that is before the courts in another jurisdiction.  What we can do, and what we are doing, is working constantly to maintain maximum pressure on the Egyptian Government to ensure that they are in no doubt about our wish to see that this trial proceeds now to a conclusion and, once it is concluded, that our citizen is returned to Ireland without delay.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-30a.784.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000069#WRO03500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 329 and 331 together. </p>  <p>  Dealing with long-outstanding issues relating to the legacy of the conflict in Northern Ireland are of the utmost importance to me as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and for the Government.  The Programme for a Partnership Government highlights this priority, with specific reference to implementation of the All-Party D&aacute;il motions relating to the Dublin Monaghan bombings.</p>  <p>  The 17 May marked the 43rd anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, which saw the biggest loss of life in a single day during the Troubles. </p>  <p>  I was glad to participate on behalf of the Government in the commemoration ceremony on that day, to stand - along with other Deputies - in solidarity with the victims of the appalling attacks in Dublin and Monaghan, 43 years ago.  As I said in addressing the commemoration ceremony, the Government is determined to continue - and to complete - our efforts to seek the truth of those awful events of 17 May 1974.</p>  <p>  The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings that was adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May last year has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  The Taoiseach has raised the issue with Prime Minister May, emphasising the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the D&aacute;il motions.  I have also raised the matter on a number of occasions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, and am actively engaging with the British Government on an ongoing basis, as are my officials. </p>  <p>  In our discussions, I have advised Secretary of State Brokenshire that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin Monaghan atrocities.  I have also underlined to the Secretary of State that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and emphasised the urgent need for a response from the British Government.</p>  <p>  Secretary of State Brokenshire has acknowledged the importance that the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann attach to this case, but indicated that the British Government is still considering how it could respond in a way which would adequately address the motions and be consistent with its obligations.</p>  <p>  Further to these discussions, I wrote to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 17 May this year, to formally reiterate the request on behalf of the Irish Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the expectation of a timely response to the all-Party Motions on the Dublin Monaghan bombings.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to pursue this matter with the British Government, urging them to provide a satisfactory response to the motions that have been adopted by this House.  The Taoiseach and I will also continue our engagement with party leaders in the Oireachtas on the issue.</p>  <p>  There are many families throughout these islands and beyond who continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one, but also with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events.  Accordingly, the establishment of a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement, is a priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  There has been intensive engagement on legacy issues as part of the current talks&rsquo; process in Belfast that will resume after the UK general election on 8 June.  In these discussions, I have been very clear on the urgent need to achieve progress, so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and to support broader societal healing and reconciliation.  I have also emphasised in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties, the need to ensure that legacy inquests are properly resourced, and urged all with responsibilities in relation to the legacy inquests to move forward as quickly as possible to implement the helpful proposals of the Lord Chief Justice.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue its intensive engagement with the British Government and the political parties to move forward with the Stormont House legacy framework, and I hope that this can be achieved in the period immediately ahead.</p></reply>

My Department works closely with the Department of the Taoiseach in regard to NSMC matters and the Taoiseach co-chairs the NSMC Plenary meetings with the Northern Ireland First Minister and deputy First Minister.</p><p>However, in the absence of a Northern Ireland Executive and specifically a First and deputy First Minister the North South Ministerial Council cannot meet.</p><p>As the formal means for bilateral discussions between the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, the NSMC has a crucial role to play in the Brexit discussions and the negotiations ahead.  The most recent NSMC Plenary meetings on 4 July 2016 in Dublin Castle and on 18 November 2016 in Armagh saw the Government and the Executive agree on a number of important common principles for dealing with Brexit on an all-island basis, scoping out the sectoral implications of Brexit for Ireland, North and South, and agreeing to work together to optimise North-South planning in the phases preceding and following Brexit.  It was agreed that this work would be taken forward through continuing bilateral discussions within the NSMC at sectoral level, as well as through a high-level working group comprising senior officials from the Government and from the Northern Ireland Executive Office.</p><p>At the Plenary meeting of the NSMC on 18 November 2016 in Armagh the Council considered an update by a group of Senior Officials from relevant Departments, North and South, on the progress being made on implementing the commitments set out in Section E of the Fresh Start Agreement, to provide support and funding for North-South infrastructure projects.  The review is ongoing and a further report will be presented at a future Plenary meeting.  The Senior Officials last met in February 2017 and will meet again in early June to consider progress on all of the Section E commitments. </p><p>The Council also received an update in relation to the North West Gateway Initiative.  Ministers welcomed the establishment by Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council of the <i>North West Strategic Growth Partnership</i>which will aim to work with central government North and South to ensure the North West region can reach its full potential.  </p><p>The NSMC Plenary meeting was advised that Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council had finalised the necessary arrangements for oversight and delivery of the <i>North West Strategic Growth Plan</i>and the associated &euro;5m North West Development Fund which was established under the Fresh Start Agreement.  I am pleased that the Irish Government has played a leading role in this regard &ndash; contributing &euro;2.5 million to the Fund.  The Inaugural meeting of the North West Strategic Partnership was subsequently held on 7 December 2016 and attended by senior officials from Departments, North and South.</p><p>The Government remains engaged with the political parties in Northern Ireland.  I am hopeful that after talks resume following the UK General Election on 8 June a new Northern Ireland Executive can be put in place by 29 June and that North South Ministerial Council meetings will recommence at the earliest opportunity thereafter.  </p></reply>

I condemn unreservedly any intimidation, violence, or discrimination perpetrated against indigenous people and those seeking to defend their rights, whether in Brazil or elsewhere. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples visited the Guarani-Kaiow&aacute; people in Mato Grosso Do Sul in March of last year to identify and assess the main issues facing indigenous peoples there.  The Special Rapporteur&rsquo;s report of August 2016 recognised that Brazil has in the past been a leader in the area of indigenous peoples&rsquo; rights and has made significant achievements in this area, including in constitutional provisions protecting the rights of its indigenous people.  However, the report also noted a worrying regression in the protection of indigenous peoples&rsquo; rights in recent years.   </p>  <p>  Consequently, Ireland used the occasion of the 27th Session of the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council in Geneva on 5 May 2017 to express our concern at the reported regression in the protection of indigenous peoples&rsquo; rights in Brazil.  Ireland recommended that Brazil take further steps to protect human rights defenders, including those working in relation to the rights of indigenous peoples, by ensuring impartial, thorough and effective investigations into all cases of attacks, harassment and intimidation and the prosecution of all alleged perpetrators of such offences.</p>  <p>  In addition to these representations at multilateral level, officials of my Department at home and abroad engage regularly with human rights activists and civil society leaders in Latin America, including those working on the rights of indigenous communities. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the issue of the rights of indigenous peoples is the subject of ongoing attention by European Union Ambassadors in Brazil.  Ireland and other EU Member States strongly support the mandate of FUNAI, the government agency responsible for enforcing the rights of indigenous peoples.  Together with our EU partners, we have urged the Government of Brazil to ensure that FUNAI is adequately resourced to carry out its important work. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland&rsquo;s representatives in Brazil and in multilateral fora such as the United Nations will continue to actively engage with these important issues. </p></reply>

The ongoing negative developments in Turkey, particularly in light of the referendum passed by a narrow majority on 16 April, were most recently discussed in detail at the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers (Gymnich) on 28 April, which I attended.</p>  <p>  Foreign Ministers agreed that the long-term future of all the citizens of Turkey is at the heart of the EU-Turkey relationship.  In that context, the accession process with Turkey would not be &lsquo;suspended or ended&rsquo;: if Turkey is interested in proceeding, the criteria, including on core EU values, are clear and Turkey knows what it has to do.</p>  <p>  While the EU acknowledges that Turkey has a right to decide its own governance, it has called for investigations into alleged irregularities in the conduct of the referendum as highlighted by both the Council of Europe and the OSCE.  The EU will continue to work closely with the Council of Europe in encouraging frank, open and serious discussions with Turkey. </p>  <p>  On 25 May,  the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker and President of the European Council, Donald Tusk met President Erdogan in Brussels.  They reiterated the EU&rsquo;s concern at the situation in Turkey in relation to recent developments.</p>  <p>  Ireland agrees with the EU&rsquo;s approach - it aligns completely with our own views about the future of the relationship with Turkey. </p>  <p>  I have previously expressed my concern at the number of dismissals and detentions in Turkey, and I repeat that it is critically important that the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial are respected.  The ongoing media crackdown has resulted in the closure of over 170 media outlets, the arrest and detention of over 150 journalists, and the blocking or slowing down of social media accounts and websites e. g. Wikipedia.  My concerns about the restrictions on freedom of media expression have not abated since the referendum.  </p>  <p>  The relationship with Turkey will remain on the EU agenda, and I will continue to raise my concerns about democracy, rule of law, human rights and freedom of expression, including media expression at every appropriate opportunity.</p></reply>

However, voting on membership of UN bodies involves expressing preferences between Member States or between individual candidates nominated by Member States.  This can have implications which go beyond a particular election and the policy issues addressed by these bodies.  Accordingly, since 1947, the rules of procedure governing UN General Assembly elections provide that UN elections take place by secret ballot.</p>  <p>  These rules of procedure were established to facilitate the management of sensitive international relations between countries of different views and political backgrounds.  This approach also ensures that all states &ndash; especially smaller states &ndash; can cast their votes without undue pressure from larger and more influential states that might result from votes being made public.</p>  <p>  The convention that votes in UN elections are not publicly disclosed is also well-established among the 193 Member States, as to do so could seriously damage bilateral relations between States.  Ireland joined the UN in 1955 and successive Irish governments have abided by its rules and conventions in the 62 years since then.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, in general for elections the Member States are divided into regional groupings and the practice is to allocate a certain number of positions on each committee to each regional group.  Regional groups often agree the candidate countries for the seats allocated to them in advance.  For example, for the recent election to the Commission on the Status of Women, the 55 States in the Asia-Pacific grouping agreed five candidate countries for five seats for their grouping on the 45 member Commission; these were Iraq, Japan, Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia and Turkmenistan.  Elections to the Commission took place on 19 April and the Commission will have its next annual session in March 2018.

I would urge the Chinese authorities to ensure that they do their upmost to meet their international and humanitarian obligations in this regard.</p>  <p>  As outlined in parliamentary question number 267 of 28 March 2017, the EU raises the issue of non-refoulement of refugees from North Korea with China regularly and through a number of fora.  Specifically, the issue is raised in the context of the annual Human Rights Dialogue between the EU and China. The last session of this dialogue took place in November 2015.  The next session is scheduled to take place shortly. The issue of North Korean refugees has been raised in this dialogue since the inception of the dialogue in 1995.  The issue is also raised with China by the EU, where appropriate, in other meetings at both working level and at political level including at the annual EU-China Summit and EU-China High-level Strategic Dialogue.</p></reply>

Ireland has no presence on the ground in the camps.</p>  <p>  Ireland is offering practical solidarity to Greece through the EU relocation programme which we voluntarily opted into in 2015. As part of this programme, Ireland has now taken in 459 asylum seekers from Greece and that number will increase in the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  In respect of unaccompanied minors, it should be noted that under the Greek definition - which is broader than the Irish definition - Ireland has to date taken in 22 unaccompanied minors from Greece.  Of course, the cohort of asylum seekers which Ireland is taking from Greece already includes large numbers of young children. Officials from the Department of Justice and Equality located in the Irish Embassy in Athens already work closely with both officials from the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, other Government Departments and agencies, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well as colleagues in the Greek Asylum Service, the International Organisation for Migration and other bodies, in order to make the relocation programme in Greece a success. </p>  <p>  Ireland has agreed to take 1,089 asylum seekers from Greece by September 2017 and, in close cooperation with Greek colleagues and a range of other actors, is well on target to process these numbers within that deadline.</p></reply>

I share the grave concern at the truly alarming numbers of children moving alone worldwide, many of whom are forced to take highly dangerous routes to reach their destinations, and are often at the mercy of smugglers and traffickers. </p>  <p>  Ireland has a strong partnership with UNICEF and we support its work in development and humanitarian aid.  Last year, Ireland was among UNICEF&rsquo;s top twenty international donors.  Our support enables UNICEF to carry out its valuable work on the ground to respond to the needs of children in the current refugee crisis.  UNICEF is also working to deliver humanitarian services wherever needed on refugee routes, including providing water and food and increasingly psychosocial support.  Ireland is currently a member of UNICEF&rsquo;s governing board and we are using this opportunity to ensure that the Fund continues to focus on the needs of children who are forced from their homes.</p>  <p>  Ireland also provides core funding to UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) so that it can deliver on its critical role in child protection. </p>  <p>  Last year concerted work at the UN, co-facilitated by Ireland, led to a UN agreement in September to negotiate a more humane response to the current refugee and migration crisis.  Currently UNHCR is leading efforts to finalise a Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework which recognises unaccompanied children and children separated from their families as refugees with special protection concerns.  The importance of respecting and protecting the human rights of migrant and asylum-seeking children, including unaccompanied minors, remains a priority for Ireland in this process. </p>  <p>  At the EU level, the core intention of the EU- Turkey Agreement agreed in March 2016, is to break the business model of the people smugglers who are profiting from the suffering of the vulnerable including children.  Ireland is contributing a total of almost &euro;23 million to the Facility established to support that Agreement, between 2016 and 2019.</p>  <p>  Similarly, the &euro;3 million which we will provide between 2016 and 2020 for the EU&rsquo;s Emergency Trust Fund on the Root Causes of Irregular Migration in Africa, is aimed at meeting immediate needs and at enabling longer-term development so that children will not be forced out of their homes because of the absence of economic opportunities. </p></reply>

This open, inclusive and transparent approach is welcome and is in keeping with the need to renew the EU's contract with its citizens.  The Commission is in the process of publishing a series of accompanying reflection papers on a range of diverse topics which will also contribute to the Europe-wide discussions that this White Paper seeks to initiate.

On a national basis, the Government and the Oireachtas should of course facilitate and encourage a wide ranging and full engagement by Ireland in this important debate about the future of Europe that reflects the very high levels of support that the Irish people give to our EU membership.

It has featured on the agenda of almost every European Council over the period, as well on the agenda of many Foreign Affairs and JHA Councils.  The migration crisis will again be discussed by EU Heads of State and Government at their June European Council meeting.</p>  <p>  The EU has responded to the crisis by adopting a range of measures to deal with this mass movement of people.  These have included engaging with countries of origin and transit to address the root causes of migration including through bespoke Migration Compacts; agreeing a plan to relocate migrants from Italy and Greece across the Union; the launching of Operation Sophia to disrupt people smuggling in the Mediterranean; and substantial financial assistance to countries hosting large numbers of migrants.  EU Heads of State and Government concluded a landmark migration deal with Turkey in March 2016, which has resulted in a very substantial reduction in the number of migrants risking their lives at sea to enter the EU from Turkey. </p>  <p>  In the past year the focus has shifted from Turkey to the so-called Central Mediterranean Route, with some 181,000 migrants crossing from Libya to Italy in 2016.  In March 2017, EU leaders issued the Malta Declaration, which sets out the EU&rsquo;s commitment to assist Libya, with a strong focus on capacity building.  This includes training, equipment and support for the Libyan national coast guard and other relevant agencies, as well as seeking to ensure adequate reception capacities and conditions in Libya for migrants, including through working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration.  Last month the EU announced a &euro;90m programme to improve the protection of migrants and reinforce migration management in Libya.  This is in addition to the &euro;120 million already announced for migration-related support for Libya.</p>  <p>  Responses to the migration crisis have varied from one EU member state to the other with some states admitting large numbers of migrants while others have resisted admitting any.  Ireland choose to voluntarily Opt In to EU arrangements to relocate migrants from Greece and Italy and accept up to 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers both on humanitarian grounds and as a gesture of solidarity with our partners in the EU.  For administrative and other reasons, progress in taking in migrants has been slower than anticipated, as it has in many other EU member states.  However, in recent months the pace has accelerated.

Economic prosperity is an integral part of deepening peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland.  The achievements of peace and the operation of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement have greatly facilitated progress in developing an all-island economy.</p><p>A central goal of the extensive engagement that I and my Government colleagues have undertaken in the eleven months since the referendum in the UK has been to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s unique concerns in relation to Brexit are understood by our EU partners and to seek explicit recognition of these issues and priorities in the EU&rsquo;s position for the withdrawal negotiations.  The Government has laid particular emphasis on the political imperative of achieving flexible and imaginative solutions in relation to the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, in particular with a view to avoiding a hard border.  In so doing, we have been equally clear that we will only pursue solutions that are compatible with our aim of protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.</p><p>This extensive political, diplomatic, and official campaign has been effective.  This was reflected most recently in the clear statement of support given by Michel Barnier when he said that Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the upcoming negotiations will be the EU&rsquo;s interests.  Even more importantly, this has been demonstrated in practice through the strong acknowledgement of Ireland&rsquo;s issues in the European Council Guidelines, the detailed negotiating Directives and the European Parliament&rsquo;s resolution on Brexit.</p><p>We have already taken important steps to prepare our economy, including in Budget 2017, the Action Plan for Jobs 2017, and our New Trade and Investment Strategy.  Now that the EU&rsquo;s initial negotiating position is clear, the Government will intensify its focus on the economic implications of Brexit.  In order to underpin this, building on the recent Government strategy document released on 2 May, a further paper on the economic implications of the Brexit challenge is being developed.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests lie firmly in a strong and well-functioning EU with continued and unfettered access to the Single Market.  In terms of Brexit, the Government is working to minimise any negative impact on our economy and to provide clarity and certainty for our businesses that are trading with the UK.  To this end, the Government&rsquo;s consistent position is that we wish to see the closest possible trading relationship based on a level playing field between the UK and the EU, including Ireland.  </p><p>I hope that we can see substantial progress in the initial phase of the negotiations so that we can start talks on the framework for the future relationship between the UK and the EU as early as possible.</p></reply>

GDP growth in Africa has remained resilient, with the African Development Bank estimating growth of 4.7% in 2017.  Medium-term prospects for economic development on the continent are also positive.</p>  <p>  Our trade promotion activities in Africa are guided by the Department&rsquo;s Africa Strategy, launched in 2011.  Ireland Connected, the trade and investment strategy published in March of this year, mandates the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other relevant Departments and agencies to &lsquo;deliver focused events and activities to support a deepened economic engagement with Africa, building on the approach identified in the Africa Strategy&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Ireland has 11 Embassies in Africa, each of which includes trade promotion as a core element of its role.  The Embassies provide support and advice to Irish companies seeking to explore economic opportunities available in their countries of accreditation, and promote Ireland to potential investors as an attractive location in which to do business.  Working with local Irish business groups, the Embassies in South Africa and Kenya have also produced accessible guides to doing business in Africa.</p>  <p>  A range of initiatives have also been undertaken by the Department in Ireland, to complement the work of the Embassies, and to increase awareness of the opportunities available to Irish companies in Africa.  These include the Africa Ireland Economic Forum, which brings together business and policy makers from Ireland and Africa to discuss opportunities for enhanced trade and investment, and the Winning Business in Africa initiative, which highlights tendering opportunities for Irish companies under the European Development Fund.  Last year, the local Irish chapter of the Business Ireland Africa network was launched, with the support of the Department.</p>  <p>  The Department will continue to work with all relevant state agencies, in line with the Team Ireland approach of the Ireland Connected strategy, as well as with partners in the private sector, to support and enhance Ireland&rsquo;s economic and trade links with Africa.</p></reply>

A strong focus on Sub-Sahara Africa continues to be central to Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme.  Successive Peer Reviews of our aid programme by the OECD, including the most recent in 2014, have highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to benefit the poorest countries in the world.  </p><p>Approximately 25% of Ireland&rsquo;s official aid is spent on humanitarian response.  In order to ensure that our humanitarian response is focused on areas of greatest need, we use a Country Categorisation of Needs method which ranks crises according to risk and needs. Category 1 countries are classed as those with greatest needs.  All humanitarian funding decisions are informed by this method. </p><p>As an example of how we apply this tool, all countries in the Horn of Africa region currently fall within Categories 1 and 2 and as a result, Ireland provides substantial humanitarian assistance to South Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, and Sudan. Assistance to the region has totaled &euro;120 million in since 2012, including &euro;17 million to date in 2017.</p><p>In addition, significant resources are committed to vulnerable and crisis affected communities in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.  Also to forgotten crises, such as in Chad, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are also prioritised for support. </p><p>High standards of accountability are continually maintained to ensure that aid reaches its intended beneficiaries.  All funding proposals are rigorously appraised by officials from my Department against clear criteria, including effectiveness and efficiency, the capacity of implementing organisations to deliver results, and account for resources received.  Programmes in receipt of funding are subject to regular monitoring to ensure intended results are being achieved and resources have been used appropriately.  </p><p>Robust accountability systems in partner countries are essential to ensuring that assistance is appropriately targeted to reach the poorest and most vulnerable beneficiaries.  Ireland also strongly supports the strengthening of these national systems in partner countries.  </p><p>Full details of the distribution of our aid, and the results achieved, are published each year in our Annual Report.  The latest Annual Report 2015 is available at <i>www.irishaid.ie</i>.</p></reply>

Engagement with third countries to prevent violent extremism and to strengthen their capacity to detect and prevent terrorism, in full compliance with international law and human rights, is at the heart of the EU&rsquo;s strategy and is reflected in a substantial increase in assistance to third countries in this respect.</p><p>The EU has placed considerable emphasis on its immediate neighbourhood: Western Balkans, Turkey, and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries.  Actions include finalising Counter-Terrorism action plans with Lebanon, Jordan, Tunisia and Turkey, expanding the EU Counter Terrorism experts&rsquo; network to the Sahel and Western Balkans, and focusing on preventive action on conflict and violent extremism prevention priorities identified through the EU Early Warning process.</p><p>The EU&rsquo;s approach is guided by, and is consistent with, the approach taken by the UN to countering terrorism and by the principles and measures set out in relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, including UNSCR 2161 (2014) on freezing funds and other assets of terrorist groups, and UNSCR 2178 (2014) on measures to suppress the recruiting, organising, transporting or equipping of individuals who travel to another State to plan or carry out terrorist acts or training.</p><p>The former UN Secretary General&rsquo;s comprehensive <i>Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism</i>, presented in January last year, and his related reports are an important and welcome contribution to addressing the threat posed by international terrorism, and to highlighting the need to address drivers of violent extremism through dialogue and conflict prevention, strengthening governance and the rule of law, gender equality and empowering women, community engagement and youth empowerment, and education and skills development. </p><p>Ireland supports the comprehensive approach being taken at EU and UN levels level to preventing and countering terrorism.  At meetings of the Council, I have stressed the need to tackle underlying factors that contribute to radicalisation and terrorism and in particular the importance of the link between security and development.  I have emphasised the need to ensure a joined-up approach in relation to the discussions of Foreign Ministers and those of our Justice and Home Affairs counterparts with a view to a coordinated and comprehensive response to terrorism that can help ensure the safety of citizens abroad and in Ireland.  </p></reply>

There have been over 400 such engagements with the 27 EU Member States and the EU Institutions, which has included most recently the visit of the EU&rsquo;s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to Ireland.  This programme of engagement has been led by the Taoiseach, as well as my colleagues from across Government, complemented by official level meetings.  For my part, I have had nearly 100 engagements with my EU counterparts and with the EU institutions.</p>  <p>  A central goal of this engagement has been to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s unique concerns in relation to Brexit are understood by our EU partners and to seek explicit recognition of these issues and priorities in the EU&rsquo;s position for the withdrawal negotiations.</p>  <p>  This extensive political, diplomatic and official campaign has delivered for Ireland.  This was reflected most recently in the clear statement of support given by Michel Barnier when he said during his address to the Joint Houses of the Oireachtas that Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the upcoming negotiations will be the EU&rsquo;s interests.  This has been demonstrated in practice through the strong acknowledgement of Ireland&rsquo;s concerns and priorities in the European Council Guidelines, the detailed negotiating Directives and the European Parliament&rsquo;s resolution on Brexit.</p>  <p>  The EU Guidelines adopted by the Taoiseach and his counterparts on 29 April fully take account of the Government&rsquo;s priority of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including the need for flexible and imaginative solutions to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland as well as recognising bilateral agreements and arrangements between Ireland and the UK, including the Common Travel Area.</p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s negotiating directives, which were agreed by the General Affairs Council on 22 May are fully in line with the EU Guidelines and additionally reflect the need to take full account of the situation of Irish citizens residing in Northern Ireland who will continue to enjoy rights as EU citizens.  They also recognise the need to address issues arising from Ireland&rsquo;s unique geographic situation, including the transit of goods to and from Ireland via the UK.</p>  <p>  I have been struck by the very genuine level of engagement and understanding demonstrated by our EU partners with regard to the significant political challenges that Brexit poses to Ireland and in particular the peace process.  Finding solutions will be a difficult exercise, but my engagement with EU partners has left me fully confident that we can count on their support as we seek the right outcome for Ireland at the end of what will be complex negotiations. </p></reply>

One factor behind this is disillusionment among Europe&rsquo;s citizens that their everyday concerns are not being addressed by their political leaders.  In response, they have been listening more closely to those offering easy answers and all too often, simplistic solutions.</p><p>The Rome Declaration agreed by EU leaders in March rightly highlights the EU's achievements, which leaders see as being increasingly overshadowed by the drift towards euro scepticism and the sense of alienation among voters.  One way of addressing this sense of alienation is for the EU to deliver practical improvements to the lives of citizens throughout the Union.</p><p>While there are differing views about the order and emphasis on different policy priorities &ndash; jobs and growth, Single Market and Digital Single Market, migration, internal and external security and defence &ndash; there is convergence on the need to communicate that the EU will prioritise delivery for its citizens, re-dedicate itself to its core values, and reaffirm its <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>as the embodiment of peace, stability, democracy and the Rule of Law in these uncertain times. </p><p>Delivery on these important issues should serve to rekindle citizens&rsquo; trust in - and support for - the EU and the values it espouses.</p></reply>

This Programme forms a significant part of the recent Capital Review carried out by the OPW and the early development targets are included in the spending targets for the Office over the period immediately ahead.</p>  <p>  While all of the current visitor locations in the relevant parts of the country, including Co. Kildare sites, were considered for investment, it is clear that certain properties have a better short and medium term tourism development potential because of factors such as an identified visitor need, site availability, existing tourism traffic etc.   It is felt that a targeted capital investment in these locations in particular would best meet the needs of the Tourism Programme and would yield exponentially better outcomes in terms of generating visitor footfall at these locations.  The Maynooth site, while it is performing relatively well as a local and a seasonal tourism site, is not considered, in this early phase of the Programme, to offer as significant a potential for tourism generation.</p>  <p>  The Tourism Capital Development Programme is intended to progress over a 5 year period and will involve the continuing reappraisal of all investment options on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

The particular PSPR treatment of these later-awarded pensions reflects the fact that they are based on salary rates which have been affected by the public service pay cuts of 1 January 2010; earlier-awarded pensions, by contrast, are effectively based on salary rates which do not take these 2010 pay cuts into account.</p><p>A very significant part-unwinding of PSPR in three stages is taking place under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015, with PSPR-affected pensioners getting pension increases via substantial restoration of the PSPR cuts on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018 as follows:</p><p>- On 1 January 2016, increases in the annual pension thresholds for PSPR application were activated.  These exemption threshold increases fully removed PSPR from a significant number of pensions with relatively lower values, while those pensions which continued to be impacted by PSPR received a boost of &euro;400 per year. </p><p>- On 1 January 2017, additional PSPR amelioration, acting principally via further exemption threshold increases, fully removed PSPR from another significant tranche of public service pensioners, while at the same time boosting those pensions which remain affected by PSPR by up to &euro;500 per year.</p><p>- On 1 January 2018, the third phase of PSPR amelioration will ensure that all PSPR-impacted pensions with values up to &euro;34,132 will be fully restored, meaning that PSPR will no longer affect such pensions, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR will get a boost of, in most cases, &euro;780 per year. </p><p>At 2015 year-end, public service pensions with annual pre-PSPR values up to at least &euro;12,000 were exempt from PSPR.  Under the FEMPI 2015 three-stage part-unwinding which I have referred to, on 1 January 2016, all pensions of up to at least &euro;18,700 became exempt from PSPR; from 1 January 2017, all pensions of up to at least &euro;26,000 are now exempt from PSPR, and from 1 January 2018 all pensions of up to at least &euro;34,132 per year will be exempt from PSPR.  Those pensioners not fully removed from the reach of PSPR by dint of these changes will, in the majority of cases, benefit by &euro;1,680 per year from 2018 . The cost of these changes is estimated at about &euro;90 million on a full-year basis from 2018.</p><p>Under section 12 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, I as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform am required to review the necessity of the FEMPI legislation annually and cause a written report my findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The next report is due by end June 2017 and in the context of that report, I shall review the scope of the existing financial emergency measures and the possible further scale-back of those measures, including the PSPR. </p></reply>

As it is the economic and evaluation resources within the relevant Departments that are best placed to determine if the existing appraisal framework provides the best available advice on measuring and reporting on the costs and benefits associated with climate change measures, my Department will work with the relevant Departments in circumstances where the latter consider that changes in terms of specific sectoral and/or technical guidance in the Public Spending Code is necessary.</p>  <p>  In this context it is to be noted that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is, through the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGESS), supporting capacity building of economic and evaluation skill sets in Government Departments.</p>  <p>  A sustained whole of Government approach will be required to enable Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050.

The draft plan acknowledges the savings made to date through the OPW's successful Optimising Power @ Work energy conservation initiative and proposes to build on the existing campaign.  The draft plan also refers to the recent publication of the "Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy" and the OPW is working closely with other relevant Departments and agencies to identify energy efficiency projects within our building portfolio.

On foot of the conclusions from the HPRA&rsquo;s report I announced my intention to establish an access programme for cannabis-based treatments, for patients under the care of a medical consultant, for the following medical conditions:</p><p>- spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis resistant to all standard therapies and interventions;</p><p>- intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, despite the use of standard anti-emetic regimes; </p><p>- severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy that has failed to respond to standard anticonvulsant medications. </p><p>An expert reference group has been established to develop the operational, clinical and practice guidelines for this access programme. Officials in the Department are also working on secondary legislation to underpin the access programme.  This work will take a number of months to complete.</p><p>Under existing legislation it is open to me, as Minister, to consider granting a licence under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, for access to medical cannabis for named patients, where the proposed course of treatment has been endorsed by the patient&rsquo;s Irish-based consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient, and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.  One such licence has already been granted under this mechanism.</p><p>The main elements of an application submitted under the Misuse of Drugs legislation for a licence for cannabis for medicinal use must include:</p><p>- an outline of the treatment the patient has received to date and justification from the doctor as to why it is appropriate in their patient&rsquo;s specific circumstances to prescribe a Schedule 1 drug; </p><p>- details of the cannabis-based product which it is proposed to prescribe and administer to the patient; </p><p>- the source of the cannabis-based product; </p><p>- the arrangements for the ongoing monitoring and care of the patient once the cannabis-based treatment has commenced.</p><p>Ultimately it is the decision of the clinician, in consultation with their patient, to prescribe or not prescribe a particular treatment for a patient under their care.  I have no role in this clinical decision-making process.</p></reply>

Although a proportion of activity in public hospitals involves the provision of care to private patients, the core purpose of the system is to provide services for public patients.  Government policy is to ensure there is equitable access for public patients, that the proportion of private activity is appropriately controlled and that the costs of provision of services to private patients are recouped by public hospitals.  Persons can opt to be treated privately on admission to a public hospital, in which case they are liable for the consultants fees and hospital charges arising for that episode of care, whether paid for by the patient or by a health insurer on their behalf.  Where private in-patient services are provided the daily charges that apply depend on the category of hospital and whether the overnight accommodation was in a single or multi-occupancy room.</p>  <p>  There are a broad range of health insurance products available to consumers in the health insurance market, which provide varying levels of benefit.  Most health insurance contracts cover the cost of consultant services provided during a hospital stay (an exception to this would be day-to-day or outpatient policies).</p>  <p>  Some Private Health Insurers have raised issues in relation to the operational procedures (in particular the use of the Private Insurance Patient waiver form) in place by hospitals for the collection of the private in-patient charges.  The detailed operational procedures are managed by the HSE.  It is considered that the application of these operational procedures should be sensitive to the health status of patients whilst in hospital.  The Department has recently conducted an analysis of trends in private activity in public hospitals since the Health (Amendment) Act 2013 commenced.  The key conclusion from the analysis is that the proportion of patients treated privately in public hospitals remained very stable over recent years and did not increase significantly further to the introduction of the new charging regime in 2014.</p></reply>

This chronic disease policy framework addresses the challenges of chronic disease so as to reduce the burden for individuals, their carers and the health system.

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  </p>  <p>  In December 2016, I granted approval to the NTPF to dedicate &euro;5m to a daycase waiting list initiative with the aim of ensuring that no patient will be waiting more than 18 months for a daycase procedure by 30 June 2017.  In excess of 2,000 daycases will be managed through this process and patients have started to receive appointments and procedures.  Specifically, the NTPF has advised that over 300 patients have accepted an offer of treatment in a private hospital and that over 80 patients have received their procedure.</p>  <p>  In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services.  These plans have now been finalised and the details will be communicated imminently.  It is expected that the Inpatient / Daycase and Outpatient Plans will considerably reduce the number of patients waiting 15 months or more for inpatient and daycase treatment or for an outpatient appointment.  The Scoliosis Action Plan aims to ensure that no patient is waiting more than four months by the end of 2017.</p>  <p>  These Plans will utilise both the capacity within the private hospital system through outsourcing, whilst maximising existing capacity in our public hospital system through insourcing within hospital groups.  The Plans have been developed in conjunction with, and supported by, the NTPF's proposal for utilisation of the remaining &euro;10m of 2017 funding for patient treatment.</p></reply>

It states that a person may be detained in such a centre where he or she is suffering from a mental disorder.  It does, however, prohibit the detention of a person deemed not to have a mental disorder but who is addicted to drugs or intoxicants or is suffering from a personality disorder.  Section 3 of the Act defines &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo; as being a state of mind which affects the person&rsquo;s thinking, perceiving, emotion or judgement and which seriously impairs the mental function of the person to the extent that he or she requires care or medical treatment in his or her own interest or in the interest of other persons.  The prescription of psychotropic drugs may be taken as a clinical indication of a mental health disorder if it has been prescribed to treat a mental illness.</p></reply>

The terms and conditions of employees in the public service is generally a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  In this context an Interdepartmental Working Group on Fuller Working Lives, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was established in early 2016 to examine issues from prevailing retirement ages for workers in both the public and private sectors. </p>  <p>  The Report of this Group was agreed by Government in August 2016.  The report identified a set of framework principles to underpin policy in the area and made a number of recommendations assigned to Government Departments and employer bodies for follow-up.  On foot of the recommendations in this report  the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been tasked with reviewing the current statutory and operational considerations giving rise to barriers to extended participation in the public service workforce up to and including the current and planned age of entitlement to the Contributory State Pensions.  This work  is currently underway and expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017.  Any future proposals will be considered in the context of the outcome of the work of this group.</p></reply>

In order to manage the available funds within the budget throughout the year, a national placement list is operated by the HSE.  Funding approvals issue to applicants in chronological order.  There is no transitional payment available for applicants whose NHSS application is being processed, however in 2017 the time applicants to the Scheme spend on the placement list for funding should not exceed 4 weeks.</p></reply>

The National Screening Service (NSS) oversees the three national cancer screening programmes: BreastCheck, CervicalCheck and BowelScreen.</p><p>The implementation of national, population based screening programmes for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer was recommended by the 2006 National Cancer Strategy, <i>A Strategy for Cancer Control in Ireland.</i>In the 2014 Evaluation Panel Report on the implementation of that Strategy, the panel noted that excellent progress had been made in the area of screening in Ireland since its commencement. </p><p>To date, BreastCheck has detected over 8,500 cancers.  CervicalCheck has detected 1,082 invasive cervical cancers, 41,417 high-grade abnormalities and 29,508 low-grade abnormalities.  In its first three year screening round which finished in December 2015, BowelScreen detected 521 cancers and led to the removal of over 13,000 precancerous adenomas. </p><p>The objective of screening is to detect disease before it has developed to the point where it results in symptoms.  Thus, these numbers represent members of our population who would not otherwise have been aware that they had cancer, or that they were at risk of developing cancer.  Without the intervention of the screening programmes, many of these people may not have received the care they needed in a timely manner leading to better outcomes.</p></reply>

The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  Notwithstanding this, I understand that in recent times, some GPs are charging GMS patients for these services.  </p>  <p>  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may make a complaint to the HSE Local Health Office, who will deal with the matter in accordance with the HSE's Complaints Policy.  </p>  <p>  In order to achieve clarity on this issue, I have asked that any difference of perspective in relation to the provision of phlebotomy services be addressed in the GP contractual review.  I am pleased that engagement with GP representative bodies to progress this process has commenced and I look forward to constructive and positive engagements in the coming months.  </p></reply>

I have met the HSE specifically about this, and visited Linn Dara last week.  The HSE has confirmed that no young person is discharged from Linn Dara, unless this is deemed clinically appropriate by their mental health team.  It should be clearly understood also, that nobody is discharged to allow a bed to be closed.</p>  <p>  As is normal practice, a number of young people have been discharged from Linn Dara purely based on clinical decisions.  Due to staff shortages, for a variety of reasons , some beds cannot be refilled.  This, unfortunately, has left Linn Dara with just half of its 22 bed complement operational.  The HSE has indicated that, for those discharged for clinical reasons, dedicated follow-on supports from the community-based CAMHS service will be provided, if deemed necessary.  The Executive will also make available the CAMHS Day Service, as appropriate in individual cases, to enhance supports for young people and their families.</p>  <p>  The core issue facing Linn Dara relates specifically to staff recruitment and retention difficulties for mental health professionals.  This, unfortunately, reflects wider health system issues.  The problem in this case does not relate to funding availability.  Staffing cover has been augmented in recent times through methods such as staff working additional hours, overtime and engaging agency staff.</p>  <p>  The HSE are exploring every option to maximise the operation of this service in the future.  The Executive is intensifying its efforts on recruitment, and while a number of staff have been identified to join the Linn Dara service in the near future, this will take time.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may rest assured that all efforts will continue to be made to address on-going service difficulties at Linn Dara.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Department of Health is currently engaged in a detailed process to determine what type of home care scheme is best for Ireland.  This process will consider the future design of both the funding and regulation systems for these crucial services.</p>  <p>  As an initial step, the Department recently published an evidence review, undertaken by the Health Research Board, of the home care systems that are in place in four other European countries.  The Review will help us to learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions and will inform the debate and future consideration of approaches to formal home care financing and regulation here in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Another important step in this process is a public consultation which I will be launching shortly.  The purpose of this consultation is to allow all those who have views on this topic to have their say, including older people themselves, their families, and healthcare workers.  I strongly urge all those with an interest in home care services to make a submission to the consultation.</p>  <p>  The benefits that individuals receive from their allocated provider will differ from person to person.</p></reply>

However, it is open to the complainant to discuss their concerns with their private healthcare provider.  In addition the complainant can refer their concerns to the appropriate Regulatory Body for the particular healthcare professional involved in their care.  Doctors, Nurses, Health and Social Care Professionals and others are required to be registered with their relevant professional body which in turn oversees the maintenance of professional standards.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, work is currently underway in my department on legislative proposals relating to the development of a Health Information and Patient Safety Bill for  health care facilities.  It will provide for the extension of the remit of Health Information and Quality Authority to set and monitor standards in private hospitals, including the management of complaints.  The Health Information and Patient Safety Bill has recently under gone pre-legislative scrutiny with the Oireachtas Health Committee.</p>  <p>  Hospitals need to take complaints and their management very seriously, as they provide an opportunity for the healthcare facility to  learn and improve.  My  Department is also in the process of undertaking a public consultation on the development of a Patient Safety Complaints and Advocacy Policy.  We are seeking the opinion of the public and encourage everyone to complete the questionnaire which is available on the Department's website.  The information received through this consultation will inform the National Patient Safety Complaints and Advocacy Policy.</p>  <p>  The Department is also continuing to develop the Draft General Scheme of the Patients Safety Licensing Bill, which will introduce a regulatory regime for all hospitals, public and private.</p></reply>

In that same period a total of 5,703 representations were received of which over 2,000 were sent to the HSE for reply.</p>  <p>  To ensure that members of the Oireachtas receive as effective a service as possible the HSE has a dedicated Parliamentary Affairs Division (PAD).  This is a national office and is responsible for all communication between the Houses of the Oireachtas, Department of Health and the HSE.  The Head of PAD reports directly to the Director General.  The PAD processes all questions referred to it from the Department and representations received directly from Deputies.  To assist members of the Oireachtas in contacting the HSE PAD has a dedicated email address for members pad@hse.ie.</p>  <p>  The HSE's performance in replying to PQs and representations is monitored by the Parliamentary Affairs Unit in my Department and they meet regularly with their colleagues in the HSE to review performance.</p>  <p>  PAD also makes every effort to facilitate members of the Oireachtas in obtaining information outside the Parliamentary Process.  For example in the twelve months to May 2017 there were 28,000 email/phone engagements between TDs and the Primary Care Reimbursement Service on national medical card matters.  PCRS have briefed members of the Oireachtas on several occasions as to how they can cater to requests for information outside the parliamentary system.</p>  <p>  As noted above I am satisfied that the HSE takes its responsibility to the democratic process seriously and strives to provide as effective a service as possible.  Systems are constantly reviewed to ensure they operate as effectively as possible and I have no plans to review processes at this time.</p></reply>

The data is extracted from the National Incident Management System (NIMS), a system which it hosts for the Health Service Executive, other healthcare enterprises and Delegated State Authorities.</p><p>The table supplied shows details on all compensation payments made and the number of claims they relate to with regard to Maternity Services in the 19 maternity units nationwide from 2007 to 2017 year to date.  The figures include payments related to acute maternity units only and are broken down by hospitals groups as providing such information at a hospital level on a claim by claim basis could have the unfortunate and unintended consequence of causing the State Claims Agency to breach data protection legislation by potentially identifying individual plaintiffs or hospital employees.</p><p>Additionally, the State Claims Agency has indicated that this information could have a detrimental effect concerning the financially sensitive management of the active claims portfolio.  Finally, the State Claims Agency has concerns that the provision of this information on a hospital by hospital basis could result in non-contextualised league tables giving the public a wrong impression of any individual hospital&rsquo;s patient quality and safety risk. </p><p>It should be noted that:</p><p>- The figures relate to compensation payments made to patients and service users only.</p><p>- Private healthcare schemes are excluded.</p><p>- The compensation payments included can relate to any type of claim where the service has been recorded as Maternity Services, i.e. birth specific procedures, medication errors, hospital acquired infections etc.</p><p>- In order to avoid breaches of data protection legislation, some hospital groups have been merged where appropriate to avoid possible identification of individual patients or hospital employees.</p><p>- This report is correct as of 29/05/2017.</p><p>- It is important to note that payments outlined in the table may be made in relation to a single claim across multiple transactional years and that the total number of individual claims which the payments in this table relate to is 533.<table><tr><th>Transaction Year</th><th>Hospital Group</th><th>Amount</th><th>Number of Claims</th></tr><tr><td rowspan="5">2007</td><td>Group 1 -

We do not know yet what changes the UK may seek to the current arrangements. We are, however, clear that our objective is to maintain current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal and protect Ireland&rsquo;s quota share for joint fish stocks. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I hosted a dedicated Civic Dialogue on the potential impacts of Brexit for the seafood sector as whole.  This was very well attended by stakeholders from across the industry and gave a clear insight into the real dangers that a 'hard' Brexit presents for our fishing communities.  </p>  <p>  I will remain in close contact with fisheries stakeholders as the issues develop and work with them and my fellow fisheries Ministers in the EU to ensure that we are all fully prepared for what are likely to be extremely complex negotiations.   </p>  <p>  I am also continuing to work closely with all of my European colleagues to ensure that fisheries remain a top priority in the negotiations to come. </p>  <p>  As both I and An Taoiseach have stated before, we intend to ensure that fisheries remains high on the Brexit agenda in the EU and that Ireland obtains the best possible outcome from the negotiations. </p>  <p>  During the recent visit of Chief Brexit Negotiator, Mr Michel Barnier to Ireland, I met with him and discussed the issues arising for the agri-food sector.  On fisheries,  I explained Ireland's perspective and that it was shared by a number of EU partners.  I am satisfied that  Mr Barnier understands the issues and the potential significance of Brexit for Ireland's fisheries sector.  Mr Barnier agreed with me that fisheries negotiations must be inextricably linked to the wider trade negotiations.  </p>  <p>  I also made clear that transitional arrangements are likely to be important for the seafood sector. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that I will be unequivocal in opposing any dilution of our existing EU quota shares, including protecting the benefit to Ireland of the Hague Preferences, and any limitations on our existing rights of access.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-30a.1341.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000078#WRX02300"><p>Food Wise 2025, the ten-year strategy for the agri-food sector published in July 2015, identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow it to grow and prosper.  It includes more than 400 specific recommendations spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness, as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p>  <p>  Food Wise is a vision for the sector developed by stakeholders and facilitated by my department.  As regards reviewing the strategy in the light of Brexit, it is important to understand that Food Wise 2025 is in fact, a living and evolving strategy.  I chair quarterly meetings of the High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC), with high level representatives from all the relevant Departments and State agencies.  The committee reviews progress on detailed actions on a quarterly basis, in order to identify and solve problems quickly.  Brexit has now been included as a standard item on the agenda of each meeting of the HLIC. </p>  <p>  It is not yet clear what the final outcome of the UK's decision to leave the EU will be. While the value of agri-food exports to the UK declined in 2016 - primarily as a result of the reduction in the value of sterling - the overall value of exports increased.  A so-called 'hard' Brexit, involving the imposition of WTO tariffs on trade, would have a more significant adverse effect on the value of exports, but our stated aim is to avoid such a scenario. </p>  <p>  In either event, while recognising the challenges, I do not believe that it would be appropriate to reduce our ambition for the sector at this juncture.  Furthermore, it is clear that the implementation of the Food Wise recommendations, particularly those related to market development, competitiveness and innovation, will assume even greater importance in the light of the UK decision, regardless of the ultimate outcome.</p></reply>

The working groups meet regularly and focus on critical issues such as disease control, animal identification and movement, cross-Border communication, data sharing and the development of joint initiatives on animal welfare.  Working groups are also meeting to discuss specific Brexit issues, including in the area of animal health and disease. </p>  <p>  In October 2016 I chaired the most recent meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council on agriculture.   Together with Michelle McIlveen, then Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, we welcomed the continuing work on the delivery of the Action Plan and, in the context of Brexit, looked forward to the continuation of practical and effective co-operation on animal health and welfare, and disease control in both jurisdictions, in order that the health and welfare of livestock is maintained at the highest level. </p>  <p>  Since December 2016 I have hosted three all-island civic dialogue events to discuss the implications of Brexit across the agrifood sector and one civic dialogue for the fisheries sector.   These events provide important opportunities to engage directly in detail with stakeholders on the implications of Brexit and the potential responses that will be required as the negotiations unfold.  The need to maintain an all-island approach to animal health/disease issues was discussed.</p>  <p>  I have held a number of meetings with my EU colleagues and the European Commissioner for agriculture over the past few months to discuss Brexit and the potential implications for the agrifood and fisheries sectors in Ireland.  As part of these discussions, I outlined the integrated nature of the North-South food economy and cautioned against the potential  implications of a return to a hard Border.</p>  <p>  Within my Department I established a Brexit Response Committee and a dedicated Brexit Unit.  A Stakeholder Consultative Committee was also established, to assess the impact of Brexit and to ensure a full exchange of information in advance of exit negotiations taking place.</p></reply>

The Scheme, which was developed by my Department in co-operation with the SBCI, makes &euro;150 million available to farmers at interest rates of 2.95%.  Distributed and administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, the Scheme provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital, allowing them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>  <p>  The SBCI reported that &euro;60.2m has been drawn down by farmers to the end of April.  The average loan size is &euro;32,000, with more than half the loans being advanced for terms of four years or more.  Normal bank lending criteria applies to the Scheme and the terms and conditions of each individual loan are agreed between the bank and the applicant according to the purpose of the loans and the circumstances of the farming enterprise.</p>  <p>  One of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some agriculture sectors.  I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.  I have met with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other access to finance issues relating to the agrifood sector.  I have asked the banks to respond positively to the demand that has been demonstrated by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.</p>  <p>  The banks advise that all of the remaining &euro;150m is committed and is in the process of being drawn down.  Based on progress to date, the SBCI anticipate that in total approximately 4,000 farmers will benefit from the scheme.  I attach the SBCI figures as reported on 2 May.</p></reply>

We also held a seminar to encourage further consultation and discussion of suggestions received as part of the public consultation phase. </p>  <p>  The Teagasc Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) for Irish Agriculture (April 2012) quantified the opportunities for abatement of agricultural greenhouse gases, as well as the associated costs and benefits and was key in informing the suite of priority measures selected for implementation.  An updated MACC is currently being finalised which will quantify the abatement potential of the agriculture, forest sector and land use sector for the period 2021-2030 and identify further measures for consideration.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware my Department and its agencies have been strongly focused on improving the efficiency of Irish farming which is key to reducing emissions.  We are focused on improving animal, grassland and nutrient management and have invested heavily in a number of schemes and measures such as the Origin Green initiative, the Beef Data and Genomics Programme and our Agri-Environment Scheme, GLAS.  Our knowledge transfer programmes are key to bringing the latest innovative sustainability research and practices direct to farmers.  These strategies have led to a significant disaggregation of production output and emissions, with current analysis suggesting that the emissions intensity per kcal of food output in 2013 is reduced approximately 14% relative to 2005.  </p>  <p>  The agriculture and forest sector mitigation measures have been submitted for inclusion in the NMP to my colleague Minster Naughten.  I look forward to the publication of the final Plan in due course.</p></reply>

The Directive sets out measures to prevent and limit waste from end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) and their components and to ensure that, where possible, this is reused, recycled or recovered.  It sets clear quantified targets for Member States for reuse, recycling and recovery of ELVs and their components.  It also encourages producers to manufacture new vehicles without hazardous substances, thus promoting the reuse, recyclability and recoverability of waste vehicles.</p>  <p>  The ELV Regulations are primarily concerned with ensuring that Ireland meets the reuse, recycling and recovery targets laid out in the Directive.  They put in place measures to ensure that producers of new or imported vehicles fulfil their obligations in relation to the end-of-life vehicles for which they are responsible and put in place a network of authorised treatment facilities to ensure that these vehicles are treated correctly. </p>  <p>  The aims of EU ELV Directive, which are to reduce waste, to encourage reuse, and improve the environmental performance of the vehicle industry, do not address road safety issues, which are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></reply>

The draft Plan has been prepared having regard to the provisions set out in the 2015 Act in close collaboration with all relevant Government Departments and, in particular, with the Ministers responsible for Transport, and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use. The Electricity Generation and Built Environment sectors are dealt with in my own Department.  Work on the Plan has been overseen by an inter-Departmental National Mitigation Plan Steering Group, as well as by both the Senior Officials Group, and the Cabinet Committee, on Infrastructure, Climate Action and the Environment.  Technical support has been provided to all the sectors by the Technical Research and Modelling Group which operates under my Department. </p>  <p>  In addition, I invited the Climate Change Advisory Council, following my publication of the draft National Mitigation Plan, to engage directly with me and with other relevant Government Ministers with a view to providing its recommendations to feed into the preparation of the final Plan.  All input received from the Advisory Council has being considered in finalising the National Mitigation Plan.</p>  <p>  As well as mechanisms to ensure inter-Departmental cooperation, I also recognise the need to engage wider society more generally with the climate challenge, motivate changes in behaviour, and create structures at local, regional and national levels to support the generation of ideas and their translation into appropriate cost-effective actions.  To progress this, I recently announced a National Dialogue on Climate Action to provide for an inclusive process of engagement and consensus building across society towards enabling the transformation to a low carbon and climate-resilient future.  </p>  <p>  It must also be recognised that the first Plan is a work in progress, reflecting the reality of where we are in our decarbonisation transition having regard to a number of factors including curtailed public and private investment ov er the course of recent years.  The first Plan cannot provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050 but it will begin the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades.  This will be an ongoing process aimed at incremental and permanent decarbonisation. The Plan will become a living document accessible on my Department's website, and will be updated on an on-going basis as analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate further cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.  The Plan will also be subject to annual progress reports.</p></reply>

The scheme provides energy efficiency upgrades free of charge to people who meet the eligibility criteria.  Typical measures available under the scheme include attic and cavity wall insulation, draught proofing, lagging jackets and low energy light bulbs.  To date the scheme has provided energy efficiency upgrades to 120,000 homes.  The average capital cost to upgrade a home was &euro;2,641 in 2016.</p>  <p>  Since the scheme is 100% Exchequer funded it is designed to be available only to those in most need of Government assistance.  To determine this with complete accuracy SEAI would need to know the condition of a person's home, including its energy efficiency level and heating system, that person's family circumstances and their household income level.  However, it would not be practical or efficient for SEAI to perform this assessment for each applicant to the Warmer Homes scheme.  Therefore eligibility for the scheme is determined through the use of proxy indicators, principally the National Fuel Allowance.  These proxy indicators provide an acceptable approximation that allows SEAI to find and identify people in energy poverty without having to resort to a cumbersome, expensive and intrusive administrative regime. </p>  <p>  Eligibility for the National Fuel Allowance is determined by the Department of Social Protection through use of a means tested income assessment.  Everyone in receipt of a non-contributory state payment is accepted as satisfying the means test. In addition, if a person is on an employment support scheme or getting a Back to Education Allowance they are entitled to the Fuel Allowance.  Any household with a combined weekly income of up to &euro;100 above the maximum State Pension (Contributory) is also eligible for the Fuel Allowance. </p>  <p>  In addition to the Fuel Allowance, anyone in receipt of the Family Income Supplement, Job Seekers Allowance for over six months (and with children under 7 years of age) or anyone in receipt of the One Parent Family Payment is also eligible for the Warmer Homes scheme. 378,000 low income households were paid the Fuel Allowance over the 2016-2017 winter season, there are currently 57,000 families with more than 127,000 children receiving family income supplement, circa 40,000 in receipt of the One Parent Family Payment and as of April 2017 there were 195,434 job seekers allowance claimants.  However, it is likely that there is a considerable crossover of claimants to these schemes i.e. many of those in receipt of job seekers allowance may be living in a household that is also eligible for the Fuel Allowance. </p>  <p>  These additional eligibility criteria were selected as there are health and wellbeing consequences to living in a cold and damp home and children can often be particularly vulnerable to these conditions.  In addition, lone parent families suffer from a particularly high deprivation rate in Ireland.  In the Government's Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty, I have committed to ensuring that the eligibility criteria for the Warmer Homes scheme remain consistent with the latest findings on deprivation in Ireland.  This is consistent with the aim of ensuring that the limited resources available to the scheme are targeted at those in most need. </p>  <p>  Regarding a potential expansion of the scheme, statistical information available from the Department of Social Protection suggests that around 1.4 million people are in receipt of a weekly social welfare payment.  According to statistics obtained from the Revenue Commissioners on gross income levels in 2014 (the latest period for which statistics are available), there were 1,019,631 persons with a gross income of less than &euro;25,000 in that year.  That figure rises to 1,206,851 when the income limit rises to &euro;30,000. </p>  <p>  There is no cost to extending the eligibility criteria to the Warmer Homes scheme since the scheme operates within a defined budget each year.  However, expanding the eligibility criteria along the lines the Deputy suggests would mean that a much greater number of people would be eligible to apply to the scheme.  This would likely lengthen waiting times for the scheme in general and would mean that those most in need could end up waiting much longer to receive a home upgrade than they would under the current arrangements.  For this reason I do not propose extending the eligibility criteria so broadly.</p></reply>

It is likely that a higher level of funding will be required over the duration of the proposed 25 year term of the contract.  The level of exchequer funding required for the NBP will only be known after the competitive tender process has concluded and bidders provide their estimates of cost and subsidy requirements.</p>  <p>  In April, I signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  Eir has committed to concluding this work over a 90 week period, an average of nearly 500 premises per day.  My Department is monitoring this rollout to ensure that eir meets its obligations under the Agreement.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website.  </p>  <p>  Quarterly updates will be published on the Departments website.  Milestone 2, the Q1 2017 update, will be published shortly and the eir rollout is in line with the Commitment Agreement.  I am advised that in the period from 1 January to end March 2017, 30,064 premises have been passed.  This brings to 40,114 the total subset of the 300k premises that eir has passed since they commenced work in late 2016. Of those, over 1,400 premises have been connected.   </p></reply>

This Directive aims to provide &ldquo;a common framework to avoid, prevent or reduce, on a prioritised basis, the harmful effects of exposure to environmental noise&rdquo;.  The key sources of noise covered under the END are road, rail, aircraft and industrial noise.</p><p>The Environmental Noise Regulations 2006 transpose the END into Irish law.  The Regulations designate noise-mapping bodies and action planning authorities for the production of strategic noise maps and action plans.  Primary responsibility for both noise mapping and action planning is assigned to local authorities.  A number of other bodies also have noise mapping functions which are carried out on behalf of the local authorities concerned.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland (formerly the NRA &ndash; National Roads Authority and Railway Procurement Authority &ndash; RPA) are a designated noise mapping body under the 2006 regulations.</p><p>The Regulations also designate the Environmental Protection Agency as the National Authority for the purposes of the Regulations.  The Agency's role includes supervisory, advisory and coordination functions in relation to both noise mapping and action planning, as well as the reporting requirements for the purpose of the Directive.</p><p>The Regulations set out a two-stage process for addressing environmental noise. </p><p>Firstly, noise must be assessed through the preparation of strategic noise maps every 5 years for areas and infrastructure falling within defined criteria, e.g. large urban areas (referred to as agglomerations), major roads, railways and airports.  The first and second rounds of noise maps were prepared and submitted to the European Commission in 2007 and 2012 respectively.  The current third round of Noise maps are due to be updated by June 2017 and officials from my department have been actively involved in this process with the EPA and other national bodies.</p><p>Secondly, based on the results of the mapping process, the Regulations require the preparation of noise action plans for each area concerned.  The fundamental objective of action plans is the prevention and reduction of environmental noise.  Action plans are due to be updated by June 2018 and require public consultation.</p><p>For national road schemes, potential noise emissions are addressed as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process undertaken by, or on behalf of, the Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  TII have published Good Practice Guidance for the Treatment of Noise during the Planning of National Road Schemes which can be accessed at the TII website  <i> </i></p></reply>

I have no statutory function in relation to either the routing of gas pipelines or the connection of towns to the gas pipeline network. </p>  <p>  The CER network connections policy stipulates that in order for any town to be connected to the gas network certain economic criteria must be met, which provide that over a certain period the costs of connecting the town are recouped through consumption of gas and  associated tariffs.  The key factor which would qualify a town, or group of towns, in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually resulting from the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility. </p>  <p>  As regards the connection of Longford to the gas network I have, over recent months, had discussions with GNI relating to proposals to establish a gas pipeline in County Longford.  However, I am informed  that the most recent assessment under CER&rsquo;s economic criteria undertaken by GNI in early  2017 found that connecting Longford to the gas network remains unviable at this time in the absence of a significant new demand for gas.     </p>  <p>  The wider question of whether network extensions should, where economically feasible and in line with our energy policy goals in the White Paper, provide for the possibility of future connections in order to contribute to regional and rural development needs to be addressed, in my view.  At the launch of the Action Plan for Rural Development I set out my view that there are communities partly or sometimes wholly excluded from basic criteria of modern convenience and comfort, in terms of communications, energy efficiency and fuel poverty.  My long-standing position on the gas network is that it should be developed generally in rural Ireland to provide natural gas to as many areas as possible.  Accordingly, I am arranging to have research undertaken into the potential role that natural gas could play in supporting rural centres, with the aim of having a  report by year-end. </p></reply>

Under this scheme a 100% asset write down is permitted in the year of purchase enabling the full value of the tax relief benefit to be received promptly.  SEAI currently administer the eligibility criteria for this scheme which is committed until the end of 2017. </p>  <p>  The Task force will also consider current public procurement policy in the context of Government and public body leadership initiatives and opportunities, as means of further demonstrating support for LEV uptake.  An opportunity will be provided for stakeholders and interested members of the public to contribute their perspectives to the deliberations of the Task Force, details of which will be made available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy has been approved by Government and its implementation is now underway.  The delivery of this strategy is a shared, whole of Government, effort where all  Departments, and the bodies under their aegis, play their part in embedding structured energy management as part of their business delivery.   As part of this strategy, the development of Workplace Travel Plans which promote sustainable forms of transport are strongly encouraged.  My Department has already installed an on-site electric vehicle charger.  Any further installation of chargers would, of course, be subject to demand within individual Departments.</p></reply>

This model is one of publicly-owned port authorities with high levels of private sector involvement in the provision of infrastructure and services.  Irish ports operate on a commercial basis and are expected to fund their activities and capital infrastructure investment.</p>  <p>  National Ports Policy 2013 indicates clearly that it is the current policy of the Irish Government that no Exchequer funding is provided to any port.  This has been the position since 2005 policy.  Therefore, GBER does not currently apply.  Government Policy on the matter remains unaltered at this time and there are no plans to change this position.</p>  <p>  In relation to airports, the National Airports Policy 2015 sets out clearly the policy for Exchequer support under the Regional Airports Programme for the four regional airports at Donegal, Ireland West Airport Knock (IWAK), Kerry and Waterford.  This support is provided to the regional airports for safety and security related projects and activities over a multiannual period.</p>  <p>  Given current policy, the recent amendment to GBER will have limited impact for our regional airports, since Ireland has already received State-aid clearance from the EU Commission in 2015 for our current, five-year, Regional Airports Programme 2015-2019.</p>  <p>  There is one new concession in the revised GBER regime that would be relevant to Donegal and Waterford, and that is that they would be eligible for aid towards operating losses, if incurred.  In practice, Waterford is already eligible for this kind of operational support under our current Regional Airports Programme.  This provision does not apply to airports that handle more than 200,000 passengers annually such as IWAK.</p>  <p>  In addition to the funding approved under the Regional Airports Programme 2015-2019, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to provide an additional &euro;10 million over the lifetime of the Capital Plan to support the four regional airports.  This additional commitment, together with other Programme for Government commitments of a capital nature, is part of the mid-term review of the Capital Plan which is currently underway and my Department has made a submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this regard.</p></reply>

This will mean that works can be carried out by a landowner or occupier of land as well as a road authority under section 70 at any time during the year to ensure that a tree, hedge and other vegetation is not, or could not become, a danger to people using a public road and that it does not obstruct or interfere with the safe use of a public road or the maintenance of a public road.</p></reply>

In order to fully inform any debate on the future of the rail network, we must allow this important background work to be completed and for the outputs to be assessed.</p></reply>

The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) is responsible for the safety oversight of registered pilot training colleges, including the standard of the training being delivered and the conduct of examinations and flight tests.  The IAA does not have a role regarding the financial viability of a company or the contractual arrangements between pilot training centres and their clients.  There are no current plans to amend the IAA's remit in this regard.</p>  <p>  In relation to bonds, in light of difficulties experienced in Ireland - as in some other EU Member States - I am advised that my Department and the IAA gave consideration to the possibility of a bonding scheme for flight training schools.  It was found that introducing such a requirement would, on balance,  be more likely to undermine the overall provision of flight training services in Ireland by increasing costs in the sector and, as such requirements are not imposed in other jurisdictions, if introduced in Ireland it would likely dissuade schools from remaining or setting up in Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that work is ongoing through the National Civil Aviation Development Forum, which brings State agencies, industry players and relevant departments together, to identify, devise and implement measures to make the pilot training sector more competitive, including ways to potentially reduce the cost base for providing and undergoing flight training in Ireland.</p></reply>

In mid-2016, it became clear that the projects in Galway and Kerry would not be in a position to fully draw down the grants awarded due to the challenges experienced by the local authorities in delivering these projects so a decision was taken to reallocate this funding to other 'shovel ready' projects that would be in a position to draw down the funding in 2016.

A JLC is comprised of equal numbers of representatives of employers and workers in a sector.  JLCs meet regularly, under an independent Chairperson to discuss proposals for terms and conditions to apply to specified grades or categories of workers in the sector.  If agreement is reached the JLC publishes details and invites submissions from interested parties.</p>  <p>  If, after consideration of any submissions received, the Committee adopts the proposals it will submit them to the Labour Court for consideration.  The Labour Court will then make a decision on the adoption of the proposals.  If the Court decides to adopt the proposals, a copy is presented to me and if I consider it appropriate to do so I will make an Order giving effect to the proposals. Such Orders are known as Employment Regulation Orders. </p>  <p>  The Joint Labour Committee for the Security Industry was established in accordance with Statutory Instrument No. 377 of 1998 (as amended by Statutory Instrument No. 30 of 2014).  The Deputy may be aware that the JLC structure has in recent years undergone an extensive overhaul as the result of a successful Constitutional challenge in 2011 and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 addresses the shortcomings identified in the ruling on that challenge.</p>  <p>  In relation to the membership of the JLC I am informed that, in accordance with the Statute, the Labour Court consulted with ICTU, Ibec and the two employer organisations most closely connected with the Security Industry, the National Union of Security Employers (merged with the Security Institute of Ireland in 2011) and the Irish Security Industry Association.  Following consultation, these bodies nominated representatives of both employers and employees for membership of the Committee.  The current members were appointed on 12 May 2014.</p>  <p>  The Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson are Industrial Relations Officers from the Workplace Relations Commission and are appointed by me. </p>  <p>  The constitution and proceedings of JLCs is set out in the Fifth Schedule to the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  The discussions within the Joint Labour Committees are not open to me nor to my Department. </p>  <p>  I am informed that the draft proposals for an employment regulation order to replace the one that currently exists for the Security Industry and that you refer to were advertised as part of the public consultation process.  The closing date for submissions on those proposals was 7 February last. I am also informed that the proposals have been adopted by the Labour Court and I expect to be in a position to consider the proposals shortly.</p></reply>

The Forf&aacute;s Pay allocation was absorbed into the Department&rsquo;s Pay allocation from 2015 onwards. </p><p>In October 2014 the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission was formed through the amalgamation of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency (NCA).  The 2014 Pay allocation highlighted in the table above is the combined Competition Authority and NCA pay allocation for that year.</p><p>The Low Pay Commission was established with a Pay allocation from 2015. </p><p>In October 2015 the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) was established through the amalgamation of the Labour Relations Commission, Equality Tribunal and the National Employment Rights Authority.  These entities, along with the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal, were funded through a single subhead on the Department&rsquo;s Vote, Subhead C3,  under the heading &ldquo;Workplace Relations Programme&rdquo;.  From 2016 the pay allocation in Subhead C3 covers the staff of the Workplace Relations Commission, the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p><p>The 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) were established in April 2014 and these replaced the former City and County Enterprise Boards.  A key element of this reform was to enhance the connectivity and synergies between micro-enterprise and the local authority sector to deliver more jobs regionally. </p><p>From 2017, in recognition that the LEOs, and the associated staffing cohort is now the responsibility of the Environment and Local Government Vote, the previous LEO&rsquo;s Pay amount of &euro;7.2 million has been reclassified as Non-Pay expenditure in my Department&rsquo;s Vote this year.  Therefore there is no longer a Pay line in Subhead A8 &ndash; Local Enterprise Development (LEOs) and the Non-Pay allocation in the subhead has been increased by the commensurate amount.  This technical adjustment partly explains the reduced overall JEI Pay ceiling this year. </p><p>The other significant Pay adjustments in 2017 relate to the additional &euro;3 million in Pay secured for Brexit specific posts across the Department and Agencies.  In addition an amount of &euro;2.67 million is included in the Department&rsquo;s Pay ceiling this year relating to the technical adjustments specific to the Lansdowne Road Agreement.</p><p>Ordinarily there are 26 fortnightly and 52 weekly Pay runs which impact on the annual pay requirements across the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  In 2015, there was an extra fortnightly pay period, i.e. a 27th fortnightly payrun.  In 2016 there was a return to the normal 26 fortnightly pay periods though there was also an extra weekly pay period, i.e. a 53rd weekly payrun.  For 2017 there is a return to the norm of 26 fortnightly and 52 weekly pay periods. </p><p>Some Agencies, such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, National Standards Authority of Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority have access to Agency Own Resource Income which can be utilised to support of their overall operations, which may include Pay purposes.  The retention and usage of Own Resource Income requires annual sanction from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>The Personal Injuries Assessment Board is another agency of the Department.  It does not receive any Exchequer Pay allocation as its operations are self-funded from fees received from its operations.</p></reply>

Central to this approach, is understanding those impacts, positive and negative, across all policy areas of my Department and at a sectoral level. </p>  <p>  In this context, my Department has conducted a risk assessment of the potential impacts of Brexit across policy areas which has fed into the national level assessment led by the Department of Taoiseach. My Department has been working with enterprise development agencies to mitigate risks and maximise opportunities. </p>  <p>  In order for me, as Minister with responsibility for supporting business across all sectors, to develop any initiative to support businesses that are impacted by Brexit, I have taken every opportunity to hear the views of sectors and companies.  I have met with a wide range of representative organisations. In addition, my Department held a large stakeholder engagement event in Carrick-on-Shannon in January to hear the views of all stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In terms of our future trading relationships, our absolute preference is to maintain the closest possible trading relationship based on a level playing field between the UK and the EU, including Ireland.  The EU Guidelines state that the EU welcomes and shares the UK&rsquo;s desire for a close partnership in the future.</p>  <p>  In regard to standards, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) provides Ireland with the components necessary for an effective trading infrastructure for products and services to be developed, traded, and relied on nationally and around the world.  This infrastructure of Certification, Standards and Agreement (building products and processes), also contributes positively to decisions on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), where, again, organisations rely on, a developed standards and conformity assessment infrastructure, to achieve their objectives, such as the medical devices sector. </p>  <p>  The NSAI has informed me that Britain may well continue to play an active part in the European standardisation system post-Brexit. Membership of the European Standards Bodies - CEN, CENELEC and ETSI &ndash; is not confined to EU member states.  In the case of CEN and CENELEC, which operate a National Standards Body (NSB) membership model, 34 countries are directly represented, including Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, Turkey, Serbia, FYROM (the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).  So Britain may, in practice, still conform to European Norms, the European standards developed in Brussels.</p>  <p>  NSAI understand that BSI, the British Standards Institution, has striven to reassure its stakeholders that BSI intends to maintain membership of European Standards Institutions.  For most sectors of British industry and society that would seem to be the most advantageous policy since it effectively minimises cost-increasing variances from the European Norms.  In addition - European Norms are generally close to global ISO and IEC standards, which would still be followed in the UK market.</p>  <p>  That said, Britain has always maintained a library of indigenous British Standards which supplement the European Norms.  It is eminently possible that Britain might place more weight on indigenous British standards in certain sectors.  However, that might not be a huge problem for Irish industry in those sectors.  Irish industry would tend to have a good knowledge of British standards in their particular sector because of historical political links and traditionally strong trading links with the British market.</p>  <p>  It is difficult to say definitively what sectors would be most vulnerable to pressures for divergent standards.  However, many observers would say that the British sector most likely to diverge from the European model is the Construction sector, which has traditionally been considered to be slowest to embrace common solutions across Europe.  The Irish Construction sector has close ties with the British Construction sector &ndash; so this may not be such a threat to Irish construction sector companies &ndash; indeed it could perhaps be an opportunity.</p>  <p>  One issue for Irish stakeholders, in the event of divergent British Standards, would be continuing involvement in the standardisation process which would revise and update these distinct British Standards.  The NSAI has an active Joint Cooperation Agreement with BSI, the British Standards Institution.  This Joint Cooperation Agreement is under review at the moment.  There could be a need to strengthen this bi-lateral agreement if standards divergence were to become an issue.</p>  <p>  My Department, working in close cooperation with the NSAI, is monitoring the situation and will continue to monitor developments as Britain goes through the Brexit negotiation process.</p></reply>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-30a.1649" nospeaker="true" ><p>Enterprise Ireland (EI) launched its &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; in March 2017.  The Scorecard is a new interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit.  By completing the online questionnaire, the Brexit SME Scorecard will provide companies with an assessment of their preparedness under six key pillars - Business Strategy, Operations, Innovation, Sales and Marketing, Finance and People Management.  The Scorecard then generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions, resources and information on events to attend, to prepare for Brexit.  The tool is a starting point for companies to develop an action plan to help mitigate risks and leverage opportunities which may arise from Brexit.</p><p>While the SME Scorecard is available to all companies, EI client companies that utilise the Brexit Scorecard will then be able to engage with the agency&rsquo;s experts both domestically and through the overseas offices in global markets.</p><p>To date over 600 companies have completed the Enterprise Ireland Brexit Scorecard to help assess their level of preparedness for Brexit.</p><p>EI&rsquo;s #PrepareforBrexit communications campaign also included a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; that supports the costs of SME clients in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities.  This Grant can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and out of pocket expenses associated with researching the direction of their Brexit action plan.  This might involve developing new strategies to maintain and grow existing UK exports, investigating the feasibility of diversifying to new markets and market segments; investment in innovation; improvement in operational competitiveness; enhancement of strategic financial capability.</p><p>There have been a number of applications for the &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; and as the approvals come on stream over the next couple of months, EI will report them.  EI do not publish grant application information, only grant approvals information.  This is standard practice for all grant approvals' processes.</p><p>EI is currently running a Brexit regional roadshow to encourage companies to examine their potential exposure to Brexit, complete the Scorecard and use the &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to plan their strategic response to Brexit.</p></speech>

The Council&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge 2016 report published in December 2016 contained a specific chapter in relation to Brexit.

Convincing these companies to invest in Ireland, however, can be a delicate process that requires perseverance and patience.  This is especially the case with regard to Brexit-related investment.  It is therefore not in the country&rsquo;s interests to describe, in detail, the engagement to date between the IDA and new investors or any inquiries that the Central Bank may have received.  In fact, to do so would risk both compromising the progress that has been made with prospective new clients of the IDA and losing the potential jobs that might accompany any such new future investment here.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to quantify the precise number of FDI-related jobs that may have been created here on account of Brexit.  That is partly because companies that have expanded or invested in Ireland over the last 12 months have done so for many different reasons, not simply because of the UK&rsquo;s decision to withdraw from the European Union. </p>  <p>  I am confident that Ireland will remain attractive to new investment in the time ahead, whether Brexit-related or otherwise, and that we will continue to see significant FDI-related job creation.  That is because the attributes that have made this country one of the leading global locations for FDI &ndash; including our talented workforce, first-rate education system and pro-enterprise policy environment &ndash; continue to be highly valued by multinational companies.</p></reply>

There are positive competitiveness opportunities, as well as threats.  For example, improving access to quality rail freight services and further extensions of the natural gas grid will assist smaller, indigenous companies currently using oil as their primary fuel source to reduce their carbon footprint.  Furthermore, measures focused on other EU targets with which Ireland must comply, such as renewable energy, will have positive spin-offs for industry: renewable heat options (e.g. biomass boilers, combined heat and power) are seen as key ways for both the commercial and industrial sector to decarbonise further.</p>  <p>  In addition to contributing to the National Mitigation Plan, my Department is actively engaged on proposed revisions to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which covers over a quarter of Ireland's total greenhouse gas footprint.  My officials are working closely with the Permanent Representation in Brussels to ensure that the various amendments proposed by the European Commission, European Council and European Parliament, to commence in Phase IV of the Scheme from 2020, do not harm Ireland's competitiveness, whilst ensuring the Scheme is strengthened going forward. </p>  <p>  Following a public consultation in March and April, I understand that work on the development of the first National Mitigation Plan is now nearing completion, and it is intended to submit it to Government for approval in the next two weeks.  The draft Plan has been prepared in close collaboration across all relevant Government Departments and, in particular, with the key Ministers responsible for the four sectors covered by the Plan: Electricity Generation; the Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use.  This work has been overseen by an inter-Departmental National Mitigation Plan Steering Group, on which DJEI participates, as well as by both a Senior Officials Group, and the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure, Climate Action and the Environment.  Technical support has been provided by all sectors via the Technical Research, Analysis and Modelling (TRAM) Group on which my Department is also actively engaged. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department recently met with the Secretariat to the National Climate Change Advisory Council, following publication of the draft National Mitigation Plan.  This was a fruitful discussion during which my Departmental officials set out a 'direction of travel' on climate change policy from an enterprise perspective, including a vision of the green enterprise opportunities that arise from the hugely challenging task of decarbonising our economy by as much as 80% of 2005 greenhouse gas levels by 2050.  I understand that all input received from the Advisory Council has been considered in finalising the National Mitigation Plan.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to contribute to the National Mitigation Plan by ensuring that any actions that have a bearing on the enterprise sector are implemented with a view to maximising the enterprise and competitiveness opportunities.  In addition, DJEI will continue to play a strong role in advising the Department of Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment on the ongoing revisions to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.</p></reply>

This included the publication of the DCYA Early Years Qualifications list, which itemises qualifications that meet the required standards.  Anyone with a qualification on this list is automatically approved for work in the sector. </p>  <p>  This list is very comprehensive and encompasses Irish and international qualifications.  My Department also provides individual statements, on application, in instances where a person holds a qualification that is appropriate for work in the Early Years sector, but for various reasons, cannot be added to the published list. </p>  <p>  The Further Education and Training Award Council (FETAC) was wound up in November 2012, and its functions transferred to Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI).  Relevant FETAC awards are accepted by my Department for work in the sector and these are itemised on the published list.  My Department does not use FETAC awards as a standard.  My Department does not, and has never, distinguished between FETAC awards and other types of award for purposes of payment or any other purpose. </p>  <p>  In assessing a qualification, my Department takes both the content of the programme of learning and the award level of the final award achieved into account.  By award level, we refer to the level at which the award is placed on the National Framework of Qualification (NFQ).  The NFQ is both a national and international standard, as it is linked to the European Qualifications Framework, an overarching framework that links the qualifications frameworks of different European countries together.  Management of the NFQ is a function of QQI and DCYA will adhere at all times to advice provided by QQI in relation to award levels.  All awards are subject to the same standards of assessment.</p>  <p>  Within the ECCE scheme, there are two rates of capitation paid.  The standard capitation rate is paid to the majority of services, where the room leader of the ECCE group holds a relevant qualification at Level 6 on the NFQ or equivalent.  The Higher Capitation rate is paid to services that meet the criteria for that rate, one of which is that the room leader of the ECCE group holds a relevant qualification at Level 7 on the NFQ or equivalent.  It should be noted that the wording given here mirrors that of the minimum standard as set out in the regulations, and also that used in the ECCE contract with Early Years&rsquo; service providers.  Where we use the word &lsquo;equivalent&rsquo;, this is to allow for international qualifications and for qualifications which were never linked to an appropriate level on the NFQ. </p>  <p>  The award of the person in question is on the DCYA published list of approved Early Years qualifications.  My Department has been advised that the award pre-dated award standards such as the NFQ, but that the designation of this award as being appropriate to a room leader at the standard rate of capitation is appropriate.  This decision was taken subject to advice from the Department of Education Early Years Policy unit, QQI and St Nicholas Montessori College, Ireland.</p></reply>

I understand that there has been a large volume of applications and these are currently being evaluated by Pobal, with a view to making recommendations as to which of these are suitable for funding.  Once these recommendations have been received I will be in a position to consider whether the level of funding provided is sufficient.</p><p>Strand two of the funding scheme relates to community childcare services constructed under previous capital programmes, and this strand aims to provide funding for maintenance/repair, to protect the state's investment in these facilities - a consideration that does not apply to private services.  I would however point out that private facilities were eligible to apply for the vast majority of funding available - &euro;3m out of the total &euro;4m.  The timing of the announcement of this capital programme and the deadlines for application were in line with recent capital programmes operated by the Department, and the volume of applications received indicates that most services did not have significant difficulties in applying.  I do acknowledge that it will be difficult to have significant building works completed by 30 November 2017 deadline - it is a requirement of capital expenditure that funds be spent in the year in which they are allocated; and I will be consulting with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to establish what flexibility can be offered to childcare services in this regard.</p><p>I will consider further capital expenditure to support both community and private childcare facilities in the context of Budget 2018.  It is important to bear in mind that capital expenditure is only one strand of support available to childcare providers - the deputy will be aware that I have recently I announced a substantial increase to subsidies provided under existing childcare schemes, specifically the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Schemes from September 2017, in some cases by as much as 50%.  This will provide significant additional funding to families but also to services.  I have also taken steps to provide payment to childcare services for &lsquo;non-contact time&rsquo; for the first time, and this will be available in summer 2017.  A total of &euro;14.5 million is available across community and private services to recognise the increasing volume of work done outside of direct contact hours with children.  These are in addition to the restoration of ECCE rates to pre-crisis levels last year.</p></reply>

The reality is that many of the buildings and sites which accommodated Mother and Baby Homes and County Homes have evolved significantly in the intervening years.  These locations are now being used for a wide array of different activities and purposes, ranging from housing estates to private health care facilities and hotels.  In some cases little remains of the former institutions and the locations are not in public ownership. </p>  <p>  In relation to cemeteries at these sites, available information does not indicate that we should expect burials on the sites of all the former institutions.  The remains of children who died in a number of the Mother and Baby Homes were buried in what are generally known as Angel Plots in local cemeteries.  For example, I understand that the children who died while resident in St. Patrick's Mother and Baby Home on the Navan Road were frequently interred in the Angel's plot in Glasnevin cemetery.  The Commission has been directly tasked with examining the burial arrangements in respect of these institutions and it will consider available records and witness testimony.

This grant scheme then passed to the Family Support Agency (FSA) when it was established in 2003 and subsequently to Tusla on establishment in January 2014. </p>  <p>  Up until 2011 applications were invited through an annual public advertisement, however in 2011 due to austerity, this scheme was closed and no new applications have been accepted.  Since 2011 the grantees who received funding in 2011 have continued to receive an annual grant equivalent to their 2011 grant.  This Counselling Grants Scheme is for a total of &euro;245,900 annually and currently there are only 64 grantees nationwide benefitting from this scheme.  With over 4,000 schools in Ireland 64 grantees means that less than 2% of schools are in receipt of support from this scheme currently.</p>  <p>  The Counselling Grants Scheme which was originally established to provide counselling support for children affected by bereavement or loss was affected by austerity cuts in 2010.  The need for bereavement and loss counselling still exists in schools right around the country however without a significantly increased budget it is unfair and unethical to continue providing support to a small number of areas (64 grantees) while excluding all other schools from the scheme.  Opening up the scheme nationally with a current budget allocation of &euro;245,000 is not an option as this equates to less than &euro;60 per school.  Hence the decision was made to cease the scheme in its current format.</p>  <p>  Tusla Educational Welfare Services is very supportive of the provision of appropriate school counselling supports and the option of continuing the scheme with adequate funding to provide the opportunity to all schools and School Completion Programmes nationally.  All School Completion Programmes have been requested to identify unmet needs as part of their annual plan for 2017/18. Responses identifying gaps in service, including counselling provision for bereavement and loss, are currently being reviewed by Tusla Educational Welfare Service and a report will be forwarded to my Department when this process is complete.</p></reply>

This honours a key commitment in the Programme for Government.  I can confirm that these measures, which will benefit the families of tens of thousands of children, will commence this September. </p>  <p>  A new universal subsidy will be available for all children aged between 6 months and 3 years of age (or until they are eligible for ECCE e.g 3 years 3 months) in registered childcare.  This will amount to as much as &euro;80 a month or &euro;1,000 per year for children in full time childcare. </p>  <p>  In addition, subsidies provided under existing childcare schemes, specifically the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Schemes have been increased significantly, in some cases by as much as 50%.  To illustrate the effect of this increase, the highest subsidy provided under the CCS scheme for full time childcare in 2016 was &euro;95 per week.  This will increase to &euro;145 per week from September.  This should decrease the co-payment required by families who qualify and therefore make childcare more accessible and affordable to these families; assisting them in their return to training and employment and lifting them out of poverty. </p>  <p>  These subsidies, both universal and targeted, will be available through childcare services who contract with my Department to deliver the schemes.  The schemes are open to 4,500 community (not-for-profit) and private providers across the country.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that parents and childcare providers are aware of the changes to the schemes this September, a comprehensive information campaign is underway.  Information packs have been sent to over 4,000 registered childcare providers and an information road show for providers will commence in the coming weeks in eight locations throughout the country.</p>  <p>  A dedicated website has been launched (affordablechildcare.ie) and information for parents went live on this website on Monday 29th May to inform them of the various enhanced childcare supports they may qualify for this September.  A campaign via various media, including digital and radio, will also raise awareness among parents. </p>  <p>  I remain strongly committed to introducing the Affordable Childcare Scheme at the earliest possible opportunity.  My Department has made good progress in this regard.  The Government has approved the Heads of Bill for the Scheme, and officials are working intensively to plan for successful introduction of the Scheme.

The draft Plan has been prepared having regard to the provisions set out in the 2015 Act and through close collaboration across all relevant Government Departments and, in particular, with the key Ministers responsible for the four sectors covered by the Plan: Electricity Generation; the Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use.  This work has been overseen by an inter-Departmental National Mitigation Plan Steering Group, as well as by both the Senior Officials Group, and the Cabinet Committee, on Infrastructure, Climate Action and the Environment.  Technical support has been provided to all the sectors by the Technical Research and Modelling Group which operates under the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Climate Change Advisory Council was invited, following publication of the draft National Mitigation Plan, to engage directly with the Department of Communication, Climate Action and the Environment and with other relevant Government Ministers with a view to providing recommendations to feed into the preparation of the final Plan.  All input received from the Advisory Council has been considered in finalising the National Mitigation Plan.   </p>  <p>  It must also be recognised that the first Plan is a work in progress reflecting the reality of where we are in our decarbonisation transition having regard to a number of factors including curtailed public and private investment over the course of recent years.  The first Plan cannot, therefore, provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050 but it will begin the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades.  This will be an ongoing process aimed at incremental and permanent decarbonisation.  The Plan will become a living document: it will be made accessible on the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment&rsquo;s website; will be subject to annual progress reports; and will be updated on an on-going basis as analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate further cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.</p>  <p>  The Defence Organisation takes a very proactive approach to energy efficiency by monitoring energy consumption on an on-going basis and carrying out a number of energy saving projects each year.</p>  <p>  In compliance with ISO 50001 certification the Defence Forces have a particular emphasis on design and acquisition in relation to the built environment.  The Defence Forces, as a large energy user, are the subject of annual internal energy management reviews and external audits as part of their ISO 5001 compliance.  In addition the Defence Forces have undertaken a number of initiatives to maximise the energy performance of its transport fleet, including:   </p>  <p>  - Driver initiatives promoting slower speeds and less idling of engines.   </p>  <p>  - Purchasing a fleet of cars which replaced 4x4 vehicles.  These new vehicles have higher fuel efficiency and less CO2 emissions.</p>  <p>  In aviation, start-up procedures for helicopters are being reviewed in consultation with Aircraft manufacturers in order to reduce fuel consumption and the concept of leaner burning flights is being promoted in consultation with pilots.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that building on the work of the Defence Organisation to date, the Defence sector plays its part in the National Mitigation Plan once adopted.</p></reply>

In line with the consolidation of under-strength units into a smaller number of full strength units, the number of field engineer companies was reduced from three to two.  This facilitated an increase in the establishment strength of a field engineer company from 88 to 103 personnel, whilst an Engineer Support Platoon, based at the Defence Forces Training Centre, comprises a further 22 personnel.  </p>  <p>  As stated in my answer to the previous question referred to, I am satisfied that the re-organisation has led to an improvement in the deployability and sustainability of the Defence Forces, both at home and overseas, and has allowed it to continue to fulfil all roles assigned in the White Paper on Defence. </p>  <p>  Clearly, the Defence Forces provided very significant assistance to the emergency services fighting gorse fires in Counties Sligo and Galway recently.  In this regard, it should be noted that gorse fire fighting is carried out by personnel from infantry units, and not by personnel from field engineer companies.  When personnel are deployed, as in Co. Galway recently, a qualified Engineer Fire Officer is however deployed with them as an adviser.</p></reply>

Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence (2015) is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.</p>  <p>  The security environment is kept under constant review including the threat from international terrorism.  On-going coordination and liaison meetings take place between the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, based on on-going threat assessments, the Garda&iacute; and the Defence Forces liaise with regard to possible Defence Forces supports required for a range of contingencies.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can request a broad range of supports from the Defence Forces including Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams and the Army Ranger Wing.  In this context, I can confirm that there is very active cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.   </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na take the lead responsibility for exercises where the Defence Forces act in a support role to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Following such exercises a review is carried out and the lessons learned feed into future planning in order to enhance support and interoperability.  The Defence Forces will continue to engage fully with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard and will also continue to undergo training so as to ensure effective interoperability.</p>  <p>  Given that these exercises are led by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on their specific details.  For security and operational reasons, the specific number of Defence Forces personnel engaged in these exercises will also not be released.</p></reply>
