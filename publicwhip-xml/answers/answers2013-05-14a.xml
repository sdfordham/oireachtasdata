    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-14a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013051400057#WRB00500"><p>In 2012 the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) initiated a national project to compile, for the first time, an Outpatient Waiting List database based on patient-level information from individual hospitals. Collaborating with individual hospitals, the SDU together with the NTPF and the HSE have developed the OP waiting list minimum dataset that allows for this data to be submitted to the NTPF from hospitals on a weekly basis. This builds on the work previously undertaken by the HSE Outpatient Data Quality Programme.</p><p>  Clear data on the OPD waiting list is now being reported for the first time, and is published on www.ntpf.ie. The waiting list for outpatients is updated monthly. The data show numbers waiting over the various time-bands for a first appointment at a consultant-led clinic. In a further enhancement of the reporting, future updates will for the first time include numbers reported by specialty in addition to the breakdown by hospital. The total number of people waiting on the out-patient waiting list as at 3 May 2013 is 376,751.  This is a reduction of 7,881 in comparison with the NTPF published figures to March 2013. The data also shows that of the total number of people waiting,  199,513 (52.6%) are waiting less than 6 months and almost 278,666 (74%) are waiting less than 12 months.  </p><p>  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has been set of 12 months for a first time consultant-led outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE Service Plan. The SDU/NTPF will work closely with hospitals towards achievement of the maximum waiting time. </p><p>  Currently, the focus is on hospitals continuing the validation of waiting lists. All hospitals have been engaged in this process which is anticipated to be complete by mid-May 2013. </p><p>  Reforming the delivery of outpatient services is being addressed through the Outpatient (OP) Service Performance Improvement Programme. This Programme encompasses the HSE, SDU, the NTPF and all hospitals providing outpatient services. It is a national programme being implemented between 2012 and 2015. The overall aim of the programme is to ensure timely, appropriate access to OP services so that the most appropriate member of the clinical team sees the right patient at the right time. Key elements of this large programme of reform will include on-going validation of waiting lists, the systematic and standardised management of referrals from primary care, a reduction in unacceptably high &ldquo;do not attend&rdquo; rates and appropriate discharging from OP services when clinically appropriate to do so.</p></reply>

Together, they provide a range of services for the catchment of Dublin South-East and Wicklow, across three sites in a collaborative arrangement.  The establishment of hospital groups will ensure that these hospitals have a central role in the future delivery of good quality care for patients.</p><p><i>  Securing the Future of Smaller Hospitals: A Framework for Development</i>   offers clear information about the role of our smaller hospitals and what they will do in the future.  While the Framework focusses in particular on the role of nine smaller hospitals, including St. Columcille's, which have been the subject of particular attention from the Health Information and Quality Authority, the principles behind it will apply to all smaller hospitals.  In developing the Framework, the Government is clear that (i) there is an important future role for smaller hospitals, in which they will provide services for more patients, not fewer; (ii) no acute hospital will close, and (iii) safety issues in all acute hospitals, large or small, must be fully addressed, by providing the right type of service, for the right patient in the right setting.  This framework will demonstrate clearly that the future of smaller hospitals is secure.  It outlines the need for smaller hospitals and larger hospitals to operate together and therefore is intrinsically linked to the on-going work regarding the development of hospital groups. </p><p>  We know that the traditional practice of providing as many services as possible in every hospital is neither sustainable nor safe.  Professor John Higgins chaired a strategic board on the establishment of hospital groups and I have received his report, which is based on a comprehensive consultation process and contains almost 60 recommendations on the formation, management and governance of hospital groups, all of which are strongly endorsed by the Strategic Board.  The formation of Irish acute hospitals into a small number of groups, each with its own governance and management, will provide opportunity for hospital services to be configured to deliver high-quality, safe patient care in a cost-effective manner.  </p><p>  I appreciate that both of the reports and the related government decision are anxiously awaited. However, this is the most radical and most fundamental modernisation of our acute health system infrastructure since the State's foundation and I took very seriously my obligation to consider the reports closely, to assure myself and my Cabinet colleagues that they provide a robust basis to enable timely access to a high quality and sustainable hospital service for those who need it. </p><p>  The Deputy will be pleased to learn that I submitted the reports to Government this morning for its consideration and decision and the reports have been accepted. Officials in my department are now in the process of making suitable arrangements for the publication of these reports as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The report is available on the NCPE's website (www.ncpe.ie).</p><p>  The NCPE report is an important input to assist decision making and informs further discussions between the HSE and the manufacturer of the drug. The HSE is currently in negotiations with the manufacturers of pirfenidone and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further while these negotiations are ongoing.</p><p>  The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of pirfenidone that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. The HSE understands that patients and clinicians are very anxious that a decision be made as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This recommends the provision of 80 child and adolescent psychiatric in-patient beds nationally.  There are currently 39 such child and adolescent beds nationally, which is planned to  increase to 66 beds by the end of this year.  The provision of additional bed capacity  reflects an almost 50% decrease in admissions of children to adult units since 2008.  In the context of on-going developments, planning permission has been granted to construct a 24 bed In-Patient facility at Cherry Orchard, Dublin, which will incorporate some existing beds and increase capacity overall to 76 beds.  This project is scheduled to be completed by the end of this year, or early next year, with an expected opening date of 2015.</p><p>  The basic approach to delivery of mental health services to children and adolescents revolves around Community Mental Health Teams. In this regard, 150 additional posts were allocated to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams in 2012, and a further 80 posts have been identified for allocation to this specific service area in 2013, arising from targeted Government investment of &euro;35 million for each of these respective years.</p><p> As of 29<sup></sup> April last, 122 of the designated 150 posts for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services were either been filled, under offer, or awaiting appropriate clearance.  The National Recruitment Service (NRS) of the HSE creates national panels in anticipation of vacancies.  On occasion, however, it is difficult to fill some posts  due to various reasons, such as geographical location or shortage of suitable candidates at certain times for some grades such as Clinical Psychologists.  However, given the policy and service requirements identified, the NRS  is currently working to ensure that remaining posts will be filled as soon as possible, subject to qualified candidates being available.</p><p>  I wish to re-iterate this Government's strong commitment to enhance this year in practical terms Mental Health services for children and adolescents and I will continue to closely monitor the position over the remainder of 2013.</p></reply>

Its aim is to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  As set out in Future Health, a key goal is to deliver faster more equitable access to hospital services.</p><p>With regard to waiting times for procedures, the target maximum wait times for inpatient and daycase treatment,as set out in the HSE Service Plan 2013, are:</p><p><table><tr><th>Children awaiting an inpatient or daycase procedure</th><th>20 weeks</th></tr><tr><td>Routine endoscopy procedure (all)</td><td>13 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Adults awaiting an inpatient or daycase procedure </td><td>8 months</td></tr></table></p><p>In July 2011, when the Special Delivery Unit was set up a total of 6,277 patients were waiting more than nine months for inpatient or daycase treatment. By December last year, there were 86 adults waiting over nine months for inpatient or daycase treatment, a 98% decrease on the previous year and 89 children waiting longer than 20 weeks, a decrease of 95% on the previous year. 36 patients were waiting over 13 weeks for routine endoscopy, a 99% decrease on the previous year.</p><p>Maintaining the progress made to date and achieving the 2013 targets will be extremely challenging.  The achievement to the end of 2012 has been followed, as expected, by bounceback in the figures at the start of 2013. The early months of the year have brought severe pressures on Emergency Departments which impact on waiting times - the extended winter seasonal pressures, older age profile, sicker patients etc. are all  having a knock-on effect on scheduled care. However, latest available data shows that as of 2 May 2013, 88% of adults on the list were waiting less than eight months (5,392 waiting longer), 80% of children waiting were waiting less than 20 weeks (716 waiting longer), and 90% of those awaiting a GI endoscopy were waiting less than 13 weeks (917 waiting longer).</p><p>With regard to patients waiting to see a consultant, in 2012 the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) initiated a national project to compile, for the first time, an Outpatient Waiting List database based on patient-level information from individual hospitals. Collaborating with individual hospitals, the SDU together with the NTPF and the HSE have developed the OP waiting list minimum dataset that allows for this data to be submitted to the NTPF from hospitals on a weekly basis. Clear data on the OPD waiting list is now being reported for the first time, and is published on www.ntpf.ie  . The waiting list for outpatients is updated monthly.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has been set of 12 months for a first time consultant-led outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE Service Plan. The total number of people waiting on the out-patient waiting list as at 3 May 2013 is 376,751.  This is a reduction of 7,881 in comparison with the NTPF published figures to March 2013. The data also shows that of the total number of people waiting,  199,513 (52.6%) are waiting less than 6 months and 278,666 (almost 74%) are waiting less than 12 months.</p><p>All hospitals have been engaged in the process of validating outpatient waiting lists, which is anticipated to be complete by mid-May 2013. Reforming the delivery of outpatient services is being addressed through the Outpatient (OP) Service Performance Improvement Programme. This is a national programme, encompassing the HSE, SDU, the NTPF and all hospitals providing outpatient services, being implemented between 2012 and 2015. The overall aim of the programme is to ensure timely, appropriate access to OP services so that the most appropriate member of the clinical team sees the right patient at the right time. Key elements of this large programme of reform will include on-going validation of waiting lists, the systematic and standardised management of referrals from primary care, a reduction in unacceptably high &ldquo;do not attend&rdquo; rates and appropriate discharging from OP services when clinically appropriate to do so.</p><p>Neither my Department nor the HSE has a function in relation to the gathering of waiting list data for the private hospital sector.  Therefore, a comparison between public and private waiting lists is not available.  However, I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to focus its resources on reducing waiting lists in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to deliver rapid and equitable access to health services.</p></reply>

This is embodied in the <i>National Disability Strategy,</i>which is the Government's overarching policy on the most effective combination of legislation, policies, institutional arrangements and services to support and reinforce equal participation for all people with disabilities.</p><p>  The National Disability Strategy Implementation Group, which I am chairing, is in the process of drawing up an <i>Implementation Plan</i>   specifying actions across a number of departments, including the Department of Health. The National Disability Authority is at an advanced stage in the development of Disability Indicators which will allow real measurement of how the actions contained in the Plan translate into an enhanced quality of life for people with disabilities.</p><p>  With regard to services and supports which are under the aegis of the Department of Health, the implementation of the recommendations set out in the <i>Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review of Disability Services in Ireland</i> and the <i>VFM National Implementation Framework</i>   will enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities in the following ways: people with disabilities and their families will have more choice and flexibility in the services they receive and will have more control over how they access these services; services and supports will be tailored to meet individual need and will support greater independence and social inclusion; the move to individualised budgeting will be underpinned by a standardised needs assessment to ensure fairness and transparency in the way in which funding is allocated; supports and services will be delivered with greater equity, transparency and accountability and will be more cost effective.</p><p>  During 2013 the HSE will manage and direct migration towards a person-centred supports model through demonstration projects initiated by service providers as proof of concept, which will run in parallel with current services. Their suitability for wider application will then be evaluated. The implementation processes underway in respect of the <i>Congregated Settings Report</i> and the <i>New Directions</i>   (Adult Day Services) Report also fit within the overarching VFM implementation framework and will significantly enhance the lives of people with disabilities.</p><p>  A HSE-led National implementation Group is developing a national plan and change programme to progress the recommendations of the <i>Congregated Settings Report</i>   and transfer the 3,600 people with disabilities who live in these settings into the community over the next 7 years.  As part of this process &euro;1m has been transferred from the Health Vote to the Housing Vote to provide for the social housing costs of up to 150 people leaving institutions in 2013.</p><p>  The recommendations in <i>New Directions, </i>the Report of the National Working Group for the Review of HSE-funded Adult Day Services<i>,</i>is guiding the reconfiguration and modernization of HSE funded adult day services from a largely segregated group-delivered service to a personally chosen and socially inclusive model of supports. A National Implementation Working Group established by the HSE to oversee the implementation of the recommendations has developed a draft interim <i>Quality Standards Framework for Day Services</i>   with a  consultation process to commence in Quarter 3, 2013.</p><p>  One of the key commitments in the Programme for Government  in relation to children and adults with disabilities is to put the<i> National Standards for Residential Services for People with Disabilities </i>  on a statutory footing and ensure that the services are inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA). The standards outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services.  They seek to ensure that vulnerable people with disabilities in residential services are safeguarded and protected, and their quality of life is enhanced. </p><p>Each section of the <i>National Standards</i> outline the specific standards for adults and children which aim to enhance the potential of people living in residential services in addition to ensuring that their living space is of an appropriate standard.  The <i>Standards </i>  focus on outcomes which empower people with disabilities at the different stages of their lives to participate in, and contribute to, activities which help them realise their full potential.  I am pleased to say that I formally launched these standards earlier today.</p><p>  Work is also continuing in the Department of Health on both the <i>Registration and Inspection</i> and <i>Care and Welfare</i>  regulations required to bring the standards into law. These are being developed taking into account the lessons learned from the introduction of similar regulations for nursing homes. HIQA's additional staffing requirements have been approved and discussions on the resources required to commence the regulatory regime are well advanced.  It is expected that the proposed registration and inspection regime will commence in Quarter 3 this year.</p></reply>

Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self-harm is a priority for this Government.  <i>Reach Out </i>our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention makes a number of recommendations in relation to fast track referrals to community-based mental health services, effective response to deliberate self-harm, training, stigma reduction, etc.  Consequently, the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has developed a range of initiatives to support people who are suicidal and also supporting their families, friends and peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts.    </p><p>  Funding for suicide prevention is provided to the NOSP by the HSE from its overall budget for mental health.  The annual budget for suicide prevention increased this year to over &euro;13 million.  Over &euro;8 million of this is provided to the NOSP to fund voluntary and statutory agencies delivering services in the area of prevention, intervention, postvention and research.   The remaining &euro;5 million for suicide prevention is available regionally to fund HSE Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives.</p><p>  The NOSP is reviewing its current activities to make the most of our available resources, including looking at best practice internationally to inform evidence-based policy decisions.  This will result in a revised strategic approach for 2013 and will inform the final phase of the <i>Reach Out </i>Strategy<i>, </i>  which runs until 2014.   I expect that the HSE will approve the revised approach in the very near future.</p><p>  A key part of the work of the NOSP is to create an awareness within the community of positive mental health and suicide prevention.  NOSP commissions major national media campaigns and also sponsors non-statutory partners in their health promotion work.  The major NOSP campaigns include '<i>Your Mental Health'</i> and <i>'Let Someone Know'</i>  .  It also funds campaigns targeted at specific groups within the community e.g. the farming community through Farm TV.   These programmes have been well evaluated in terms of impact.   The focus of these national campaigns is to assist the individual to understand the importance of looking after their mental health and to seek help at times of stress.</p><p>  The NOSP is also involved in media monitoring to ensure that safe messages are communicated through print media and has facilitated national standards on the reporting of suicide.  The NOSP has recently established a communication advisory group to assist with the development of a new communications strategy for suicide prevention and to promote positive mental health. </p><p>  Another function of the NOSP is to coordinate the activity of the many voluntary and statutory agencies that are engaged in suicide prevention activities.  Currently the NOSP funds 26 non-statutory agencies working in this area.  The relationship between NOSP and the non-statutory groups is framed in Service Level Agreements.</p><p>  It is vital that we ensure that this work is connected/interlinked and avoids duplication, is evidence and needs based and offers value for money.  In order to get maximum benefit from the investment in suicide prevention and ensure a coordinated response to the needs of those at risk of or affected by suicide, the NOSP will continue to coordinate the work of the many different voluntary, statutory and non-statutory organisations working in this area.  By promoting cross-organisational collaboration, the development of networks and partnerships, skills sharing and service development, the NOSP hopes to maximise the impact of a suicide prevention and support network in Ireland, to ensure it reaches and responds effectively to people who are vulnerable.  The NOSP is currently working to integrate current programmes so as to reduce duplication within the sector, and provide a strategic framework for the coordination of the extensive range of actions in this area.</p></reply>

However, at the appointment stage this data may not be current and cannot be validated.  Accordingly, it is not possible to indicate the number of the successful candidates who were already employed by the HSE.  </p><p>  It is currently the responsibility of the HSE Regional Directors of Operations (RDO) to decide within the context of their current resources, whether to fill vacancies that may arise as a result of the appointment of an individual to the mental health development posts from 2012.  Each RDO has been asked to consider favourably the backfilling of posts vacated by the appointment of individuals to new mental health development posts to ensure that the objective of enhancing General Adult and Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams will be maintained.</p><p>  As at 30th April, 2013, 383 of the 414 posts approved in 2012 have either been filled, are under offer or awaiting clearance.  The National Recruitment Service (NRS) of the HSE creates national panels in anticipation of vacancies.  On occasion however, it is difficult to fill some posts for various reasons including geographical location, international shortage of some grades, most notably clinical Psychologists etc.   The NRS  is currently working to ensure that  the remaining posts will be filled as soon as possible, subject to appropriately qualified candidates being available.  </p><p>  Budgetary pressures within the HSE delayed the full utilisation of the 2012 funding, but this sum is available again this year along with a further additional &euro;35m which was provided in Budget 2013 for the continued development of mental health services across a range of headings, including the further ongoing development of community services.  477 posts have been approved to implement these measures.</p><p>  Discussions took place within the HSE, and in consultation with the Department of Health, to finalise the allocation of these resources and commence recruitment.  In March, each of the four HSE regions were asked to submit a business case against each of the identified objectives detailing how the funding is to be spent and the type and number of WTE to be recruited.   The business cases were submitted to the Office of the Assistant National Director Mental Health and examined to ensure that they were within the scope of the agreed objectives approved by the HSE Senior Management Team; the funding came within the allocation to the Region; the WTEs were within the allocation; there was clarity about the types of post to be recruited. </p><p>  Approval has issued to two of the Regions, HSE Dublin North East and HSE South and it is expected that approval will issue to the remaining two HSE Regions shortly.    When the Approval Letters issue, the Regional Directors of Operations will ensure that the necessary paperwork is submitted to the NRS and the recruitment process will commence.  I have received assurances from the HSE that the recruitment process for the new posts being funded in 2013, and any outstanding  posts from the 414 approved in 2012, is being given priority within the HSE.</p></reply>

The Report identifies that around 4,000 people (based on the 2008 census) with disabilities in Ireland live in congregated settings, defined as a residential setting where people live with ten or more people.  It found that not withstanding the commitment and initiative of dedicated staff and management, a significant number of people were still experiencing institutional living conditions where they lacked basic privacy and dignity and lived their lives apart from any community and families.  The HSE has established a National Implementation Group on Congregated Settings under the auspices of the National Consultative Forum, which is comprised of representatives from the HSE, Disability Umbrella Groups and service user representative organisations.  This group is developing the implementation plan that will be rolled out at a regional and local level in full consultation with the appropriate stakeholders. </p><p>  The implementation of the report poses significant challenges to many stake holders, including clients, families, disability service providers, the HSE, various Departments, statutory bodies and representative organisations.  It will require a need for a major change programme.  This radical change is not the sole responsibility of the HSE but rather a collaborative responsibility shared between the person with a disability, their family and carers, a multiplicity of agencies, the Government and society as a whole.  To ensure the needs of people transitioning from congregated settings are fully taken into account during the process, the model of care for individuals will be based on a person-centred plan.  This may change over time in line with an individual's needs and circumstances and the model of service delivery applicable at a particular time.  The Report recognises a seven-year timeframe for the implementation of its recommendations.  However, this timeframe should be treated with caution as there are a number of complexities involved due to multidimensional elements of implementation including, individual choice of accommodation, living arrangements and location, funding, and the future role of staff, training and skill mix.</p><p>  The National Housing Strategy for People with Disability 2011-2016 provides for Government policy in relation to the deinstitutionalisation of people with physical, intellectual and mental health disabilities.  This Strategy forms part of a coherent framework, in conjunction with the Government's mental health policy, A Vision for Change and the Report of the HSE Working Group on Congregated Settings, to support people with disabilities within communities with maximum independence and choice.  As part of this process, some &euro;1 million has been transferred from the Health Vote to the Housing Vote to provide for the ring-fenced social housing costs of up to 150 people leaving disability or mental health institutions in 2013.  Those units will be additional to the overall social housing supports which are expected to be delivered through all supply mechanisms in 2013.   As the specific queries about Cheshire Homes raised by the Deputy are service issues, they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

However, people attending outpatient and hospital appointments are, in general, expected to make their own travel arrangements, using private or scheduled public transport.  The exceptions are for dialysis, cancer (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and post-operative transplant patients, where transport may be provided.  In these cases, the patient's appointment or treatment should be directly related to the treatment.  Transport may also be provided where, in the clinician's view, the patient would be unable to make the journey without clinical assistance or where the patient must be transported on a stretcher.  Following implementation of the HSE's non-ambulance patient transport policy, responsibility for the arrangement and provision of non-ambulance transport has moved from the HSE National Ambulance Service to local health offices in each region.  If a patient or his or her clinician considers that transport is required, the local health office should be contacted.  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

The formation of Irish acute hospitals into a small number of groups, each with its own governance and management, will provide an optimum opportunity for hospital services to be configured to deliver high-quality, safe patient care in a cost-effective manner.  Professor John Higgins chaired a Strategic Board on the establishment of Hospital Groups.  I have received his report, which is based on a comprehensive consultation process and contains almost 60 recommendations on the formation, management and governance of hospital groups, all of which are strongly endorsed by the Strategic Board.  I appreciate that this report and the related Government decision were anxiously awaited.  As this is the most radical and most fundamental modernisation of our health system infrastructure since the State&rsquo;s foundation, I took very seriously my obligation to consider the report closely and to assure myself and my Cabinet colleagues that it provides a robust basis to enable timely access to a high-quality and sustainable hospital service for those who need it.  The Deputy will be pleased to learn that I submitted the report to the Government this morning for its consideration and decision.  The report has been accepted.  I will be publishing the report later this afternoon, together with the smaller hospitals framework.</p></reply>

Collaborating with individual hospitals, the SDU together with the NTPF and the HSE have developed the OP waiting list minimum dataset that allows for this data to be submitted to the NTPF from hospitals on a weekly basis.  This builds on the work previously undertaken by the HSE Outpatient Data Quality Programme.  Clear data on the OPD waiting list is now being reported for the first time, and is published on .  The waiting list for outpatients is updated monthly.  The data show numbers waiting over the various time-bands for a first appointment at a consultant-led clinic.  In a further enhancement of the reporting, future updates will for the first time include numbers reported by specialty in addition to the breakdown by hospital.</p><p>  The total number of people waiting on the out-patient waiting list as at 3 May 2013, as advised by the NTPF, is 376,751.  This is a reduction of 7,881 in comparison with the NTPF published figures to March 2013.  The data also shows that of the total number of people waiting, some 199,513 (52.6%) are waiting less than six months and almost 278,666 (74%) are waiting less than 12 months.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has been set of 12 months for a first time consultant-led outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE Service Plan.  Currently, the focus is on hospitals continuing the validation of waiting lists. All hospitals have been engaged in this process which is anticipated to be complete by mid-May 2013.</p><p>  Reforming the delivery of outpatient services is being addressed through the Outpatient Service Performance Improvement Programme.  This Programme encompasses the HSE, SDU, the NTPF and all hospitals providing outpatient services.  It is a national programme being implemented between 2012 and 2015.  The overall aim of the programme is to ensure timely, appropriate access to OP services so that the most appropriate member of the clinical team sees the right patient at the right time.  Key elements of this large programme of reform will include ongoing validation of waiting lists, the systematic and standardised management of referrals from primary care, a reduction in unacceptably high &#8220;do not attend&#8221; rates and appropriate discharging from OP services when clinically appropriate to do so.</p></reply>

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme.  There has been no change to the Government&rsquo;s over-arching commitment to this goal.  This Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population.  Having examined the progress made in the universal GP care plan, it became clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic for a short-term arrangement.  Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness.  The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public.  This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions.  As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition.  While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments.  In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. </p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the delay in the initial step of the roll-out of the universal GP service.  In doing so, it has considered the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, with the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay.  No decision has been taken by the Cabinet Committee or by Government on changing the first step of the plan to extend GP care without fees to persons with chronic illnesses.  Instead, it has been agreed that we should prepare and set out a number of alternative options with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, and I expect to report back to the Cabinet Committee in the near future.  As part of this work, consideration will be given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation this universal health service.  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources in the two most recent budgets.  The HSE Vote now contains funding of &euro;30 million for this year for an initial phase of the provision of GP services as part of this Programme for Government commitment.</p></reply>

The health services has already achieved significant progress in &ldquo;doing more with less&rdquo; and in providing various flexibilities in line with the Croke Park agreement to date. There has been a significant reduction in the cost base of the health services over the last few years, and yet the level of service has either been maintained or increased.  We are cutting the cost of services, not the services.  Even after the considerable reduction in the cost base over the last few years, further substantial cost extraction is required, with &euro;781m in savings to be achieved this year. Significant savings have been targeted in relation to the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.  A new agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association will provide savings in excess of &euro;400m over the next three years.  This will mean significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, as well as a reduction in the drugs bill to the State.  </p><p>  The level of health services to be delivered within the available funding is set out in the Service Plan. The Plan also sets out the measures required to fund unavoidable pressures and commitments made under the Programme for Government. Significant reductions in drug expenditures will be required and maximising the potential for pay savings under the Croke Park Agreement is critical in achieving the savings target.  Every budget holder must achieve the expenditure targets set at the start of the year, and in line with the National Service Plan, the Regional Service Plans were prepared in the context of the challenges faced by the health services in terms of reduced staffing levels, and a reduced budget, combined with increasing demand for services. </p><p>  My Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE are working collaboratively on the Financial Improvement Programme with a view to strengthening the Health Service Executive's financial and performance management and reporting systems during 2013. Notwithstanding this, there is ongoing and intensive engagement each month between officials from my Department and the HSE in the context of regular monitoring of expenditure. The HSE's Performance Report, which is published every month, provides an overall analysis of key performance data from Finance, HR, Hospital and Primary &amp;amp; Community Services. The activity data reported is based on Performance Activity and Key Performance Indicators outlined in the HSE National Service Plan.</p><p>  The position at the end of the first quarter is showing a &euro;27m deficit in income and expenditure terms.  When account is taken of timing issues around the phasing of budgets and the shortfall in retirees to date , there is a core deficit of &euro;11m. Projections to year end based on 1st Quarter data are being finalised by the HSE at present, in tandem with the detailed assessment of performance. The scale of the risk and challenge in achieving financial breakeven by year end remains significant as predicted in the NSP 2013. and will increase if there is an absence of continued and improved flexibility under the Croke Park Agreement.</p></reply>

The HSE has decided that applications for Phase 1, covering registered general nurses for the Acute Hospital setting and the Community, will be accepted on a rolling basis for 2012 graduates, and also those who graduated in 2010 and 2011.  Phase 2, which covers General, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability and Midwifery Mental Health, Intellectual Disability, Midwifery launched in mid-February.

I have emphasised to the HSE the high priority the Government and I attach to this issue, and also the need to address NCHDs working conditions more generally.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Service Plan for 2013 specifically recognises the need to address EWTD compliance as a priority, stating that there will be a particular focus in the acute hospital service on the achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive amongst the non-consultant hospital doctor workforce, in line with the Implementation Plan submitted to the Commission in 2012.</p><p>  A key priority for the HSE in 2013 will be a further reduction of average weekly hours worked and also a reduction in the duration of shifts undertaken. The Executive is bringing a strong and particular focus to the achievement of compliance with the Directive.  New and demanding targets and timescales have been issued to hospital managers and clinical directors and progress on a site-by-site basis will be assessed against these.  The HSE has recently established a national group chaired by a senior executive to bring a clear and urgent focus to: implementation of the Directive, assessment of performance and site-by-site accountability for change. The HSE is also conscious of the need to implement other measures to improve the working conditions of NCHDs, including protection of training time, the implementation of formal bleep policies and the transfer of tasks often inappropriately undertaken by NCHDs to more appropriate staff.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the HSE is making every effort to improve the working hours of NCHDs and to implement other measures to improve their working conditions which will in turn facilitate the provision of improved and safer delivery of services to patients.</p></reply>

In cases where HIQA believes that there is a serious risk to the health and welfare of healthcare service users, then HIQA may undertake an investigation into the safety, quality and standards of healthcare services. </p><p>  In June 2012 HIQA published the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare. These national standards provide the building blocks for quality and safety throughout the healthcare system, creating a common understanding of what is required with regard to the quality and safety of services provided. The HSE is continuing to work with hospitals in preparation for the monitoring process against the National Standards which will be commenced by HIQA later this year. </p><p>  Effective service delivery requires processes to ensure that there will be sufficient staff available at the right time and with the right skills to deliver high-quality care.  The focus of health service management is on ensuring that all critical and essential services are protected and are provided in a safe manner.</p><p>  The Government has determined that, in line with its commitment to reduce the size of the public service, health sector employment numbers must be reduced substantially in 2013 and 2014.  Spending on health services will also have to be very tightly controlled. However, the HSE can make critical staff appointments when necessary.  </p><p>  The Public Service Agreement has been crucial to the health service&rsquo;s ability to manage through the very difficult circumstances of recent years.  The flexibility and adaptability shown by staff has meant that even with reducing staff numbers, service levels have largely been maintained and indeed performance in relation to Emergency Departments and hospital waiting lists has markedly improved.</p></reply>

GP engagement and agreement to deliver primary care services from primary care centres is central to delivery of the necessary infrastructure. Regardless of the method of delivery or deprivation ranking, locations cannot be progressed unless there is committed GP engagement.  Carrickmacross is one of the 35 potential locations for primary care centres to be developed by means of the Public Private Partnership (PPP) project as announced in the July 2012 Infrastructure Stimulus Package.   Of the 35, approximately 20 will be offered to the market subject to a) agreement between the local GPs and the HSE on active local GP involvement in the centres and b) site suitability and availability.</p><p>  Delivery of health care infrastructure is a service matter.

Deliberations by the Government on the expenditure allocations for next year and 2015 are likely to continue up until Budget time. As with previous Budgets, the difficult financial position facing the Exchequer will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure.</p><p>  There has been a significant reduction in the cost base of the health services over the last few years, and yet the level of service has either been maintained or increased.  We are cutting the cost of services, not the services.  This has been, and will continue to be, achieved through efficiencies and re-configuration under the existing Croke Park Agreement. Significant savings have been achieved to date in relation to the cost of pharmaceuticals and professional fees, thereby reducing the cost of the PCRS without affecting the clients.  The agreement reached with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) will provide savings in excess of &euro;400m over the next three years.  This will mean significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, as well as a reduction in the drugs bill to the State. </p><p>  The reductions in the cost base over the last number of years have largely been required to meet unavoidable pressures within the health system, along with Programme for Government commitments, for which no additional funding was available from the Central Exchequer.  Within the overall expenditure reduction, additional funding was made available to address key policy priorities in services for older people, disability, cancer, child protection and suicide. Furthermore, additional numbers of medical cards as a result of the economic crisis along with the development of primary care and mental health services all had to be met from the reduced level of funding available for the health sector.  Achieving this, whilst maintaining the level of services provided is evidence of the  significant progress in reducing the cost of services in the health sector. </p><p>  My Department and the HSE will continue to work on the Health Reform Programme, which is a central element of the Programme for Government and critical to providing a health service which is fair to patients, gives them access when they need it and delivers value for money for the taxpayer.</p></reply>

The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) is the body charged with building the hospital. Following detailed consideration of the project management and governance structures required to deliver the project as quickly as possible and to the highest quality, I intend to restructure the NPHDB so that its sole focus is on planning, designing, building and equipping the new hospital. I am currently considering the necessary appointments to the NPHDB to ensure that it has the expertise needed to deal with this very large and complex capital project. </p><p>  In the interim, senior  officials from my Department and the HSE were appointed to the NPHDB in January 2013. The priorities for this transitional Board has been on reconciling the brief with the new site, site preparation, close-out of existing contracts and new procurement processes.  A joint group involving the HSE and St James's Hospital are meeting regularly to progress the enabling and decant work required; a shared services group is in place focusing on identifying the facilities which can be shared so as to optimise the build; and a review of urgent care centre(s) configuration is underway and is expected to be complete within the coming weeks. The latter is key to finalising the scale of the facilities required on the St James's campus and informing the design. </p><p>  Work on developing a detailed project timeline is continuing, recognising the urgency and priority attached to the project, as well as its scale and complexity.  In the short-term, the contract notice for the procurement of a new design team is expected to be published in the coming weeks. The aim is to have the new design team in place as soon as possible, while complying in the tendering process with EU directives and national guidelines on procurement. The aim is to secure planning permission by December 2014.  </p><p>  In addition to a new building, the new children's hospital entails the coming together of three existing paediatric hospitals (Temple Street, Crumlin and Tallaght). An important step in this regard is the establishment of a Children's Hospital Group, involving the three hospitals.  The Group will have a non-statutory Board of Direction which will oversee the integration of services across the three hospitals. The Children's Hospital Group will also act as client for the capital project, and will lead on service transfer planning, human resource planning, philanthropy etc., functions which were previously within the remit of the NPHDB.  Dr Jim Browne has been appointed as its Chair, and will work closely with the Chairs of the three existing hospitals, who have welcomed his appointment. </p><p>  This project is of huge importance for the provision of acute paediatric services for all children in Ireland and is a priority for me and for this Government. No effort will be spared in ensuring the swiftest possible completion, with optimal design and value for money. </p></reply>

In the case of Community Nursing Units, these include challenges regarding staffing, funding and the age and structure of its units.   For 2013 the quantum and type of health services to be delivered within the available funding has been set out in the HSE National Service Plan. Minister Reilly approved and laid a copy of the Plan before both Houses of the Oireachtas earlier this year.</p><p>  If it becomes necessary for an older person to move to a nursing home, their safety and well-being is of paramount concern.  We have to ensure that the highest standards of care are provided to all residents in a safe and secure environment, and that we meet the needs of those who require our services in the very best way possible. I believe that patient safety and quality assurance in nursing homes is secured by setting quality standards, reinforced by Regulations that specify how the best services possible can be delivered in an effective and appropriate way. The National Quality Standards referred to by the Deputy apply to all nursing homes, both public and private.</p><p>  Recent capital investment has brought about a significant improvement in the standard of facilities across all care programmes including Services for Older People.<b></b>Between 2006 and 2012 approximately <b>&euro;508m</b> capital funding was invested in infrastructure, including CNUs, which supports the delivery of Services for Older People.  In order to comply on an on-going basis with regulatory requirements, the HSE is now concentrating on the refurbishment and upgrade of existing accommodation.  Accommodation which requires the least investment to comply with the regulatory requirements will be refurbished first. This will achieve the greatest number of compliant beds for the available funding.</p><p>  Any capital development must be considered in the context of the multi-annual HSE capital programme which is developed over a rolling five year period.  In drawing up its capital programme, the HSE is required to prioritise capital infrastructure within its overall capital funding allocation, taking into account the programme's capital commitments and costs of completion over the multi-annual period.  It is essential to assess all projects, other than those where existing contractual commitments are in place, on their merits to ensure that the limited capital funding available goes to those developments which are of highest national importance.</p><p>  Both myself and my colleague, Minister Reilly are committed to the provision of a quality public nursing home service. Our overall objective is to protect the viability of as many units as possible, within the funding and staffing resources available.  The Department is working closely with the HSE to develop an overall plan regarding future public provision for the Minister's consideration.  The plan will reflect regional need and have regard to the current severe financial constraints, restrictions on public sector staffing and recruitment and the on-going need to meet service and safety standards; all of which pose challenges for community nursing units across the country.</p></reply>

Together, they provide a range of services for the catchment of Dublin South-East and Wicklow, across three sites in a collaborative arrangement.  Smaller hospitals, such as St Columcille's hospital, need to be supported within a hospital group, for the safe management of patients who present with varying levels of complexity, for education and training, continuous professional development and the sustainable recruitment of high quality clinical staff.  The establishment of hospital groups will ensure that St Columcille's is guaranteed a central role in the future delivery of good quality care for patients.</p><p><i>  Securing the Future of Smaller Hospitals: A Framework for Development</i>   offers clear information about the role of our smaller hospitals and what they will do in the future.  While the Framework focusses in particular on the role of nine smaller hospitals, including St Colmcille's,  which have been the subject of particular attention from the Health Information and Quality Authority, the principles behind it will apply to all smaller hospitals.  In developing the Framework, the Government is clear that (i) there is an important future role for smaller hospitals, in which they will provide services for more patients, not fewer; (ii) no acute hospital will close, and (iii) safety issues in all acute hospitals, large or small, must be fully addressed, by providing the right type of service, for the right patient in the right setting.  This framework will demonstrate clearly that the future of smaller hospitals is secure.  It outlines the need for smaller hospitals and larger hospitals to operate together and therefore is intrinsically linked to the on-going work regarding the development of hospital groups. </p><p>  We know that the traditional practice of providing as many services as possible in every hospital is neither sustainable nor safe.   Professor John Higgins chaired a strategic board on the establishment of hospital groups and I have received his report, which is based on a comprehensive consultation process and contains almost 60 recommendations on the formation, management and governance of hospital groups, all of which are strongly endorsed by the Strategic Board.  The formation of Irish acute hospitals into a small number of groups, each with its own governance and management, will provide opportunity for hospital services to be configured to deliver high-quality, safe patient care in a cost-effective manner.</p><p>  I appreciate that both of the reports and the related government decision are anxiously awaited. However, this is the most radical and most fundamental modernisation of our acute health system infrastructure since the State's foundation and I took very seriously my obligation to consider the reports closely, to assure myself and my Cabinet colleagues that they provide a robust basis to enable timely access to a high quality and sustainable hospital service for those who need it. </p><p>  The Deputy will be pleased to learn that I submitted the reports to Government this morning for its consideration and decision and the reports have been accepted. Officials in my department are now in the process of making suitable arrangements for the publication of these reports as soon as possible. </p></reply>

I am committed to providing the best possible health service and will continue to work with the HSE to ensure the best possible outcomes for these patients. </p><p>  There has been significant investment in services for people with Cystic Fibrosis in the last few years, the most recent development being the opening of a new dedicated Cystic Fibrosis unit in July 2012 at St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital. This unit contains single en suite rooms which are dedicated for inpatient CF patients and reflects best practice in terms of infection control.</p><p>  The new Nutley Wing (opened summer 2012) at St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital (SVUH) is a seven-storey development of which two floors contain a dedicated Cystic Fibrosis unit.Under a protocol for the treatment of CF patients at SVUH, signed off in July 2012 with the hospital, the HSE, Department of Health and CFA, up to 34 isolation beds will be made available in the new wing and the 10-bed day unit will be used effectively to help ensure that patients are treated in the optimum setting. </p><p>  Beaumont Hospital is one of the 6 specialist centres and provides services to adults with cystic fibrosis.   In the 2008 Budget, a special allocation of &euro;2.5m capital funding was provided to enable the hospital to provide facilities for ambulatory care of people with cystic fibrosis.</p><p>  This enabled the provision of the new dedicated Outpatient facility for patients with CF and will facilitate a comprehensive range of services from the multidisciplinary teams; these include outpatient clinics, a drop in centre / base for clinical assessments with medical consultants and nurses, and the provision of treatments that otherwise have required hospitalization. This facility opened on 26 October 2010. </p><p>  St Paul's Ward is the specialist respiratory ward in the hospital, on which the single rooms are for elective admissions of patients with CF for prophylactic antibiotic therapy (or other treatment as required). With priority access to a number of en-suite inpatient rooms, the need for an adult with CF being admitted as an inpatient via the Emergency Department is now a rare occurrence.</p><p>  Services in Dublin for children with Cystic Fibrosis are provided at Crumlin, Tallaght and Temple Street Hospitals. A new dedicated Respiratory and CF unit was opened in Temple Street  in June 2010 providing state of the art facilities for children with respiratory disorders, their families and staff.  It includes a lung function laboratory with the most up to date equipment, spacious patient treatment rooms and outpatient clinic rooms.  The National Newborn Bloodspot Screening Laboratory is also located in Temple Street and newborn screening for Cystic Fibrosis, introduced in July 2011, is an integral component of the National Newborn Bloodspot Screening Programme.</p><p>  On a regional basis services for children with CF are also provided at specialist centres in Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Drogheda. The majority of services for children cystic fibrosis care are delivered on an ambulatory care basis.</p><p>  As the provision of facilities and services for persons with cystic fibrosis is an operational matter for the HSE, I have also asked the HSE to reply directly to the deputy on this matter.</p></reply>

For this reason he proposed a tax on Sugar Sweetened Drinks and undertook to have a Health Impact Assessment (HIA) on the potential effects of such a tax on the health of the Irish people, including those in disadvantaged circumstances.  The Working Group who oversaw the Health Impact Assessment were broadly of the view that there was evidence to suggest that Sugar Sweetened Drinks are associated with weight gain and that a Sugar Sweetened Drinks levy should not be seen as a revenue generating issue but rather a measure to change behaviour.  They agreed that if this tax were implemented there would be a need for good monitoring and evaluation.</p><p>  The Minister launched the Department of Health's revised Healthy Eating Guidelines in 2012 which are a tool to help inform the general public about the food and drink choices required for a healthy lifestyle and set out in plain and simple language the food servings the Irish population need to consume to maintain health and wellbeing.  These guidelines strictly limit high fat, high salt and high sugar foods and drinks from the Top Shelf of the Food Pyramid.  The Special Action Group on Obesity is currently considering measures to support the use of the Healthy Eating Guidelines.

They act on the Commission in their personal capacities and are required by the Revised Statute of the Venice Commission not to receive or to accept any instructions.  Members do not receive any remuneration for their service on the Commission or for attendance at plenary sessions.  The travel and subsistence expenses of each member of the Commission are borne by the State concerned.  However, if the Commission entrusts members with specific missions, the expenses are borne by the budget of the Commission.</p><p>  The current appointments to the Venice Commission were made by the Attorney General in 2010. </p><p>  Vacancies will arise on the expiry of the tenure of the current members in 2014.

The report for Kosovo, and a report on Serbia, were finalised following the agreement reached by both countries on the status of Serbs in Kosovo on 19 April.  High Representative Ashton and Commissioner Fule presented the reports and an update on the Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue at the General Affairs Council on 22 April. The report was positive on the reforms undertaken by Kosovo, as well as efforts to normalise relations with Serbia, and recommended the opening of SAA negotiations with Kosovo.  It is now being discussed by Member States.  </p><p>  While the reaction of Member States to the report has been positive, the importance of the implementation of the agreements reached at the Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue has been emphasised.  Member States will be looking for concrete progress in this regard between now and the European Council in June, when a decision on opening SAA negotiations with Kosovo may be taken. </p><p>  With a view to a possible decision on SAA negotiations, Member States are also discussing what form an SAA with Kosovo may take, in a context where five Member States do not recognise Kosovo.  I am encouraged that all Member States have indicated they wish to be constructive, and I am confident that Member States will work towards a solution that respects their positions, but also honours their commitments to Kosovo's European perspective as outlined in the December Council Conclusions.

Earlier this month the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Eamon Gilmore TD and I launched Ireland's new Policy on International Development &ndash; One World, One Future &ndash; where we set out our vision for a sustainable and just world.  This policy sets out in very clear terms our goals and areas of focus and affirms Ireland's commitment to international development and its centrality to our foreign policy.  It also makes it clear that our positive role in international development, in addition to helping fight poverty and vulnerability and saving lives, can create opportunities, which are important for our own economic recovery.  </p><p>  The new policy restates the Programme for Government commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP to Official Development Assistance (ODA).  However this can only be achieved when economic circumstances permit and in the meantime we will endeavour to maintain aid expenditure at current levels.</p><p>  Stabilising the ODA budget has been an important and significant achievement for this Government, particularly in light of the extraordinarily difficult economic conditions facing the country.  For the record, we have allocated &euro;622 million to ODA for 2013.  This represents a very significant allocation of public funds, is a clear indication of our commitment to the aid programme, and represents a genuine investment on behalf of the Irish people to assist those less fortunate than ourselves.</p></reply>

The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been an official candidate for EU accession since 2005. With a view to a possible decision on opening accession negotiations, the December Council invited the Commission to report on progress in three areas: (i) EU-related reforms in the context of the High Level Accession Dialogue (HLAD); (ii) steps taken to promote good neighbourly relations, and (iii) steps taken to resolve the 'name issue' with Greece, under the auspices of the UN.  </p><p>  The Commission&rsquo;s report was published on 16 April and was relatively positive, noting progress in almost all areas of the HLAD.  It concluded that steps have been taken on bilateral relations, and that efforts to resolve the &lsquo;name issue&rsquo; have taken on new momentum.  </p><p>  However the report also noted the negative effects of two months of political crisis that followed events on 24 December 2012, when adoption of the 2013 annual budget under controversial circumstances resulted in the forcible removal of opposition MPs and journalists from Parliament.  The Commission's report emphasised the importance of the timely implementation of the political agreement of 1 March 2013 which ended the crisis. </p><p>  Ireland has supported the Commission's recommendation to open accession negotiations.  However, decisions on enlargement are made by unanimity, requiring the agreement of all 27 Member States.  Ireland, as EU Presidency, will facilitate discussion of the report at the General Affairs Council in June and will seek to have the issue progressed.  Prior to that I expect to have talks with the Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for European Integration.</p></reply>

Tax is charged, subject to certain exemptions and reliefs, on the amount inherited by the donee, the person receiving the inheritance. CAT is long established and forms part of the tax system.  Capital taxation is designed to apply a tax to the capital as distinct from the income of a person. The case for the taxation of capital rests mainly on considerations of equity and social justice. The object of the present system of capital taxation in Ireland, which consists of Capital Acquisitions Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Discretionary Trust Tax, Domicile Levy and now also Local Property Tax, is to ensure equity in the tax system and to reduce inequalities in the distribution of wealth.</p><p>  The taxation of capital raises substantial tax revenue for the exchequer and is also preferable from the point of view of its impact on the economy to an increase in employment taxes such as income tax.</p><p>  It is appropriate for CAT to be charged on an inheritance as provided for.  I have no plans to abolish CAT.</p></reply>

The Minister has prescribed and published this list, which is set out in the schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013.  I stress that the decision as to whether an estate is on the list of unfinished estates is in the ambit of local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and not in the ambit of the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners. I have been advised by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government that there will be no change to the list of prescribed unfinished housing estates for the current valuation period.  Where a property situated in an unfinished housing estate within the list as prescribed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is not liable to LPT on a valuation date, section 14(2) of the LPT legislation provides that such residential properties will be exempt until the next valuation date. Therefore any residential properties contained in the list of unfinished housing estates on 1 May 2013 will be exempt from LPT until the next valuation date (1 November 2016).</p><p>  For those properties that are not exempt, the LPT is a self-assessment tax so it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on her or his assessment of the market value of the property.  The condition of the property and surrounding areas would be factors that property owners could take into account in valuing their properties.</p></reply>

However, the following may be helpful to the Deputy.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that local authorities and approved housing bodies will be liable to pay the LPT on their properties in the same way as any other residential property owner, unless the properties are used to accommodate people who have special housing needs.  Special housing needs refers to the provision of housing and support for people who have a particular need in addition to a general housing need to enable them to live in the community.  Under an amendment which I introduced this year in section 7 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013, local authorities and approved housing bodies will have until 1 January 2014 to pay their 2013 LPT on any properties which they are liable to pay the tax on.</p><p>  Approved housing bodies operate in the voluntary and co-operative housing sector and are engaged in the provision of social housing for those who face difficulty in living in our communities.

Notwithstanding the economic arguments in favour of liability, the group on balance did not favour creating a circular flow of payments.  However, the Government felt there could be issues of equity and proportionality in the differing treatment of privately owned properties and properties that are occupied by local authority tenants.  While reform of the local authority differential rents system would contribute to horizontal equity between local authority tenants and low income owners, anomalies could arise in cases where local authorities own and rent out a property in an otherwise privately owned housing estate.  The tenant in such a local authority property would not be subject to the LPT, but the owners of other properties would be subject to it.  The Deputy may be aware that the Household Charge was not payable in respect of houses owned by local authorities.  My intention in making local authorities liable for the payment of LPT was to address such anomalies.  Section 7 of the Act therefore provides that local authorities will be liable to pay the LPT on their properties in the same way as any other residential property owner, unless the properties in question are used to accommodate people with special housing needs such as the elderly or people with disabilities.  Residential properties purchased under the various local authority shared ownership schemes will also be subject to LPT, and in these cases, the individual(s) who purchased the residential property from the local authority will be liable to pay the tax.</p><p>  In response to submissions from local authorities, approved housing bodies and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, section 17 of the Act was amended to deem the chargeable value of local authority properties would fall into the first valuation band of &euro;0 to &euro;100,000 for the first valuation period, from 2013 to 2016.  This will result in a charge to LPT for each property of &euro;45 for 2013 and &euro;90 for 2014 to 2016.  The payment of the local authorities&rsquo; 2013 liability as also been deferred until January 2014.  This provision will not apply to residential properties purchased under the local authority shared ownership schemes, only to properties owned by local authorities and those owned by bodies standing approved for the purposes of section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. </p><p>  The provision was introduced as a transitional provision to give local authorities and approved housing bodies time to put structures and processes in place for dealing with LPT.</p><p>  Privately owned residential properties will be subject to the standard valuation mechanism set out in the legislation.</p></reply>

The legislation relating to transfers for no consideration specifies that such a transfer is treated as if it were for a consideration equal to the market value of the site at the date of the transfer. The transferor is liable to capital gains tax in respect of the transfer of the site if a chargeable gain arose between the time that he or she acquired the site and the time of its disposal. The transferee does not have a liability to capital gains tax in respect of the transfer. However, he or she might have a liability to gift tax in respect of the transfer. Any capital gains tax paid by the transferor in respect of the transfer is allowed as a credit against the gift tax payable, but the credit is clawed back where the asset is disposed of within 2 years of the gift. In addition, a liability to stamp duty arises on the transferee in respect of the transfer.  It should be noted that there is an exemption from capital gains tax where an individual transfers a site to his or her child (including a child of his or her civil partner or a foster child in certain circumstances) to enable the child to build a house on the site to be occupied as that child&rsquo;s only or main residence. The value of the site must be less than &euro;500,000 and the area of the site must be less than 0.4047 hectare. If the child disposes of the site or part of the site without a house having been built on the land, then the chargeable gain that was exempted is treated as accruing to the child at the time of the disposal. </p></reply>

Grouping properties into valuation bands, with the rate applying at the mid-point of the bands &ndash; in effect creating fixed sum and certain charges for each band &ndash; can ease the valuation challenges.  In devising the bands, a balance should be struck between the width of the bands and avoiding substantial liability differences between adjacent bands.  The wider the band, the easier it is to carry out a self-assessment, but very wide bands run the risk of creating inequities between taxpayers as well as compliance challenges.  The 2009 Commission on Taxation proposed five bands of &euro;150,000 width up to &euro;750,000; from &euro;750,000 to &euro;1 million; from &euro;1 million to &euro;1.5 million; and assessment on actual value over &euro;1.5 million. The Thornhill Group recommended the creation of a sufficient number of taxation bands to allow property owners to place their properties in an appropriate valuation band with reasonable confidence. Taking account of all aspects, the Thornhill Group recommended an initial band of &euro;0 to &euro;100,000; bands of &euro;50,000 in width for properties valued between &euro;100,001 and &euro;1,000,000; and no banding on properties over &euro;1 million with the tax liabilities determined on the self-assessed actual value. These bands are significantly narrower than the proposals of the 2009 Commission. The Government accepted the recommendation of the Thornhill Group.</p><p>  While there may be anomalies for properties that are valued close to the edge of the bands, this is unavoidable no matter what bands are chosen, and as indicated above narrower bands would make it more difficult for taxpayers to decide the correct band for their property.  I am satisfied the current system of valuation bands strikes a good balance between ease of assessment and a smooth progression of liabilities between the valuation bands.</p></reply>

The Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 puts the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the performance of their functions on a fully statutory basis. </p><p>  As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, most recently in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 87 (20652/13) and 92 (20686/13) on 1 May, liable persons who have not yet received an LPT Return from Revenue must still self-assess the amount of LPT due, complete and file their LPT Return by the relevant deadline and pay the tax due.  In my previous replies I also indicated that the logistics of ensuring that the chosen payment option can be activated in good time for the July payment date determines the closing date for paper return filing of 7 May 2013.  The e-filing closing date of 28 May 2013 is the de facto extension.</p><p>  While the due date for filing paper Returns has now passed, a number of options are available to property owners for filing their Returns electronically by the 28 May filing deadline. Depending on the customer&rsquo;s requirements, one of the following options will address their particular needs.  For property owners for whom e-filing is not practical, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the legislation provides that another person may file an LPT Return online on their behalf.  A further option includes contacting the LPT helpline on 1890 200 255 (mobile phone users can contact the helpline on 01 702 3049) to file a Return online.  Where, due to recent publicity about the attempted mis-use of credit card details, a property owner does not wish to give their credit or debit card details over the phone, if they own a single property, they can file online through the LPT helpline and opt to make their payment through deduction at source from their salary, occupational pension or pension from the Department of Social Protection, by cheque or in cash to one of three service providers.  It should also be noted that the credit card holder will not be held liable where the card is used without their proper authorisation.</p><p>  Furthermore, property owners who either have no internet access or are unable to read or write can also visit their local Revenue office where computers and assistance to file online will be available.</p><p>  As to difficulties being experienced by people attempting to contact the LPT helpline at 1890 200 255, I am assured by Revenue that only a small number of access issues have been reported since the service commenced on 6 March in comparison to the very high volumes of satisfied callers.  Since commencement, the helpline has handled in excess of 300,000 calls, with peak days experiencing 15,000 &ndash; 20,000 calls.  Any difficulties that may have been experienced by some people were clearly as a result of the high volumes on particular days coming up to the 7 May deadline for paper filers.  In response to the demand, Revenue extended the opening hours of the helpdesk from 9am/5pm to 8am/8pm on weekdays and commenced Saturday opening from 9am to 5pm.  Extra operators were also deployed to ensure that the necessary resources were in place to deal with the very high volumes of calls.  Revenue will continue to monitor the situation and make whatever adjustments are necessary to ensure there is sufficient capacity on the helpline to meet demand up to the 28 May filing deadline.  Details of the LPT helpline&rsquo;s extended opening hours for the period prior to this deadline are already posted on the Revenue website.</p><p>  Given the range of options that have been made available by Revenue to assist people experiencing any difficulty in meeting their LPT obligations, and the fact that owners of residential properties have already filed in excess of 700,000 returns and utilised the different payment options, I am very satisfied with the current arrangements that Revenue has in place.  Therefore, I do not propose, nor is it practicable given the logistics involved, to extend the closing date or consider that any changes to Revenue&rsquo;s procedures are required in the run-up to the online LPT Return filing date.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware the Relationship Framework with AIB provides that the State will not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the bank or their management decisions. This framework is published on the Department of Finance website. I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.  Neither the Central Bank nor the Department of Finance has a statutory function in relation to interest rate decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time. It should also be noted that the Relationship Framework references decisions regarding pricing as being commercial decisions for the banks.</p><p>  It must be remembered that in order to fund mortgages the bank must borrow at current wholesale and deposit rates which are currently higher than the ECB base rate and the bank must ensure that the rate it lends at is economically sustainable and provides a return for the bank and ultimately the State as its shareholder. It would not be fair for 2.1 million taxpayers to subsidise 138,000 owner occupier mortgages, especially when the vast majority of these mortgage holders can afford to pay their mortgages.</p><p>  I understand that the Central Bank of Ireland pays attention to the effect of any increases in the standard variable rate, on mortgage arrears and would no doubt be concerned if banks were exacerbating their arrears problem and as such impairing their on-going viability, from such actions.</p></reply>

They can also be required when obtaining licences, e.g. an excise licence or road transport licence, or in other cases such as where the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001 applied tax clearance requirements to persons elected to the Dail or Seanad, judicial appointees and senior office appointees.

A process is currently being finalised that ensures that maximum value is extracted from the loan sales.  The Special Liquidators are responsible for putting in place a liquidation process which fulfils their obligation under the IBRC Act and where applicable the Companies Acts.

The protocol which is in place for the disposal of the IBRC assets is guided in a specified manner as the Special Liquidator will only be holding the assets for a limited period of time.  Any assets that are not sold to third parties for a value higher than the independent valuations will be sold to NAMA at that price.  Assets that are transferred to NAMA will then be subject to the protocol according to the NAMA Act 2009.</p><p>  It is the objective of NAMA in any loan sale to achieve its commercial mandate of obtaining the best financial return on behalf of the State.

The register was developed using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue's own databases, the Household Charge database from the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), Non-Principal Private Residence Charge data, Private Residential Tenancies Board data, information from the Department of Social Protection, and data from utility companies.  As I previously indicated to the House, the Register was used to issue LPT correspondence to property owners.  I am advised that there are a number of possible reasons why property owners who registered for and paid the Household Charge did not receive a LPT Return.  These include:</p><p>- The version of the Household Charge database that was used to create the LPT Register was updated to January 2013.  Properties which were added to the database after this date would not have been provided to Revenue.  Revenue now has a more up-to-date version of the Household Charge database and will be using that to refresh the LPT Register in due course.</p><p>- The Household charge database included properties not liable for LPT - for example, bedsits - which were not added to the LPT Register.</p><p>- Where a property was identified as being in the ownership of a local authority or approved housing body, these were excluded from the general issue of LPT Returns to property owners.</p><p>- Returns were issued to the owner's address held on Revenue's system. In some cases this may have been different to the owner's address recorded on the Household Charge database.</p><p>- In some cases it was not possible to identify the relevant owner of the property from the Household Charge database.  For example, in some instances the charge on a property was paid using a payment card in a different name, in which case the data supplied to Revenue was the payer's name, not the owner's.</p><p>  Given the complexity of the process of developing the LPT Register from scratch through the matching of multiple data sources, it was always likely that in a small number of cases, people would either receive an LPT Return in error or, possibly not receive one at all.  I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners forewarned taxpayers about this.</p><p>  In particular, for those who had not received an LPT Return, Revenue has been highlighting in its extensive media campaign that as LPT is a self-assessed tax, in common with other self-assessed taxes certain responsibilities rest with the taxpayer even where they have not received a communication from Revenue.</p><p>  I have also re-enforced that point to the House on a number of occasions, most recently in my replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 87 (20652/13) and 92 (20686/13) on 1 May, that liable persons who have not yet received a Return from Revenue must still self-assess the amount of LPT due, complete and file their LPT Return, and pay the tax due.  They should contact the LPT helpline 1890 200 255 or they can login to LPT online at <i><i>www.revenue.ie</i></i> and file a return by clicking on the &quot;I have not received a Property PIN&quot; tab.  There is good evidence that people are responding to the message.</p><p>  The process of ensuring that the LPT Register is as accurate and complete as possible will be an ongoing one, given the scale of the task, and will continue beyond the online return filing deadline.  I am satisfied that the continuing work of the Commissioners will ensure that all residential property owners are registered for the tax.</p></reply>

I refer the Deputy also to my detailed reply to similar questions, No. 115 on 27 March (15664/13) and No. 231 on 16 April (16212/13).  Section 10B of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, provides that a permanently and totally incapacitated person is exempt from payment of LPT where the property is occupied as his/her sole or main residence and where he/she has received a personal injury compensation, either from a court or the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, or is a beneficiary under a qualifying trust.</p><p>  Where this exemption does not apply, Section 15A of the Act as amended provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person, as defined within Section 2 of the Disability Act 2005, where the adaptation has been grant-aided or approved for grant aid by a local authority under either of the following: (1) Housing (Adaptation Grants for older people and people with disabilities) Regulations 2007; or (2) Regulation 4 of the Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grants) Regulations 2001.</p><p>  The person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.  The reduction in value is limited to the lesser of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  The relief ends on the sale or transfer of a property that has been adapted, unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property.  Full details are available on<i></i><i><i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i></i><i>.</i></p><p>  If the Deputy wishes, he can supply me with further details in regard to the person in question, so that Revenue can investigate the exact circumstances and revert.

In creating its valuation guidance, Revenue consulted widely with academic and other researchers in the field of property valuation.  Revenue engaged geo-specialist consultants from an academic institution in Ireland to assist in creating the database used for valuation purposes.  In addition to publishing valuation guidance application on its website, Revenue also made the data used in the guidance application available to researchers, businesses and the public.  This enables any interested party to map the average valuations in the Revenue guidance through their own mapping software or spatial analysis tools.  The same data are also available in hard copy paper format for those without internet access.</p><p>  Aside from valuation guidance related statistics, since the launch of the LPT campaign in March Revenue has provided regular updates on returns filed and this type of update will continue.  The Commissioners also expect to be in a position later in the year to make publicly available further information on return filing and payment compliance levels, as well as property valuation patterns on a geographical basis.</p><p>  It is clear to me that Revenue has adopted an open approach to working with academic and interested parties in the implementation of the LPT and I am advised that they will continue to evaluate options for sharing statistics and data as appropriate and feasible over the coming months as the LPT progresses, consistent with ensuring that taxpayer confidentiality is protected.</p></reply>

I disagree that continuing problems are being faced by people in fairly valuing their properties.  Property owners have already filed in excess of 700,000 LPT Returns and have made their self-assessment of the valuation band in the course of filing these Returns.  I am satisfied that the arrangements are working very well and property owners are engaging fully with their LPT obligations.</p><p>  Based on the information provided by the Deputy in this question, it is not possible to provide a definitive reply to the issues raised.  However, the following will be of relevance.  </p><p>  As previously advised, the Revenue Commissioners have provided on their website and in their &ldquo;Guide to LPT&rdquo; a variety of sources to help property owners establish the market value for their residential property.  This includes the Residential Property Price Register as well as other property websites and information from local estate agents and newspapers.  Revenue&rsquo;s online interactive valuation guidance provides average indicative valuations for residential properties, based on the property type, age and location and uses data from the Residential Property Price Index (produced by the Central Statistics Office) to adjust for property price changes.  Given that property prices have broadly stabilised in recent months, any recent changes in values are small, therefore the Revenue valuation guidance offers a very good starting point to identifying current market prices for property owners.  </p><p>  I am further advised that the Residential Property Price Register provides sales prices for residential properties sold since 2010 and is updated regularly, to include more recent sales of properties.  The Property Price Register shows the date of sale and property owners can use this date to judge how useful a sale is in assisting them in valuing their residential property.  Clearly, the more recent the sales details, the better for the property owners in making their self-assessments.  In addition, for the purposes of LPT, properties under &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands, with an initial band of &euro;0 to &euro;100,000 and 18 bands from &euro;100,001 to &euro;1 million with a range of &euro;50,000 in each band.  The first returns were filed in late March and, in the two-month period from then until the end of May, any change in property values in the context of the value band system is extremely unlikely to cause concerns for those early filers who made an honest and reasonable assessment of their property valuation.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware the Relationship Framework with AIB provides that the State will not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the bank or their management decisions.  This framework is published on the Department of Finance website.  I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.  Neither the Central Bank nor the Department of Finance has a statutory function in relation to interest rate decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time. </p><p>  It must be remembered that in order to fund mortgages the bank must borrow at current wholesale and deposit rates which are currently higher than the ECB base rate and the bank must ensure that the rate it lends at is economically sustainable and provides a return for the bank and ultimately the State as its shareholder.  It would not be fair for 2.1 million taxpayers to subsidise 138,000 owner occupier mortgages, especially when the vast majority of these mortgage holders can afford to pay their mortgages.</p><p>  I understand that the Central Bank of Ireland pays attention to the effect of any increases in the standard variable rate on mortgage arrears and would no doubt be concerned if banks were exacerbating their arrears problem and as such impairing their on-going viability, from such actions.</p></reply>

Their &ldquo;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013)&rdquo; includes a wide range of measures designed to identify and target those engaged in the supply or sale of illicit tobacco products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible.  This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, the development of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and within the country.   </p><p>  A key element of Revenue&rsquo;s work against the illicit trade within the country is targeted action in relation to markets, fairs and other locations where illicit products are known to be sold.  This includes high visibility patrols aimed at disrupting the sale or supply of illicit tobacco products at those locations.  In addition, covert surveillance and test purchasing are carried out to gather intelligence, with a view to identifying and prosecuting the suppliers and sellers of illicit products in the areas concerned.</p><p>  This ongoing work is complemented each year by a number of countrywide &ldquo;blitz&rdquo; operations, focused on particular aspects of the illicit trade.  Four operations of this kind were carried out during 2012, resulting in the seizure of 1.9 million cigarettes and over 1 tonne of tobacco, 17 vehicles were also seized in the course of those operations, and 2 arrests were made.</p><p>  There is extensive co-operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.</p><p>  Considerable success is being achieved against the selling of illicit cigarettes and other tobacco products. During 2012, there were 75 convictions, resulting in the imposition of 21 custodial sentences, some of which were suspended, and fines amounting to &euro;153,050.  In addition, there were 57 convictions for smuggling of illicit products, which led to the imposition of 26 custodial sentences, some suspended, and fines totalling &euro;93,550.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are committed to maintaining their extensive programme of action against all stages of the supply chain for illicit tobacco products, and action against the selling of such products, wherever it occurs, will be a particular focus of attention in this work.</p></reply>

The Inter-Departmental Expert Group on the Design of a Property Tax (the &ldquo;Thornhill Group&rdquo;) recommended against allowances for Stamp Duty because such allowances would not be targeted at need, and this recommendation was accepted by the Government.  The LPT legislation provides for a system of deferrals which is targeted at cases of need.  There is provision for deferral of LPT for income stressed households who are meeting high levels of mortgage interest.  Full details of the LPT deferral options can be found in the answer to Parliamentary Question No. 69 of 25 April (Reference No. 19631/13) and on www.revenue.ie.</p><p>  This Government is committed to helping address the problems faced by those that bought homes at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008.  In this regard, in Budget 2012, I fulfilled the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period.  Mortgage holders will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 or if they drew down their mortgage in that period.   The relief is available up to and including the tax year 2017 on the interest paid on qualifying home loans taken out between 1 January 2004 and before 1 January 2013.</p><p>  There are no specific exemptions from LPT for those whose properties are susceptible to flooding.  The LPT is a self-assessed tax and therefore it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  Issues such as a potential liability to flooding would be one of the factors that a property owner would take into account in valuing their property.  Where a property owner makes a valuation in an honest and reasonable manner, that valuation will not be challenged by Revenue in accordance with its normal Customer Service Charter.</p></reply>

The appointment of rent receivers to buy to let properties is a day-to-day operational decision for the Boards and Management teams of the covered institutions.    </p><p>  The covered institutions have provided me with the following details regarding their use of rent receivers. </p><p><b>PTSB</b></p><p>- Permanent TSB has appointed 1 Receiver of Rent (Receiver) in the year to date in respect of Buy-to-Let (BTL) properties. </p><p>- 10 BTL properties (on 1 account) have been affected by this appointment in the year to date. </p><p>- The bank's Receiver Strategy for its BTL portfolio is centred on a case by case analysis.  Appointments are made where it is deemed to be the most appropriate outcome for both the customer and the bank.  The appointment of a Receiver is currently pending on 29 BTL properties (14 accounts).  A forecast for 2013 is not advisable. </p><p>- A Receiver is appointed by the bank and operates as an agent of the borrower, assuming the role of property landlord in many respects.  The Receiver collects rent from the tenant(s) and passes it to the bank, together with attending to any property related issues the tenant may have (in accordance with the Lease Agreement).  The appointment of a Receiver should not negatively impact the tenant(s) as the Receiver effectively steps into the shoes of the landlord.  The appointment is more likely than not to benefit a tenant as maintenance issues/concerns are more more likely to be attended to in a timely manner. </p><p><b>AIB</b></p><p>  In the year to date 2013 the number of rent receivers appointed by AIB in respect of buy to let properties is in the low single digits.  The number of properties affected by these appointments is not tracked as rent receivers are appointed at a customer level rather than on a property basis.  Currently, AIB has no specific targets for the number of rent receivers expected to be appointed over the remainder of 2013.  The appointment of a rent receiver has no impact on the tenants. </p><p><b>BOI</b></p><p>  In our 2012 Annual Report we disclosed a number of 1,100 rent receiver cases.  This included formal appointments in place and appointments pending at end December 2012.  We will give a market update on numbers at the time of release of our interims and cannot speculate for the remainder of 2013. </p><p>- The receiver notifies the tenant of their appointment and requirement to pay rent to the receiver.</p><p>- Any issues relating to the property, e.g. repairs will be dealt with by the receiver.</p><p>- The tenant is not required to leave the property unless the minimum notice period based on their rights as tenants has been provided.</p><p>- <i>The main impact on a tenant is that they pay their rent to the receiver and not to the landlord.  The receiver will write to them to make that clear.  In general the rights of the tenant under his or her lease and under legislation are not affected</i>.</p></reply>

All options will remain available to consumers but those who need help moving to more efficient methods will be supported.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-14a.418.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013051400063#WRH02200"><p>For Local Property Tax (LPT) purposes, a residential property is defined as any building or structure (or part of a building) which is used as, or is suitable for use as, a dwelling.  This is similar to the position for the Household Charge, which applied to a building (including a house, flat, maisonette, or apartment) which was occupied or suitable for occupation as a separate dwelling.   </p><p>  If a residential property is suitable for use as a dwelling but is unoccupied, it is still liable to LPT, which will be calculated based on the valuation of the property.  However, if the property is not suitable for use as a dwelling, it is not liable for LPT.  Where a property owner considers her/his property is not suitable for use as a dwelling, s/he is obliged to notify the Revenue Commissioners as soon as possible after receiving her/his LPT Return.  The owner must also include relevant supporting documentation; for example, an engineer&rsquo;s report.  Based on the information provided by the property owner, Revenue will consider the claim and make a decision on the matter.</p><p>  Section 10(2) of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that a residential property shall be exempt from LPT where it is situated in an unfinished housing estate.  Section 10(1) of the Act defines an &ldquo;unfinished housing estate&rdquo; as a development of two or more buildings that is specified in a list prescribed under section 10(3) of the Act by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for the purposes of the Act.  Section 10(4) of the Act prescribes a range of circumstances to which that Minister shall have regard for the purposes of that section.</p><p>  The Minister for the Environment Community and Local Government has prescribed and published this list, which is set out in the schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013 and was compiled by local authorities utilising the categorisation employed for the purposes of the National Housing Survey 2012.  The Survey was carried out over the course of summer 2012 by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in conjunction with local authorities and the Housing Agency. </p><p>  The categorisation methodology for the survey was different to that which was used in 2011 and which provided the basis for the waiver from the Household Charge.  That earlier categorisation related largely to the level of on-site activity at the time the 2011 survey was carried out and had less to do with the physical character of a development.  The 2012 survey was based purely and objectively on the actual state of completion of a development.  Only developments that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included.  </p><p>  For purposes of preparing the final list of developments to which the exemption from the LPT would apply, local authorities were asked by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to confirm or update the then existing list as appropriate.  I stress that the decision as to whether an estate is on the list of unfinished estates is in the ambit of local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and not in the ambit of the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>  In addition to the above, section 10A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 as amended provides for a temporary exemption of at least three consecutive years from the charge to Local Property Tax (LPT) for residential properties that have been certified as having &ldquo;significant pyritic damage&rdquo;.</p><p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Pyrite Exemption) Regulations 2013, which were signed earlier this month by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, set out the methodology for the assessment of dwellings to establish significant pyritic damage.  The Regulations require that homeowners demonstrate significant pyritic damage in accordance with the recently published standard by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, I.S. 398 &ndash; Reactive Pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1.  This standard provides guidance on the building condition assessment, as well as on the sampling and testing to be carried out to establish the presence of significant pyritic damage.</p><p>  To be eligible for an exemption from the LPT, a homeowner must obtain a certificate, from a competent person, confirming the presence of significant pyritic damage on the basis of a building condition assessment in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 and having regard to the outcome of the testing and classification of the sub-floor hardcore material carried out in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013.  Eligibility for an exemption will be determined by reference to the presence of significant pyritic damage in the relevant property concerned.</p><p>  Conscious of the need to reduce costs to affected homeowners, the regulations provide for the use, where feasible, of the results from testing of the sub-floor hardcore undertaken prior to the publication of I.S. 398-1:2013, to classify the hardcore material if the testing that has already been carried out is in accordance with, or equivalent to, the test methods provided in I.S. 398-1:2013, and this has been validated as such by a competent person.</p><p>  A Building Condition Assessment in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 will be required to be carried out by a competent person irrespective of when the testing is, or was, carried out.</p><p>  A homeowner cannot claim the exemption until the relevant certificate has been issued in respect of the residential property.  He or she should notify the Revenue Commissioners at that stage to claim the exemption.  Special arrangements will apply in respect of 2013 and 2014 to facilitate homeowners in claiming an exemption.  While homeowners who do not have the relevant certificate on the first liability date of 1 May 2013 (liability date for 2013), or by 1 November 2013 (liability date for 2014), will be required to pay LPT for those periods, they will be able to reclaim the tax paid if they obtain the certificate by 31 December 2013 and notify the Revenue Commissioners in writing on or before 31 January 2014.  As an alternative to such retrospective treatment they can opt to start the period of exemption from the liability date following the issue of the certificate.</p><p>  For those properties that are not exempt, LPT is a self-assessment tax so it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  The condition of the property would be one of the factors that a property owner would take into account in valuing her/his property.</p></reply>

The fee for initial registration remains at &euro;90; I am advised by the Teaching Council that this reflects the greater administrative costs associated with initial registration as opposed to annual renewal of registration.  These include acting as a conduit for the Garda Vetting process and determining that applicants' qualifications meet the Council's standards for entry into the profession.  Both fees, as the Deputy may be aware, are substantially lower than for many other professions.</p><p>  The Teaching Council keeps all matters concerning registrants, such as fees, under review. </p></reply>

An enhanced capitation grant is provided to the special schools and special classes for hearing impaired pupils.</p><p>  Pupils in special classes and special schools for hearing impaired children are supported by enhanced pupil teacher ratios of 7:1.  Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support is also provided in these schools and classes, as required.</p><p>  In line with my Department's policy that children with special educational needs (SEN) access appropriate education intervention in mainstream settings where possible, many deaf/hard of hearing pupils are integrated into mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level with the assistance, as necessary, of resource teaching and special needs assistant support.</p><p>  Grant-aid is also provided to schools towards the provision of special equipment for pupils who are hard of hearing, such as sound field systems and radio aids.  My Department also provides funding for a weekly home tuition service whereby tutors visit the homes of deaf and hard of hearing pre-school children and school-going pupils to provide training in Irish Sign Language (ISL) for these children, their siblings and parents.</p><p>  In addition, the Visiting Teacher Service for Children and Young People with a Hearing Impairment is provided by my Department from the time of referral through to third level education.  The Visiting Teacher service provides advice and support to ensure that the needs of children and young people with hearing impairment are met. This service is available at pre-school, primary and post-primary levels.  Specifically, the service works in partnership with parents of pre-school children with hearing impairment, visiting their homes and/or meeting them in groups to inform, advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to their education and overall development and in helping their children to derive maximum benefit from the educational opportunities available.</p><p>  My Department, through the Higher Education Authority (HEA), has established and funds a Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for ISL/English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies.  The course modules deal with issues such as sign linguistics, bi-lingualism and socio-linguistics of sign language.  The course is delivered in seminar sessions/group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment and a project and course design.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has published Policy Advice on the Education of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children in Ireland, which makes a number of recommendations for the improvement of educational provision for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children.  This policy advice is available on the NCSE's website www.ncse.ie.  My Department has established a working group which will consider and implement the recommendations of this report in accordance with available resources.</p></reply>

Taking into account all of the research reviewed and submissions and presentations received, the Anti-Bullying Working Group that produced the Action Plan did not recommend a particular anti-bullying programme, however, they did recommend nine principles that should underpin a schools approach to preventing and tackling bullying.</p><p>  These are:</p><p>A positive school culture and climateA school wide approach</p><p>Effective leadership</p><p>A shared understanding of what bullying is and its impact</p><p>Anti-bullying policies</p><p>Consistent recording of reported bullying behaviour</p><p>Education and training</p><p>Prevention strategies including awareness raising</p><p>Established evidence-based intervention strategies</p><p>  There is space within all subjects at junior cycle level to foster an attitude of respect for all.  Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is particularly relevant to the prevention of bullying and promotion of respect for diversity and inclusiveness at post primary level. The SPHE post primary syllabus allocates time for exploring bullying, as well as the interrelated areas of belonging and integrating, communication, conflict, friendship, personal safety and relationships.  Schools and teachers have discretion as to which parts of the syllabus are taught at different stages of the school cycle.</p><p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle which will be implemented on a phased basis, from September 2014, highlights among its 8 principles - the &quot;well being&quot; of the young people and  &quot;inclusive education&quot;. In the statements of learning it is expected that students will have the skills and knowledge to &quot;take action to safeguard and promote her/his wellbeing and that of others&quot;. Through the skill of &quot;working with others&quot; they will learn to develop good relationships and deal with conflict&quot;. All of these components which are integral to the Framework blend in with the Action Plan and should provide guidance for schools into the future.</p></reply>

The remaining 2 schools were delivered in Co. Offaly. As the entire Programme or Bundle - referred to as Bundle 1 - constitutes a single contract with the PPP provider, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to disaggregate the individual details of all payments in respect of each school. To the extent that it is possible to do so, this has been done.</p><p>  The ongoing unitary charges are a monthly payment due to the PPP Operator for the design, build, finance and operating costs of the schools. Since taking possession of the Bundle 1 of schools in 2010 the Department has paid a total of &euro;21.8m to the PPP Operator in respect of the unitary charges. The target expiry date of the unitary charges for Bundle 1 is 2035. The current value of the unitary charge is &euro;0.76m per month. The charge is subject to indexation annually which occurs generally in September.  Where appropriate, deductions are made monthly for under performance or service malfunction issues from the monthly unitary charges. Where these issues arise they are examined in conjunction with the schools' management authorities. Post completion of the Bundle in 2010, a VAT liability specific to the Portlaoise schools of &euro;4.588m presented and was paid together with ICT development grants to the schools to the value of &euro;627,070. A balance of costs specific to the 2 Portlaoise amounted to just over &euro;32,000 and relate to minor miscellaneous works also arose and was paid. A total of just over &euro;1m was paid in respect of approved variations that arose for the entire Bundle 1 of schools which it is not possible to disaggregate costs between the 4 schools.  </p></reply>

An enhanced capitation grant is provided to the special schools and special classes for hearing impaired pupils.</p><p>  Pupils in special classes and special schools for hearing impaired children are supported by enhanced pupil teacher ratios of 7:1. Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support is also provided in these schools and classes, as required.</p><p>  In line with my Department's policy that children with special educational needs (SEN) access appropriate education intervention in mainstream settings where possible, many deaf/ hard of hearing pupils are integrated into mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level with the assistance, as necessary, of resource teaching and special needs assistant support.</p><p>  Grant-aid is also provided to schools towards the provision of special equipment for pupils who are hard of hearing, such as sound field systems and radio aids.</p><p>  My Department also provides funding for a weekly home tuition service whereby tutors visit the homes of deaf and hard of hearing pre-school children and school-going pupils to provide training in Irish Sign Language (ISL) for these children, their siblings and parents.</p><p>  In addition, the Visiting Teacher Service for Children and Young People with a Hearing Impairment is provided by my Department from the time of referral through to third level education. The Visiting Teacher service provides advice and support to ensure that the needs of children and young people with hearing impairment are met. This service is available at pre-school, primary and post-primary levels. Specifically, the service works in partnership with parents of pre-school children with hearing impairment, visiting their homes and/or meeting them in groups to inform, advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to their education and overall development and in helping their children to derive maximum benefit from the educational opportunities available.</p><p>  My Department, through the Higher Education Authority (HEA), has established and funds a Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for ISL/English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies. The course modules deal with issues such as sign linguistics, bi-lingualism and socio-linguistics of sign language. The course is delivered in seminar sessions/group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment and a project and course design.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has published Policy Advice on the Education of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children in Ireland, which makes a number of recommendations for the improvement of educational provision for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children.</p><p>  This policy advice is available on the NCSE's website www.ncse.ie. My Department has established a working group which will consider and implement the recommendations of this report in accordance with available resources.</p></reply>

The core function of the redeployment panels at primary level is to enable the redeployment of teachers who are surplus in one school to another school that has a vacancy. Under the panel arrangements, the most junior eligible permanent teacher in a school with surplus teaching staff is placed on the panel for redeployment to another school.   Responsibility for running schools on a day-to-day basis is devolved from the patron to the board of management and this was statutorily underpinned by Section 14 of the Education Act 1998.</p><p>  Section 24 of the Education Act 1998 provides that the appointment, suspension and dismissal of teachers are the responsibility of boards of management.</p><p>  Under Circulars 59/2009 (VEC schools) and 60/2009 (all other schools) procedures were agreed relating to both professional competence issues and procedures relating to work, conduct and matters other than professional competence. This agreement was made under the terms of Towards 2016 and the procedures were issued in September 2009.</p><p>  The procedures serve a dual purpose in that they provide a framework which enables schools to maintain satisfactory standards, and for teachers and principals to have access to procedures whereby alleged failures to comply with these standards may be fairly and sensitively addressed.</p><p>  Matters of professional competence are dealt with through a process which allows for informal counselling and the use of internal and external supports such as the Employee Assistance Service and relevant educational support services. Only when the informal procedures are unsuccessful in addressing professional competence issues are the formal stages invoked which may at the end of the process have recourse to disciplinary action (up to and including dismissal).</p><p>  Matters of conduct follow a similarly staged procedure. However, in the cases of serious misconduct at work or a threat to health and safety to children or other personnel in the school the stages outlined above do not normally apply and a teacher may be dismissed without recourse to the previous stages. A teacher may also be placed on administrative leave on full pay pending an investigation and the conclusion of any appeal process.</p></reply>

Following this agreement the CSR (NI) registration cards are recognised as equivalent to the F&Aacute;S Safe Pass registration card. </p><p>  There was also an agreement in place between F&Aacute;S and Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) in the UK to recognise safety awareness registration cards.  However, as of March 2013, the CITB UK have withdrawn this agreement, which they are entitled to do.</p><p>  I am informed that safety awareness training is not regulated under UK legislation.

If the Deputy has concerns or information about any practice in a school which, in his view, constitutes a risk or threat to the safety, health or wellbeing of any pupil, he should, in the first instance bring such information to the attention of the HSE. In addition, I would welcome any further information from the Deputy in relation to this model and any school in which it is being operated whether or not such concerns exist.</p></reply>

There are no decisions or proposals on the table regarding cuts in child benefit.</p><p>  Research shows that high quality pre-school education delivers lasting benefits in terms of better academic attainment and socio-behavioural outcomes, particularly for children from minority groups and low-income families. The evidence is that it can help close the gap in social development and literacy and numeracy achievement between children from socially advantaged and disadvantaged backgrounds.</p><p>  Based on this, I declared my support in principle for an extension of the universal free pre-school year. However, I also acknowledged that, given the current fiscal climate, it would be necessary to consider how such an expansion could be financed and called for a debate on how this might be done.</p><p>  In the interim, I believe we could, at a much smaller cost, transform the quality of education being delivered under the free pre-school year. Research evidence shows that just attending pre-school predicts improved educational attainment by the age of 14. However, the research also indicates that the quality of that pre-school education is a further predictor of the levels of attainment children can reach by the same age. </p><p>  I believe that, in a short period and with limited additional resources, we could put in place the frameworks and supports needed to up-skill our pre-school leaders and assistants, review and develop the mandatory system of inspections for all pre-school settings, and fully implement the Aistear curriculum framework in pre-schools.</p><p>  In the meantime, it is worth noting that this Government has continued to fulfil the Programme for Government commitment to protect the existing year of free pre-school.</p></reply>

This Request For Tender (RFT) also outlined the qualifying criteria for specific paper quality and sizes, nationwide delivery to hundreds of different public bodies, provision of a dedicated website and various environmental conditions. </p><p>  In addition to the criteria above, any interested parties were invited to tender their best prices for the full range of these contract envelopes. </p><p>Following a full evaluation of all the tenders received, the contract was awarded to Koverto Envelopes Ireland Limited, and not the company named by the Deputy in this Parliamentary Question, as they offered the most economically advantageous tender which included the lowest prices.

The inspection of petrol stations is carried out by a team of specialist inspectors from within the &quot;ADR&quot; Compliance unit of the HSA, who also enforce Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road legislation.  These inspectors have received specialist training in relation to management of risks and enforcement of relevant legislation at petrol stations, generally supplied by the UK Association for Petroleum and Explosives Administration (APEA) who run such courses for a range of stakeholders in the UK, including regulators, designers, local authority fire services, and petrol station operators etc.  A specialist bespoke training course in LPG installations at Forecourts was held in the HSA and attended by ADR inspectors in 2012.  ADR inspectors also attended a seminar last year organised by the Irish branch of the APEA, at which a range of Irish stakeholders, including Fire Officers, operators of petrol stations, etc., attended.</p><p>  As part of its on-going maintenance of technical expertise in this area, the HSA maintains a corporate membership of the APEA, which includes a supply of regular information bulletins and technical information relating to petroleum storage.

Therefore, parliamentary staff in the Houses of the Oireachtas who meet the criteria of the Unfair Dismissals Acts are covered by the protections of the Acts.  The Acts protect employees from being unfairly dismissed by laying down criteria by which the fairness or otherwise of dismissals are judged.  The Acts also provide an adjudication system and then redress for an employee whose dismissal has been found to be unfair.  To qualify to take a case under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, an employee is normally expected to have at least one year's continuous service with the employer, with some exceptions.  Also, the Acts do not generally apply to the non-renewal of a a Fixed-Term contract which has reached the expiry date in the contract or do not apply to the non-renewal of a Specified-Purpose contract which has been completed in line with the contract, provided that this exclusion from the Acts is expressly stated in a written contract of employment.  A claim for redress under the Acts may be submitted initially to either of the adjudicative bodies specified in the Acts i.e. a Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal within six months of the date of dismissal (this can be extended to 12 months in exceptional circumstances).  An application to either a Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal may be made using the Single Complaint Form which is available at website    and the completed form may be forwarded to the Workplace Relations Customer Services, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, O'Brien Road, Carlow.</p></reply>

Issues regarding childcare fall within the remit of my colleague Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Issues regarding employment rights fall within my remit.  The term &quot;au-pair&quot; is not defined in Irish employment rights legislation.  A genuine au pair placement falls outside the scope of the employer-employee relationship.  I am aware that the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has encountered individuals described as &quot;au pairs&quot; who have been found to be domestic employees and as such are fully protected by the State's employment rights legislation.  In these instances NERA investigates employers who are using the term &quot;au pair&quot; to avoid their statutory obligations under employment law.  Where the employment status of an individual is in question, the provisions of the &quot;Code of Practice Determining the Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals&quot; are used in order to determine the employment status of the relationship.  Ireland's body of employment rights legislation protects all employees legally employed on an employer-employee basis in Ireland.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment in another person's home, on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees.  Where a person has concerns that employees may be exploited or are receiving less than their statutory entitlement, the matter may be reported to NERA for investigation.  Cases for redress on matters relating to Employment Equality or Employment Rights legislation can be made on the workplace relations complaint form available from NERA or online at .</p></reply>

This means that there will be a standard State Pension age of 66 years for everyone from 1 January 2014.  The 2011 Act also provided for further changes in State pension age to come into force in 2021 and 2028 when the State pension age will be raised to 67 years and 68 years respectively.  With regard to retirement ages in employment, there is no statutory retirement age for employees in the private sector in Ireland.  A contract of employment will generally contain a retirement age but this is a matter of contract between the relevant parties.  The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has made rulings in a series of age-discrimination cases concerning Directive 2000/78/EC, which prohibit discrimination in employment and occupation on various grounds, including age.  The CJEU has clarified that mandatory retirement ages may be set down if, within the context of national law, they are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim.  Directive 2000/78/EC is principally given effect in national law by the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2011, which come within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Alan Shatter.</p><p>  With regard to the extension of contracts, the Employment Equality Acts currently permit an employer to offer a fixed-term contract to a person over the compulsory (contractual) retirement age for that employment.  As matters currently stand for those employees who are obliged by their contract of employment to retire at 65 years but will not receive the State pension until 66 years, the Department of Social Protection have indicated that, in terms of financial supports, social welfare benefits will continue to be available to the age of 66 for those who are contractually obliged to leave employment.  Also, existing legislation provides that jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66, subject to the person having paid 156 or more qualifying contributions and satisfying the general scheme conditions.</p><p>  The Department of Social Protection, which has lead responsibility for the State pension and pension age policy, is chairing an inter-Departmental Group on Working and Retirement issues, on which my Department is represented.  That Department organised and chaired a Working and Retirement Forum in Croke Park last December, at which a range of stakeholder groups discussed, amongst other matters, issues related to the alignment of mandatory retirement age practices with the new State pension age.  The Group is currently considering the issues highlighted at the Croke Park Forum and is preparing preliminary proposals in this regard.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s exports to China have expanded very significantly in recent years to the extent that Ireland now has a healthy trade surplus of over &euro;1.7 billion with China, a dramatic turnaround from the position in 2007 when we had a trade deficit of over &euro;2 billion with that country.  Ireland&rsquo;s total exports to China have increased by over 40% since 2007 and our services exports have increased by 73% in that time.  The Chinese market has been a strong performer in the Government's strategy to expand and diversify our exports.  In 2011, the latest year for which full figures for both goods and services trade are available, Irish total exports to China were more than &euro;4.77 billion with a significant level, over half, being Services exports.  Ireland's services exports to China have grown steadily over recent years and in 2011 reached their highest level to date of &euro;2.4 billion.  Details of Goods and Services trade with China are given in table below.</p><p>A number of Ministerial-led Trade Missions to China have taken place, both this year and last.  I will also be leading a further trade and investment mission to China later this year.  Ministers Cannon, Coveney and Quinn have travelled to China and last year also saw a Taoiseach led Mission to China, in which I participated.  The Taoiseach led mission to China was preceded by the visit to Ireland by the new Chinese President, Xi Jinping.  This visit further enhanced ties between the two countries.  As a result of Xi Jinping's visit to Ireland and subsequent Trade Missions, there have been several Memoranda of Understanding agreed between our two countries in areas such as Science, Innovation, Trade in International Services and Investment.</p><p>The Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy is developing initiatives to open new markets and increase the penetration of Irish business in existing markets.  China has been identified as a key high-growth and high-potential market for Ireland, and the local market team which reports to the Export Trade Council is implementing a market plan for China.  This will continue to build on the excellent bilateral relations that exist between our two countries, to further enhance our trade, investment, education and tourism links with China.</p><p>In recognition of the importance of our partnership with China, Ireland has, in addition to the Embassy in Beijing, a Consulate General in Shanghai which is a key commercial centre.  Enterprise Ireland is co-located with both the Embassy and the Consulate General.  China is one of a number of countries with which Ireland has a Joint Economic Commission.  The last meeting of the JEC took place in Dublin in October 2012.  JEC's provide an opportunity for intensive bilateral discussions on a range of issues that have the potential to deepen our economic and trade engagement.</p><p>Trade Table</p><p><table><tr><th></th><th></th><th>Merchandise<div>&euro; m</div></th><th></th><th>Services <div>&euro; m</div></th><th></th><th>Total <div>&euro; m</div></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Total China (including HK and Macau)</td><td>Exports</td><td>Imports</td><td>Exports</td><td>Imports</td><td>Exports</td><td>Imports</td><td>Total Trade (Imports &amp;amp; Exports)<div>&euro; m</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>1,989</div></td><td><div>5,169</div></td><td><div>1,414</div></td><td><div>272</div></td><td><div>3,403</div></td><td><div>5,441</div></td><td><div>8,845</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>2,325</div></td><td><div>4,275</div></td><td><div>1,625</div></td><td><div>682</div></td><td><div>3,950</div></td><td><div>4,957</div></td><td><div>8,907</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>2,330</div></td><td><div>2,879</div></td><td><div>1,648</div></td><td><div>317</div></td><td><div>3,978</div></td><td><div>3,196</div></td><td><div>7,174</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>2,407</div></td><td><div>2,756</div></td><td><div>1,943</div></td><td><div>411</div></td><td><div>4,350</div></td><td><div>3,167</div></td><td><div>7,517</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>2,330</div></td><td><div>2,714</div></td><td><div>2,444</div></td><td><div>325</div></td><td><div>4,774</div></td><td><div>3,039</div></td><td><div>7,813</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>2,167</div></td><td><div>2,865</div></td><td><div>*</div></td><td><div>*</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>*Country specific Services trade data for 2012 will be available in Q3 2013.</p></reply>

The enterprise development agencies under the aegis of my Department are at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs across all our regions, including the Longford/Westmeath area.  Against this policy background, and as previously outlined to the Deputy in my reply to Question No. 292 on Tuesday 18 December 2012, I consider that it is not practicable or effective to establish jobs task forces, except in exceptional circumstances, having regard to the State's current limited resources.  In 2012, 1,557 people were employed on a full time basis in Enterprise Ireland (EI) client companies in Co. Longford (an increase of 46 from 2011) and 2,352 people were employed on a full time basis in EI client companies in Co. Westmeath (an increase of 171 from 2011).  In 2012, &euro;1.33 million was paid by EI to companies in Co. Longford and &euro;1.01 million was paid to companies in Westmeath for job creation and retention and business development purposes.  To date in 2013, EI has held/launched: An Export Awareness Event in Athlone through its new Potential Exporters Division and a Call for Proposals under the Midlands Competitive Feasibility Fund.  Nine applicants &ndash; including one from Longford and four from Westmeath - were successful in winning funding and are currently progressing with their start-ups.  This new Fund provides funding of up to &euro;25,000 per project.  The 2013 New Frontiers Programme is currently underway.  14 start-up companies participated in the 2012 Programme receiving targeted financial support of &euro;15,000 per start-up.</p><p>  For IDA Ireland, the key sectors of focus for the midlands Region are Life Sciences, Information and Communications Technologies and High Value Services Activities.  The Region currently facilitates the presence of a large number of multinational companies who have invested over the years, span multiple sectors and employ significant amounts of people.  In addition to attracting new Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), IDA also works closely with its existing client companies with a view to getting them to upgrade and consolidate their existing businesses.  Longford and Westmeath County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) can, subject to certain eligibility criteria, also support individuals, firms and community groups employing less than ten people, provided that the proposed projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability.  In 2012, Longford CEB paid out over &euro;250,000 in grant assistance to 31 projects and 585 people participated in Longford CEB assisted training courses, while Westmeath CEB paid out over &euro;460,000 in grant assistance to 36 projects and 718 people participated in Westmeath CEB assisted training courses.</p><p>  An important action, in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 is the creation of a First-Stop-Shop at local level for the support of small and micro business will bring local enterprise support into an integrated national network of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) delivering enterprise policy to the highest standards, offering seamless progression for small business with potential to the existing national programmes run by EI, such as the dlands Competitive Feasibility Fund.  Pending the introduction of the LEOs, Longford and Westmeath CEBs will continue to support Enterprise Development in their areas and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development at county level.  As the Deputy will also be aware, my Department recently introduced two targeted National Schemes to support an additional flow of credit to SMEs; namely the croenterprise Loan Fund and the Credit Guarantee Scheme.  These schemes will support business investment, job maintenance and job creation around the country. Work on facilitating access to finance for all viable businesses remains a priority under Action Plan for Jobs 2013.</p></reply>

The proposed National Step Change Initiative is intended to position Ireland's Manufacturing Sector for growth and will involve actions at both the level of the firm and also in terms of enhancing the wider business environment.  Specifically,  it is envisaged that work will be undertaken on enhancing productivity; strengthening the international reach of companies; strengthening innovative capabilities and developing connections (including enhancing sub-supply opportunities); and strengthening cross-sectoral collaboration.  A wide range of actions to drive this Step Change are recommended in the Strategy and these involve initiatives by the Development Agencies and other bodies.  Key Actions have been incorporated into the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs 2013, with specific timelines for delivery.  My Department will be to the fore in driving the actions and we will be assisted by the Manufacturing Development Forum, which provided valuable advice and insights into the development of the Strategy and which will continue to assist the process.  In relation to the medical devices industry, which has a thriving indigenous base, in addition to the multinational companies located here, I am very conscious that sub-supply opportunities in that sector represent a significant benefit to be pursued.  I would also like to record, that in addition to developing the Manufacturing Strategy, the Government have also initiated research on the specific skills needs of the Manufacturing Sector up to 2020, and this work was completed recently by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and Forf&aacute;s.  That report identifies what needs to be done regarding training and skills development for the sector.  A wide range of recommendations are made and work is already underway to address some of the recommendations in that report.  I am confident that all these ambitious actions will be pursued by the relevant parties and we will succeed in reinvigorating the Manufacturing Sector in Ireland and enhance its job creation potential in the years ahead.  </p></reply>

The relief under Section 472A, known as the Revenue Job Assist scheme, allows qualifying employees, in addition to their normal tax credits, to claim certain income deductions, including additional deductions for qualifying children, for the three year period after taking up employment.  Section 88A provides an associated tax incentive for employers.  Employers may claim a double deduction in computing the profits of the trade or profession in respect of the first three years wages paid to qualifying employees.  This double deduction may also be claimed in respect of the employers PRSI contribution on such wages.  In order to qualify for the scheme, an individual must be unemployed for at least 12 continuous months prior to the date of commencement of the employment.  They must also be in receipt of certain payments from the Department of Social Protection or signing for PRSI credits.  Time spent on certain F&Aacute;S courses and employment schemes, as well as time spent in prison can count towards the &lsquo;unemployed for 12 months' condition.  Employment under an employment scheme or similar which is directly supported by way of a grant from public funds is precluded from being supported by Revenue Job Assist on the basis that it is already grant-aided from public sources.</p></reply>

All welfare customers paid through the post office network are paid in cash.  This is an inherently expensive means of paying customers.  This approach is inefficient, costly and imposes security risks on customers and staff alike who handle, distribute and receive these monies.  The Government needs to move to more modern approaches for distributing these vast sums of money to customers weekly.  The current contract with An Post expires at the end of 2013.  In this context, the Department is undertaking two public procurement competitions for the delivery of welfare payments and will provide for progression over time from cash to electronic payment methods.  The first procurement for over the counter cash services for social welfare customers commenced in December 2012 and is now well advanced.  This will replace the existing service contract with An Post and will ensure continuity in the delivery of cash payments to the Department's almost 1 million cash payment customers.  I anticipate a contract for these services will be signed by the summer and will provide similar services to customers to those they currently enjoy.  In addition, and to further support the migration towards electronic payments, the Department will be procuring an ePayment solution(s) to complement the existing facility to make payments directly into customers&rsquo; accounts in financial institutions. It is anticipated that notification regarding this procurement will issue by end June 2013.  Public sector contracts for the supply of products and services are generally subject to a competitive tendering process.  This ensures that the taxpayer receives value for money and ensures that all potential suppliers are given the opportunity to put forward the most efficient, effective and competitive solutions for consideration and evaluation.  The award of public sector contracts with a significant financial value is subject to various EU Directives.  Because of the financial value of this particular service, the Department was required to publicly invite tenders for the new contract to deliver social welfare payments when the current contract with An Post expires at the end of this year.</p><p>  I am conscious of the important role of the post offices around the country, notably the extent to which it is now a one-stop shop where people can pay bills, purchase mobile phone top ups, use the passport application facility, pay local property tax and carry out a range of banking and other financial services.  The Government has stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

However, in the course of Budget 2013, the Government had to make some very difficult decisions and in order to protect those core weekly social welfare payments, we had to look very carefully at other additional  payments such as the respite care grant.  As a result, the grant was reduced by &euro;325 to &euro;1,375 per annum.  I am very much aware that this reduction had implications for carers and their families.</p></reply>

The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department.  The second is the school meals local projects schemes through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.  The Government has allocated an additional &euro;2 million for the school meals programme in 2013, providing a total allocation of &euro;37 million.</p><p>  Priority for funding is given to schools which are part of the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills&rsquo; initiative for disadvantaged schools, &lsquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rsquo; (DEIS).  The Department has written to approximately 170 DEIS schools requesting expressions of interest in participating in the scheme for the coming school year. To date, some 75 schools have expressed an interest in participating in the scheme. The Department is currently assessing these applications in determining the most appropriate method of distributing the additional funding for the 2013/14 school year.</p><p>  The Department also contacted a further 11 schools/groups who had already made an application to join the scheme. These schools were invited to participate in the scheme for the remainder of the current school year. One group, a School Completion Programme in Bray, Co. Wicklow, has accepted and will be participating in the scheme during May and June 2013.  This programme will provide a food club for children attending St. Fergal&rsquo;s Senior National School in Ballywaltram, Bray, Co. Wicklow. It is expected that the remaining 10 schools will join the school meals scheme from September 2013. </p></reply>

It was for that reason that the Government last year adopted the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy with a view to giving greater public recognition to carers and their work.  </p><p>  Carers receive significant income supports from my Department so that people can continue living at home.  Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years.  In 2013 it is estimated to be &euro;776 million compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.  The expenditure on carers in 2012 included: &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance; &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit; &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and; &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance. </p><p>  Carers also receive a free travel pass at an annual cost of &euro;6 million and carers who reside with the care recipient are eligible for the household benefits package at an annual cost of approximately &euro;30 million.  The revised rate of the respite care grant of &euro;1,375 will still be more than what it was in 2006 when the rate was &euro;1,200.</p><p>  The respite care grant is paid to more than 70,000 people each year, with some 5,000 people in receipt of more than one grant as they care for more than one person.  Almost 54,000 people are in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance and 27,000 in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  There are also 1,700 in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  Some 5,000 carers not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment also receive the grant.  </p><p>  The supports to carers from my Department are among the highest rates of income support in Europe. A person getting certain qualifying payments and also providing full-time care and attention to another person can keep their main social welfare payment and receive a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance as well. The half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance was protected in Budget 2013.  </p><p>  The respite care grant is available to all full-time carers regardless of their means while the income disregard and means test for carers allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system. A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of  up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance while a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.  Carers are entitled to an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person and a respite care grant for each care recipient.</p><p>  The other issues raised in the submission are the responsibility of the Minister for Health and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

Education sector host organisations may submit applications from 1st August to 6 December 2013 for placements for the academic year 2013/14.  These closing dates have been chosen to ensure that interns can complete their internship prior to the summer holiday period, that is no later than 27th   June, 2014.   These dates will be clearly advertised on the home page of the JobBridge website later this month thereby giving several months advance notice to potential host organisations in the education sector.</p><p>  With regard to the issue of displacement, the recent independent evaluation of JobBridge launched by myself and the Taoiseach on 1st  May found that any such scheme inevitably has some element of displacement but that, based on reported instances, displacement of existing paid jobs by JobBridge internships occurs in only a very small number of cases and accounted for just 3% of the overall number of placements within the organisations responding to the survey.  I am satisfied that the Department&rsquo;s monitoring and control measures are addressing displacement where it is occurring.  More than 2,000 monitoring visits have taken place to-date and I am pleased to say that 97% of those visits found the internships to be operating satisfactorily.  Remedial action has been taken in cases of non-compliance.</p><p>  If any individual suspects any potential abuses of the Scheme including displacement there is a dedicated support facility on the Contact Us page of the JobBridge website.  All such matters will be fully investigated.</p></reply>

In other cases PPS Numbers are issued following a controlled allocation procedure which takes approximately 20 minutes and involves personal attendance at one of the Department's PPS Number allocation centres, the completion of a written application form, the submission of appropriate identity documents and the proving of identity.</p><p>  In circumstances where a person is not resident in the State, but requires a PPS Number, s/he, or someone acting on his or her behalf, must apply by post to the Department submitting the required documentation.   The Department processes some 17,000 of these applications annually. The application referred to was received in my Department on the 2nd of May. </p><p>  It normally takes between 3-4 weeks to finalise the allocation of such PPS Numbers. The vast majority of such requests are for reasons such as probate or property purchase.  However some requests are from individuals who are employed outside of the State by an Irish employer and require a PPS Number in that context. Where these requests are identified, they are given priority by the Department. Apart from these, requests are dealt with in the date order in which they are received. </p></reply>

To illustrate this, in 2011, social transfers reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children from 51 per cent to 16 per cent; this is amongst the best performance of all member states in the EU. </p><p>  The assessment finds that households with children lost around 1 per cent of disposable income, slightly more than the average loss of 0.8 per cent.  This reflected the reduction in child income supports (child benefit and back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance) and the impact of the reduction of the earnings threshold for recipients of the One Parent Family Payment (OFP) from &euro;130 per week to &euro;110 per week (which was announced in a previous Budget).</p><p>  However, the analysis did not, for technical reasons, take into account the additional &euro;20.75 million which was provided for services for low income children, including an Area Based Approach to Child Poverty, school meals and after-school child care.  </p><p>  In this regard, Budget 2013 contained a measure to provide 6,000 additional after-school child care places to people who have been long-term unemployed or were former recipients of OFP and who have received a job offer or significantly increased their part-time hours. The provision of good quality, affordable child care is one of the most important ways in which we help people get back to work.  In the first phase, up to 500 child care places are being made available in seven local offices: Tralee, Mullingar, Dundalk, Cork City, Finglas, King&rsquo;s Inn and Limerick City (Dominic Street).  </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s priority in Budget 2013 was to maintain the basic weekly rates of social welfare income support payments including the personal weekly rate OFP and this was achieved.  In addition, there were no changes to the family income supplement, fuel allowance and the level of weekly increase payable for qualified children.</p></reply>

The relocation will take effect from 17 June 2013. In the interim, services in Tramore will continue to operate as heretofore.  A key factor influencing the decision is the objective of ensuring continuity of service in the event of any future staff absences which would otherwise negatively impact on the quality of service.</p><p>  An important factor taken into account in the reconfiguration of services was the good public transport services from Tramore to Waterford, with a frequent bus service passing the existing community welfare service offices in Waterford and the main offices of the Department. </p><p>  There is also the facility for clients who are unable to travel to Waterford, for example due to illness, to phone the community welfare service in Waterford and discuss their case and, if required, the officer may arrange a visit to the client&rsquo;s home</p><p>  The relocation of services coincides with greater integration between the community welfare service and other locally based staff of the Department. This process will be further enhanced by the roll-out of a full Intreo service to Waterford later this year.  It should be noted that currently claims for supplementary welfare allowance are generally processed within a number of days where all the required documentation is in place.</p></reply>

The corresponding allocation to the Citizens Information Board in 2012 was &euro;46.8 million of which some &euro;18.3 million was allocated to MABS and &euro;14.6 million for the Citizens Information Services.</p><p>  The Citizens Information Board is responsible for ensuring that all appropriate governance arrangements are in place in relation to the expenditure of these public funds.  It is essential that this significant amount of public monies is carefully monitored and properly accounted for, in terms of financial accountability, effective performance and excellent delivery of quality services to the customer and taxpayer, who ultimately funds these services. The Board is responsible for ensuring that all appropriate governance arrangements are in place in relation to the expenditure of these public funds.</p><p>  An important element of assessing accountability is through the formal arrangement of Service Level Agreements. These are annual contracts between the CIB and the 96 separate companies, which provide the services for which the Citizens information Board has responsibility, including the 42 local Citizens Information Services and the 53 MABS companies.  These contracts are agreed by the governing board of the Citizens Information Board and cover standard items such as service delivery, governance, financial controls, HR practices, reporting, evaluation, monitoring etc. This enables the Board to ensure that excellent service and best value is achieved across the wide range of services it provides.</p><p>  With regard to the 2013 Agreement the CIB met with the representative forums of MABS and CIS to discuss issues raised. To date, some 40 CIS companies and 19 MABS companies have signed the contract and are fully compliant with the governance and accountability requirements. </p><p>  The Citizens Information Board is engaging with the remaining companies to resolve outstanding matters and following consultation with the MABS and CIS network is bringing forward a longer term contract to govern the period to end 2016.  I am confident this will secure the agreement of all and would like to assure the Deputy that there is no risk to service delivery and all parties are fully engaged in ensuring that the excellent service to those most in need continues as required.</p></reply>

Already clients are seeing the benefits of the integrated decisions process in pilot offices in terms of shorter decision times and in the reduced recourse to supplementary payments in offices where integrated decisions are in operation.  </p><p>  More importantly the service model is focused on existing clients to prepare for and access work opportunities. As part of this approach, the clients are asked to sign a &lsquo;social contract&rsquo; with the Department.  The client acknowledges their responsibility to work to secure employment at the earliest possible opportunity, on the understanding that failure to adhere to those undertakings may result in the reduction or withdrawal of income support payments.</p><p>  To support the client in this endeavour, the most significant elements of the Intreo approach are: </p><p>  i) Profiling of clients to inform the approach taken to activation (e.g. training, work experience etc)</p><p>  ii) Early engagement with clients through group engagement sessions &ndash; this informs clients of options and services available to them</p><p>  iii) One to one interviews with case managers to support the client develop and follow a Personal Progression Plan and to assist the client to access activation and employment opportunities.</p><p>  INTREO is also refocusing the Department&rsquo;s relationship with employers with a range of events at national and local level to increase the Department&rsquo;s engagement with employers and to increase their recruitment of employees from the Live Register.</p></reply>

The estimated expenditure on child benefit in 2013 is around &euro;1.9 billion and it is currently paid to around 611,000 families in respect of some 1.16 million children. </p><p>  The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, can be an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. The social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment. Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household&rsquo;s income situation.</p><p>  Achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness and the efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes can be achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and its report on this issue was published in February.</p><p>  This report makes important recommendations on how child benefit could be maintained as a universal payment while reforming the current system of child and family income supports so as to better target those who need these supports most. Given the range of complex issues involved, including fiscal, operational and legal considerations, as well as the implications for reforms in terms of child poverty and employment incentive outcomes, the Government has made no decision at this time on the core recommendations of the report.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the report will now contribute to the policy debate on the matter. In considering the proposals to reform the structure of child and family income support payments, including the balance between income supports and services, such as childcare, I expect that Government will also take into account further work by the Advisory Group on the issue of social protection and taxation supports for working age persons and more general developments in the budgetary and fiscal situation. </p><p>  The provision of childcare services, such as those supported by the Early Childhood Care and Education scheme, is primarily a policy matter for my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Frances Fitzgerald T.D.  However, any proposal to fund additional childcare services from cuts to the child benefit scheme would require a Government decision within an overall budgetary context on which no indications can be given at the present time.  </p></reply>

Details of expenditure for Gaeltacht areas in general are available in the various annual reports published by my Department and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.    While expenditure under these programme areas takes place throughout the Gaeltacht, it is not possible to give a county-by-county breakdown of that expenditure. For example, a number of my Department's Gaeltacht programmes are delivered through agencies and other intermediary bodies that operate across county boundaries and in respect of which there is no detailed breakdown held by my Department on a county basis. In addition, groups and organisations that receive grants directly from my Department are not necessarily constituted on a single-county basis. </p><p>  In view of the large volumes of payments and grants involved on an ongoing basis, it is not clear that it would be feasible to compile and collate the breakdown of expenditure sought by the Deputy.

Expert scientific advice available showed that the marine survival of salmon in the North Atlantic has decreased significantly in the previous decades.  It was in this context and to afford every protection to the remaining stocks that the decision to cease indiscriminate mixed stock fishing was taken.  </p><p>  In 2007, I understand that a Salmon Hardship Scheme of &euro;25m was established to address any hardship experienced by affected commercial salmon licence holders.  In addition, I also understand that a further &euro;5m was allocated to a Community Support Scheme which was directed primarily at those communities where commercial salmon fishing had been a well-established activity and where its withdrawal demonstrably impacted on the economic and social fabric.  </p><p>  On foot of the decision to prioritise conservation the harvest of salmon by any means is restricted to those individual stocks of rivers that are judged by the scientific advice as meeting their conservation limits.  Commercial fishing and recreational angling can continue only where there is a scientifically identified exploitable surplus within the genetically discrete stock in each individual river.  Overall the estimate of total Irish spawning salmon over the past decade is only 52% of that in the 1970&rsquo;s.</p><p>  In this regard, and in the mixed stock context pertaining as stocks migrate during the at sea phase of their life-cycle, it is not possible to identify the discrete stocks of salmon emanating from individual rivers which are above their conservation limit.  Such mixed stock fishing activity would be irresponsible in that the possibility of disaggregating those genetically individual river stocks (including stocks from other countries) within a large mixed migratory body of fish is impossible.  To permit targeting of such mixed stocks would expose vulnerable individual river stocks, which are not meeting conservation limits, to indiscriminate and unsustainable harvesting.  Consequently the question of reopening drift net salmon fishing does not arise.</p></reply>

The process identifies a number of categories of applicant depending on, <i>inter </i>alia, the applicant's previous fishing history.  The issuing of licences is administered by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) and decisions will be made in advance of the season which commences on 12 May each year.  Any person over the age of 18 is entitled to apply for a public draft net licence unless they have previously availed of the Salmon Hardship Scheme.  </p><p>  The Salmon Hardship Fund was established in line with the decision to end, on conservation grounds, the mixed stock fishery for salmon at sea.  The scheme provided a payment, based on catch history, to former commercial licence holders who could no longer fish or who chose to withdraw from the fishery.  The beneficiaries undertook to abide by all of the conditions of the scheme including not to apply for a commercial fishing licence in the future.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-14a.911.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013051400067#WRQ01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 399 and 409 together.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware I published the second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) on 28 February last, which reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to a 20% energy savings target in 2020 in pursuit of our EU obligations.  This is equivalent to 31,925 Gigawatt hours (GWh) or a reduction in annual CO2 emissions of around 7.7 Mega tonnes (Mt).  Recognising that Government must lead by example, we are committed to achieving a 33% reduction in public sector energy use by 2020.  </p><p>  The second Action Plan follows a similar approach to its predecessor, identifying realisable but ambitious actions across six areas: Public Sector, Residential, Business, Transport, Energy Supply, and Cross-Sectoral.  The Plan contains 97 actions, each of which will play a part in securing a more sustainable energy future for Ireland.  Of the 97 actions, the following five will play an integral role in the delivery of the national target:  </p><p>  1. In the Public sector, we will introduce a series of obligations on public sector bodies to address consumption, procurement and reporting of energy use.  </p><p>  As part of our Action Plan for Jobs commitments, we will issue in June this year a mandate to public sector organisations with an annual energy spend of &euro;500,000 or more, to go to the market to identify solutions for the delivery of energy reduction services.  In 2010-2011 the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and my Department developed and launched a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system to record each individual public body&rsquo;s progress towards the 33% target.  A database of over 30,000 meters has been established to enable the accurate gathering of public sector data.  This database is being developed with linkages to the National Procurement service and will lead to better procurement of energy supplies for the public sector.  A report on public sector consumption will be published later this year.  </p><p>  2. We will institute a national Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) process to deliver innovative models of retrofitting and financing of energy efficiency measures in the commercial and public sectors.  </p><p>  Work on the National Energy Performance Contracting Policy Framework, which will standardise energy performance contracting in Ireland and provide a robust process for establishing investment-ready projects, is well advanced and the first version of the Framework will be published shortly.  The Framework will be underpinned by an Energy Efficiency Fund, to which Government has already committed &euro;35 million in the 2013 Budget as seed capital. </p><p>  3. We will introduce an appropriate Pay-As-You-Save (PAYS) model for Ireland to replace existing exchequer supports for domestic and non-domestic energy efficiency upgrade measures.</p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to roll out a Better Energy Financing (formerly known as Pay-As-You-Save) energy retrofit scheme for domestic buildings after 2013.  The Better Energy Financing (BEF) model proposes that the current suite of Exchequer funded grants for energy efficiency measures, excluding the low-income housing retrofit programme, will be replaced by a new financing scheme open to the residential and non-residential sectors.  This scheme will allow consumers to secure upfront financing for energy efficiency upgrades, the repayment of which will be funded from savings on their energy bill generated from the retrofit.</p><p>  My Department has put in place a project team to design a replacement retrofit financing scheme under the direction of a Project Board representing key state and industry stakeholders.  Project resources have been drawn from industry experts and elsewhere in the public sector.  It is planned that the design of the scheme will be developed over the coming months and that a public consultation process will be undertaken later this year.  </p><p>  4. The Better Energy programme will deliver energy efficiency improvements across a number of sectors including energy saving targets for energy suppliers.  </p><p>  The NEEAP emphasises the role of market actors in facilitating the delivery of energy savings, with the introduction of energy saving targets for energy suppliers a key measure underpinning the delivery of the 2020 energy saving target.  A move to a market-based programme is a logical step in mainstreaming energy efficiency within the energy supply sector in line with EU ambitions.  </p><p>  To date 18 energy supply companies have signed voluntary energy savings agreements, with a programmatic target of 875GWh for the period 2011-2013.  I am currently considering proposals for the period beyond 2013.</p><p>  5. A Cross-Departmental Implementation Group will soon be established to ensure that all the actions contained in this Plan are delivered.  </p><p>  The Implementation Group, chaired by my Department, has been established and is meeting quarterly to ensure delivery of the actions contained in the NEEAP.  It comprises representatives from a number of key stakeholders who are responsible for leading or supporting the progression of key sectoral actions in pursuit of our NEEAP goals.  The Implementation Group will report to Government regularly on progress.  </p><p>  Should all measures detailed in the plan reach their full potential by 2020 it is estimated that a potential reduction in energy spend across all sectors of approximately &euro;2.36 billion (at 2011 prices) will be realised.  A very significant element of this will be Exchequer savings in the public sector.</p></reply>

The DHDA provides companies in the digital media sector with support to survive and grow.  More than 160 companies have been located at the Digital Hub since 2003.  The Digital Hub&rsquo;s most recent Annual Report (2011) shows that client companies generated a total turnover of &euro;34 million, of which &euro;25 million was in exports and had a total payroll of approximately &euro;30 million, generating payroll taxes of over &euro;12 million.  Many companies previously based there have gone on to notable success and expansion with resulting job creation, including Amazon, Havok, Houghton Miflin, Daft.ie and PopCap.  </p><p>  The Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA) is currently funded by a combination of Exchequer subvention, commercial income and sponsorship.  This year the DHDA will receive an Exchequer subvention of &euro;2.49m.  </p><p>  As part of its overall plans to reduce the number of State agencies, the Government has decided to merge the Digital Hub with Dublin City Council.  While obviously this will result in some annual savings to the Exchequer, it also provides a very good strategic fit for both organisations given their respective clear focus on supporting digital development.  </p><p>  The National Digital Research Centre (NDRC) has been funded since 2007 by my Department through a Concession Agreement, with the aim of translating research-based projects in the digital enterprise sector to market-ready stage.</p><p>  I am informed by the NDRC that ventures set up from its projects have created 250 jobs to date in the digital enterprise sector.  NDRC ventures have received follow-on investment of &euro;16m to date and their market valuation has reached almost &euro;40m.  Support is provided by the NDRC for ventures by way of mentoring and development as well as share capital in some instances.  </p><p>  Following a strategic review of the NDRC last year, I have decided to extend the Concession Agreement, for another 5 years.  Discussions on the details of this are currently on-going between my officials and NDRC Board and management in this regard.</p><p>  I expect that both NDRC and the DHDA will continue to play an important role in assisting Government supporting digital entrepreneurship and increasing overall digital adoption rates in business and the community at large.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, who provide services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Louth, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at www.callcosts.ie.</p><p>  The State can only intervene, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme, to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, NBS services are available within 1 of the 42 Electoral Divisions in County Louth, (Creggan Upper ED 147012).</p><p>  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department has appointed experts to assist it in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be on-going throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.  </p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland, including County Louth as well as all rural areas in Ireland, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity, through public or private sector investment, as outlined in the National Broadband Plan.</p></reply>

This Directive translates elements of the European Efficiency Plan into binding measures on Member States, in response to the Commission&rsquo;s assessment that the EU is unlikely to achieve its energy efficiency target of 20% primary energy savings by 2020 based on the current policy mix. While there are no binding targets in the Directive there are a number of binding measures.  A review of each Member State&rsquo;s progress towards the European 20% objective will take place in 2014.</p><p>  Member States have 18 months to transpose the Directive, with a transposition deadline of 5 June 2014. However, there are a number of policy decisions and reporting requirements to be notified to the Commission in advance of the transposition deadline. The first of these, a report on the indicative national target for energy efficiency, was due by 30 April 2013. This report, confirming Ireland&rsquo;s 20% national target, and sectoral target of 33% for the public sector, was sent to the Commission in advance of the deadline.</p><p>  A series of subgroups have been set up with relevant stakeholders in order to progress the transposition of the Directive, with a formal consultation on the transposition and implementation of the Directive expected over the summer months.</p></reply>

Better Energy Homes provides a financial incentive to private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes.  Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying BER.  </p><p>  The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan and the Programme for Government include a commitment to roll out a Better Energy Financing (formerly known as Pay-As-You-Save) energy retrofit scheme for domestic buildings after 2013.  The Better Energy Financing (BEF) model proposes that the current suite of Exchequer funded grants for energy efficiency measures, excluding the low-income housing retrofit programme, will be replaced by a new financing scheme open to households and commercial operators.  </p><p>  The key benefit to the homeowner of such a financing mechanism is that the scheme will allow them to secure upfront financing for energy efficiency upgrades to their homes, and in the process remove one of the key energy efficiency barriers.  The consumer will also benefit through the creation of a robust quality assurance process that will protect consumers and ensure high-quality workmanship.  </p><p>  My Department has put in place a project team to design a replacement retrofit financing scheme under the direction of a Project Board representing key state and industry stakeholders.  Project resources have been drawn from industry experts and elsewhere in the public sector.  It is planned that the design of the scheme will be developed over the coming months and that a public consultation process will be undertaken in quarter three of this year. </p></reply>

Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Cavan, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at www.callcosts.ie.  Decisions by private operators relating to investment in infrastructure, including the upgrading of telephone exchanges, are taken purely on commercial grounds, having regard to the cost of service provision and the anticipated revenue returns from any such investment.  You will appreciate, therefore, that I do not have a role in this regard.</p><p>The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme.  NBS services are available within 45 of the 93 Electoral Divisions in County Cavan, the list of which is set out below.</p><p>With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department has appointed experts to assist it in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be on-going throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p>I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland, including Bailieboro in County Cavan, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity, through public or private sector investment, as outlined in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p><b>National Broadband Scheme (NBS)</b></p><p><b>Electoral Divisions (ED) covered by NBS in Co.

Motor tax receipts for 2012 were in excess of &euro;1bn. It is estimated that, in order to raise a similar amount from motor fuels, an increase in excise for a litre of petrol and auto diesel in the order of 28-30 cent, inclusive of Value Added Tax, would be required.</p><p>  I have no plans currently to seek to replace the current system of motor tax with additional taxation on motor fuel. In developing any such proposal, I would be conscious that such a move may be simpler to administer; would create a more direct relationship between use of the vehicle and the costs, with potential environmental benefits; and free up staff in licensing authorities, the Courts Service and time spent on enforcement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I have not quantified these benefits in monetary or other terms, and nor have I quantified the potential disadvantages, which include the impact on inflation and economic competitiveness; the higher costs under a pay-as-you-drive system on goods vehicles and other high usage and high mileage vehicles, such as public service vehicles and buses; the other distributional effects, including on those with longer distances to commute; the extent to which this would impact on cross-Border fuel purchasing, further depressing the tax base and requiring a compensatory adjustment, either in further increases in fuel prices or elsewhere in the tax system, to make up the shortfall; the potential forward extent of increased fuel laundering; and the costs and modalities for maintaining a robust and accurate National Vehicle and Driver File to ensure compliance with roadworthiness testing, insurance certification and other traffic controls such as penalty points and fixed charge offences.</p></reply>

The purpose of closed periods is to protect ground and surface water bodies, including drinking water sources, by prohibiting the application of fertilisers when such application poses an unacceptable risk to water courses.  Good agricultural practice involves the application of fertilisers as early as practicable in the growing season in order to maximise the uptake of nutrients by crops and to minimise pollution to water.</p><p>  The closed periods in Ireland were decided following extensive consultation and were discussed with farming bodies and the European Commission at the time.  They extend from 15 October to 12, 15 or 31 January depending on location in the country.

Ireland&rsquo;s priority is the safety of the Irish people and the protection of our environment, including the shared marine environment of the Irish Sea. </p><p>  The UK published its draft Energy National Policy Statement in November 2009, which signalled its intention to construct ten new nuclear power stations at sites judged as potentially suitable. This was subsequently revised in October 2010 when the number of planned stations was reduced to eight, following the dropping of two sites originally proposed for Cumbria, near the existing Sellafield facility.  Since the original announcement in 2009, Ireland has written twice at ministerial level to the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change outlining concerns about potential environmental impacts in Ireland and in the Irish Sea. The key issues of concern include the assessments by the UK of effects on the environment, management of radioactive waste, and the rationale underpinning the proposed justification decision for new nuclear facilities. This engagement at ministerial level has been supported and informed by a continuing dialogue at official level where Irish officials engage, and raise concerns where appropriate, with UK counterparts directly engaged in the development and implementation of the plans. </p><p>  I note the legal proceedings being brought by An Taisce in relation to Hinkley Point and I respect the rights of An Taisce, as an independent body, to take such a course of action. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), in accordance with its statutory advisory role to the Government, was requested by my Department to complete an assessment of the potential radiological impacts on Ireland from the programme of new nuclear power plants in the UK, including the plant at Hinkley Point. This assessment will consider both routine operations and a range of postulated accident scenarios at the plants. I understand that the Report will be completed imminently, and will be made publicly available. I am advised that the RPII will then provide briefings for interested parties. I will consider the position having read the RPII report.</p><p>  Finally, under the EURATOM Treaty the UK was required to satisfy the European Commission that the development at Hinkley Point would not be likely to result in radioactive contamination of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State. In that context, a Commission opinion, issued in February 2012, considered that under normal operating conditions, the discharges of liquid and gaseous radioactive effluents are not likely to cause an exposure of the population in another Member State that is significant from the point of view of health.</p></reply>

The level of capital funding available has decreased significantly in recent years along the lines highlighted in the Medium Term Exchequer Framework for Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016. As a result, capital spending on housing programmes is subject to constraint over the short-term.</p><p>  On 22 February 2013, I announced capital allocations to local authorities under the suite of Grants for Older People and People with a Disability amounting to &euro;42.750 million. In allocating the available funding across all 34 city and county councils I did so in as transparent and as fair a way as possible.  In framing the 2013 allocations, my Department wrote to each local authority requesting details of the numbers and value of grants where work had been approved to commence. Between them, local authorities reported contractual commitments in respect of approved grants totalling &euro;18 million.  This year I allocated local authorities the full amount of their contractual commitments.  The balance of the available funding was allocated on the basis of each authority&rsquo;s share of the new applications on hand in January 2013.</p><p>  In order to deal with any acute or particular difficulty which might arise in the operation of the schemes over the course of the year I have set aside a small capital reserve. I recently approved supplementary allocations totalling &euro;1.2 million for 13 local authorities.  I will consider further applications from local authorities where similar difficulties arise.</p></reply>

It is a key tool of Government in providing supports for the &lsquo;harder to reach&rsquo; in the most disadvantaged areas and communities.  Given the current economic situation and the high level of unemployment, the LCDP is more relevant than ever insofar as it creates employment opportunities and gives those most distant from the labour market the skills to access training and jobs. The Programme has four high level goals focusing on supporting activities that enhance access to services, provides education and lifelong learning supports for individuals, employment supports for individuals and supports for community development activities.</p><p>Goal 3 of the LCDP is the primary goal that delivers employment services. Approximately 40% of the LCDP budget is allocated to the goal, and under it, a range of services are delivered and supported.  These are diverse and range from employment mediation supports, programmes to reduce youth unemployment, actions designed to engage with employers to promote local job opportunities, labour market focused education and training supports, supports for social enterprise, and the delivery of services for individuals who are seeking to set up their own business.</p><p>The Programme is delivered at a local level by the national network of local development companies (LDCs).  Pobal, who manage the day to day operation of the LCDP, have advised that the assessment of the 2013 LCDP Plans of the LDCs is on-going. However, it is anticipated that outputs and outcomes for the LCDP in 2013 will be broadly similar to those achieved in 2012. The total caseload for the programme in 2012 was 47,792 individuals.

Questions concerning the use of Local Property Tax revenue raised in 2013 should be directed to my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move, from 2014, to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised. The remaining 20% of the Tax collected nationally will be re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of General Purpose Grants. It is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources. The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which include adopting the annual budget, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.</p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates. A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.  Specific queries concerning planned usage of future Local Property Tax revenue should be directed to the relevant local authority.</p></reply>

Following an examination of the proposals received, with particular regard to the environmental justification provided, I approved grant assistance last March towards the following pilot schemes:</p><p><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Scheme Name</th><th>Approved Grant </th></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>Woodview, Ennis</td><td>&euro;90,000</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>Boston Cottages</td><td>&euro;60,000</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>Toortane</td><td>&euro;105,000</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>Derrymoyle </td><td>&euro;35,301</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>Jamestown Rue </td><td>&euro;93,000</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>Military Road, Birr</td><td>&euro;39,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>Ballykeeran Big</td><td>&euro;84,500</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>Coolbawn / Ferns </td><td>&euro;14,083</td></tr><tr><td>TOTALS</td><td></td><td>&euro;520,884</td></tr></table></p><p>Proposals for six group sewerage schemes were included in Kerry County Council&rsquo;s request for funding under the Rural Water Programme. However, the proposals did not merit inclusion in the pilot programme on the basis of the environmental justification provided by the Council.  Progress on the selected pilot schemes will be reviewed in due course with a view to deciding how best to proceed with the grant scheme.</p></reply>

In allocating the available funding across all 34 city and county councils I did so in as transparent and as fair a way as possible.  In framing the 2013 allocations, my Department wrote to each local authority requesting details of the numbers and value of grants where work had been approved to commence.  Between them, local authorities reported contractual commitments in respect of approved grants totally &euro;18 million.  This year I allocated local authorities the full amount of their contractual commitments which, in the case of Wexford County Council, amounted to &euro;43,480.  The balance of the available funding was allocated on the basis of each authority&rsquo;s share of the new applications on hand in January 2013.  This brought Wexford County Council&rsquo;s overall allocation to &euro;1,210,764.</p><p>  In order to deal with any acute or particular difficulty which might arise in the operation of the schemes over the course of the year I have set aside a small capital reserve.  I recently approved supplementary allocations totalling &euro;1.2 million for 13 local authorities.  I will consider further applications from local authorities where similar difficulties have arisen.  No such application has so far been received from Wexford County Council.</p></reply>

The <i>AMAI Policy Document on Municipal District Councils</i>, issued in response to the Action Programme, is useful in providing an understanding of the perspective of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland (AMAI).  However, it would be more appropriate and useful for the AMAI to develop sectoral positions and a joint response together with the Association of County &amp;amp; City Councils (ACCC) on matters in relation to the implementation of the Government's Action Programme, as county councillors will have responsibility, from mid-2014 onwards, for the direction of their local authorities both at County Council and Municipal District levels.  In the transition to the system where each county councillor will also be a councillor in respect of a Municipal District, there is a need for a close working relationship between the two Associations at this time.</p><p>  The role that councillors can play in shaping structures and providing input into the implementation of the Government's Action Programme is very important.  I have accordingly established a Working Group for Engagement with Local Authority Representative Associations to provide a direct conduit for input and involvement by both the AMAI and the ACCC in the reform implementation process.  Discussions have taken place with the two associations on several of the issues addressed in the AMAI response to the Action Programme, and these discussions will continue.</p></reply>

Housing policy is therefore predicated on meeting need at a point in time based on household circumstances and not on favouring one tenure option over another through fiscal or other stimuli.  The Government is committed to supporting access to home ownership for lower to middle income households and the current range of paths to home ownership will remain in place in that regard.  Two types of house purchase loan are available from local authorities: standard annuity loans targeted at lower income first time buyers and those under the Home Choice Loan scheme which are available to qualifying middle income first time buyers affected by the &#8220;credit crunch&#8221;.

Recommendations on how to manage the movement of tyres and waste tyres across the border to/from Northern Ireland in order to ensure that waste is properly managed and that data are accurately recorded were also requested. Any recommendations for future changes in this area, including consideration of the establishment of a system of arrangements in accordance with international best practice, will need to be supported by details setting out the necessary regulatory regime, operational requirements, self-compliance issues, information and awareness requirements and other relevant issues. The recommendations should also take account of the recently published North/South study on Waste Tyres.</p><p>  I expect to receive the report from the consultants shortly and once I have considered its recommendations, my Department will make it available for consultation.

No. 326 of 2012), which were given effect following a public consultation process, provide for a ban on the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of bituminous (or &quot;smoky&quot;) fuel inside specified ban areas.  The Regulations introduced some improved and updated provisions that will help to ensure that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of residential fuels.  These are as follows:   </p><p>- most existing smoky coal ban area boundaries were revised to take recent urban development into account;</p><p>- seven new towns were added to the ban from May 2013 - Greystones, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Navan, Newbridge, Portlaoise and Wicklow Town; and</p><p>- a prohibition on the burning of bituminous fuel to complement the established ban on marketing, sale and distribution. </p><p>  The single focus of the previous regulations on prohibiting the sale, as distinct from the burning, of &quot;smoky&quot; coal meant that the burning of such coal inside ban areas undermined the intent and purpose of the ban and the supply of such fuel was known to be facilitated by businesses that had established premises just outside ban area boundaries to serve ban area residents as their main market.  The revised boundaries and prohibition on the burning of smoky coal inside ban areas support the effectiveness of the ban in the areas concerned by restricting such activities and hence closing the loophole.  These updated provisions were broadly welcomed by the EPA, local authorities and the import and supply industry, on the basis that they provide for more effective legislation.  My Department continues to meet regularly with the EPA, local authorities and the industry representatives to discuss the ongoing implementation and enforcement of the Regulations.</p><p>  In the case of new towns that were added to the ban, a lead-in period of eight months was provided to allow local authorities and fuel retailers time to adapt as necessary to the new regulatory requirements in preparation for the switch-over to smokeless fuels.  Following the inclusion of these areas, the smoky coal ban applies in all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people.  This provides for greater consistency in urban air quality standards throughout the State by extending the cleaner air benefits of the ban to all large towns.</p><p>  The Regulations also require that all smoky coal sold outside ban areas for residential use outside those areas must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%.  This compares to a maximum permitted sulphur content of 2% for bituminous coal sold in Northern Ireland. <font color="#333333"> &amp;#8206;</font>Coal bagging operators and certain solid fuel suppliers trading in smoky coal must demonstrate the compliance of their product with the 0.7% sulphur limit and be registered with the EPA.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland has prepared an annual traceability audit system, known as SWiFT 7, for demonstrating compliance.  All retailers who trade in smoky coal must ensure that their suppliers are registered with the EPA and must hold a record to this effect with their supplier's registration number. </p><p>  Despite these regulatory improvements, I recognise that different standards applying to coal between separate jurisdictions presents a continuing challenge for enforcement.  On 6 May I announced that a joint North-South study is being commissioned to examine air pollution from residential smoky coal and to consider the potential policy options to reduce such emissions. <font color="#333333"> </font>A closer alignment of solid fuel policy and legislation on an all-island basis would aid enforcement, eliminate unfair competitive advantage, protect air quality and allow the benefits derived from the ban to potentially be further extended.</p></reply>

These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities.

Where any borrower, either from a local authority or from a private financial institution, is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, they should engage proactively and constructively with the lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution.  The services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service are also available to such borrowers and support is available through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.</p><p>Local authorities have long been the lenders of last resort servicing the housing loans needs of less affluent members of society.  In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears.  Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases.  In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based upon the Central Bank's first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.<br />  To reflect the content of the Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct &ndash; which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt &ndash; my Department issued updated guidance in June 2012 to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association.  This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.  In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, presents borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, including those referred to in the Question, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case.  This process features a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent.  Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices. The introduction of these revised guidelines standardises the approach across the whole sector, introduces a systematic structure to this area and provides borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution.</p><p>Regarding the level of repossessions in the last three years, my Department publishes a wide range of housing statistics which can be found at <i>www.environ.ie.</i>  The total numbers of forced and voluntary repossessions obtained by local authorities in 2010, 2011 and 2012 are set out in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td>Forced</td><td>16</td><td>54</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>Voluntary</td><td>73</td><td>49</td><td>64</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The application is being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation, such as good character and lawful residence, and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.  As well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation as provided for in law is also a major step for the State which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p><p>  I can advise the Deputy that there is a very ambitious target in place to process 70% of all standard non-complex cases within six months of receipt of applications.  The nature of the naturalisation process is such that for a broad range of reasons some cases will take longer than others to process.  It is a statutory requirement that, inter alia, applicants for naturalisation be of good character.  In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.  As a result there will always be a proportion of cases that take longer than the norm to process.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of statistics.

They refer to summonses issued for courts dates in the years in question, rather than the date on which the summons issued.</p><p>Road traffic legislation, which is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, provides that if the fixed penalty notice is paid the driver is liable for the penalty points attaching to the offence.  If the driver does not pay the fixed penalty notice and the case goes before the court, the number of penalty points is automatically doubled in the event of a conviction.  I am informed that when a conviction is recorded in court, the Courts Service electronically provides the Road Safety Authority with details of such convictions.  It is then the responsibility of the Road Safety Authority to ensure that the appropriate penalty points are recorded.  There is no provision in the legislation to allow for a fine in place of penalty points.</p></reply>

Rivalries and feuds which develop on the outside continue inside of prison.  Prison management must ensure that the various factions are kept apart and, as far as possible, that gang members do not have influence over other inmates in the prisons or criminal activities on the outside.</p><p>  Gang members are managed on a daily basis through segregation and separation throughout the prison system.  Membership/allegiance of these criminal gangs fluctuates on a continuous basis with some persons breaking links and others becoming affiliated.</p><p>  I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that a number of initiatives have been introduced with a view to preventing identified gang leaders from conducting criminal activities while in custody and also to prevent them exerting inappropriate influence over other persons.  For example, the security initiatives undertaken by the Operational Security Group (OSG)  have made it more difficult for prisoners to engage in illegal activities while in prison.  These initiatives include the introduction of passive and active drug detection dogs and the installation of airport style security including scanners and x-ray machines.  Core functions of this group include gathering and collating intelligence information on criminal gang members in custody, carrying out intelligence led searches and preventing the flow of contraband (including mobile phones) into the prisons.</p><p>  In addition, there is regular contact between the Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to discuss security issues including the operation of criminal gangs. Garda&iacute; are also provided with reports detailing the release dates of this category of prisoner.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Risk Management of Offenders Group within the Irish Prison Service, which is comprised of Governors of all closed prisons and the Governor of the Operational Support Group, meet on a regular basis to share intelligence and decide in a strategic and collaborative fashion on the placement of leading gang members across the prison estate, having regard to the associated protection issues involved.</p></reply>

Moreover, a Referendum on a proposed Constitutional Amendment to establish a Court of Appeal will take place in the Autumn.  I intend to consult further with interested parties, including colleagues in Government and the judiciary, before deciding on the optimal number of judges to be appointed to the new Court of Appeal and on the future shape of the Supreme Court.

To support the achievement of these aims, the Act provides for the establishment of an independent Charities Regulatory Authority.</p><p>  I am aware of the recent Prime Time programme which reported, amongst other things, on the issue of theft from charity clothing banks.  Theft is an offence contrary to section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  A person convicted upon indictment of theft is liable to imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or an unlimited fine.</p><p>  I am also concerned about the reported practice of some collectors of clothing who convey the impression in their promotional literature that they are collecting on behalf of a charity, when this may not actually be the case.  This may lead some people to donate to such collections in the belief that they are supporting a charity and helping to alleviate hardship. This is unfair both to donors whose intention in donating such items is to help those in need, and to bona fide charities that may lose out on donations as a result. It is an offence under section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 to make gain or cause loss to others by deception.</p><p>  In addition to these existing measures under the Criminal Justice Acts, while the Charities Act 2009 does not deal directly with the regulation of Irish charity clothing banks or collections, it does contain measures aimed at preventing the abuse of charitable status. Under section 46 of the Charities Act, it is an offence for an organisation that is not a registered charity to describe itself or its activities in such terms as would cause members of the public to reasonably believe that it is a charitable organisation. This section cannot be commenced until the statutory Register of Charities, also provided for under the Charities Act, is in place.</p><p>  While further implementation of the Charities Act and creation of the Register of Charities have been delayed for financial reasons, the Government remains committed to progressing the implementation of the Act and putting in place a dedicated regulatory framework for charities in line with the provisions of the Act. My Department has been examining how best this can be done in the current financial climate.  As part of this work, my Department recently undertook a consultation on key issues, including the creation of the Register of Charities. The submissions received are currently being reviewed and I look forward to publishing the results in due course and giving a further indication of the Government's timeframe for the introduction of an operational Charities Regulatory Authority and full implementation of the Charities Act 2009.</p></reply>

(d) undertaking monitoring, observation or advisory duties&rdquo;.</p><p>  While no UN Security Resolution is required to underpin a deployment of Defence Forces Personnel for training purposes, the training of the Malian Defence and Security Forces is specifically provided for in relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions 2071 (2012) and 2085 (2012). </p></reply>

Under this policy the general public are permitted and welcome to use forest lands for non-commercial, informal, recreational purposes subject to visitors taking due care for their safety, having consideration for other forest users and respecting the nature of Coillte's commercial operations. This policy is applicable to the individual user and small user groups.  </p><p>  Coillte has also advised that larger groups, generally in excess of 50 people and usually in the form of pre-organised events, are also welcome under permit available upon request from the local forest manager and that a nominal charge usually applies in such cases to cover licence administration and other costs.  The requirement for a permit for such large organised groups allows for the checking of insurances, completion of a HIRA (hazard identification risk assessment), assessment of environmental impacts and other related issues such as parking requirements etc.</p></reply>

It also provides for the sharing of expertise and the exchange of officials, designed to provide assurances to the Chinese authorities of the integrity of our food production systems, our high veterinary and food safety procedures and of our technologically advanced agri and seafood sectors, thereby enhancing trade and facilitating increasing exports.</p><p>  This MOU builds on an original MOU agreed in September 2006 and on the Action Plan on Mutual Cooperation between both Ministries which I signed on 28 May, 2011, and which provided for Chinese officials to undertake work placements in the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine (DAFM) and in the Marine Institute in addition to undertaking educational courses in agrifood related areas.</p><p>  Since the signing of the renewed MOU in April, 2012, there has been a significant increase in the number of political and trade related visits from China to Ireland. My Department hosted seven inward delegations from China in 2012, including three Vice Ministerial visits, one inspection visit and visits by senior Chinese officials including a joint study visit by EU and Chinese officials as part of their cooperation agreement. Two further Chinese Vice Minister&rsquo;s will visit Ireland in May and June. </p><p>  There have been two work placements in the Marine Institute in 2012 and 2013, during which important joint research based work was undertaken, while Teagasc is currently hosting a Chinese official, also undertaking research work. A Chinese official successfully completed an Irish web based veterinary certificate course in 2012 in addition to undertaking a work placement in the Department. A further work placement was also facilitated in my Department related to the dairy sector. On an annual basis, my Department also facilitated 4 study visits by Chinese officials.</p><p>  Of particular significance is that in the period 2010-2012, Irish exports to China of food beverages, seafood and other agri related products have increased from &euro;167m to &euro;323m, an increase of 93%.  </p><p>  I am therefore very pleased that the MOU signed during my trade mission to China in April 2012 has been a sound basis for developing a mutually beneficial relationship between China and Ireland in the agriculture and fisheries sectors.  </p></reply>

The central database can be used to supplement the checks carried out by Department staff in the two premises that slaughter equine animals currently.

AIM is a generic animal identification and movement system and it was possible to adapt the existing facilities to create the equine database and to implement the checks at slaughter plants.  The database is being established within the current budgetary allocation for the development and maintenance of the AIM system in addition to some very limited once-off staff costs and the cost of the installation of communication lines and computer hardware equipment at the two slaughterhouses.</p><p>  The Department requested the Passport Issuing Organisations (PIOs) to submit an electronic file containing the details of all equine animals registered from 1 January 1980 up to May 2013 for loading onto the central equine database on 4th and 5th  May 2013. Arrangements have been put in place to provide for the on-going notification by the PIOs of new equine animal registrations to the database on a nightly basis. There are some technical issues still to be resolved with the data received and a significant amount of additional data is expected over the next few days.  Contacts are continuing with the PIOs in order to obtain all the equine animal registration data in the appropriate format at the earliest possible date. </p></reply>

Levels of discards in EU Member States vary depending on the size and nature of the fishery. The evidence in relation to mixed fisheries across western waters indicates a consistently high level of discards and presents a significant problem for all EU Member States  involved in fishing EU waters.</p><p>  Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish is a major component of the current reform proposals for the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Since taking up office as Marine Minister, I have worked tirelessly to influence and drive a change in policy which will urgently lead to an end to discarding. I have prioritised securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the Parliament on reform of the CFP throughout the Irish EU Presidency and we are making considerable progress in this regard.  The Fisheries Council which commenced yesterday and continues today is seeking to agree a compromise package on the CFP reform, including in relation to dealing with discards, with a view to finalising negotiations with the EU Parliament and the Commission before the end of the Irish Presidency.</p><p>  Ireland has been to the forefront in the drive to reduce and eliminate discards for many years and I was delighted to launch an Irish &ldquo;discard&rdquo; atlas in 2011, which is a detailed compendium of discards by the Irish Fleet targeting whitefish on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  This was the first publication of its kind and placed Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards and assisted in advancing the case for a phased elimination of discards as part of the CFP reform package. I have urged other Member States to produce similar publications for their fleet.   It can be expected that discard levels are similar for similar fleets operating in the same fisheries across the EU.</p><p>  In relation to sea bass, the EU Commission has not yet advised if it intends to pursue a TAC and quota regime for sea bass for 2014.   I will continue to press Ireland&rsquo;s case at every opportunity at EU level including at EU Fisheries Council meetings and will consider management arrangements for sea bass when and if Council decides on TACs and quotas for the relevant stocks.</p></reply>

The restriction ensures that the environmental objectives of the scheme are met by ensuring that seeds from the grass species in the meadow have had time to spread and contribute to maintaining and increasing the diversity within the sward.

The Reserve has been funded in recent years only from the value of unused entitlements and as the value of unused entitlements has decreased, it will not be possible to operate a 2013 or 2014 National Reserve.</p></reply>

The store lamb trade failed to take off in Autumn 2012, largely driven by a poor pasture conditions (limited grass, forage) and lack of confidence on the part of store lamb finishers who were reluctant to buy expensive feed. Demand within the traditional markets for light lamb (Portugal and indirectly Spain) has also been poor over the last two years due to the economic downturn in these regions. Indeed total imports of sheep meat into Portugal and Spain have fallen by 26% and 42% respectively.</p><p>  Bearing in mind the difficulties in recent times with these two outlets, the industry and Bord Bia are exploring additional new markets for light lambs for 2013.  These markets include France and the UK, which are the core export markets for Irish lamb, and Sweden, Belgium and Germany, which have been delivering positive growth over the last 2-3 years.  However it must be recognised that light lambs (&amp;lt;13kg) are generally not favoured by consumers in these regions and it is likely that lambs will need to be finished up to a weight of 17kg+.   I understand that Bord Bia has been discussing with the industry on how this could best be done, for example overwinter the lambs and dispose of them in the following Spring. </p><p>  Research can also be used to assist light lamb producers to bring the carcass to an acceptable weight specification. The Teagasc BETTER farm programme has a number of hill farms around the country. The aim of this programme is to establish focal points for the on-farm implementation, development and evaluation of technology that is relevant to hill sheep farmers. Close collaboration between Teagasc Researchers &amp;amp; Advisers with these farms aims to help improve profitability of hill sheep production.</p><p>  The recently launched Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP) contains a measure designed to help improve the weight, quality and thus price of hill lambs.</p><p>  My Department is providing significant funding to Sheep Ireland to help deliver on the significant profit potential that breed improvement can deliver. A number of hill flocks are involved in data recording initiatives which will help identify the most profitable animals to breed from. </p><p>  All of these initiatives should help hill farmers in dealing with the vagaries of the market and in matching specification with market requirements.</p></reply>

Under the current approved financial plan in the Programme close on &euro;4.8Bn is allocated at programme level. This amount includes an allocation of EAFRD funding of &euro;2.49Bn and &euro;2.3Bn of Exchequer funding. Since the launch of the RDP expenditure under the programme up to the end of March 2013 amounted to &euro;3.8Bn<b>. </b>This represents close on 79% of the total value of the Programme and 85% of the EAFRD amount.   Axes 1 and 2 of the Rural Development Programme are administered by my Department while Axes 3 and 4 are delivered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. Details of the allocation and expenditure per measure per fund source under the RDP up to the end of March 2013 are set out in the table below. Included in the table is the indicative level in percentage terms of required exchequer funding per measure to meet the current approved financial plan. This table does not include funds already committed but not as yet claimed.</p><p>The programme, like all national spending, is subject to ongoing budgetary constraints but is configured to maximise all available EU funding. Spending under a number of measures may continue until the end of 2015 and this will provide considerable scope to allow all measures to spend up to their full allocation. Adjustments have already been made to the RDP financial plan and further adjustments are currently being made in order to achieve the fullest possible draw down of available funds. These adjustments must take expenditure to date and commitments to the end of the programme into account and have regard to the available national funding.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Axis / Measure</div></th><th><div>Current <br /><br />RDP<br /><br />Allocation <br /><br />&euro;</div></th><th><div>EAFRD <br /><br />Allocation<br /><br />&euro;</div></th><th><div>Total <br /><br />Exchequer <br /><br />Allocation<br /><br />&euro;</div></th><th><div>EAFRD <br /><br />and <br /><br />Exchequer <br /><br />Expenditure<br /><br />2007 -

This includes a special allocation of &euro;100 million, over the full period, negotiated in the final stages of the talks. Measures which may be funded must address the three rural development objectives and the six priorities laid down in the proposal.</p><p>  The MFF provides for flexibility regarding the co-financing rates for Pillar 2 support measures and a number of different rates have been incorporated into the proposal. A general co-financing rate of 53% is proposed but this rate may rise to a maximum of 80% for measures such as farm and business development, co-operation activities, Leader projects, and other measures. Environmental type measures may be co-funded up to 75%. The exchequer funding percentage that will be required to draw down the available EU funding will depend firstly on the types of measures that will be included in the Programme and secondly on the co-financing rate that is agreed with the EU Commission for these measures. </p><p>  As regards the minimum spend for certain measures, the proposal provides that at least 5% EAFRD funding must be reserved for Leader while the Common Provisions Regulation provides that 7% of EAFRD funding must be allocated under a national performance reserve. In addition a recital to the rural development regulation proposes that 25% of the total EAFRD amount be reserved for diverse environmental operations and climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.</p></reply>

Transitional rules will be required to bridge the current and 2014-2020 programming period for rural development and this is standard practice in the case of Pillar 2 due to the multi annual nature of some of the measures. </p><p>  Draft transitional rules have been proposed and will be under discussion at EU level over the coming months. One of the purposes of these rules will be to allow area based commitments undertaken under the current programme to be funded during 2014 out of the new financial envelope where the financial resources of the current programme have been exhausted. Under the current rural development Regulation agri environment commitments are undertaken as a general rule for periods of between five and seven years.

I am, of course, conscious of the difficulties facing the farming community at present and I am prioritising the processing of outstanding payments, including REPS, and to ensure that queries are resolved and payments expedited.</p><p>  To date approximately 29,200 of the remaining 30,200 REPS 4 participants have been paid a total of &euro;167m in respect of the 2012 application period.  An additional &euro;1m will issue this week to a further 200 REPS 4 farmers.</p></reply>

Responsibility for these Regulations rests with my colleague, Minister Phil Hogan, Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  These regulations transpose the EU Nitrates Directive into law in Ireland with the objective of the Regulations being the protection of ground and surface waters including drinking water sources, through the application of measures to reduce the risk of nutrient enrichment from Agriculture to water.</p><p>  The unusually wet weather in 2012 resulted in reduced fodder being available on many farms for last winter. The cold and wet weather in the early part of 2013 led to greatly reduced grass growth this Spring, culminating in an acute shortage of fodder. </p><p>  Clearly the long-term answer to recent fodder shortages is increased grass production as soon as possible.  I have asked the advisory services to prioritise advice to farmers in the period ahead and to focus on the optimum use of fertiliser in generating feed for the national herd. </p><p>  I understand that sales to date this year of fertiliser are running significantly behind the corresponding levels of recent years. This indicates that, in the short term at least, there is significant scope for farmers to increase fertiliser usage, where appropriate, taking their location, soil fertility and other relevant factors into account, without exceeding the limits set out in the Nitrates Regulations.  </p><p>  The situation is being constantly monitored and I will continue to work with all stakeholders in the sector to get through this difficult period caused by very unusual weather patterns.</p></reply>

The EU Sugar Regime underwent a radical reform in 2005 following major EU decisions to restructure the industry. A temporary restructuring scheme was introduced with the aim of reducing EU sugar production. Greencore, the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota, availed of this voluntary scheme, dismantled its facilities and ceased production in 2006. Ireland secured &euro;353million as part of the reform package of which &euro;220million went to beet growers, &euro;127million to Greencore and &euro;6million to machinery contractors.</p><p>  Post reform, production in the EU is now concentrated in 18 Member States. The present regime runs from 1 September 2006 to the 30 September 2015. There is no mechanism under the present EU Regulations which would allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for the growing of sugar beet in Ireland for the production of sugar. Of course, sugar beet is still grown in Ireland as a fodder crop.</p><p>  In 2011 I met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies, into the possibility of rebuilding a new sugar industry in the country. At both meetings, I stated that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense in order to be viable. </p><p>  I also further suggested to both groups, the desirability of there being only one single proposition in play, as both studies had indicated a potential for only one such viable project and both groups had appeared to accept the reasonableness of this position at the time. Only recently, I re-stated that any business plan for a new venture in this area, would need to be competitive and that it would have to justify the very substantial investment to build a new facility.</p><p>  In recent discussions at the Council of Agriculture Ministers, which I am chairing under our EU Presidency responsibilities, a deep divide emerged between one group of Member States, including Ireland, which favoured abolition of quotas in 2015 and another group of Member States which wished to extend quotas to 2020 and beyond. As current President of the Council, I made a compromise proposal that garnered the support of a large majority of Member States, to extend the quota regime for a further two years until 30 September 2017 when it will finally cease.  This is the formal negotiating mandate for the Agriculture Council, as we enter the final phase of the ongoing CAP Reform negotiations<i>. </i>  The compromise has been welcomed strongly by those who want to re-establish a sugar industry in Ireland. It is my job to ensure that Ireland either has a quota or alternatively can produce sugar in the absence of EU quotas. I would, however, encourage caution on making decisions to planting sugar beet crops or any other investments until we know when Ireland will have the capacity to produce sugar again and when the regime is likely to end.</p><p>  The European Parliament is in favour of extending quotas to 2020. The Council is now in detailed trilogue discussions between the EU Commission and the Parliament on the general CAP Reform package, including the future of the EU Sugar Regime, and I will do everything I can to ensure that we end the Sugar Quota Regime in the EU as soon as possible, so that revival efforts here can get off the ground, as long as the commercial case can be made for them. I am hopeful that I can bring these talks to a successful conclusion before the end of Ireland's Presidency role on 30 June next. </p></reply>

This resulted in &euro;22.6 million being allocated in 2005.  From 2006 onwards, the national reserve was replenished only from unused expired entitlements which reverted to the fund.  From 2008 onwards, the national reserve catered only for land leased out to a third party during the reference period and new entrants to farming.  In 2012, the national reserve catered for new entrants to farming only.</p><p>  Over the period 2005 to 2012, entitlements to the value of approximately &euro;39.7 million have been allocated to 18,834 farmers from the national reserve.  The reserve is funded only from unused entitlements, and the value of unused funds has been decreasing over recent years.  The amount of unused funds for the 2013 scheme year will not be known until the 2013 applications are processed and paid later this year.  It is not therefore possible to operate a 2013 or 2014 national reserve.</p><p>  Under the new CAP regime, there will be a new national reserve in 2015 which can cater for farmers who commenced their agricultural activity within the previous five years.  It is likely that farmers who commenced farming after May 2011 will be catered for in Ireland.  The CAP reform proposals also include a young farmers scheme which makes provision for a top up to the value of entitlements held by qualifying young farmers.  This top up is paid annually for a period of up to five years following commencement of their farming activity. </p></reply>

This inspection regime covers both the eligibility of land declared to drawn down payments and also cross compliance aspects, to ensure adherence with EU regulatory requirements in the areas of public, animal and plant health, environment and animal welfare.</p><p>  In order to be eligible under the single payment scheme and other area based schemes, an applicant must ensure that all agricultural land is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC.  Issues relating to control of rushes must, therefore, be seen in this overall context.  Farmers can keep grassland in GAEC by conducting an agricultural activity on it, such as grazing, harvesting forage crops, or by topping.  Grasslands continue to be eligible where it is evident that the stocking rate on the land is sufficient and, for example, keeps rushes under control and avoids their proliferation.  In such situations, the reality is there may not be a necessity to cut rushes.  However, where a farmer cuts rushes as part of management practice, with the exception of certain designated lands, there are no restrictions on when this is done, enabling the task to be carried out at any time throughout the year once conditions are suitable.</p><p>  I am acutely aware of the weather related difficulties being experienced by farmers and of their concern in respect of their ability to meet the various compliance requirements.  When conducting inspections, my Department&rsquo;s personnel take prevailing weather conditions into account.  For example, where the practice is to cut rushes and it has not been possible to top them in the current year, inspectors will take a broader assessment including whether there is evidence that they have been cut in previous years.</p><p>  Where land is deemed ineligible, this, in the main, is a result of the inclusion of ineligible areas or features and where it is not being used for an agricultural purpose. In cases where land with rushes is rejected, it will be seen that this is due to the broader issue of insufficient agricultural activity being undertaken on it to keep it in GAEC.  My Department therefore does not maintain records specifically on the presence of rushes since the issue has to be seen in the broader context.</p></reply>

The Commission&rsquo;s proposal is that entitlements will be based on hectares declared in 2014 but the farmer must have activated one entitlement in 2011.  The approach agreed by the Council gives member states the option of basing entitlements on hectares declared either in 2012, 2013 or 2014 and the 2011 activation clause is made optional for member states and extended to 2010.  The European Parliament view is close to that of the EU Commission.

The regulations covering production include the European Communities (Hygiene of Foodstuffs) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 369 of 2006), and the European Communities (General Food Law) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 747 of 2007).</p><p>  Bottled water plants also come within the definition of food business operators under EU legislation and, as such, must meet the requirements set down in EC Regulation (EC) 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs which was transposed into national law in 2006. Consequently the operators of water production/bottling plants must ensure that they meet the high food safety standards set out in the legislation. </p><p>  In addition to the general hygiene requirements above at the processing plants, there are separate requirements in relation to bottled water. These are set down in the European Communities (Natural Mineral Waters, Spring Waters and Other Waters in Bottles or Containers) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 225 of 2007). These requirements include microbiological, chemical and labelling parameters, including sale descriptions. There is on-going testing of all bottled water facilities and the frequency of testing increases in line with production volumes. Business operators must put in place a safety management system which ensures the water is safe for consumption and meets all legal requirements.</p><p>  The enforcement of food law is a matter for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).   Bottled water plants are inspected by Environmental Health Services (EHS) from the Health Service Executive (HSE) operating under a Service Contract with the FSAI and are inspected regularly. Samples are taken and tested generally as part of routine inspections &ndash; the EHS are supported by the HSE&rsquo;s network of official microbiological and chemical laboratories in this regard. </p><p>  In December 2011, the FSAI released the results of a major survey of the microbiological safety and quality of bottled water in Ireland. It showed a significant improvement in the microbiological quality of bottled water since the previous survey was conducted in 2007. When samples were tested against all four of the microbiological standards in the legislation, 2% were found to be unsatisfactory (compared to 7% of similar samples in the 2007 survey).   In addition, where non-compliances were detected, manufacturers were required to take immediate corrective actions.</p><p>  In collaboration with the FSAI, the HSE organises annual programmes of testing for all foods on sale in Ireland, including bottled water. In 2012 the HSE, as part of the annual surveillance programme, completed 410 analyses on samples of bottled water. No recalls were required during the year.</p><p>  The FSAI and EHS have worked with the bottled water industry in Ireland to develop guidance on safe and hygienic production of bottled water resulting in an updated national hygiene standard available through the National Standards Authority of Ireland. The FSAI and HSE continue to monitor production sites and retail outlets and to investigate customer complaints.</p></reply>

In relation to the National Stroke Programme,  the aim of the programme is to save lives,  reduce average length of stay (AvLOS) in hospitals and reduce admission of stroke patients to nursing homes.  One of the objectives of the National Stroke Programme was to establish additional stroke units. Stroke units are generally referred to as acute stroke units, rehabilitation stroke units or combined acute and rehabilitation stroke units.  The acute, combined and rehabilitation stroke units located in acute hospitals operate on a 24/7 basis.</p><p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query regarding rehabilitation services and medicine consultants I have forwarded the question to the HSE who will respond directly to you in this regard.</p></reply>

Each case must be dealt with individually and each officer making a decision whether to release, not release or partially release records must make the decision based on the specific record set and specific relevant circumstances.</p><p>  In general, the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003 enable an individual to request access to records held by a public body as named in the schedule to the legislation.  Access may be granted subject to conditions set out in the legislation.  For personal records, as this case would seem to involve, there is no fee for an individual seeking access to their own records, although there may be administrative charges.  In the case of medical records, an individual requesting access to their medical records may be asked to nominate a health professional to whom the records will be released in the first instance.  This nominated individual should have the expertise to interpret and explain the records to the requester.</p><p>  Similarly,  the Data Protection Acts, 1988 and 2003 provide for access to personal information, again subject to conditions in the legislation.  This legislation, however, concerns itself more with protection of data and the length of time that data can be held.</p><p>  An individual record holder is responsible for the maintenance of its own records and for decisions in relation to release, non-release or partial release of those records.  In all cases, reasons for a decision not to release or to partially release must accompany the decision.</p><p>  In 2007, the HSE published a National Code of Practice for Healthcare Records Management, providing guidelines for hospitals in relation to the management of their healthcare records.  This code of practice can be accessed on line at:<i></i>. </p><p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  </p></reply>

As Chair of the negotiations on the Directive during the Irish Presidency, we are working to progress the discussions and to build consensus among the Member States to facilitate the adoption of legislation which will ultimately reduce the number of EU citizens who die from tobacco related illnesses.  This legislation is a priority for the Irish Presidency and it will be discussed at the EPSCO Council on the 21st June.  I have spoken to the Lithuanian Health Minister about this proposal on a number of occasions.  My officials in the Irish Permanent Representation to the EU are in contact with their Lithuanian and Greek counterparts on an ongoing basis in relation to this legislation.

Clinical trials are essential for the development of new medicines and to improve and refine treatments with existing medicines.  Clinical trials are also a key contributor to growth and jobs.  A regulatory environment which supports and nurtures clinical research will benefit patients and also is essential for the growth of the pharmaceutical industry both in Ireland and in the EU in general.</p><p>  The Medical Devices Proposals are also designed to strengthen the EU regulatory system in the area of medical devices by ensuring that all medical devices placed on the European market are safe for patients, and to improve patient access to new innovative treatments.  </p><p>  To date there have been 6.5 meetings of the Council Working Party on Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices during the Irish Presidency dedicated to examination of the Clinical Trials Proposal. The dossier is complex but work is progressing well.</p><p>  The Presidency team aims to complete a first examination of this entire Proposal by the end of the Irish Presidency.  The Irish Presidency team has also been working outside of Council Working Party meetings to review the technical annexes of the Proposal. A number of informal meetings have taken place with Ms. Glenis Willmott MEP, rapporteur on this dossier.</p><p>  There have also been 5 meetings of the Council Working Party on Pharmaceuticals &amp;amp; Medical Devices dedicated to examination of the two large Proposals on Medical Devices and In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices.  These are challenging and technical dossiers consisting of approximately 200 articles and nearly 30 annexes.  Good progress has been made to date and the Presidency's intention is to examine a substantial number of chapters of both proposals in parallel during the Presidency. The Presidency team has also convened a number of meetings of medical devices experts in Brussels to review and improve a number of technical annexes of the Proposals, and has held informal meetings with the EP rapporteurs on these dossiers, Ms. Dagmar Roth Behrendt MEP and Dr. Peter Liese MEP.</p><p>  Both proposals will be on the agenda for the EPSCO meeting in June where it is proposed to present Presidency Progress Reports on the Clinical Trials and Medical Devices Proposals.</p></reply>

The HSE remains seriously concerned regarding the situation in relation to delayed discharges since the New Year. Delayed Discharges impede the operational functioning of a hospital, and exposes the mainly older persons concerned to the inappropriate risks of acute hospital stays e.g. hospital acquired infections.  Higher numbers of delayed discharges can also be associated with extended waits in the Emergency Department.  There is a body of international evidence that demonstrates that longer ED waits is also associated with poorer mortality and morbidity outcomes for patients.  It is essential that this issue is successfully addressed.  In response to this growth, number of actions have been initiated.  These include the establishment by me of a ministerial Task Force to deliver substantial improvements in delayed discharges, including a review of the operational arrangements associated with the &lsquo;Fair Deal&rsquo; scheme.</p><p>  Senior personnel have been tasked with improving cross hospital-community process issues, focusing first on the &lsquo;longest waiting&rsquo; delayed discharges (&amp;gt;100 days).  The aim is to remove all local barriers to discharge and identify those matters which require action at a national level. The management teams have been making good progress with respect to these tasks and it is intended to quickly roll-out this structure to all areas.  </p><p>  New reporting systems and processes have also been introduced. A HSE web-based database that allows tracking at patient level (on an anonymous basis) is in the implementation phase in a number of hospital sites.  In addition, the current categorisation of reasons for delay has been reviewed. New categories, which should give enhanced data on the blocks to discharge, are due for implementation nationally on May 20.  The data captured through the web-based system will facilitate revised metrics for each hospital.  There will be a greater emphasis on reducing the bed days lost to delayed discharges, with targets established on a site-by-site basis.  </p><p>  As issues relating to specific matters taken to address delayed discharges from Galway/Roscommon University Hospital Group are operational matters for the HSE, I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to this.</p></reply>

It is important, therefore, that health promotion programmes which address smoking are in place at an early stage of young people's lives. Schools are a key setting for health promotion. The Health Promoting School (HPS) is an example of an ideal model for the promotion of health and well being and through the HPS programme many topics and issues, including smoking, can be addressed.  Smoking is also specifically addressed through the Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) curriculum at both primary and post primary level and is also included as part of substance use prevention education in primary schools. </p><p>  In 2011, a health education campaign, &quot;QUIT&quot;, aimed at encouraging smokers to quit, was initiated by the HSE.  It uses real-life stories about smoking related illness to help smokers to quit.  This social marketing campaign is on-going.</p><p>  Education programmes and social marketing campaigns are among a number of issues being considered by the Tobacco Policy Review Group. It is expected that the report of the Group will be published in the coming months. </p></reply>

This means that on-duty ambulance crews are at their stations or in their vehicles during a shift, rather than having to be summoned to the station in the event of a call-out. Therefore, crews can respond to an emergency call immediately, instead of the average time of over 20 minutes for a vehicle to leave the station under on-call. This change, which was sought by both staff and the NAS, has obvious benefits for patients and response times and represents a clear improvement in service. </p><p>  The NAS intends to introduce on-duty rostering and dynamic deployment of emergency resources, on a phased basis, across the entire Cork and Kerry region. So far, on-duty and dynamic deployment arrangements have been successfully introduced across County Cork, most recently in West Cork. </p><p>  The NAS informs me that planning for the next phase, in South Kerry, can now be progressed. This phase will include ambulance stations in Caherciveen, Killarney and Kenmare. As in each phase to date, any decisions on the best model of service for South Kerry will be preceded by detailed consideration of activity, geography, demographics, location of acute hospitals and other facilities, supporting services, wider NAS developments and learning from previous phases, as well as public, clinical and community leader engagement.</p><p>  The HSE is currently considering the most appropriate model of service delivery for South Kerry, to replace the current on-call, static deployment model and the operation of resources in isolation.  No decisions have so far been made and a number of matters need to be progressed before deliberations in relation to South Kerry can be finalised. These include public, staff and clinical (including GP) consultations, continuing national reconfiguration of the control and dispatch system and the ongoing roll-out of the Intermediate Care Service for inter-facility patient transport in the region.  A final model will emerge once this process is completed. </p><p>  In light of the above, all stakeholders should take advantage of the opportunity to participate in the consultation process, as the most effective and appropriate forum to engage with the HSE and the NAS in relation to proposals for changes in emergency service delivery in South Kerry.   </p><p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.</p></reply>

However, if a private designated bed is not available and a private in-patient is accommodated in a public bed, the maintenance charge is currently not levied, although the private in-patient continues to pay the fees of his/her hospital consultant.</p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has reported that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying private-designated beds.  This situation represents a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and an indirect subsidy to private insurance companies, who cover most private patients.  I believe that this situation cannot continue and that the new charge makes sense. Up to now insurers have enjoyed a significant subsidy, where these private patients have only paid a standard &euro;75 charge per night even though they have seen their consultant privately.</p><p>  The gap between the cost of providing this service to private in-patients and the amount that public hospitals are currently allowed to raise is estimated to be about a quarter of a billion euro. The subsidy is equivalent to the cost of running a hospital the size of the Mater, or the cost of treating over 30,000 public patients every year. While everyone is entitled to use a public hospital, some people chose to be treated privately, in which case they have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital. The Government believes that users of private services should pay for the costs of providing these services even when they are provided by a public hospital.</p><p>  As part of Budget 2013, the Government announced that it would raise &euro;60m in 2013 under this heading, and &euro;115m in a full year. This represents a modest phasing in of the charge &ndash; as called for by the insurers themselves - and is a relatively modest extra cost on an industry that pays out some &euro;2 billion in claims costs every year.</p></reply>

The overarching aim of the Programme is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with asthma in Ireland and to improve clinical outcomes and the quality of life of all patients with asthma.  A key component is the improved management of people with asthma in primary care, thereby, avoiding emergency attendance at General Practitioner (GP) out-of-hours services, at hospital emergency departments and in-patient admission services.</p><p>  The initial focus of the work of the Programme has been primarily on:<blockquote>- The development and implementation of national asthma guidelines based on international best practice for acute and ongoing asthma management and national asthma education initiatives for patients and health care professionals; and<br /><br />- The organisation and better integration of national asthma services at primary and secondary care levels through the development of a national model of care.</blockquote>The acute adult and Paediatric asthma guidelines and associated care pathways, treatment protocols and care bundles have now been developed for use in primary and secondary care settings.  The acute adult asthma guidelines, which are available online at <i>www.hse.ie</i>  , are currently being revised.</p><p>  The National Asthma Programme is currently working on developing a National Model of Care for Asthma.  The National Clinic Lead for Asthma, supported by the programme's GP Lead, have responsibility in the HSE for the development of the model of care for asthma.  The Integrated Services Directorate has operational responsibility for implementation of the programme, supported by the Clinical Strategy &amp;amp; Programmes Directorate.  The proposed implementation plan will detail how physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals will work with engaged patients to make the clinical decisions most appropriate to the patient's circumstances; while collaborating with specialist colleagues in providing a safe, seamless patient experience within the health system in Ireland.  This is a key deliverable of the National Asthma Programme for 2013.  The National Asthma Progmamme had to prioritise the submission of the Adult Asthma Emergency Guidelines to the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee which had a deadline of March 2013.  The Model of Care for Asthma will be ready for stakeholder consultation by the end of quarter 2.  It is anticipated that it will be completed by the end of quarter 3 this year.</p><p>  As 85% of asthma is managed in primary care without the requirement for hospital specialist services, the National Asthma Programme is currently undertaking work to look at providing a yearly programme of assessment for asthma in primary care called Chronic Disease Watch - Asthma (also referred to as <i>Asthma Check</i>).  The development of <i>Asthma Check</i>   is being done in conjunction with the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP).  <i>Asthma Check</i> outlines the step-by-step process for implementation of guideline based asthma management in primary care to deliver optimal outcomes for patients.  The aim being to facilitate the implementation of best practice asthma guidelines in primary care in order to improve asthma control.  This will reduce acute exacerbations and thus their associated overall costs with fewer hospital bed days and less time off school / work.  It will also ensure that patients with asthma maximize their quality of life.</p><p>  The National Asthma Programme expects that savings would be made in, GP out-of-hours visits, Emergency Department attendances and bed days used by implementing the programme.  In addition, a 10% reduction in asthma deaths each year is targeted by the programme.  Consideration is being given to carrying out an economic analysis of the implementation of the acute asthma guidelines with the support of HIQA.  I am satisfied that good progress can be made in the ongoing development of the National Asthma Programme in 2013.</p></reply>

I have asked the Executive to compile the information requested by the Deputy and to reply to him directly.  In line with Government Policy there has been a significant increase in the number of consultants working in the health service in recent years and this continued after the introduction of Consultant Contract 2008. There has been an increase of nearly 300 (13%)  in the number of consultants (whole time equivalents) employed since June 2008.</p></reply>

This includes a requirement for pharmaceutical companies to justify the proposed price for new medicines, as well as technical assessments by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics for medicines with significant budget implications.  These assessments are used in decision making around new cancer medicines and during formal price negotiations with pharmaceutical companies.  The NCCP has also put a multi-disciplinary Therapeutic Review Committee in place, specifically for the assessment of new, and on occasion existing, cancer medicines with regard to their benefits, costs and budget impact implications.  In parallel to this, the NCCP has also instituted an Oncology Drug Management System for newly approved hospital based cancer medicines.  This system is intended to ensure fair and equitable access across all hospitals, on a &ldquo;money follows the patient&rdquo; basis.</p></reply>

Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data.  For the first time  data is available on www.ntpf.ie.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals.  In the first instance, this will allow resources to be targeted towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment.  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time.  In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.</p></reply>

When <i>A Vision for Change</i>   was published in 2006, there were 49 Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health (CAMH) Teams and 12 dedicated Acute In-Patient beds for children.  Today, there are 58 Community based (CAMH) teams and 39 Acute In-Patient beds nationally. Increased bed capacity reflects an almost 50% decrease in admissions of children to adult units since 2008.</p><p>  The core of mental health service delivery for children or adolescents is based on Community Mental Health Teams.  In this regard, 150 additional posts were allocated to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams in 2012, and a further 80 posts were allocated for this specific service area in 2013.  Such initiatives are underpinned by the special allocation of &euro;70 million to develop mental health over this, and last, year and do not therefore reflect, in reality, a wind down of mental health provision overall. I understand that 109 of these posts have either been filled, or have a start date shortly, and that recruitment of the balance of the new posts remains a priority within the HSE.  I will, obviously, continue to closely monitor implementation of this important initiative over coming months.  In the circumstances, if the Deputy wishes me to pursue the case raised by him, perhaps he would furnish me with specific or relevant details, and I will then be in a position to follow this up with the Health Service Executive. Alternatively, he may wish to do so direct with the Executive, which has  responsibilities for providing health and personal social services in individual cases.</p></reply>

They developed a set of key performance indicators (KPIs), which classify 999/211 emergency calls by clinical status. Clinical Status 1 Echo calls involve life-threatening emergencies of cardiac or respiratory origin.  Clinical Status 1 Delta calls involve life-threatening emergencies of other than cardiac or respiratory origin. Detailed data-sets incorporating the necessary definitions are provided in the HIQA Report.  In relation to calculating response times - the clock starts when the call verification period is complete and the following details have been ascertained: the callers telephone number, the nature of the chief complaint, the Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System (AMPDS) dispatch code and the exact location of the incident.  The clock stops when the first responder or the patient-carrying vehicle arrives at the scene of the incident.</p><p>  The HIQA target for first responders (a person trained in minimum basic life support and use of a defibrillator) is to meet the Echo 1 and Delta 1 incident  response time (7 minutes 59 seconds) in 75% of cases.  The HIQA target  for patient-carrying vehicles is to  meet the  Clinical Status 1 ECHO incidents  response time (18 minutes 59 seconds) in 85% of cases.  It is acknowledged that response-time indicators  should not be used in isolation.  Following a review of the validity of time-based KPIs for clinical status data, and in line with international views, it is considered that clinical outcome indicators would be more appropriate, and work has begun on their development.</p></reply>

The NAS has been taking a number of steps to improve response times.  These include development of a Performance Improvement Action Plan, an Intermediate Care Service, the control centre reconfiguration project and a trial emergency aeromedical service.

This Group was chaired by my Department and comprised of public health and emergency planning experts from the Health Services Executive (HSE) and its agency the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  The Report includes recommendations for a revision of the National Pandemic Plan (2007) and provides advice on operational arrangements for any future pandemic.  A Working Group will be established to begin this process.</p><p>  The purpose of a plan is to limit the effects of a potential pandemic and to inform the public about pandemic influenza, explain what the Government and health services are doing to prepare for a possible pandemic, and give information on what members of the public need to do if there is a pandemic.  The health service response to the threat of an influenza pandemic is based on eight core elements: communications strategy, telephone hotline, responsibilities of the public, surveillance, antiviral drugs, pandemic vaccine, reorganisation of the health services and essential supplies.</p><p>  Agreement to improve the European Union health security framework was secured by the Irish Presidency last week.  The Decision will help Member States prepare for, and protect citizens against, possible future pandemics.  The agreement strengthens risk preparedness and response planning, provides a legal basis for the Health Security Committee, improves access to pharmaceutical products, including vaccines, for Member States, and will result in clearer risk and crisis communication to the public and healthcare professionals.  A crucial aspect of the agreement is the establishment of a legal basis for the coordination of vaccine procurement across the EU.  This will provide more equitable access to vaccines and may reduce costs associated with vaccine procurement.  The EU will also be able to trigger pandemic vaccine production itself, ultimately leading to faster vaccination in an emergency.</p><p>  As the Health Service Executive has responsibility for the stock-piling of antiviral medication this matter has been referred to them for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals.

In 2008, the then Government decided, in the light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.</p><p>  Part 2 of the Disability Act, inter alia, provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants occasioned by their disability to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.</p><p>  There has been a very significant rise in overall activity around the assessment process in recent years in respect of the children now encompassed by the process.  The number of assessment reports received in 2012 was 3,505 which is over 400 applications more than in 2010.  It is worth noting that in the period 2010-2012 over 8,200 reports were completed.  While the HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process given the number and complexity of cases, it is endeavouring to address the issue from available resources.</p><p>  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child.</p><p>  In addition targeted action plans have been put in place since early 2011.  Measures have included: prioritising assessments, holding additional clinics, contracting the private sector to conduct assessments and reconfiguring resources to target areas of greatest need.  These plans are monitored on a monthly basis by the HSE centrally.</p><p>  Following the publication of a report commissioned from the National Disability Authority by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring disability services for children into geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme which is underway.  The NDA report indicated that where integrated teams were operating, the assessment of need process ran more smoothly.  It found that there was no one single solution to remove all of the challenges to operating a statutory assessment of need.  A meeting involving the Department, the HSE and the NDA has been arranged for early June to discuss the Report further.</p></reply>

The Minister for Health is working to ensure that protection is afforded to the disability sector, and the Social Care area as a whole.  In 2013, the HSE is seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources and to maintaining a consistent level to that provided in 2012, by continuing to provide 1.68m hours of Personal Assistant / Home Support Hours along with: - residential services to over 9,000 people with a disability; - day services to over 22,000 people with intellectual and physical disabilities; and - respite residential support for over 7,500 people with intellectual and physical disabilities.</p><p>  The Government is very conscious of the needs of the people with disability who require transport supports from the State.  The Government is also conscious of the position of the Ombudsman that the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes are illegal in the context of the Equal Status Acts.  Following detailed consideration of issues surrounding the two schemes, the Government decided in February that it is no longer possible to allow the schemes to continue and to devise an alternative for meeting people's needs.</p><p>  It is important to note that the decision is in no way intended to save costs and the funding involved in the two schemes (&euro;10.6 million) remains committed to meeting the transport needs of relevant people.  It is also important to note that despite the fact that both schemes ended in February, the payment of Mobility Allowance to those currently in receipt will continue until June, as we devise an alternative method of meeting people's needs.</p><p>  A special Project Group, which is independently chaired, has been established to seek an alternative method to provide for the priority transport needs of people in a manner that does not run counter to the Equal Status Acts.  The Project Group are to report to Government this month, before any final decisions are made on the future arrangements.  At this stage, I am not in a position to pre-empt the outcome of the review or the decision of the Government.</p></reply>

Dublin.  This is an independent Board, whose decision is final.  Where the Board considers that the person concerned meets the criteria, it will issue the required certificate.

Therefore, efforts to combat harmful materials and activities on the Internet can be hampered by the multiplicity of jurisdictions, various legal systems, differing societal norms, or other relevant factors in this regard.</p><p>  Many pro-eating disorder websites may be hosted outside this jurisdiction, principally in the United States.  As such, they would be subject to US jurisdiction, and any effective action is therefore limited in nature.  Notwithstanding such difficulties, there is in Ireland a self-regulatory framework in place for internet service providers (ISPs).  The Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland Code of Practice and Ethics sets out clear guidelines and minimum standards in respect of dealing with complaints regarding suspected illegal material.  However, pro-eating disorder websites are not regarded as illegal.</p><p>  The Deputy may rest assured that the Department of Health, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, are cognisant of the issues raised in this instance and will continue to pursue an inter-agency response to policy and service developments to best tackle eating disorders overall.  A key feature of this, obviously, is to promote awareness of the dangers involved among the younger sections of our population.</p></reply>

These reforms will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for medicines resulting in savings for taxpayers and patients.  The Bill passed Report Stage on the 9th of May and will return to the Seanad on the 22nd of May.  It is hoped that the Bill will complete its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas shortly thereafter.  It is not possible, at this juncture, to provide accurate figures regarding potential savings resulting from the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing, as these depend on various factors including prevailing prices, number of competitors, availability of substitute products, and market dynamics.</p><p>  Following intensive negotiations involving the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs; a lowering of the drugs bill to the State; timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years.  &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years.  Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.</p><p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have also successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.</p><p>In addition, the recently established HSE Medicines Management Programme has identified &lsquo;preferred drugs&rsquo; for prescribers when prescribing Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) or statin medication for patients.  This is the first time that the State has introduced a preferred drug initiative.  PPIs are prescribed for patients with peptic ulcer disease and/or reflux and statin medication is for high cholesterol.  The preferred PPI is Lansoprazole and the preferred statin is Simvastatin.  The HSE is asking doctors to prescribe these preferred drugs in order to save money, both for patients who pay for their medication and to deliver savings of an estimated &euro;15million for the taxpayer.</p><p>  Furthermore, the European Commission has completed its eighth review of the EU-IMF financial assistance programme for Ireland and has published the technical report by the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (ECFIN) which assesses programme implementation by the Irish authorities.  The report published on 28th January 2013 identifies areas where the joint EC-ECB-IMF mission considers that further efficiencies could be achieved in the health system.  This includes compulsory prescription by active ingredient rather than by brand name with exceptions only for 'non-substitutability' cases.  The implications of this recommendation are being examined by my Department at present.</p></reply>

Price increases have only been allowed under the national pricing agreements in exceptional circumstances.  Of the existing medicines reimbursed, in excess of 4,000 products have been impacted by price reductions since 2006.</p><p>Approximately 60 products have been granted price increases since 2006. Included in this are essential medicines such as epilepsy medicines and cortico-steroids.  Price increases are only allowed <i>in extremis</i>  to maintain supplies of required medicines in the Irish market and require the provision of detailed supporting evidence including international pricing.  A number of the price increases were accompanied by pro-rata reductions in other products within a company&rsquo;s portfolio (as per the national pricing agreements).</p><p>Price increases are not a significant contributor to reimbursement costs.  Between 2009 and 2013 price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved.  The average cost per item on the GMS Scheme has reduced from a peak of &euro;18.97 in 2009 to &euro;13.43 in January/February 2013, a 29% reduction in cost per item.

My priority is to ensure that those affected by narcolepsy, with symptom onset post pandemic vaccination are provided with a range of services and supports to meet their health needs.   The Irish Medicines Board has indicated that as of 12 May 2013 there are 49 cases with a clinical diagnosis of narcolepsy, with symptom development post pandemic vaccination.  There are a number of cases still under investigation. The majority of cases are in the five to twenty two years age group. The Health Service Executive has responsibility for health service delivery and at my request, the HSE developed a range of appropriate services and supports to address the needs of this group.  Together, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills provide a very comprehensive range of services and supports to those affected.</p><p>  These supports and services include access to rapid diagnosis, clear treatment pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred. This includes expenses for counselling services for individuals and also for families of children affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination,  in cases where such services are not already available through the HSE.  Multi-disciplinary assessments which allow for appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place are ongoing.  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected.</p><p>  The HSE's advocacy unit is in regular contact with the support group SOUND and last met representatives of the group on 28 February 2013.  Through regional co-ordinators the HSE also has frequent contact with individual members of SOUND to assist them in service access and reimbursement of expenses.   On March 22 the HSE held an information day to ensure those affected were fully aware of all of the the services available.

However, as I made clear in the answer to which the Deputy refers, one of the main purposes of the new EU licence is to provide harmonisation in the level of information in all Member States, and number codes are the standard way in which information is included on EU driving licences.  This has an added advantage in that there is relatively little available space on the licence itself.  I understand that there is no one internationally recognised organ donor symbol, and the number code ensures that a wish to be an organ donor provides the required information in a format consistent with EU standards.</p></reply>

The ultimate aim of the national programme is to ensure that there is no abuse of drugs in sport in Ireland.  The Council represents Ireland on the EU Expert Group on Anti-Doping which was set up to implement the EU Work Plan on Sport 2011-2014.  The new EU competence for sport, under the Lisbon Treaty, allows the EU and Member States the opportunity to work more closely together to address issues of common interest and to speak with one voice at international level, particularly in areas such as the fight against doping in sport.</p><p>  Last week I attended a meeting of the WADA Foundation Board as one of three EU representatives on the board. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was established in 1999 as an international independent agency composed and funded equally by the sport movement and governments of the world. Its mission is to lead a collaborative worldwide campaign for doping-free sport.  WADA&rsquo;s key activities include scientific research, education, development of anti-doping capacities, and monitoring of the World Anti-Doping Code &ndash; the document harmonising anti-doping policies in all sports and all countries.</p><p>  While enormous strides have been made internationally in the fight against doping in sport, recent high profile international cases have shown that doping remains one of the major challenges facing the sport sector.  The fight against doping in sport is one of the priorities of the current Irish Presidency of the Council of the EU.  This will be the focus of a debate at the Council of EU Sport Ministers this week in Brussels which will be chaired by my colleague Minister of State Ring.</p></reply>

The overall target is to attract at least 325,000 extra overseas visits to Ireland in 2013. If this target is achieved, it will generate an additional &euro;170 million in revenue this year, based on historic spending patterns. Recent figures from the CSO show visit numbers for the first quarter of 2013 up over 86,000 compared to the corresponding period of 2012. This is represents an encouraging start to 2013.</p><p>  In terms of resources, the 2013 Estimates allocations to F&aacute;ilte Ireland include a special provision of &euro;7 million which was specifically provided for The Gathering. This amount is to be used exclusively to fund the promotion, development and legacy of the event and complements support for the initiative from the tourism agencies' mainstream activities and from national and local partners.</p><p>  The general response from the public and tourism stakeholders has been overwhelmingly positive. There are now over 3,500 individual gatherings confirmed on the Gathering website. These include clan gatherings, festivals, special sporting events and concerts taking place all across the country throughout the year. Along with well-established events and festivals, we are also supporting a specially targeted set of events for the Gathering, such as the very successful New Year's Eve Event in Dublin, while over 6,000 overseas visitors took part in the People's Parade in Dublin during the St. Patrick's day festivities.</p><p>  Obviously the ambitious targets for overseas visits and associated revenue can only be achieved if people in our main source tourism markets are aware of the initiative. Tourism Ireland continues to mount a major consumer campaign to promote The Gathering to the people across the world that feel linked by family, friends or otherwise with Ireland. The agency is undertaking cooperative activity with the major airlines and ferry operators to highlight the value fares that are on offer. My colleague, Minister Michael Ring recently launched a brand new app for iPhones and android devices which has been specifically designed for The Gathering Ireland 2013. The &quot;Gathering Gestures&quot;  app which is free to download has been created by Tourism Ireland and offers a variety of offers to ensure our overseas visitors get even more from their holiday here.</p><p>  While progress to date has been encouraging, as I have previously stated, all tourism stakeholders must continue to work hard to ensure that the full potential of the Gathering is realised.</p></reply>

I have no specific plans to meet the Northern Ireland First Minister or Deputy First Minister on this issue.  However contact between our two sponsoring Departments is ongoing, I am kept appraised of progress and any significant developments are discussed at plenary meetings of the North South Ministerial Council.</p><p>  At the North-South Ministerial Council plenary on 18 November 2011, it was noted that the Irish Government would provide &pound;25 million per annum in 2015 and 2016 towards the A5 road project.  This is further to &pound;22 million that the Irish Government has already contributed to the project as part of the planning process.  It brings the Exchequer commitment to &pound;72 million.</p><p>  The Northern Ireland Road Service had planned to start construction on two of the approved sections of the A5 in autumn last year. However, following publication of the necessary statutory Orders in advance of construction, the Minister for Regional Development&rsquo;s decision to proceed with the A5 was challenged by a group known as the Alternative A5 Alliance.</p><p>  While the Northern High Court rejected the majority of the applicants&rsquo; grounds of challenge, one was upheld.  The judge found that an appropriate assessment under the Habitats Directive should have been carried out on the scheme.  On that basis at a further hearing on 8 April 2013 the judge confirmed he would quash the Orders relating to the A5 scheme.</p><p>  The project was discussed at the North South Ministerial Council Transport Sectoral on 17 April and the Minister for Regional Development now plans to undertake the environmental assessment required under the Habitats Directive.  This is a necessary first step to progress the project and it must be allowed run its course. </p></reply>
