    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-26a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014112600068#WRA00500"><p>Ireland has consistently expressed concern at the ever increasing tension caused by Israeli policies on the ground, and in particular the relentless growth of settlements.<br/><br/>Israeli settlements and their continued expansion constitute a major barrier to peace.<br/><br/>Settlements, and related policies in Area C (which is the majority of the West Bank), seem designed to drive Palestinians off the bulk of the land they occupy, and to crowd them into the cities under PA control.<br/><br/>Put simply, these processes are incompatible with a genuine commitment to a peaceful and viable two-State solution, and must cast doubt on the good intentions of any Government that pursues them.<br/><br/>In public statements on 1 September and again on 28 October I explicitly condemned Israeli government announcements of further settlement expansion, and called for these decisions to be reversed.<br/><br/>It is essential for both sides, but in particular the occupying authorities, to avoid actions that will increase tension and confrontation.  I would call in particular for respect for the status quo in relation to the Holy Places.  I note and welcome the pledge in this regard issued by Prime Minister Netanyahu and King Abdullah of Jordan in their meeting in Amman last week, alongside US Secretary of State Kerry.<br/><br/>While the resumption of talks is important, we believe that it is also important to work to influence and change those policies on the ground which are directly destructive of the chances for a peace agreement.<br/><br/>The separate question of Israel as an explicitly Jewish State is a complex one in internal Israeli politics, with no clear definition of what this would mean.<br/><br/>The reaction of the Palestinian President has been that it is a matter for Israelis how they define their state, so long as the equal rights of non-Jewish citizens are not infringed.  This seems to me a sensible position.</p></reply>

I would encourage anyone who wishes to share their views as to the content of the Plan to make them known to the Human Rights Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by emailing businesshr@dfa.ie<br/><br/>It is envisaged that the Plan will consist of a reference framework for state actors, business enterprises, and civil society to address the challenges associated with business impact on human rights standards and how to help integrate human rights into corporate culture.<br/><br/>The Plan will provide information on existing policies in place and describe future steps that the Irish government plans to take to implement the UNGPs.</p></reply>

They have been prompted by the Turkish government's negotiations with the group and the role played by PKK-affiliated Kurdish groups in Syria.</p><p>  Any designation or listing by the EU of a group as a terrorist organization is done on the basis of Council Common Position 2001/931 (CFSP) on the application of specific measures to combat terrorism.  The reasons and processes for designation of an organisation by the EU are rigorous and detailed, as are the procedures for de-listing.  These involve a thorough assessment as to whether the grounds for listing are still valid, taking into account the past and present activities of the group and the perceived future intentions of the group.</p><p>  Ireland participates in discussions on the designation and delisting of organisations with our EU partners, and decisions are taken by unanimity.  The designation of entities as terrorist organisations at EU level is applied automatically in Ireland and we cannot unilaterally delist the PKK.</p><p>  The PKK was first placed on the European Union's list of designated terrorist organizations in 2002 and has remained on the list since then.  The designation of the PKK was most recently reviewed by the EU on 22 July 2014.</p><p>  The PKK is a militant organisation, which was founded in 1978 to create an independent Kurdish state on the principles of revolutionary socialism and since 1984 the PKK have engaged in an armed struggle in Turkey's Kurdish-dominated southeast region.  Although there have been intermittent ceasefires, the PKK's campaign has been marked by acts of terrorist violence.</p><p>  The PKK has indicated its wish to negotiate a peaceful solution and now calls for autonomy for Kurds within Turkey and seeks to promote and advance the rights of Kurds living in Turkey, specifically the right to maintain their ethnic identity.  Its imprisoned leader, Abdullah &Ouml;calan has recently indicated his wish to negotiate a peaceful solution to achieve the PKK's current aims and several parliamentary delegations have visited him in prison.</p><p>  We welcome the PKK's stated willingness to engage in political dialogue and the engagement in negotiations with Turkey.  As the European Commission stated in its most recent progress report issued last month, the process is of historical significance to Turkey   and should be pursued in good faith by all sides.</p><p>  I regret that after two years of comparative peace, there has been a resurgence of violence over the last month.  I very much hope that the current difficulties can be overcome, the ceasefire fully respected and that the process can lead to the successful conclusion that we all wish to see.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-26a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014112600068#WRA01400"><p>This is a repeat of my reply to Question No. 3.</p><p>  Policing and justice powers were devolved to the Northern Ireland institutions following the Hillsborough Agreement of February 2010.  Since that time, David Ford MLA has been Minister for Justice with responsibility for prison policy.  An executive agency of his Department, the Northern Ireland Prison Service, is responsible for implementing prison policy.</p><p>  A comprehensive Review of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, chaired by Anne Owers and which flowed from the Hillsborough Agreement, was published in October 2011.  This Review set out a path to reform the prison system in the North.  Implementation of the forty recommendations made by Anne Owers and her Prison Review Team is due to be completed next year, and progress is overseen by an independent expert group which reports every six months.</p><p>  Owers recognised that Maghaberry was unable to meet the challenge of seeking to provide appropriate security, and sufficient and relevant activity, for its long and short term prisoners, including those imprisoned for paramilitary offences.</p><p>  In summer 2010, Republican prisoners in Maghberry's Roe House wing protested at conditions: an agreement between prisoners and prison management, known as the Roe House Agreement, was concluded in August 2010 and four independent assessors were appointed to assist in its oversight and delivery.</p><p>  On the recommendation of the Prisoner Ombudsman, Tom McGonigle, the independent assessors carried out a stocktake of implementation of the Roe House Agreement in August and September this year.  Their stocktake report was published by Minister Ford on 12 November and highlights areas of progress since 2010 and issues of concern to prisoners and management.  The report was based on free access to Maghaberry and to its prisoners, as well as extensive contact with the prison authorities, the Prisoner Ombudsman, and with Prison Officer representatives.  I understand that any documentation requested was made available.</p><p>  The independent assessors highlight the murder of a prison officer, David Black, in November 2012 by so called dissident Republicans as a significant challenge and a breach of the principles underpinning the Agreement: ongoing and recent threats against members of the Northern Ireland Prison Service and officials dealing with prisoner welfare have further complicated relations and damaged trust between the Prison Service and prisoners.</p><p>  All threats against those working in prisons and with prisoners in Northern Ireland are completely unacceptable and should be lifted immediately.</p><p>  The recent stocktake report was accepted by the Northern Ireland Prison Service and by the relevant prisoners, and opens an opportunity to resolve outstanding matters so that the unimplemented elements of the Roe House Agreement can be achieved.  The independent assessors recommend a timeline of six months for the resolution of outstanding issues.  I would encourage all concerned to make the most of this opportunity.</p><p>  I have discussed these issues with Minister Ford and will continue to do so as appropriate.  I also intend to meet the independent assessors who concluded the stocktake report over the coming weeks.  My officials continue to meet with the range of agencies responsible for prisoner issues in Northern Ireland, including the Department of Justice, the Northern Ireland Prison Service, the Prison Ombudsman, and on non-devolved aspects, with officials from the Northern Ireland Office.</p></reply>

In response to Turkey's stated intention to search for oil and gas in this area<font color="#2F2F2F">,</font>the President of Cyprus announced the suspension of talks the divided island on 7 October.  Talks to promote peace and unification on the island had reconvened on 17 September and are facilitated by the Special Adviser to the United Nations Secretary<font color="#2F2F2F"> General</font>, Espen Barth Eide.  The Government is on record as welcoming these talks, believing that they offer the prospect of injecting fresh momentum into the process.<br/><br/>It is with particular regret, therefore, that we see their suspension and we fully support the view of the UN that both parties should resume contact and avoid getting drawn into the wider regional conflicts.<br/><br/>The EU, including at the European Council last month, has called on Turkey to exercise restraint and to respect Cyprus' sovereign rights over its Exclusive Economic Zone.  This was reiterated by the EU Commissioner for <font color="#2F2F2F">European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations</font>, Johannes Hahn, as recently as 13 November at the European Parliament.  I fully endorse that call.<br/><br/>While I have not yet had the opportunity to discuss the issue in detail directly with my Cypriot colleague, the issue has been discussed at the European Council last month, and my officials are engaged in on-going dialogue with representatives of the Cypriot Government, including through our respective Embassies.  In addition, Ireland's views have been communicated to Turkey during our most recent bilateral political consultations at senior official level, which were held in Dublin last week.<br/><br/>Ireland remains supportive of all efforts to assist in the search for a mutually acceptable settlement to this long-standing problem. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-26a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014112600068#WRA02000"><p>The Deputy is referring to the extraterritorial application of US legislation in connection with that country's sanctions against Cuba.  Together with our partners in the European Union, we have firmly and continuously opposed extraterritorial measures that seek to extend the US's embargo against Cuba to third countries as contrary to commonly accepted rules of international trade.</p><p>  Our position in this regard was set out most recently at the UN General Assembly on 28 October this year in the context of the resolution on the necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the US against Cuba.  We continue to encourage the United States to take steps to alleviate the problems arising from its extraterritorial legislation.</p><p>  As regards the recent closure of bank accounts in Ireland, I would recall that my colleague, Mr Michael Noonan, T.D, Minister for Finance, advised the House in reply to a Question on 14 October this year of the reasons quoted by the Irish bank in question as to why they have taken this step.  These relate, in summary, to the fact that the bank in question relies on a US correspondent bank for the processing of its national, European and international transactions and that, as a result, they are not in a position to process the relevant transactions.</p><p>  The Minister advised also that he has no direct function in the relationship between banks and their customers nor does he have a statutory function in relation to banking decisions made by individual lending institutions.  I would refer the Deputy to Question No. 43 of 14 October 2014 for the full details.</p><p>  While the reasons quoted for closing the accounts may relate, at least in part, to operational considerations on the part of the bank in question, issues arising from the extraterritorial application of US legislation regarding Cuba remain important.  For that reason, I instructed my officials to raise the matter in recent consultations with the US State Department.  We drew their attention to the impact of the legislation on business and others in Ireland, and recalled our position on the relevant legislation.  We are currently in the process of following up further with the US side in the matter.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-26a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014112600068#WRA02300"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question, which relates to a hugely significant issue for Ireland.</p><p>  The UK's continued membership of the European Union is clearly of great importance to us.  Amongst all the EU member States, the UK is our biggest trading partner; it is a key ally on a range of policy issues at the negotiating table in Brussels; and it is, overall, the country with which we have the most in common.</p><p>  That is why the Government's position on this matter is clear: we want to see the UK remain a full and integral member of the Union.  This is very much in our national interest.  It is in the interests too of our bilateral relationship with Britain, which benefits from our joint membership, especially in relation to Northern Ireland.  And it is also in the interests of the EU as a whole: I believe, and I know that many other partners believe, that the Union is far stronger with the UK at the centre.</p><p>  I am of course fully respectful of and sensitive to the internal democratic process in Britain.  However, given the issues at stake for Ireland, I am following developments very closely.  Deputies may be aware that I participated in an event at the European Council on Foreign Relations in London on 14 November, where I delivered a speech on the theme of &quot;Ireland, Britain and Europe&quot;.  This was an important opportunity to spell out, in a constructive way, our fundamental approach to the UK-EU question.  It also allowed me to emphasise to a mainly British audience how much we value the UK's presence in the EU and our continuing mutual cooperation within it.</p><p>  This issue is very much to the fore in discussions with my counterparts across the EU and there are of course regular contacts at official and diplomatic level with the UK, both here and in London.

The Taoiseach, launched the outline plans for the commemoration of the Easter Rising 1916 on Wednesday 12<sup>th</sup>November.  These outline plans are now subject to a period of consultation to enable members of the public to comment and to submit ideas in relation to this important commemoration.  Details of the proposed plans, and a facility for submitting comments and ideas, can be found on the dedicated website .  My colleague, Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Heather Humphreys T.D., whose Department has lead responsibility for the 1916 commemoration, has also tasked a team from her Department with visiting every county to listen to people's views on commemorating 1916.<br/><br/>Once this consultation process has concluded and final decisions made on the overall programme of commemorative events, the Government will consider the question of attendance by Ireland's international partners.<br/><br/>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland's Diaspora are keen to mark this centenary and my Department, through its network of overseas Embassies, is planning a series of initiatives - including  talks, community events, exhibitions, seminars and cultural events - to commemorate the events of 1916 and to present Ireland in 2016 to the world.  Highlights of this programme will include a major three-week festival at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC in May/June 2016, as well as the premiere of a major documentary on 1916 currently under preparation at Notre Dame University.</p></reply>

Since that time, David Ford MLA has been Minister for Justice with responsibility for prison policy.  An executive agency of his Department, the Northern Ireland Prison Service, is responsible for implementing prison policy.</p><p>  A comprehensive Review of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, chaired by Anne Owers and which flowed from the Hillsborough Agreement, was published in October 2011.  This Review set out a path to reform the prison system in the North.  Implementation of the forty recommendations made by Anne Owers and her Prison Review Team is due to be completed next year, and progress is overseen by an independent expert group which reports every six months.  </p><p>  Owers recognised that Maghaberry was unable to meet the challenge of seeking to provide appropriate security, and sufficient and relevant activity, for its long and short term prisoners, including those imprisoned for paramilitary offences.</p><p>  In summer 2010, Republican prisoners in Maghberry's Roe House wing protested at conditions: an agreement between prisoners and prison management, known as the Roe House Agreement, was concluded in August 2010 and four independent assessors were appointed to assist in its oversight and delivery.</p><p>  On the recommendation of the Prisoner Ombudsman, Tom McGonigle, the independent assessors carried out a stocktake of implementation of the Roe House Agreement in August and September this year.  Their stocktake report was published by Minister Ford on 12 November and highlights areas of progress since 2010 and issues of concern to prisoners and management.  The report was based on free access to Maghaberry and to its prisoners, as well as extensive contact with the prison authorities, the Prisoner Ombudsman, and with Prison Officer representatives.</p><p>  I understand that any documentation requested was made available.</p><p>  The independent assessors highlight the murder of a prison officer, David Black, in November 2012 by so called dissident Republicans as a significant challenge and a breach of the principles underpinning the Agreement: ongoing and recent threats against members of the Northern Ireland Prison Service and officials dealing with prisoner welfare have further complicated relations and damaged trust between the Prison Service and prisoners.  All threats against those working in prisons and with prisoners in Northern Ireland are completely unacceptable and should be lifted immediately.</p><p>  The recent stocktake report was accepted by the Northern Ireland Prison Service and by the relevant prisoners, and opens an opportunity to resolve outstanding matters so that the unimplemented elements of the Roe House Agreement can be achieved.  The independent assessors recommend a timeline of six months for the resolution of outstanding issues.  I would encourage all concerned to make the most of this opportunity.</p><p>  I have discussed these issues with Minister Ford and will continue to do so as appropriate. I also intend to meet the independent assessors who concluded the stocktake report over the coming weeks.  My officials continue to meet with the range of agencies responsible for prisoner issues in Northern Ireland, including the Department of Justice, the Northern Ireland Prison Service, the Prison Ombudsman, and on non-devolved aspects, with officials from the Northern Ireland Office.</p></reply>

However, no date for this has been decided as yet.  The Global Irish Network and the Global Irish Economic Forum have given greater strategic direction to the Government's engagement with our most senior Irish contacts around the world.  Over the past five years, the Network has proved particularly effective as a source of structured advice from key players in priority markets and within multinational companies.  This advice, whether given at the Forum or elsewhere has fed directly into the formation of Government policy and action plans.  Members of the Network also facilitate high level access for the Government and Irish companies to decision makers in major corporations.  To date there have been three Forums, 2009, 2011 and 2013.<br/><br/>In 2011, the focus of the Forum was on recovery, reform and restoring our international reputation.  From the 65 recommendations that came from the Forum working groups, 24 key outcomes were defined which delivered, and continue to deliver, tangible economic benefits in relation to job creation, FDI, support for our SME sector and our image abroad.  <br/><br/>Examples of outcomes of the 2011 Forum include:<br/><br/>- An &ldquo;Invest in Ireland&rdquo; roundtable with President Clinton in New York;<br/><br/>- The establishment of the Global Irish Contacts Programme where to date, over 100 members have signed up to support exporters providing expertise in<b></b>32 markets across 14 sectors;<br/><br/>- A World Actors Forum held in May 2013;<br/><br/>- The extension of the Irish Short Stay Visa Waiver Programme and the introduction of an Immigrant Investor Programme and the Start up Entrepreneur Programme.<br/><br/>In addition, the 2011 Forum saw the launch of the Gathering which brought an extra 250-275,000 visitors to Ireland during 2013 to attend 5,000 Gatherings across the country.<br/><br/>Connect Ireland, who implement the Government's Succeed in Ireland initiative, was also formally launched at the 2011 Forum and they now have approximately 1,000 new jobs committed.<br/><br/>The most recent Forum in 2013 took place in a different context than its predecessors.  It took place as the country was coming out of recession, our reputation internationally was much improved and the Troika was preparing to leave.<br/><br/>18 working groups brought forward <b>64 specific recommendations</b>.  Each of these recommendations has been considered in detail by Government Departments.  Some of these have been implemented in full; some are being advanced by Government while other initiatives are being brought forward by members of the Global Irish Network.  Where appropriate, recommendations are reflected in the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs.<br/><br/>Among the ideas being advanced are:<br/><br/>- Year of Irish Design (ID2015) to take place in 2015, showcasing the best of Irish design both at home and internationally.<br/><br/>- The launch of an agency to market Irish agri-business expertise globally<br/><br/>- Inviting Global Irish Network members to bring conferences to Ireland<br/><br/>- Considering whether Ireland can have a competitive advantage in the area of Smart Ageing<br/><br/>The 2013 Forum also saw regional components and a mentoring event for Irish SME's held in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.<br/><br/>My Department is currently compiling a one-year-on update on these recommendations which will itemise progress under each recommendation and this will be published in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>All of the reports from each of the Forums are available on </p></reply>

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we are working closely with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond towards achieving some relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the United States and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.  During my visit to the US from 23 September to 1 October I had a wide range of meetings on this important issue with both Irish community groups and high level government contacts, including Vice President Joe Biden, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and Secretary of State John Kerry.<br/><br/>As you are all aware, last Thursday President Obama announced new measures which should benefit thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants based in the US.  Pending further possible measures being considered by the US Congress, the President's measures are a step forward which will undoubtedly have a positive impact on immigrants' lives.  The Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers (CIIC) have welcomed President Obama's announcement as an important first step in allowing for much needed improvements to the immigration system.  At the core of his proposals is that undocumented immigrants in the US for more than 5 years, who have children who are US citizens or legal residents, who register, go through background checks and pay their taxes, will be protected from deportation and given temporary legal status.  I particularly welcome a provision which, for the first time, albeit under limited conditions, will permit some travel from and to the United States for those undocumented Irish who are eligible to apply under the arrangements President Obama has announced.  <b>Details as to how the travel provision will work in practice have yet to be confirmed but through our Embassy in Washington, we are following up on it directly with the White House and U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</b><br/><br/>This clearly represents real progress, albeit with further important steps yet to be achieved, and I am happy that the relentless efforts of the Government and our Embassy and diplomatic missions in close partnership with the Irish community in the US have begun to bear fruit.  I am determined that as many Irish nationals as possible will benefit from these changes and, to that end, our missions in the US will continue to work in partnership with the excellent Irish immigration centres there whose work my Department supports.  At the same time, I am by no means complacent about what has yet to be done.<br/><br/>I am well aware that some will not benefit from these new arrangements and that our work to encourage further changes in this area must be pushed forward proactively.<br/><br/>It is clear that on immigration reform, as President Obama himself has indicated, there is no substitute for legislative action by Congress.  The government and our Embassy will continue to work with the US Administration and with Republican and Democratic political leaders.  We already have strong friendships across both aisles in Congress and will keep building our network of friends on Capitol Hill.  Through our Embassy and Consulates in the U.S. and through direct political contacts with the Administration and all sides in Congress, we will continue to encourage further steps that will reflect the concerns and needs of the undocumented Irish and their families, as well as ensuring improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.</p></reply>

Last year the Government launched our new Policy for International Development, &lsquo;One World, One Future&rsquo;.  It clearly identifies the impact of climate change on development as a priority area for action.</p><p>  My Department has been working very closely on these issues with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which has the lead responsibility for Ireland&rsquo;s climate change response.  We will continue to work collaboratively across  Government to support the objective of reaching a legally binding international climate agreement at the United Nations Climate Conference, to be held in Paris in 2015.</p><p>  Through the Government&rsquo;s overseas aid programme, which is managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, we have been working to provide assistance for smallholder farmers and poor communities to adapt to the changing environmental context. Through our support for agricultural research which directly addresses poverty we are assisting farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere in the developing world to become more sustainable through enhanced farm methods and improved seed varieties. We are scaling up our assistance to agriculture in a way that delivers on inter-related hunger and climate objectives.  This includes support for climate smart agriculture, agro-forestry, crop diversification and the development and promotion of drought resistant crop and livestock varieties.  I emphasised the priority we attach to this work when I co-hosted the major Zero Hunger international meeting at the United Nations in September.</p><p>  The increasing impact of uncertain weather patterns and the increasing number of severe weather events has a devastating effect on some of the poorest communities where Irish Aid is working.  We are supporting  programmes to prepare for and reduce the risk of disasters.  We are also helping developing countries to plan for climate adaptation nationally and supporting their engagement with the international climate change negotiations.  This will remain a priority area of work for my Department.</p></reply>

Its economic provisions are intended to encourage trade by eliminating tariffs and obstacles and improving market access generally.</p><p>  The Agreement&rsquo;s human rights provisions are essential elements that, together with the sustainable development chapter, provide the EU with an important means to encourage positive social reforms and greater protection of human rights. Ireland strongly promoted the inclusion of the human rights provisions, and these, together with the sustainable development aspects, have been developed further by the elaboration by the Colombian side, at the request of the European Parliament, of &lsquo;roadmaps&rsquo; on human, labour and environmental rights.</p><p>  The serious situation that prevails with regard to many human rights issues in Colombia is a matter of ongoing concern, both to Ireland and to the EU as a whole. The Deputy will be aware of the long-standing conflict that has plagued Colombia and of the terrorism and criminality that have accompanied it. While respect for human rights requires considerable improvement, there are nonetheless grounds for believing that the situation is improving in overall terms.</p><p>  In relation to Colombia, as elsewhere, Ireland works to support positive developments and promotes the progressive improvement of human rights standards. Our Embassy in Mexico City is accredited to Bogot&aacute; on a non-residential basis and the Ambassador and officers visit Colombia regularly. In addition to our bilateral contacts on human rights issues with the government and with civil society, we participate in a range of dialogue mechanisms at EU level and at the UN.</p><p>  I believe that the policy of engagement, dialogue and scrutiny which the EU has pursued since the launch of the negotiations on the Free Trade Agreement is the best way to promote human rights and the interests of labour in Colombia. At the most recent session of the EU-Colombia Human Rights Dialogue, on 24th October this year, for instance, the EU engaged with the Colombian government across the full range of human rights issues, including as regards human rights defenders and trade unionists   that are a particular priority for Ireland.</p><p>  The EU&rsquo;s efforts to advance human rights in Colombia are reflected also in its support for the current peace process involving the government and the guerrilla forces. I share the view that this process offers the potential for a major improvement in the overall human rights situation and I hope for a speedy resumption of the talks.</p></reply>

We are determined that they will include a clear commitment to the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger by 2030.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s policy on International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, provides the framework for our engagement on development at UN level.  It reaffirms our commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA), when economic circumstances permit.</p><p>  In the context of the very difficult economic circumstances facing the country, the Government has successfully managed to stabilise allocations to Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme. For Budget 2015, we were again determined to protect the aid programme, and we have provided a total allocation of just over &euro;600 million for next year.  This clearly demonstrates our commitment to the aid programme and represents a very significant and generous contribution on behalf of the people of Ireland to assist those less fortunate than ourselves. I will set out the case for building further on this commitment over the coming year.</p><p>  Our priority now is to ensure we continue to focus this significant level of public funding on tackling the root causes of poverty and injustice, strengthening our key partner countries ability to deliver essential services to their citizens, and delivering real and sustainable improvements to the lives of some of the world&rsquo;s poorest people and communities.</p></reply>

Ireland is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis. At the Second International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria and the region held in Kuwait last January, Ireland pledged to provide &euro;12 million in humanitarian assistance over the course of 2014. Given the scale of the crisis, we have already exceeded this pledge by &euro;2 million. Since 2011, Ireland has provided over &euro;28 million in humanitarian support to Syria, delivered through UN partners and NGOs. In addition we have provided &euro;1.15 million in funding to our partner organisations responding to the crisis in neighbouring Iraq.</p><p>  Ireland has consistently matched our material humanitarian contribution with concrete support to international efforts led by the UN to find a sustainable political solution to the crisis, and to advocate for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access, as well as for respect by all parties of International Humanitarian Law. In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees, Ireland will continue to advocate for a comprehensive regional response and increased support to host countries which is crucial to defuse the growing tension between host and refugee communities that could further exacerbate and extend this already entrenched and complicated conflict. In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees, Ireland will continue to provide assistance within our means as the situation evolves.</p><p>  There can be no complacency about the threat which ISIS and other extremists represent or about the need for urgent international action to confront this threat to us all.  This requires a wide range of actions including security responses to deny ISIS the freedom to attack civilians, action by the new Iraqi Government to promote inclusivity and ensure real Sunni representation within Iraq&rsquo;s political system and Government, as well as achieving a political resolution to the Syrian conflict. Humanitarian relief is also a critical component of the response to mass displacement of civilians fleeing the threat from ISIS and other terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq.</p><p>  UN Security Council Resolutions 2170 and 2178 adopted in recent weeks require all UN Member States to implement comprehensive measures to address the threat of terrorism including through such measures as taking active steps to prevent travel by persons suspected of planning or intending to participate in terrorist acts; cooperation in exchanging information on actions and movement by terrorists; prevention of recruitment and radicalisation of possible members of such groups, including through community outreach initiatives, and denying financial transfers to terrorist groups; and supporting the provision of bilateral assistance to States in developing national capacities to respond to foreign terrorist fighters.</p><p>  Ireland will continue to support all international efforts, including by the EU and UN, to promote a political resolution of the current conflict in both Syria and Iraq. We will also continue to address the humanitarian consequences of the conflict and provide urgent assistance and support to the civilian populations within Syria and Iraq who have been displaced or suffered violations of their rights at the hands of ISIS and other extremists.</p></reply>

Of particular concern is the sharp escalation of hostilities in recent weeks and reports of large movements of tanks, artillery and troops from across the Russian border into rebel held areas, which have threatened progress towards a peaceful resolution of the crisis.</p><p>  I participated in the Foreign Affairs Council on 18 November, where Ministers had a comprehensive discussion on the situation in Ukraine and the way forward.  The Council reiterated the urgent need for all sides to swiftly and fully implement the Minsk agreements and, once again, underlined the responsibility of the Russian Federation in this regard.  We called for an immediate halt to the continuous violations of the ceasefire, a withdrawal of all foreign forces and military equipment from Ukraine, as well as a securing of the border between Ukraine and Russia with permanent monitoring by the OSCE.</p><p>  It is clear that a lasting ceasefire remains central to the success of current efforts to reach a sustainable political solution, based on respect for Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p><p>  In light of the deteriorating security situation in eastern Ukraine and the holding of so-called &ldquo;parliamentary and presidential elections&rdquo; in Luhansk and Dontesk on 2 November which the EU considers illegal, the Council decided to ask the European External Action Service and the European Commission to present a proposal for additional listings under Phase II sanctions, targeting separatists. A decision will be taken on this proposal at the end of the month. </p><p>  Together with my EU partners, I also underlined the clear need for intensified talks in the framework of the OSCE Trilateral Contact Group. In this regard, I would like to highlight the vital contribution that the OSCE has made to date in helping to broker the ceasefire agreement and to monitor its implementation in a challenging and sometimes hostile environment. Our continued support for their important work is needed.</p><p>  In welcoming the parliamentary elections that took place in Ukraine on 26 October, Ministers looked forward to the urgent formation of a new Government. I believe that it is important that Ukraine seize the mandate for reform given by the Ukrainian people and take the opportunity for outreach, national dialogue and reconciliation. I am convinced that sustainable and real progress in the reform programme must be an integral part of the strategy to overcome the current crisis.</p></reply>

Peace building and conflict prevention are central to the EU&rsquo;s actions on the international stage, and particularly in the context of the pressing conflicts with which we are currently faced. Indeed, the EU has established peace missions and operations in many of the most sensitive regions, including most recently in Ukraine. These peace missions work actively to contribute to stability and improved security across the globe.</p><p>  Since the outset of the crisis in Ukraine, the EU has sought to play an active role in helping to find a peaceful solution. We have strongly supported the OSCE, including through financial assistance and seconded staff, in their crucial role in both negotiation a ceasefire and monitoring its implementation.  The EU has also directly pursued the path of diplomatic dialogue to achieve an outcome fully respecting Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.  At the UN level, we supported and worked to promote the adoption of the resolution on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.</p><p>  In response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and Russian actions to destabilise eastern Ukraine, the EU introduced sanctions which have been gradually stepped up as the situation on the ground has developed. These sanctions are an effective means by which to encourage all sides to come to the negotiating table.  We firmly believe that the measures taken in relation to Russia, coupled with continued political and diplomatic engagement with the various sides involved in the conflict, is the best way to create the conditions for this engagement.</p><p>  Internal reform aimed at building the broadest possible consensus across the country in Ukraine must also be central to any strategy to overcome the crisis.  The EU has established an Advisory Mission on Rule of Law under its Common Security and Defence policy to support the Ukrainian authorities in their efforts to reform the civilian security sector.  My Department is funding the participation of two Irish members of this Mission. </p><p>  The EU has also played a positive role in supporting the international response to the humanitarian crisis that has resulted from the conflict in eastern Ukraine. To date, the European Commission has mobilised &euro;10.8 million in humanitarian assistance and &euro; 17 million in development funding. &euro;4.5 million has been provided specifically to meet the recovery and integration needs of the large number of civilians who have had to flee their homes and towns.</p><p>  Considerable ongoing efforts are being made by the international community, in which Ireland is actively engaged, to resolve, and where possible prevent, conflicts, human rights abuses, and atrocity crimes across the Middle East. The international community, including the EU and UN, are using all the available instruments to foster constructive dialogue and to encourage peaceful, negotiated solutions to political differences in the region.</p><p>  As I made clear in my address to the United Nations General Assembly in September, there can be no complacency within the international community about the threat which ISIS and other extremists represent or about the need for urgent international action to confront this threat to us all. In this speech, I also underlined that it is long past time for the attainment of a comprehensive peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples by means of the realization of a just, negotiated two-State solution.</p></reply>

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we are working closely with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond towards achieving some relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the United States and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America. During my visit to the US from 23 September to 1 October I had a wide range of meetings on this important issue with both Irish community groups and high level government contacts, including Vice President Joe Biden, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and Secretary of State John Kerry.</p><p>  As you are all aware, last Thursday President Obama announced new measures which should benefit thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants based in the US. Pending further possible measures being considered by the US Congress, the President&rsquo;s measures are a step forward which will undoubtedly have a positive impact on immigrants&rsquo; lives. The Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers (CIIC) have welcomed President Obama's announcement as an important first step in allowing for much needed improvements to the immigration system. At the core of his proposals is that undocumented immigrants in the US for more than 5 years, who have children who are US citizens or legal residents, who register, go through background checks and pay their taxes, will be protected from deportation and given temporary legal status.  I particularly welcome a provision which, for the first time, albeit under limited conditions, will permit some travel from and to the United States for those undocumented Irish who are eligible to apply under the arrangements President Obama has announced.  Details as to how the travel provision will work in practice have yet to be confirmed but through our Embassy in Washington, we are following up on it directly with the White House and U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>  This clearly represents real progress, albeit with further important steps yet to be achieved, and I&rsquo;m happy that the relentless efforts of the Government and our Embassy and diplomatic missions in close partnership with the Irish community in the US have begun to bear fruit. I am determined that as many Irish nationals as possible will benefit from these changes and, to that end, our missions in the US will continue to work in partnership with the excellent Irish immigration centres there whose work my Department supports. At the same time, I am by no means complacent about what has yet to be done. I&rsquo;m well aware that some will not benefit from these new arrangements and that our work to encourage further changes in this area must be pushed forward proactively.</p><p>  It is clear that on immigration reform, as President Obama himself has indicated, there is no substitute for legislative action by Congress. The government and our Embassy will continue to work with the US Administration and with Republican and Democratic political leaders.  We already have strong friendships across both aisles in Congress and will keep building our network of friends on Capitol Hill. Through our Embassy and Consulates in the U.S. and through direct political contacts with the Administration and all sides in Congress, we will continue to encourage further steps that will reflect the concerns and needs of the undocumented Irish and their families, as well as ensuring improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.</p></reply>

The ban has had negative repercussions on our agri-food sector, with exports of diary and seafood most affected. The impact on Ireland of the Russian restrictions is being closely monitored by the Department of Agriculture and Food but it is clearly a setback to our plans for the Russian market.</p><p>  Minister Coveney is fully aware of the need to seek out alternative markets for Irish agri-food exports and has already had success in this regard with the opening of the Philippines to Irish beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat and Vietnam to Irish pigmeat. Earlier this month, he undertook a successful agri-food trade mission to China, which is a crucially important growth market for Irish food and drinks with vast import potential across a range of agriculture sectors. In the course of the week long mission a number of companies accompanying the Minister made substantive progress in advancing their commercial relationships in China.</p><p>The European Commission has also introduced a range of supports for EU farmers, growers and producers to mitigate the impact of the Russian ban. The Department of Agriculture and Food is working closely with the Irish dairy industry to ensure that it is well placed to avail of the supports available.</p><p>  My Department will continue to liaise with the Department of Agriculture and Food, including in the context of the Export Trade Council, in carefully   monitoring the impact on Ireland of the Russian sanctions and taking necessary action as required.</p></reply>

I saw for myself the impact of the crisis in South Sudan when I accompanied President Higgins on a visit to a refugee camp in Gambella, in Ethiopia, earlier this month.</p><p>  Kenya continues to be seriously affected by displacement and food insecurity. It is currently hosting some 450,000 refugees in Dadaab in the north-  eastern region of the country, many of whom have fled conflict and recurring drought in Somalia. In the northwest of Kenya, the Kakuma camp is hosting 100,000 people. Since the outbreak of conflict in South Sudan in mid-December last year, Kakuma has received over 40,000 new arrivals.</p><p>So far this year, international donors have contributed over US$68 million to support food assistance for refugees in Kenya. Nevertheless, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has indicated that, as a result of insufficient funding, it has made the difficult decision to reduce food rations for these refugees. We understand that the WFP will distribute half-rations until the end of January 2015.  The WFP has made it clear that special fortified food for children and pregnant women will continue to be provided.</p><p>  Ireland is a strong and consistent supporter of the work of the World Food Programme.  We have provided almost &euro;13 million in funding alone so far this year. This includes the annual contribution from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, of just under &euro;10 million, together with support of &euro;3 million through the Irish Aid programme.</p><p>  Ireland is also one of the largest donors to the UN Central Emergency Relief Fund (CERF).  We have contributed over &euro;100 million since 2006. This pre-positioned funding allows UN agencies to draw down quick and responsive support in severe and deteriorating crises. WFP has received over 30% of funding allocated from the CERF in 2014. Through the CERF mechanism, the WFP has been allocated over US$6 million for food assistance to refugees in Kenya.</p><p>I am very conscious of the strains on the humanitarian system globally. 2014 has seen a sharp and continued spike in humanitarian emergencies around the world, with an unprecedented number of crises, in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa and Central Africa. I am proud that Ireland has responded strongly and effectively to these growing needs through the Irish Aid programme, while also assisting &lsquo;forgotten&rsquo; humanitarian needs in regions like the Sahel.  In the coming weeks, I will consider further humanitarian funding, including to the CERF, to meet pressing humanitarian needs in the Horn of Africa and elsewhere.</p></reply>

I would call in particular for respect for the status quo in relation to the Holy Places. I note and welcome the pledge in this regard issued by Prime Minister Netanyahu and King Abdullah of Jordan in their meeting in Amman last week, alongside US Secretary of State Kerry.<br/><br/>While the resumption of talks is important, we believe that it is also important to work to influence and change those policies on the ground which are directly destructive of the chances for a peace agreement.<br/><br/>The separate question of Israel as an explicitly Jewish State is a complex one in internal Israeli politics, with no clear definition of what this would mean.<br/><br/>The reaction of the Palestinian President has been that it is a matter for Israelis how they define their state, so long as the equal rights of non-Jewish citizens are not infringed.

In 2012 a financial review of all CE projects was carried out. In addition, the Department undertook a separate review of the effectiveness of a range of employment supports which included CE. Due to the current economic circumstances, the Department has had to find significant savings in the Budget for 2012 and onwards. However there has been no decrease in the number of CE places allocated to projects.</p><p>  In relation to the recruitment of CE places, over the past 18 months representatives from the Department have on a regular basis met with representatives from community groups in the north-east inner city and political representatives to discuss CE projects and operations. As a result of these meetings a range of measures have been taken to address the concerns raised. These measures have resulted in an increase overall in the numbers of applications and people starting on CE.</p><p>  The Department will continue to work with CE schemes to assist in the referral of suitable applicants for CE vacancies, together with meeting various representative stakeholders to discuss the programmes and work towards their overall continuous improvement.</p></reply>

The limits (introduced in April, 2000) are 3 years participation for those under 55 years of age and up to 6 years participation for those of 55 years of age to state pension age (inclusive of any time spent on CE under 55). Persons in receipt of disability-related social welfare payments on entering CE may avail of one additional year on top of these limits, bringing the duration up to 4 years or 7 years respectively.</p><p>  Participation on CE prior to 3 April 2000 is not counted. Offshore island residents are exempt from this participation cap, subject to the availability of places on island-based CE schemes.  The participation limits are in place to allow for a turnover of places to give the maximum number of clients the opportunity of a CE placement.</p><p>  Over the least two years the number of CE places has been increased by 2,000 to 25,300. General recruitment onto CE is working well. Some recruitment issues that do arise tend to be with certain cohorts e.g. lone parents and persons with a disability which since the introduction of the cessation of receiving a dual payment in 2012 has led to a decline in participation rates.  </p><p>  The Department is doing its utmost to ensure that CE sponsors can recruit sufficient candidates for any vacancies arising through the local INTREO office and we will continue to monitor the situation to address any difficulties arising.</p></reply>

The State Laboratory makes use of an array of tests to determine whether a relevant adulteration of the petrol has occurred.  Revenue is also working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a joint investigation of a concentration of complaints in the midlands and west.</p><p>  All licensed filling stations in the midlands have been subject to compliance checks by Revenue staff over the past twelve months. Complaints alleging petrol stretching have been received in relation to eleven named filling stations in counties Westmeath, Roscommon and Longford and these are being investigated.</p><p>  A total of 129 samples of petrol from filling stations in the Border Midlands West Region have been referred for analysis to the State Laboratory following checks conducted from June 2014 to date.  Conclusive results have been received from the State Laboratory in two samples which indicate the contamination of petrol through the presence of kerosene. Files are being prepared for prosecution arising from these results.  To date, no evidence of fraudulently contaminated petrol has been found in any of the other samples referred for analysis and this includes the samples taken in the midlands.</p><p>  As part of Revenue's normal operating procedures, fuel delivery tankers are challenged when encountered by Enforcement officers throughout the Border Midlands West Region. No cases of contaminated petrol have been identified as a result of these checks from June 2014 to date.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are continuing their investigation in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are actively sampling suspect filling stations, monitoring deliveries of petrol and examining the supply chain in an effort to determine the origin of the suspect petrol. Petrol stretching is an offence under Section 102 (1A) of the Finance Act 1999. The Deputy can be assured that, if Revenue's investigations and the analysis of fuel samples by the State Laboratory indicate the presence of illegal stretching agents in petrol, Revenue will take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.</p><p>  Motorists themselves should take care about where they source their petrol and should report any suspicions to Revenue.  Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website specifically dealing with the shadow economy and this includes a reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices, including the adulteration of fuel.</p></reply>

While we can maintain the zero rating on those goods and services which were zero-rated before 1 January 1991, the equipment referred to in general terms by the Deputy does not fall within this category. Similarly, member states may only apply a reduced VAT rate to those goods and services set out in Annex III of the EU VAT Directive (2006/112/EC). Equipment for persons with special needs is not included in this annex. Therefore, it is not possible to apply a zero or reduced VAT rate to equipment for persons with special needs.</p><p>  There is provision for the refund of VAT incurred on qualifying goods for the exclusive use of disabled persons in the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No 15) Order 1981.  The order specifies the degree of disability and defines the qualifying goods as goods which are aids or appliances, including parts and accessories, specially constructed or adapted for use by a disabled person.  Voluntary organisations that work with children with special needs may claim a refund on VAT paid on specialist equipment provided that the conditions of the Order are met, in particular, that the equipment is supplied by the voluntary organisation, other than in the course of business, and that the equipment is used exclusively by a specific individual.  A Claim Form VAT 61A is available on the Revenue website (www.revenue.ie).</p></reply>

My Department has informed the European Commission of my intention to remove the excise relief element of the Scheme at the end of 2014 and replace it with a fuel grant in 2015. The European Commission has raised no objections.</p><p>  To give effect to this I signed a statutory instrument in March of this year (S.I. 139 of 2014) with the effect that Regulation 16 of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations (S.I. 353 of 1994) would be revoked as of 1 January 2015. As such, members of the Scheme may claim excise relief on any fuel used up to 31 December 2014. </p><p>  From 1 January 2015, current and prospective members of the Scheme will be eligible for a fuel grant in respect of fuel used during the year. At this time, I intend to maintain the current practice of paying the sum a year in arrears, so payments of the fuel grant in respect of fuel used in 2015 will take pace from January 2016.  </p><p>  As I informed the Deputy in July, I have instructed my officials to design the new grant in such a way to provide as seamless a transition as possible between the excise relief on fuel element and the new fuel grant and, as I stated in March, members of the Scheme will not be at a loss in the transition.</p><p>   Officials from my Department are continuing to engage with other Departments and the Revenue Commissioners in order to put in place the legislative, administrative and financing changes neccessary for the operation of the fuel grant. I intend to notify members of the Scheme of the details of the new fuel grant as soon as all the details are finalised.</p></reply>

The change in the VAT treatment coincided with the removal of excise duty from bottled water.</p><p>  Where a product was zero rated prior to 1 January 1991 but subsequently standard rated, it is not possible to reintroduce the zero rate for that product.  However, under Annex III of the EU VAT Directive, Member States are permitted to apply a reduced rate of not less than 5% to bottled water.  It would therefore be possible to apply our reduced rate of 9% or 13.5% to these drinks.  However, a reduction in the rate of VAT on such a product would be costly to the Exchequer and I have no plans to reduce the rate of VAT on bottled water. Such a reduction would also recreate the competitive anomaly that was corrected in 1992.</p></reply>

This ensures that those with very high incomes will only benefit to the same extent, as those with more modest incomes, reinforcing the highly progressive nature of the Irish income tax system.<br/><br/>The changes announced in the Budget will ensure that all those currently paying income tax and/or USC will see a reduction in their tax bill in 2015. However, in cases where individuals are not liable to income tax, USC or PRSI, changes to the tax system cannot provide them with a financial benefit. All employees earning less than &euro;18,304 are exempt from paying PRSI although an employer contribution is required to be made of their behalf.<br/><br/>I propose to continue this reform of the tax system in future Budgets, subject to the required economic growth and the consequent fiscal space available to the Government.</p></reply>

However, they have provided a number of anonymised examples:<blockquote>- Exemption claimed where a wealthy individual gifted a house worth &euro;400,000 to an adult child. <br /><br />- Exemption claimedin respect of &euro;90,000 of a cash gift to an adult child to purchase a car and furnish and maintain a house.  The adult child was not a dependent and had substantial income in her own right.<br /><br />- Taxpayer given free use of a credit card through which over &euro;150,000 was gifted in a two year period.</blockquote>The full extent to which this exemption is being abused cannot be determined because CAT is a self-assessment tax and there is no obligation to submit returns to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of any benefit that is exempt from tax under Section 82. However, in addition to cases identified by the Revenue Commissioners in the course of their compliance programmes, it has also been brought to their attention by a concerned tax practitioner that this exemption is subject to widespread abuse. <br/><br/>Over and above payments for support, maintenance or education, the legislation also exempts from CAT gifts up to &euro;3000 in any one year from any one personthus two parents can gift &euro;6,000 to each child in any year without giving rise to a CAT liability. Gifts over this amount only give rise to a CAT liability if the Group Tax Threshold (Parent to Child) of &euro;225,000 is fully utilised. Beyond these exemptions it is difficult to justify making any further allowance to parents who look for other means of making tax-free gifts to their children by trying to bring them within the terms of Section 82 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003<b>.</b></p></reply>

In particular, Section 1095 (4) states that 'a tax clearance certificate shall not be issued to a person unless:<br/><br/>(a) that person and, in respect of the period of that person's membership, any partnership of which that person is or was a partner,<br/><br/>(b) in a case where that person is a partnership, each partner, and<br/><br/>(c) in a case where that person is a company, each person who is either the beneficial owner of, or able directly or indirectly to control, more than 50 per cent of the ordinary share capital of the company,<br/><br/>has/have complied with all the obligations imposed on them by the Tax Acts.<br/><br/>In practical terms, I am advised by Revenue that a TCC is a written confirmation that at the date of issue of the certificate, a person has made all the necessary tax returns, paid the declared liability and there are no open issues of which the Revenue Commissioners are aware.  In some instances a certificate may be issued to a person who has tax arrears provided such arrears are covered by a phased payment arrangement that has been agreed with Revenue.  In the context of the self assessment system, applicants for a TCC are not subject to a Revenue Audit before the certificate is issued.<br/><br/>A taxpayer may apply for a TCC through Revenue's online system at or via manual application to the relevant local Tax District.  Where an applicant's tax affairs are fully up to date or, where any outstanding tax arrears are covered by an agreed phased payment arrangement, a TCC will normally issue within 6 working days.  My attention has not been drawn to any companies receiving a tax clearance certificate within one or two days of application as the Deputy describes.<br/><br/>Where an applicant's tax affairs are not in order (e.g. outstanding tax returns or tax payments) then a TCC will not issue until all of the outstanding matters are fully dealt with.<br/><br/>The Table below includes the numbers of TCC applications received in 2012 and 2013 and the numbers issued in 2011, 2012 and 2013.  It was not possible to collate the number of TCC applications that were received in 2011 in the time available.  The Deputy should be aware that in many instances businesses that are initially refused a TCC subsequently receive certification once their affairs are brought up to date.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Requested</th><th>Issued</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>227,989</td><td>177,050</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>220,268</td><td>170,220</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>-</td><td>171,998</td></tr></table><br/><br/>Finally the Deputy may be aware that following a review of the current tax clearance scheme by Revenue, I have brought forward a provision in the 2014 Finance Bill which, if passed by the Oireachtas, will lead to the introduction of a new electronic 'real time' system that will validate the tax clearance status of businesses/taxpayers on a continuous basis rather than just at the date of certification.  This new section will be subject to a Commencement Order to allow for the development of the ICT systems required to implement the new system.</p></reply>

These issues cannot be dealt with on a 'drop in' basis and instead are the subject of arranged appointments or correspondence.<br/><br/>The fastest and (for most taxpayers) the most convenient method of obtaining information or managing their tax affairs is through the Revenue website - , and through PAYE Anytime or ROS, the Revenue online service for business and self employed persons.  Of course internet services are not suitable for all people and circumstances, so, in addition to the public offices in Cork, Limerick and Tralee, taxpayers in the South West Region may choose to telephone 1890 2224 25 for PAYE queries: for business and general queries the telephone numbers are Cork (021)6027058, Limerick/Clare (061)212700, and Kerry (066)7161000.  Alternatively a taxpayer may write to the appropriate District office.  Full contact details are available on the Revenue website.<br/><br/>In addition to the public means of contact, tax professionals may (and usually do) directly contact the officer dealing with a particular case, or may use the secure email facility provided for them.  For urgent cases, the tax practitioner section of the Revenue website provides direct contact details for every District Manager.  For complex technical queries, the Revenue Technical Service, operating in each region, provides advice and guidance specifically for tax professionals.<br/><br/>Assisting customers to comply with their tax obligations is an important part of Revenue's mission.  Any specific complaints or observations in relation to the services provided  should be directed to the Regional Office, South West Region, Revenue House, Blackpool, Cork, telephone 021 6027016 or 021 6027018, email .</p></reply>

Under the terms of the facility, interest and commitment fees on the loan are rolled-up and added to the amount repayable by Irish Water at the end of the loan's term these rolled up amounts are expected by Irish Water to be approximately &euro;14 million by September 2015.  A fee is also payable by Irish Water to the Minister for Finance under the terms of the guarantee provided by the Minister.  To date Irish Water has paid &euro;4.8 million with a further circa &euro;5.6 million expected to be paid over the remainder of the loan's term.  The loan documentation deals with any payment default in a market standard manner.</p></reply>

The EFSF and EFSM can now complete the waiver process which will facilitate the first early repayment.

The ISIF Business Plan will be approved in due course by the new NTMA Board in consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Economic Impact Framework will seek to identify target areas for investment which have higher potential economic and employment impact, and will also facilitate the identification of categories of investment that would be expected to assist and accelerate normalisation of capital markets in Ireland post the financial crisis. <br/><br/>Because of uncertainty regarding investment opportunities that emerge or can be developed, the nature and shape of the ISIF's ultimate investment portfolio and the quantum of co-investment that can be achieved is not clear at this stage.  There will also be a time lag between the NPRF/ISIF commitment and when the economic impact takes place.  Therefore it is not feasible at this stage to estimate in advance what the economic activity and employment impacts of the ISIF may be.  The ISIF Business Plan and the new NTMA Board are expected to address this issue. <br/><br/>In the interim, the NTMA is developing its capabilities for collating and analysing data to measure and report on economic impact on an ex-post basis (i.e. after the investment has been made).  This will require a completely new data set to be sought and reported on by funds and the underlying companies in which funds have invested and by companies or project sponsors in which the NPRF has invested directly.  While it is standard practice that companies report financial information to their investors, the new ISIF mandate will also require metrics that can be used to help assess economic impact to be reported.  The NTMA expects to be able to publish a preliminary assessment of the economic impact of the investments made to date in Ireland after the Business Plan has been approved by the new NTMA Board.<br/><br/>The most recently reported balance for cash and cash equivalents in the NPRF Discretionary Portfolio was &euro;2,470 million as at 30 September 2014.</p></reply>

The Mortgage Arrears return was developed following individual and collective discussions with reporting institutions, and agreement on definitions and coverage.  The Central Bank undertakes extensive validation and consistency checks. While this can be kept under review, I am satisfied that the mortgage data as published is robust and of good quality.</p><p>  With respect to the treatment of mortgage accounts subject to arrears capitalisation in the  Mortgage Restructures data published monthly by my own Department, the same situation as for the Central Bank data applies.  It should be noted, that these are voluntary and unaudited returns by the relevant MART banks, and given the short timeframe in which the lenders provide this information to my Department, and more frequent report requirements, they have not gone through the lender's quality control process for regulatory return purposes.</p><p>  I believe that both the quarterly Central Bank mortgage arrears and repossession statistical release and the monthly mortgage restructures publication of my own Department show that the number of mortgage accounts in arrears continues to fall and that the number of accounts classified as restructured continues to increase on a quarterly basis.  It is also noteworthy that a significant percentage (81.2% at end June 2014) of such accounts are meeting the terms of their restructuring arrangement.  </p><p>  Both the Central Bank and my own Department will continue to keep the situation in respect of mortgage arrears under review.</p></reply>

Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes.  In general, the Act maintains the long-standing position that all commercial properties - including all private childcare facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools - are liable for rates.  </p><p>  Certain childcare and pre-school facilities can be exempt from rates under the terms of paragraph 16 of Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act, 2001, where the organisation is a charitable organisation, that uses its property exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for private profit.  The organisation claiming charitable status for the purpose of qualifying for exemption from rates must comply with the definition of &quot;charitable organisation&quot; as stated in PART 1 section 3 of the Valuation Act, 2001.</p><p>  Similarly, certain pre-school facilities can be exempt from rates where  the conditions detailed in paragraph 10 of Schedule 4 are met.  </p><p>  Inconsistency in the approach to the exemption of childcare and early education facilities from rates was raised at Committee Stage of the Valuation (Amendment)(No.2) Bill 2012 in the Seanad with Minister of State Simon Harris, who was taking the Bill through the Seanad on my behalf.  He undertook to consider what could be done in this regard.  As a result, I got Government approval for a Seanad Report Stage amendment to the Valuation (Amendment)(No.2) Bill, to insert into Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 an exemption from rates for the property of those that provide early childhood care and education on a not-for-profit basis.  This amendment was proposed and passed at Report Stage in the Seanad on 20th November 2014.  I intend that the Bill  will be considered by the D&aacute;il shortly.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-26a.174.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014112600077#WRK00400"><p>In addressing the two main issues which have been highlighted in the correspondence to which the Deputy refers, the following is the position regarding the proposition that economic factors should be taken into account when valuing real property for rating purposes and the requirement for regular revaluations. <br/><br/>Firstly, the Valuation Act, 2001 currently provides for the rateable valuation of relevant properties within a rating authority area to be reviewed periodically to reflect changes in value arising from economic factors.  The resultant valuations are all published on the same date and become effective for rating purposes at the same time.  This process of revaluation is provided for under section 19 of the Act.If there are changes in rents between revaluation dates then this may be reflective of a general downward movement in rents.  If all rents that were reduced resulted in changes on the valuation list then this would not necessarily result in a reduction in rates.  This is because the amount of rates collected is a function of the Annual Rate on Valuation set by the Local Authority multiplied by the valuation of a property on the valuation list.  Valuations could go down but the ARV would increase and there may be no change to the rates amount due.  The revaluation of all properties in a rating authority area takes place no sooner than 5 years and no later than 10 years after the first revaluation has taken place.  For example the next revaluation of South Dublin will be completed before the end of 2017.  This is also the standard model in other jurisdictions with an annual property charge similar to rates and is provided for in section 25 of the Act.As regards the<font color="#2F2F2F"> assumption  about delays underlying the concerns raised with the Deputy,</font>I have no reason to believe  at this stage that the revaluations will not be completed on time.<br/><br/>A separate process called revision of valuation provides for the value of an individual property to be amended or revised where a &quot;material change of circumstances&quot; has occurred in relation to the property.  Such a revision may only take account of purely structural alterations to a property or the subdivision of a property into two or more separate properties or the amalgamation of a property with one or more other rateable properties.  A review of valuation of an individual property arising from a change in economic circumstances would not be in keeping with the principles of valuation of real property in this or indeed in other jurisdictions which have a developed code of property valuation. <br/><br/>Any alternative would introduce significant volatility into the rating system, which yields in the region of  &euro;1.3bn annually in funding to local authorities, would further delay the national revaluation programme, would be very challenging to implement and would more than likely result in the introduction of an economic valuation system no longer based on property valuations but would become a type of economic audit of the business sector totally unsuitable for application as a base for local government funding.  There must be an appropriate balance between the costs of  rates for SMEs and the availability of adequate levels of funding to local authorities for the provision of essential local services enjoyed by SMEs and others.<br/><br/>It is imperative to maintain certainty and predictability for ratepayers, local authorities and other stakeholders between revaluations which is a fundamental principle of the rating system.  Fluctuations in the economic performance of a company or other entity in occupation of a property would not be measurable in a real estate context and would prove impossible to implement in a fair and equitable way.  The physical characteristics and features of a property are the only criteria that can be surveyed and quantified and which form a uniform basis for rates.  The use of economic factors such as business values and buoyancy may be used for the assessment of other taxes such as VAT and corporate taxes but are not considered to be suitable as a basis for a local property tax.<br/><br/>However, I accept  there may be limited circumstances where, because of the restrictive nature of the &quot;material change of circumstances&quot; provisions in the 2001 Act, it may be appropriate to amend a valuation, e.g. where an error occurred, or where a property has been adversely affected by infrastructural development in its vicinity and where the overarching valuation principles of equity and uniformity would ordain that such a revision should be carried out.Should such an eventuality occur, there is now, for the first time, provision in the Valuation (Amendment) (No.2) Bill, 2012 for the Commissioner of Valuation to address such anomalies.  This measure, introduced in response to submissions made by stakeholders during the consultation process, has been roundly welcomed.<br/><br/>The Bill, which was initiated in the Seanad, recently passed Report and Final Stages in that House and will now proceed to the D&aacute;il for its consideration.  </p></reply>

Net annual value is the rental for which one year with another, the building might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes and charges (if any) payable by or under any enactment in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant of the property </p><p>  Various methodologies may be used in estimating the net annual value (NAV/rental value) of a building.  The most common methodology used is the comparative method which as the name implies employs direct comparison with other similar buildings in the same rating area. </p><p>  In the absence of direct comparative evidence of value two other methods may be used.  The first of these is what is known as the receipts and expenditure method of valuation where trading accounts are analysed to arrive at the surplus available for rent and rates.  Another method of valuation used from time to time depending on the particular circumstances and type of building involved is the contractor's method.  This relies on the notional cost of constructing a building and the rental of that building will be related to the annual equivalent of the cost of construction, allowing for depreciation as appropriate, and the value of the site is used to arrive at the net annual value.</p><p>  There is also provision in the Act to allow for the valuation of buildings occupied by a public utility undertaking, e.g. an electricity or telecommunication company, to be valued on a global basis, whereby the valuation of all buildings are not valued on an individual basis but are taken as a whole on a nationwide basis and the valuation thus produced is known as a global valuation.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the levying of rates is a matter for local authorities and the amount of rates to be collected from a rated occupier whether a semi State company or otherwise is a function of the Annual Rate on Valuation or ARV set by each local authority, and the value of a property on the valuation list.</p></reply>

Of this total, tractors were involved in the fatalities of five of these children under seven years old.<br/><br/>The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is the national statutory body with responsibility for enforcing occupational safety and health law and promoting and encouraging accident prevention. It has conducted extensive campaigns to improve farm safety and to emphasise that children should not be placed at risk. A Code of Practice on Preventing Accidents to Children and Young Persons in Agriculture was first published in 2001. It was revised and re-issued in 2010, following the enactment of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005. The Farm Safety Partnership, an advisory committee to the Board of the Authority involving farmer representative organisations, assisted in the drafting and revision of the Code of Practice on Preventing Accidents to Children and Young Persons in Agriculture. Central to this code of practice is the principle that only children between the age of 7 and 16 may be carried in the cab of tractors or other farm machinery, and if carried must only be carried if on a seat with a lap belt provided.  <br/><br/>In 2008, the Authority launched an information Sheet on <b><i>Child Safety on the Farm. </i></b>A national farm safety awareness-raising programme run in primary schools resulted in the publication in 2013 of a children&rsquo;s book &lsquo;<b><i>Only a Giant Can Lift a Bull&rsquo;</i></b>which was sent to all primary schools and public libraries. <br/><br/>While all workplace fatalities are tragic, the death of a child is even more so, particularly as in most cases these fatalities arise out of farm work activity carried out close to the home. The grief over the loss of a child can only be exacerbated where circumstances show that the fatality could have been easily avoided through better health and safety awareness.<br/><br/>Reducing the number of farm fatalities remains a priority for the HSA and efforts will continue to embed a culture of <b><i>safety first</i></b>in the farming community.</p></reply>

The Act provides, inter alia, for the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives. The Act also ensures the enhancement of high standards of professional education and competencies. The Department of Health is responsible for oversight of the governance of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). The Department has no role in setting or approving registration fees.</p><p>  The Board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas. It has the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  These costs include an enhanced regulatory process with supporting systems for continued professional development and certain education and training requirements for the professions.</p><p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.  The Board of the NMBI made the decision to increase the annual registration fee at its meeting on 17th September, 2014.  A helpline, email address and website information page have been made available by the NMBI to provide clarification for registrants who may have queries on this matter. </p><p>  The Minister is aware that a campaign by the staff associations not to pay the fee is actively underway and is concerned regarding the possible implications for the health service and patient safety should this action continue.  The Department of Health requested the Board to give this matter very careful consideration at its meeting of the 19th November, with a view to agreeing and implementing a course of action most likely to achieve a satisfactory outcome. </p><p>  The Minister for Health continues to monitor the situation closely and has asked NMBI and the staff associations to continue these discussions in order to seek a satisfactory resolution in the interests of patient safety and continuity of care. </p></reply>

We have therefore always looked forward to being able to recognise a state of Palestine, in reality and not just as a symbolic gesture.</p><p>  Successive governments and Ministers for Foreign Affairs have considered that a state of Palestine, and Ireland&rsquo;s recognition of it, should come about as part of a comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East.  All our actions remain geared to that ultimate goal.</p><p>  Sweden&rsquo;s recent decision to recognise Palestine has brought this issue to the fore within the EU.  In a number of Member States, including Ireland, there have been strong parliamentary expressions of support for recognition &ndash; in most cases as an element of an overall solution.</p><p>  The Foreign Affairs Council which I attended last week began a discussion among EU partners about the question of recognition, which will continue over time.</p><p>  Clearly if there is no prospect of substantive peace talks resuming in the near future, then we will need to take close account of that in evaluating how we can advance our overall goal.</p><p>  Our position is not set in stone.  Against the background of a deteriorating situation on the ground, I will continue to consider any option, including early recognition of Palestine, which may advance the prospects for peace and help ensure that the two-state solution still has a chance of being realised.</p><p>  Finally, the question of international recognition of Palestine, while important, is not a magic wand to resolve the conflict.  Over 130 countries have already formally recognised Palestine, but the conflict continues.  Only a comprehensive peace agreement will end the occupation and allow the full establishment of a Palestinian state in reality, as well as in theory.  That is the consistent goal of everything the Government is doing on this issue.</p></reply>

In principle, each meeting involves the Secretary General of the Department as Chair as well as the Heads of Division at HQ at Assistant Secretary and above grade.<br/><br/>An innovation introduced in 2013 has seen the appointment on an annual basis of four to five other members at PO - Counsellor or equivalent grade, with a view to improving both the gender profile and overall representativeness of the MAC.  In another recent innovation commencing this September, a serving Ambassador has been asked to join the MAC, again on an annual basis.<br/><br/>In the past, meetings of the MAC normally took place on a monthly basis but, since the beginning of this year, meetings are normally held once a fortnight if possible.  On any given date, one or more may be unable to attend due to other commitments or absence.  Other Departmental officials attend MAC meetings periodically to brief and participate in discussions on topical developments in their areas of responsibility.  In the time available, it is not possible to confirm exactly who was present on each occasion.<br/><br/>Since my appointment as Minister, I have met very regularly with the members of the Management Advisory Committee and I have joined their own meeting on two occasions, most recently on 18 November last.  The Ministers of State at my Department are likewise in very regular communication with members of the Management Advisory Committee, but they have not participated in the Committee meetings.<table><tr><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>3 February </td><td>23 January</td><td>21 January</td><td>20 January</td></tr><tr><td>23 February</td><td>6 February</td><td>21 February</td><td>21 January</td></tr><tr><td>28 March </td><td>2 April</td><td>5 March</td><td>3 February</td></tr><tr><td>4 April </td><td>30 April</td><td>25 March</td><td>18 February</td></tr><tr><td>8 April</td><td>28 May</td><td>30 April</td><td>3 March</td></tr><tr><td>18 April</td><td>18 June</td><td>20 May</td><td>11 March</td></tr><tr><td>16 May</td><td>9 July</td><td>4 June</td><td>24-28 March inclusive</td></tr><tr><td>27 June</td><td>3 September</td><td>10 June</td><td>2 April </td></tr><tr><td>28 June</td><td>10 September</td><td>3 July</td><td>15 April</td></tr><tr><td>4 July</td><td>8 October</td><td>9 September</td><td>29 April</td></tr><tr><td>25 July</td><td>12 November</td><td>7 October</td><td>12 May</td></tr><tr><td>5 September</td><td>17 December</td><td>4 November</td><td>22 May</td></tr><tr><td>12 September</td><td></td><td>2 December</td><td>9 June</td></tr><tr><td>28 September</td><td></td><td></td><td>24 June</td></tr><tr><td>20 October</td><td></td><td></td><td>8 July</td></tr><tr><td>21 November</td><td></td><td></td><td>15 July</td></tr><tr><td>22 November </td><td></td><td></td><td>21 July</td></tr><tr><td>19 December </td><td></td><td></td><td>16 September</td></tr><tr><td>20 December</td><td></td><td></td><td>6 October</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>3 November</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>18 November</td></tr></table></p></reply>

I am also appalled by continuing reports of other violent attacks perpetrated since then by Boko Haram, including the explosion on 10<sup>th</sup>November at a secondary school in Yobe State in North-Eastern Nigeria which killed some 47 students and injured dozens more as they gathered for morning assembly.<br/><br/>I have given my full support to the clear demands of the United Nations Secretary General and the High Representative of the European Union that the girls abducted in Chibok be released and that those responsible be brought to justice.<br/><br/>Following the release of 27 hostages by Boko Haram in a separate case in Cameroon on 10<sup>th</sup>October, the Government of Nigeria announced that it was engaged in peace talks with an intermediary and that a ceasefire by Boko Haram had been agreed.  However, it now appears that the talks have ended and that Boko Haram has intensified its campaign in North East Nigeria.  I am deeply disappointed that hopes that the 200 girls would be released as a part of ceasefire arrangements in October have not been realised.<br/><br/>The EU as well as several individual EU Member States, the UN and the USA, continue to assist the Nigerian authorities in strengthening their ability to provide security and to combat terrorism.  Our Embassy in Abuja, working locally in cooperation with the EU and other key partners, remains in close contact with the Nigerian authorities on the difficult issues involved, given that they have primary responsibility for securing the safe release of the missing schoolgirls as well as addressing the broader security situation.</p></reply>

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we are working closely with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond towards achieving some relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the United States and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.  During my visit to the US from 23 September to 1 October I had a wide range of meetings on this important issue with both Irish community groups and high level government contacts, including Vice President Joe Biden, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and Secretary of State John Kerry.<br/><br/>As you are all aware, last Thursday President Obama announced new measures which should benefit thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants based in the US.  Pending further possible measures being considered by the US Congress, the President's measures are a step forward which will undoubtedly have a positive impact on immigrants' lives.  The Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers (CIIC) have welcomed President Obama's announcement as an important first step in allowing for much needed improvements to the immigration system.  At the core of his proposals is that undocumented immigrants in the US for more than 5 years, who have children who are US citizens or legal residents, who register, go through background checks and pay their taxes, will be protected from deportation and given temporary legal status.  I particularly welcome a provision which, for the first time, albeit under limited conditions, will permit some travel from and to the United States for those undocumented Irish who are eligible to apply under the arrangements President Obama has announced.  <b>Details as to how the travel provision will work in practice have yet to be confirmed but through our Embassy in Washington, we are following up on it directly with the White House and U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</b><br/><br/>This clearly represents real progress, albeit with further important steps yet to be achieved, and I am happy that the relentless efforts of the Government and our Embassy and diplomatic missions in close partnership with the Irish community in the US have begun to bear fruit.  I am determined that as many Irish nationals as possible will benefit from these changes and, to that end, our missions in the US will continue to work in partnership with the excellent Irish immigration centres there whose work my Department supports.  At the same time, I am by no means complacent about what has yet to be done.  I am well aware that some will not benefit from these new arrangements and that our work to encourage further changes in this area must be pushed forward proactively.<br/><br/>It is clear that on immigration reform, as President Obama himself has indicated, there is no substitute for legislative action by Congress.  The government and our Embassy will continue to work with the US Administration and with Republican and Democratic political leaders.  We already have strong friendships across both aisles in Congress and will keep building our network of friends on Capitol Hill.  Through our Embassy and Consulates in the U.S. and through direct political contacts with the Administration and all sides in Congress, we will continue to encourage further steps that will reflect the concerns and needs of the undocumented Irish and their families, as well as ensuring improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.</p></reply>

The issue has been discussed by Ministers at every meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council this year, most recently on 17 November.</p><p>  Since the outset of the crisis, the EU has been at the forefront of efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict.  We have strongly supported the OSCE, including through financial assistance and seconded staff, in their crucial role in both negotiating a ceasefire and monitoring its implementation.  The EU has also directly pursued the path of diplomatic dialogue to achieve an outcome to the crisis which fully respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.  At the UN level, we supported and worked to promote the adoption of the resolution on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.</p><p>   In response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and Russian actions to destabilise eastern Ukraine, the EU introduced sanctions which have been gradually stepped up as the situation on the ground has developed.  We believe that these sanctions are an effective means by which to encourage all sides to come to the negotiating table.</p><p>  The main forum for dialogue between Ukraine and Russia is the Trilateral Contact Group which was set up in June following the election of President Poroshenko.  The group, which is facilitated by the OSCE, meets regularly and provides a framework for ongoing dialogue between representatives of the Governments of Ukraine and the Russian Federation.  The Trilateral Contact Group negotiated the ceasefire and peace plan agreed in Minsk in September and is taking forward the work on implementing the commitments signed up to under the Minsk agreements.  It is crucially important that all parties live up to these commitments.</p><p>  A direct line of communication is also maintained between President Poroshenko and President Putin, who periodically speak by telephone.  They have also met on the margins of major international events.  The most recent talks between the two Presidents aimed at resolving the crisis took place during the ASEM summit in Milan on 17 October.</p></reply>

Many lessons have been learned from previous crises such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2010 Haiti earthquake.  Under the leadership of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), clear systems have been put in place to ensure the most effective, efficient and rapid delivery of aid possible.  Ireland has been playing our part in ensuring these reforms are implemented, so that responses are timely and effective, and meet the most critical, immediate needs.</p><p>  In total, over $6.25 billion in global humanitarian funding was provided for the response to the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004, far exceeding the original appeal, for $1.4 billion. Ireland pledged &euro;20 million in funding overall for the tsunami response and this pledge was met in full.  The bulk of Ireland's contribution was allocated to Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand where damages were greatest and the local capacities to respond were weakest.</p><p>  Two months after the January 2010 Haiti earthquake, an international donor conference was held in New York, at which US $4.5 billion worth of assistance was pledged by the international community over two years in response to a UN appeal for $1.5 billion.  UN figures indicate that, by the end of 2012, $2.38 billion of this had been disbursed; and $3.52 billion by 2014.  For our part, we worked hard to meet Ireland's commitments to the people of Haiti.  By the end of 2012, Ireland's pledge of &euro;13 million had been honoured and exceeded, with support totalling almost &euro;14 million.</p><p>  No official pledging conference took place in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan which struck the Philippines in November 2013, but according to the UN's Financial Tracking Service, as of 21st November 2014, more than US$845 million has been contributed by the international community in response to UN appeals. Ireland was one of the first countries to respond to this natural disaster and our contribution to date stands at over &euro;7.1 million.  This includes immediate life-saving emergency response and longer-term recovery and reconstruction support.  I am pleased to note that a delegation from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade will have an opportunity later this week to see the impact of Irish Aid support to projects to support the recovery of Tacloban in the Philippines.</p><p>  Ireland has a proud record of meeting our pledges and will continue to use all appropriate opportunities to urge our fellow donors to ensure that they meet their humanitarian commitments in full.  In order to promote the importance of ensuring that donor aid pledges are credible, achievable, and properly monitored, the OECD has published a 'Recommendation on Good Pledging Practice'.  This comprises a set of principles relating to pledging practice for financial undertakings to developing countries and is designed to serve as a benchmark to help OECD Member States frame future aid pledges in terms that are clear, practical, realistic, and capable of being monitored.  Ireland is fully supportive of this important initiative.</p></reply>

For Ireland, it is important to work intensively to advance the accession process with the current candidates and potential candidates.<br/><br/>The European Council has granted Candidate Status to six countries including Turkey, Iceland, Montenegro, Serbia, Macedonia and Albania. In addition, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo are potential candidate countries.<br/><br/>Enlargement is a conditional process: prospective member states must achieve progress on reforms in order to move forward on their EU paths and each of these countries is at a different stage on its path towards membership of the European Union.<br/><br/>They face unique challenges which they must attempt to overcome in order to align with the acquis communautaire, the body of common rights and obligations that is binding on all EU Member States.<br/><br/>The European Commission published its annual Progress Reports on 8 October. These outline in detail the extent to which the candidate and potential candidate countries have advanced to fulfil the necessary conditions. These reports are being examined in detail by all Member States, including Ireland, at official level, prior to consideration next month at the General Affairs Council.<br/><br/>Turkey was granted Candidate status by the European Council in December 1999 and the European Council agreed to begin accession negotiations in December 2004. Fourteen out of thirty-five Chapters have been opened and are now under negotiation.<br/><br/>Montenegro began accession negotiations in June 2012 and twelve negotiating Chapters are now open, of which two have been provisionally closed.<br/><br/>The European Union began accession negotiations with Serbia on 21 January 2014, and since then, the screening process has been on-going. This process is designed to determine the extent of Serbian alignment with the acquis communautaire. A major focus of negotiations ahead will be on the normalisation of relations between Serbia and Kosovo.<br/><br/>Association negotiations with Iceland remain suspended following a decision of the Icelandic Government in early 2013.<br/><br/>Macedonia was granted Candidate Status in 2005 but it has yet to open accession negotiations, pending a resolution of the name dispute with Greece.<br/><br/>Albania was granted Candidate Status in June 2014. Ireland supported this step as a signal of positive encouragement to the Albanian Government, and the region as a whole, to maintain reform momentum.<br/><br/>Bosnia and Herzegovina has not yet formally applied for EU membership and thus remains a potential candidate country. In recent years, Bosnia has been seeking to develop an EU coordination mechanism and to revise its complex power-sharing structures to facilitate the participation of minorities in political life.<br/><br/>Kosovo has continued negotiations with the European Commission on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), the first step on the EU accession path.  The SAA was initialled in July and future steps will be further discussed early next year.<br/><br/>Ireland looks forward to working with each country in support of their respective paths to EU membership.</p></reply>

Overcoming the legacy of recent conflicts in the region and promoting good neighbourly relations form an essential part of any candidate country&rsquo;s progress along its EU path.</p><p>  An assessment of the contribution to regional co-operation and participation in regional initiatives by each country is an integral part of the EU&rsquo;s annual progress reports, which this year were published on 8 October.</p><p>  There have been concrete examples of progress in enhancing good neighbourly relations in 2014 including in sensitive areas such as war crimes and police co-operation. In March, for example, a joint centre for police cooperation between Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia was opened in Trebinje in Bosnia.</p><p>  The floods which severely affected Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in May led to good co-operation across the region, between the two countries and to a strong EU response. Ireland contributed &euro;220,000 in flood relief.</p><p>  Other practical examples include an agreement on reducing the prices of roaming services on public mobile communications networks signed In September between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia.</p><p>  Since March 2011, Serbia and Kosovo have participated in the Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue. The aim of this dialogue is the normalisation of relations between Serbia and Kosovo. Numerous rounds held between 2011 and 2012 led to the breakthrough &lsquo;Brussels Agreement&rsquo; in April 2013, which covered a range of practical cross-border issues such as energy, telecoms and border management.

We have an obligation to strengthen our collective response so that the necessary skilled personnel and medical facilities are funded, mobilised and deployed to West Africa to help deal with the crisis.<br/><br/>The spread of Ebola to Mali is a particularly worrying development.  As of 20 November there have been 6 deaths there from Ebola.  It is essential that the all of the countries of West Africa are supported in making adequate preparations to prevent the further spread of the virus. Containment is possible, as we have seen in both Senegal and Nigeria.<br/><br/>Ireland will continue to play its part in the international effort to counter the spread of the virus, through the work on the ground of our Embassy in Sierra Leone and our significant financial support.  The EU and its Member States have now committed &euro;1.1 billion to the Ebola response.  This year, Ireland is providing over &euro;17 million, directly and through NGOs, to the countries in West Africa most affected by the ongoing crisis.  Some &euro;10 million is being provided through our annual development programmes in our partner countries, Sierra Leone and Liberia, focused particularly on strengthening the national health systems.  Ireland has provided funding of over &euro;4 million in recent months specifically for Ebola treatment facilities in both Sierra Leone and Liberia, as well as for contact-tracing, community sensitisation and child nutrition programmes, among other activities.<br/><br/>In recent days, Minister of State Sherlock and I announced an additional grant of &euro;221,000 for the supply of essential food and non-food items to families in Sierra Leone affected by local quarantine restrictions. There is a moral obligation on donors to meet funding pledges quickly and in full. It is only by tackling the Ebola virus in West Africa that we can ensure its spread will be arrested and lives saved.</p></reply>

Each year, the United Nations Secretary-General issues a report on children and armed conflict which lists all armed groups &ndash; both state and non-state &ndash; that recruit and use children. The most recent list, published in July of this year, includes 59 state and non-state armed groups operating across three continents.</p><p>  In 1996, the UN General Assembly voted to establish the post of Special-Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict.  In March of this year, the Special Representative and the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF) launched the &ldquo;Children, Not Soldiers&rdquo; campaign to end the recruitment and use of children by Government security forces in conflict by the end of 2016.  The campaign is being implemented in close cooperation with the eight Governments listed in the Secretary General&rsquo;s report for recruitment and use of children.</p><p>  In 1999, the UN Security Council passed its first Resolution highlighting the impact of armed conflict on children and condemning violations carried out in that context. With the adoption of nine Resolutions and several Presidential statements since then, the Security Council has developed important tools to strengthen child protection and to promote compliance with international standards.</p><p>  Ireland has engaged on this issue in various ways including through the core work of our aid programme in addressing poverty and under-development, which are major root causes of this problem.  Ireland has also actively supported more targeted and specific interventions area from supporting agencies including UNICEF as well as the International Criminal Court.  We have intervened on the issue at the UN and the Human Rights Council in 2014.</p><p>  Ireland remains deeply committed to addressing the issue of child soldiers.  Our approach is reflected in Ireland&rsquo;s Policy for International Development, &lsquo;One World, One Future&rsquo;, where we pledge to increase our engagement on the issue of child soldiers and children in armed conflict.</p></reply>

This co-operation at home is underpinned by the Local Market Teams, which are chaired by our Ambassadors in priority markets abroad.</p><p>  In the review of the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy, published earlier this year, seven additional high potential and exploratory markets were identified to increase our engagement with high growth markets in Asia, Latin America and Africa.</p><p>  Building on this review, new Embassies have been opened in Bangkok (Thailand), Jakarta (Indonesia), Nairobi (Kenya) and Zagreb (Croatia), alongside the reopening of Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy to the Holy See. Consulates-General have also been opened in Hong Kong (China), and Austin (Texas, USA) and a Consulate-General will be opened in Sao Paulo (Brazil) in the coming months. These new Embassies and Consulates will strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to take advantage of emerging opportunities in these important markets, and will complement the existing trade promotion work of our Embassy network.</p><p>  The contribution which economic diplomacy and the work of the Embassy network is making to the Government's objectives of job creation and growth has been an important theme in the preparation of the review of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy, which is being undertaken in my Department.

We will also continue to address the humanitarian consequences of the conflict and provide urgent assistance and support to the civilian populations within Syria and Iraq who have been displaced or suffered violations of their rights at the hands of ISIS and other extremists.</p><p>  Ireland is working to support strongly all international efforts, led by the UN Special Envoy, Steffan di Mistura, to promote a political resolution based on the Geneva principles and which provide for transition to an agreed, democratic form of government and the holding of genuinely free national elections in Syria.</p><p>  There must be accountability for the horrific violations of human rights perpetrated against the Syrian people. Ireland has long called for referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court as an important step in establishing any sustainable framework for peace in Syria. There must also be accountability for the criminal acts committed by terrorist groups against civilians of all nationalities.</p><p>  Since 2011, Ireland has provided over &euro;28 million in humanitarian support to Syria, delivered through UN partners and NGOs. In addition we have provided &euro;1.15 million in funding to our partner organisations responding to the crisis in neighbouring Iraq. Ireland has consistently advocated for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access, as well as for respect by all parties of International Humanitarian Law.</p><p>  In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees, Ireland will continue to advocate for a comprehensive regional response and increased support to host countries which is crucial to defuse the growing tension between host and refugee communities that could further exacerbate and extend this already entrenched and complicated conflict. In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees, Ireland will continue to provide assistance within our means as the situation evolves.</p><p>  There can be no complacency about the threat which ISIS and other extremists represent or about the need for urgent international action to confront this threat to us all.  This requires a wide range of actions including security responses to deny ISIS the freedom to attack civilians, action by the new Iraqi Government to promote inclusivity and ensure real Sunni representation within Iraq&rsquo;s political system and Government, as well as achieving a political resolution to the Syrian conflict. Humanitarian relief is also a critical component of the response to mass displacement of civilians fleeing the threat from ISIS and other terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq.</p><p>  UN Security Council Resolutions 2170 and 2178 adopted in recent months require all UN Member States to implement comprehensive measures to address the threat of terrorism including through such measures as taking active steps to prevent travel by persons suspected of planning or intending to participate in terrorist acts; cooperation in exchanging information on actions and movement by terrorists; prevention of recruitment and radicalisation of possible members of such groups, including through community outreach initiatives, and denying financial transfers to terrorist groups; and supporting the provision of bilateral assistance to States in developing national capacities to respond to foreign terrorist fighters.</p></reply>

It will be considered by the ERC, and the results of this consideration by my Department and the National Council for Special Education, but will not be shared with other Departments or statutory bodies.<br/><br/>  My Department has collected this data in order to consider potential revisions to the system of allocating Resource Teaching and Learning Support to schools on foot of recommendations set out in the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Policy Advice on &quot;Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools (May 2013) and the recommendations of the NCSE Working Group Report &quot;A Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs&quot; (2014).<br/><br/>The Working Group report recommended that a school's social context should be used because it can contribute strongly to the level of learning needs that students have. The report considered that, on the basis of available research evidence, the use of a school's social context is valid in developing an educational profile, as socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with the incidence of certain types of special educational needs, including low achievement in academic learning and emotional or behavioural disorders.<br/><br/>Details of the international and national research which support this conclusion are set out in Chapter 2 of the Working Group Report on Research Findings and Consultation Process and Chapter 3 Proposal for a New Model to Deliver Additional Teaching Resources for Students. <br/><br/>Further details are also available in Appendix 4 of the Report on International perspectives on models for supporting students with special educational needs.<br/><br/>  A copy of the Working group Report is available at www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

From then all persons employed as teachers in recognised schools must be registered with the Teaching Council, the professional standards body for teachers, in order to be paid by the State.</p><p>  More than 90,000 teachers are now registered with the Teaching Council.</p><p>  The commencement of Section 30 was widely publicised for several years in advance. In addition, teachers were notified of the changes through their payslips and through targeted communications in the preceding months to outline the change and to encourage registration.</p><p>  To continue to be paid from public funds, teachers are advised to maintain their registration with the Teaching Council and to apply to renew their registration in a timely manner. The Teaching Council provides an online renewal service as well as other means for renewal. While it is each teacher's responsibility to ensure their registration is up to date, the Council has a practice of alerting teachers when their renewal date is coming near, and there is a period of one month after the renewal date where late renewals can be processed without affecting the teacher's registration status. I believe these measures are fair and reasonable.</p><p>  Alongside Section 30, the Education Act 1998 (Unregistered Persons) Regulations 2014 were also put in place. This allows schools only in urgent or unforeseen cases to engage an unregistered person for up to 5 days.  This caters, in a measured and appropriate way, i.e. where there is a short-term absence because no registered teacher is available.</p><p>  While all matters in relation to the registration of teachers are kept under review, there are no plans at present to change the law to provide for registration for more than one year at a time.</p></reply>

The Circular explains that, in determining eligibility for learning-support teaching, priority should be given to pupils whose achievement is at or below the 10th percentile on standardised tests of reading or mathematics. <br/><br/>  In addition, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.<br/><br/>It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance. The teaching time afforded to each individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each child's individual learning needs. Schools also manage the process of deciding which subject areas to address in order to best support the childs individual learning needs.<br/><br/>Should a parent be dissatisfied with the manner in which the resources or facilities which have been provided to support their child's education are being applied in school, they should, in the first instance, raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school.</p></reply>

This bundle comprises one primary school, four post primary schools and one Institute of Further Education.<br/><br/>The site acquisition process for the school in question is underway, however, due to commercial sensitivities associated with property acquisitions generally, I am unable to provide further information at this time.

These reforms have three main pillars.  The first pillar is a new list of eligible programmes.  The current Internationalisation Register will be replaced by an 'Interim List of Eligible Programmes for Student Immigration Permission' from 1st January 2015.  In line with the strategic priorities identified under the International Education Strategy, only programmes which are accredited or recognised by Irish awarding bodies in the English language and higher education sectors will now be permitted to be listed.</p><p>  The second pillar of reform is an enhanced inspection and compliance regime and the third pillar relates to changes to the operation of the work concession.  These reforms are required to protect the educational and consumer interests of genuine international students, to tackle abuse of the labour market and the immigration regime and to safeguard the strong international reputation of high-quality Irish education providers.</p><p>  There has been an ongoing consultation in relation to changes to the regulatory and immigration framework in which the international education sector operates.  National policy in this area, signalling regulatory reforms in the sector to relevant stakeholders, is set out in the policy document Investing in Global relationships: Ireland's International Education Strategy 2010-2015, which was first published in September 2010.  The Task Force set up in May 2014 to find solutions for the students affected by the closure of a number of private colleges comprised membership and consultation with a number of key stakeholders including the Irish Council for International Students, the Higher Education Colleges Association, Marketing English in Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Quality and Qualifications Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>  Regarding the application process for QQI recognised courses, provision of private education, including English language training, is not subject to mandatory regulation in the State.  Therefore any person is free to set up a private college of education or a language school without having to come under the oversight of the Department or any of its agencies.  QQI operates ACELS (Accreditation and Co-ordination of English Language Services), which is a voluntary scheme that grants recognition to English language teaching organisations annually.  QQI wrote to all providers who have programmes on the current Internationalisation Register, informing them of the regulatory changes that would be coming into effect and inviting them to apply for ACELS recognition.  All private colleges had the opportunity to apply for ACELS recognition during the period 17th October 2013 to 31st January 2014.</p><p>  While my Department has not estimated the number of private colleges which may close as a result of these reforms, I am aware that the strengthening of regulations in this area could lead to further college closures in the short term. In this event, the priority of my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality will be to find a reasonable accommodation for genuine students affected.  However, it is expected that these reforms will have a positive impact in the longer term, as they will significantly enhance the overall quality of Ireland's international education offering, reduce the risk to our reputation from the activities of lower quality operators and enhance the net benefits of internationalisation to the labour market and wider economy.</p></reply>

This was done to provide clarity and certainty and ensure that water charges are affordable for customers.</p><p>  To implement the changed charging regime, and to provide those households who have yet to register with an opportunity to respond to the Irish Water customer registration campaign, so that they may avail of the new benefits and to receive accurate bills, households are encouraged to register by 2 February 2015.  Personal Public Service (PPS) Numbers will not be required for registration with Irish Water.  In compliance with the requirements of the Data Protection Acts, Irish Water will delete PPS data already collected during the customer registration process to protect customers&rsquo; data. Irish Water has developed a protocol in consultation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner to address this data removal exercise.</p><p>  Households that complete a valid response to Irish Water&rsquo;s customer registration process will, in the case of primary dwellings, be eligible for a &euro;100 water conservation grant, payable through the Department of Social Protection.  This payment is being made available to support more sustainable use of water, as part of the Government&rsquo;s objective of achieving greater water conservation among households, and will be available to all households (primary dwellings) including those in the group water sector and those with private wells or septic tanks.  As the aim is to provide a single annual grant to all eligible households for their primary residences, it will not be available for second homes.</p><p>  The Department of Social Protection will engage with eligible households to seek necessary PPS numbers and bank details for the purposes of grant payments.  It is envisaged that households will be required to make a statutory declaration that they have no outstanding bills for the provision of water services as part of this process.  The detailed arrangements for the operation of the scheme are being developed by my Department and the Department of Social Protection and consideration is also being given to the appropriate legislative basis for the scheme.</p></reply>

The ban proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in Dublin.  As well as bringing air quality levels into compliance with the then EU standards, the ban also had the effect of significantly improving human health in the capital. Research indicates that the ban in Dublin has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths. The ban was subsequently extended to other urban areas.<br/><br/>In August 2012, following a public consultation process, new solid fuel regulations were introduced with the aim of ensuring that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of certain residential solid fuels.  The ban now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide, including all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people, bringing the ban areas broadly into line with national EPA air quality management zones. While my Department keeps the matter under regular review, I have no immediate plans to extend the ban to new towns. However, boundary revisions are currently being prepared in Counties Kildare and Wexford, following consultation with local authorities.<br/><br/>Air quality monitoring by the EPA has shown that air quality is poorer in towns where the smoky coal ban does not apply, although there is evidence that smaller smoky coal ban areas tend to be less effective. The further extension of the ban to smaller towns on an individual basis may not be the most effective solution to addressing the problem of emissions from residential solid fuel use in these areas. Similarly, the border with Northern Ireland would present enforcement challenges if a national ban on smoky coal were unilaterally introduced. However, it is recognised that having different regulations between urban and rural locations is not ideal, as it results in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for citizens in different locations.<br/><br/>Under the auspices of the North South Ministerial Council, and in conjunction with the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, my Department has commissioned a study to inform a discussion on policy options to further address emissions from residential solid fuel use on an all-island basis. The study includes-<blockquote>- an assessment of the solid fuel market and barriers to the use of cleaner fuels;<br /><br />- consideration of the role and impacts of biomass (primarily wood and wood-based products) and the links to climate policy; and<br /><br />- an economic analysis addressing the potential positive and negative effects on the consumer, for example, resulting from potential fuel switching, the availability of smokeless fuels to supply an  all-island market and job creation opportunities in the manufacture and supply of smokeless fuels. </blockquote>A final report will be presented to the North South Ministerial Council in May 2015.</p></reply>

Section 13 of the Act provides that any rights or liabilities relating to the property transferred to Irish Water under section 12 shall also stand transferred to Irish Water.

The Orders, which are available in the Oireachtas library, provided for the transfer of a total of 970 contracts from the local authorities to Irish Water. My Department does not have data on the value of these contracts. </p><p>  Work is under way to prepare for the transfer of water services property from the local authorities to Irish Water and it is expected that further Orders will be made in this regard in the coming months. Work is also under way on preparing balancing statements for each authority in relation to their end 2013 position and this will be used in determining the value of liabilities to be transferred to Irish Water.</p></reply>

The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years with funding of &euro;281 million over that period.  It is being implemented on a transitional basis for 2014 with a budget of &euro;47 million, pending the roll out of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) in April 2015.<br/><br/>The SICAP is one of my key priorities.  The Programme&rsquo;s target groups are:<br/><br/>- Children and Families from Disadvantaged Areas<br/><br/>- Lone Parents<br/><br/>- New Communities (including Refugees/Asylum Seekers)<br/><br/>- People living in Disadvantaged Communities<br/><br/>- People with Disabilities<br/><br/>- Roma<br/><br/>- The Unemployed (including those not on the Live Register)<br/><br/>- Travellers<br/><br/>- Young Unemployed People from Disadvantaged areas.<br/><br/>In accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of the services to clients, the Programme is subject to a public procurement process, which is currently underway.  Stage one (Expression of Interest) has been completed. Stage two (Invitation to Tender), got underway on 20 October and will involve the successful applicants from Stage one being invited to apply to one or more Local Community Development Committees, in Local Authority areas, to deliver the programme. Contracts for SICAP will be determined following the outcome of the procurement process.<br/><br/>The procurement process for SICAP was open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme.<br/><br/>In Stage one, joint applications were encouraged and organisations of varying sizes (for example smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations) were invited to submit joint applications.<br/><br/>There have been no discussions between my Department and Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann. However, a meeting was held recently between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht in response to the issues raised regarding the continuation of funding for the Development Offices on the Islands concerned. My Department currently provides LCDP funding to five non-Gaeltacht islands - Bere, Sherkin, Inis Turk, Inis Bofin and Clare Island. It was recognised that the issues relating to these, non-Gaeltacht islands in question are outside of, and separate to, SICAP. However, both Departments fully understand the importance of the community development infrastructure on these islands and will collaborate to agree a workable solution. <br/><br/>In the meantime, LCDP funding, for the groups concerned, will continue until the end of March 2015.</p></reply>

There are a number of types of group schemes:<br/><br/>- Private schemes, which have no interaction with Irish Water, and<br/><br/>- Public schemes, which receive their water in bulk from public supplies, but manage their own networks and set charges for their customers; these schemes will remain non-domestic customers of Irish Water for the bulk purchase of water and current tariff arrangements, as applied by local authorities prior to 1 January 2014, will continue until non-domestic charges are reviewed by the CER. <br/><br/>There are also some group schemes, which have no management structures, and have had arrangements with local authorities, whereby the scheme members were effectively treated as public water users, with the local authority billing where appropriate and managing the network. These arrangements will continue to be applied by Irish Water unless the scheme members decide to fully reconstitute the group scheme. <br/><br/>My Department will work with the group water sector to produce a new investment programme lasting until the end of 2018 and to revise subsidy arrangements, so they are aligned as far as possible with the approach to subsidy for public schemes, but tailored to the particular circumstances of the group water sector.  My Department has met with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and has agreed the following general principles, under which to conduct the subsidy review:<br/><br/>- Fair treatment between drinking water consumers in the public and group sectors, taking into account the inherent differences in structure, funding and organisation between the sectors including the ability of individual schemes to set the price of water based on their own local circumstances;<br/><br/>- Recognition of particular cost structures in relation to the extent of networks in a rural environment with dispersed populations and the variation between publically sourced and privately sourced (DBO and Non-DBO) schemes;<br/><br/>- My Department continuing to recoup local authorities based on subsidy claims from group water schemes;<br/><br/>- Subsidies continuing to be tied to conditions which support customer charters, compliance, and optimal management and operational practices in the sector;<br/><br/>- Ensuring that the combination of capital grants and operational subvention provides schemes with the capacity to sustain drinking water quality improvements;<br/><br/>- Arrangements that are as straightforward as possible recognising the scale and administrative capacity of the sector; and<br/><br/>- Promotion of water conservation and source protection.<br/><br/>Households in the group water sector who respond validly to the Irish Water customer registration campaign will be eligible for the annual &euro;100 water conservation grant.</p></reply>

I understand that Irish Water has engaged with the householder as detailed, and will continue to engage until this issue has been resolved.<br/><br/>Similar to the approach it has taken in the electricity and gas industries, the Commission for Energy Regulation has required Irish Water to submit a Customer Handbook outlining the minimum requirements of customer service standards they will provide to their customers.  The Customer Handbook comprises Irish Water&rsquo;s Customer Charter, Codes of Practice and the Terms and Conditions of supply.  Following a public consultation on the document earlier this year, the CER have recently published the approved Irish Water Customer Handbook on their website, at<br/><br/>The CER and Irish Water have also agreed to enter into a voluntary &lsquo;Dispute Resolution Agreement&rsquo; which will set out agreed working arrangements and processes to deal with customer disputes.  The Irish Water Code of Practice on Complaint Handling has been updated to reflect this agreement. In addition, the CER will be engaging with both Irish Water and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop complementary complaints processes to ensure customers are directed in an efficient manner to the appropriate organisation with their complaint or query.  In this regard, it should be noted that Irish Water is also subject to statutory supervision by the EPA and the Health Service Executive in respect of any environmental and human health aspects of its water services provision.</p></reply>

Irish Water is providing landlords with the opportunity to prove that they are not the occupier by providing the tenants name. This will allow Irish Water to contact the tenant to complete the registration and to bill the tenant. The tenant will have to register with Irish Water to avail of the water conservation grant or to get lower charges than the default capped charge (&euro;260), where they are single adult occupants or their metered usage is less than the maximum charge.</p><p>  Draft legislation which I will be bringing forward will place certain obligations on landlords where the tenant has not paid charges. In the case of tenants in private rented accommodation, the legislation will seek to insert into all tenancy agreements/leases a deemed obligation on the tenant to discharge their liability for water charges. On the changeover of a tenancy, the registration of a new tenant with Irish Water would be conditional on all water charge arrears being discharged and, in the event of the former tenant not discharging those arrears, the landlord would be entitled to withhold the amount concerned from the tenant&rsquo;s deposit and would be required to remit the amount involved to Irish Water. I have asked my Department to consult with property owner representatives in the course of drafting the legislation.</p><p>  In the case of local authority tenants, where deposit arrangements do not apply, and where a customer is in arrears for more than 12 months and a late payment fee has accrued, Irish Water, having firstly provided the customer with the opportunity to pay the arrears or enter into a payment plan, will advise the local authority concerned of the amount of the arrears. The legislation would provide for the local authority to recover the amount outstanding over a 12 month period and to remit the amount involved to Irish Water.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-26a.453.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014112600097#WREE00600"><p>There are currently two mortgage-to-rent schemes in operation through my Department. A scheme exists whereby a local authority (LA) can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (LA- mortgage-to-rent). The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage, which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (AHB-mortgage-to-rent). Both schemes are designed to assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are now unsustainable, and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.</p><p>  On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears the Government launched the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012 and extended it nationally in June 2012. The scheme is currently in operation and continues to accept applications from lending institutions.</p><p>  A total of 2,558 cases have been submitted to the end of October. 1,034 were ineligible or terminated during the process with a further 46 units not progressing as agreement on the sale could not be reached.  50 transactions have been completed under the scheme.  1,044 are currently with the lenders who are seeking the consent of borrowers to share information and for the carrying out of an independent valuation, and the remaining 384 are actively being progressed.</p><p>  Separately, my Department has funded 36 cases under the Local Authority scheme to date. The Department currently has 40 LA mortgage to rent applications on hand and expects to receive a small number of additional applications by the end of 2014.</p><p>  In an effort to increase the numbers delivered under the AHB scheme a new protocol between all parties in the process was agreed and came into operation in June 2014. The protocol includes such measures as the provision of a single independent valuation for the purpose of agreeing the purchase price. The valuation and condition surveys will now be carried out earlier in the process to give more certainty to all parties in the process, including the borrower. The new protocol is endeavouring to ensure that as much certainty is being provided as early as possible in the process to minimise uncertainty and late withdrawals from the scheme.</p><p>  Also in June 2014, my Department issued revised guidelines to local authorities for dealing with mortgage arrears within their sector under the LA scheme. There are currently no plans to amend the LA scheme, which is at an early stage of operation, but its workings will be kept under constant review. I am confident that delivery will accelerate as a result of these changes.</p></reply>

This is why, at the request  of my predecessor, a high level stakeholder body, the Cork Airport Development Council (CADC), was established by the DAA.   The aim of the CADC is to provide a forum for senior stakeholders from a range of sectoral and geographic backgrounds who have an interest in the development of Cork Airport to engage with management at the airport and to help contribute to traffic and route growth.  The Council is chaired by DAA Chairman Padr&aacute;ig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and comprises senior representatives from the tourism and business sectors in the Cork region who are actively engaged in achieving the goals set for the Council.</p><p>  I believe that there are opportunities, particularly in the tourism sector, to grow incoming passenger numbers to the Cork region.  I am calling on all relevant stakeholders to work together to exploit those opportunities and to deliver benefits not just for the airport but for the wider region.</p><p>  In relation to the intention of Aer Lingus to suspend routes from its summer 2015 schedule, it is a matter for the airline to decide which routes they will serve based on their own commercial judgments, taking account of the demand for services.  Any decision to suspend a route is an operational decision for Aer Lingus management.   I am nevertheless disappointed by the decision of the Company in this instance. </p><p>  I am aware that the DAA's objective is to halt the decline in passenger numbers in the short term and to return Cork Airport to growth in the future.  I am confident that the DAA and Cork Airport management, working with stakeholders in the region, can achieve this objective. </p></reply>
