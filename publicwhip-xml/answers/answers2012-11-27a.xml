These include enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s pollution preparedness and response capability, improving Coast Guard volunteer oversight, training and management, addressing deficiencies in legislation relating to maritime safety and addressing various measures to promote greater efficiencies within the services.  I have informed the Government that I will consider the reviews and prepare an action plan to address the deficiencies identified. </p><p>  When I published the reviews in July last I made it clear that I would not accept or reject any of the recommendations until a full assessment of the proposals had been undertaken and actions prioritised to address the issues identified as requiring attention.  This process of assessment and preparation of the action plan is in hands in my Department and I expect it will be completed shortly.</p><p>  In publishing the reports I emphasised that preparing the action plan provides a valuable opportunity to create more efficient and effective maritime safety regulatory arrangements and emergency response services.  At the same time, it is important to recognise that resources available to the maritime services are very limited and they have to be deployed on a prioritised basis and as effectively and efficiently as possible to address the most urgent needs.   </p></reply>

Aspects of these questions were answered earlier as part of my response to Deputy Wallace's priority question on the Gathering 2013.  </p><p>  The full list of committed or pledged events for the Gathering Ireland 2013 is on the www.gatheringireland.com website and has already exceeded 1,300 events and activities.  An announcement of the key headline events will be made in the coming week.</p><p>  On the Gathering Ireland 2013 generally, there has been a fantastic response to the initiative across the board, from local communities, voluntary bodies, public bodies, businesses and Government.  For example, a special fund of &euro;2 million has been made available to support local Gathering events by IPB Insurance Ltd matching a contribution from my Department via the Gathering team.  The funds will be distributed via the 34 city and county councils and the applications process is open until 30 November.  The key qualifying criterion is the ability of the event to attract overseas visitors.  </p><p>  Meanwhile, Tourism Ireland has commenced a major promotional drive for the Gathering in markets across the world and has worked with business networks, clans, cultural and sporting associations, Irish Clubs and societies encouraging them to promote The Gathering to their networks and to mobilise members to organise events in Ireland during 2013.  The second stage of Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s strategy commenced in autumn and will continue into 2013 with a major consumer campaign to promote The Gathering Ireland 2013 in key markets including Britain, the US, Canada and Australia.  Minister Ring, the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and I have attended events during the year to promote the initiative overseas.  I saw myself in Australia last week the tremendous response to the call to come and join in the celebrations, from those with Irish roots and those with none.</p><p>  Tourism is a valuable service export.  Encouraging those from overseas, whether Irish or not, to sample our tourism offering is not a shakedown &ndash; any more than exporting other goods and services.  With the hotel and accommodation sector already generating additional employment since this Government came into office, tourism can offer jobs to those who might otherwise face a choice between emigration and unemployment and I apologise to nobody for seeking to increase that employment still further by investing in the Gathering.  There is also a parallel aim to further strengthen our connections to all of those overseas who have a kinship with Ireland and I saw myself in Australia how much our diaspora values that objective.     </p><p>  Finally, as well as regular briefings from the project team, the Gathering is on the agenda in many, indeed most, of my meetings, with the tourism industry, transport operators, sporting bodies, other Ministers and indeed overseas representatives.  Even if some are carping, I am determined to continue to promote this unique opportunity for us to show the world all that is best about Ireland and I know the vast majority of Irish people, at home and abroad, will do so.</p></reply>

No. 330 of 2012).  </p><p>  The EU requirements cover the design of the card and the categories of information to be included on the face of the licence.  There is a relatively small amount of space left for Member States to add other printed information.  I have decided that this will be used to include an indication of willingness to be an organ donor, should the holder wish.  </p><p>  While there would not be sufficient space to print much additional information, there is a facility for the licence to contain a microchip.  Discussions are currently taking place regarding the information that will be contained on the active chip.  There may be data protection and privacy issues, though, and it could be legally difficult to make the inclusion of medical information mandatory.   However, I am certainly willing to consider emergency information as something which might be included there.     </p></reply>

Discussions on the commercial elements are continuing between Dublin City Council and JC Decaux (the operators of the current scheme).</p><p>    Funding provision to meet the capital investment costs of the roll-out of public bikes in other cities has been identified within the 5-year capital funding allocation for Smarter Travel and Carbon Reduction Measures.  However, operational funding is not available from within the constrained current funding allocation.  Their commercial viability requires a collaborative approach with the private sector.</p><p>     The NTA has procured technical consultants who are progressing the design and arrangements for the bikes schemes in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.

Firstly, I must state that I have no regulatory function in relation to the car rental industry. </p><p>  The National Consumer Agency, which comes within the remit of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, is responsible for the enforcement of the Consumer Protection Act 2007. That Act provides for the regulation of quotes or other communications by traders to consumers relating to the price of goods and services, including car rentals.  Consumers who have been subject to misleading or unfair practices by car rental companies may make a complaint to the Agency.     </p><p>  I am also informed by the NCA that under Article 22 of Directive 2011/83/EU on Consumer Rights, a trader must seek the express consent of the consumer to any extra payment in addition to the payment agreed upon for the trader&rsquo;s main contractual obligation.  If this express consent is not obtained but has been inferred by using default options which the consumer is required to reject in order to avoid the additional payment, then the consumer shall be entitled to reimbursement of this payment.  While Member States are not required to transpose the Directive until December 2013, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation intends, subject to legal advice, to enact Regulations giving effect to Article 22 in early 2013. </p><p>  Article 6 of the Directive will require car hire companies and other traders, before the consumer is bound by an online or other distance contract, to provide information in a clear and comprehensible manner about the &lsquo;total price of the goods or services inclusive of taxes&rsquo; and, where applicable, about &lsquo;any other costs&rsquo;.  If the trader has not complied with the Article&rsquo;s provisions on such additional costs, the consumer will not be required to bear those costs.  </p><p>  The transposition of the Directive will greatly assist tourists travelling for The Gathering in obtaining clarity in relation to their online car hire bookings.</p><p>  Furthermore, the two tourism agencies under the aegis of my Department are aware of this issue and have recently updated their websites to help make tourists aware of issues pertaining to car rental, and to help them avoid unnecessary charges.</p><p>   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-27a.52.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112700050#WRA04300"><p>I fully support the central aim of the National Substance Misuse Strategy in reducing the level of alcohol consumption and binge drinking in Ireland.  However, I also recognise that moderate and responsible alcohol consumption is not harmful and that there is no case for denormalising alcohol consumption in the way that was appropriate for tobacco.  Any measures introduced should be evidence based, effective and proportionate, and should have regard to the potential downsides that may occur.</p><p>  As I have stated before, I believe that a legislative ban on sponsorship would have negative consequences for sport and tourism.  There are huge economic, social and health benefits accruing from sport.  From a health perspective alone, there are clearly significant benefits for individuals and for our health system in maintaining and increasing participation levels in sport. One of the goals of my Department is to contribute to a healthier and more active society by promoting sports participation.  However, it is important that funding is available to sports organisations to ensure that sport is maintained at grassroots level so that as many people as possible can participate.</p><p>  Also, it is my view that sport plays an important role in diverting young people away from alcohol.  The financial support provided through sponsorship is integral to the availability of sport at grassroots level and I am concerned that placing constraints on the sporting organisations by eliminating the alcohol industry as a source of sponsorship will have a negative impact on the development and availability of sport, particularly in the current economic climate. </p><p>  Furthermore, it must be recognised that many of the major sporting events in which Irish teams compete are international events and are directly or indirectly broadcast into the State by foreign broadcasters.  Were Ireland to ban alcohol sponsorship, the only effect would be to exclude the Irish sporting organisation from sponsorship money while the advertising occurred anyway.  I also note that Britain, having recognised the failure of the 'Loi Evin' in France to reduce alcohol consumption by young people, decided not to ban alcohol sponsorship of sport for evidence based reasons.</p><p>  I would draw the Deputy's attention to a recent <i>ESPAD Report  on Substance Use Among Students in European Countries.  </i>This report monitors substance use among 15&#8211;16-year-old European students in order to monitor trends within, as well as between, countries.  Given the 'Loi Evin' it is worth noting the comparisions between Ireland and France.  Since 1999, the proportion of these young people reporting having had five or more drinks on one occasion during the past 30 days in Ireland this has decreased by 17% to 40%.  In comparision this has increased by 11% in France to 44%.  <i> </i></p><p>  My Department has engaged with and continues to engage with the Department of Health with regard to proposals which that Department is bringing forward. </p></reply>

Whilst much of this reduction in emissions can be attributed to the contraction of the economy, savings are also being made due to policies and measures such as mobility management schemes, and promoting modal shift to cycling.  In particular, the motor taxation and vehicle registration taxation rebalancing introduced in mid-2008 has encouraged the entry of more energy efficient new cars to the fleet, leading to significant reductions in the associated greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition, the Biofuels Obligation Scheme started operation in mid-2010 with biofuels displacing petrol and diesel use in the transport sector.</p><p>  However, the country faces considerable challenges in meeting EU 2020 targets and developing a low-carbon emission pathway to 2050.</p><p>  Initiatives within the transport sector to address our carbon reduction targets are identified in Smarter Travel - Our Sustainable Transport Future, most of the actions in which continue to be pursued despite the current economic climate.  An assessment of least-cost, effective, additional measures across all sectors including transport was recently carried out by the NESC Secretariat which highlighted again the key role being played by the motor taxation and vehicle registration taxation rebalancing to secure the earliest entry of more energy efficient cars to the fleet and proposed some potential new measures, mainly in the freight area, which my Department is examining.  However, it is important to note that the potential savings from such measures remain small in the context of total sectoral emissions.</p></reply>

Currently the Scheme accounts for about 25% of the Irish Sports Council&rsquo;s investment in high performance sport and it has contributed to the measurable improvement in performances in recent years.  The Irish Sports Council published a review into the future of the International Carding Scheme on 16 November.  This review includes a number of key recommendations.  Details of the Carding Scheme for 2013 will be announced in the new year. </p><p>  The Irish Sports Council is also carrying out a review of performances at the London Olympic and Paralympic Games.  A series of debriefs with relevant National Governing Bodies of Sport are close to completion.  Recommendations from the debriefs will inform the performance plans of each targeted sport for the next Olympic cycle to Rio 2016.  </p><p>  I have referred the Deputy's question to the Irish Sports Council for a more detailed response.  I would ask the Deputy to inform my office if a reply is not received within 10 days.  </p></reply>

I am also aware that the NTA is undertaking a consultation process in relation to its review of taxi fares which is underway.</p><p>  The Taxi Regulation Review Report 2011 contains 46 separate actions aimed at improving standards, administration and enforcement within the taxi sector.  All of the recommendations of the Taxi Review are being progressed by the NTA, with 10 actions already completed, including those relating to the sharing of licensing and operational information between the NTA and the relevant agencies &ndash; the Revenue Commissioners, Department of Social Protection and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is my intention that all of the actions arising from that Review will be implemented in full.</p><p>  I understand that the NTA is to launch an IT portal which will be operational in January 2013 to facilitate a means of establishing the identity of the authorised driver of a small public service vehicle, as proposed under Action 40 of the Review.  This will also support the implementation of and the submission of information with regard to taxi rental arrangements in line with Action 39 of the Review which provides that the practice of renting taxi licences only (i.e. without the vehicle) while facilitating the continuation of &quot;full package&quot; taxi rental which includes the vehicle, complete with roof sign, taxi meter and printer.   The IT portal will facilitate a mandatory obligation on licence holders for self-declaration concerning details of other employment as proposed under Action 3 of the Review Report, which seeks to ensure, in the case of part-time drivers, improved compliance with working time legislation.</p><p>  The Taxi Regulation Bill 2012, to be published in this quarter, will replace the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 in order to strengthen the legislative basis for the regulation of the taxi sector and give effect to many of the enforcement measures proposed in the Taxi Review.  I hope that the new legislation can be enacted early in the new year.</p><p>   </p></reply>

Once such a device becomes available I will move to have it introduced as quickly as possible.</p><p>  In advance of any technological measures, I propose to introduce legislation to allow  for the introduction of roadside impairment testing for use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This testing consists of simple, physical, cognitive tests such as walking a straight line, tipping one&rsquo;s nose or counting while standing on one leg and will assist the garda&iacute; in determining whether a driver is incapable of having proper control of a vehicle.</p></reply>

As the Investment and Capital Expenditure Framework 2012-2016 did not include a financial provision for this project, an additional multi-annual allocation is required to cover the Exchequer element of the project costs.  As the allocation of such funds is related to the planned sale of State assets, clarification has been sought from the Department of Public Expenditure on the timelines involved.  Once appropriate funding arrangements are put in place, the NRA will be in a position to prepare the project implementation schedule.</p></reply>

This would bring the total subvention for this year to &euro;278m, higher than the subvention level for 2010 and is the fifth highest level of subvention ever. To date &euro;16 million of the additional subvention has been paid by the National Transport Authority to CI&Eacute; and the remaining allocation will be paid before the end of 2012.</p><p>  The Government plans to again allocate very significant funds to support and maintain public transport services across the country in 2013. There will however also be a need for further cost efficiencies to be achieved so that the public transport system can be effectively delivered.</p><p>  My Department and the National Transport Authority are working with public transport operators to increase the efficiency and attractiveness of existing public transport services.  We are not in a financial position to make further significant investment in our public transport network but we can get a better return from our existing public transport system, through targeted investment, better use of resources and by using smart technology to make public transport more responsive and user friendly.</p><p>  Targeted investment is essential in these financially straitened times. An example is the Luas BXD project to link the LUAS lines. Government has also continued to invest in the bus companies, including the recent decision to purchase 80 new buses for Dublin Bus at a cost of &euro;26m and 60 new buses for Bus &Eacute;ireann in 2011 at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;19m. Considerable funding has also taken place in recent years on measures to make public transport more attractive such as the Leap Card, Real Time Passenger Information, Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) and providing wi-fi.</p><p>  CI&Eacute; is progressing the preparation of a revised 5-year Business Plan to address the underlying financial challenges facing CI&Eacute; so that the CI&Eacute;&rsquo;s public transport services can be provided efficiently and cost effectively over the Plan period.</p></reply>

I am confident that the VAT reduction has helped to sustain employment and businesses by making them more competitive.</p><p>  That is why the rate is being maintained in 2013.  This is a further example of the importance that Government attaches to the tourism industry and its contribution to the economy, particularly in the context of continued pressure on the public finances.</p></reply>

As I stated to the Deputy in October, it is my view that the existing policy requires revision to ensure that all of our ports are provided with an appropriate development framework, reflective of their particular circumstances as well as their current role and future potential from a national freight facilitation perspective.  The new policy will therefore seek to provide all of our ports with a policy framework that will allow for their future development in a manner that best suits their individual circumstances.</p><p>  The Port of Cork handles approximately 19% of all seaborne trade in the State and offers services in both the unitised and bulk market sectors. It is clearly therefore an integral part of our commercial port network and an important facilitator of trade from both a national and regional perspective. This will be recognised within the new ports policy.</p></reply>

Bus &Eacute;ireann operate a mix of services.  Some of these services are commercial services (Expressway) in which they compete on the open market with private operators but do not receive a subsidy either directly or indirectly, while they also operate Public Service Obligation (PSO) services.  A PSO payment is made for the company to carry out necessary bus services which would otherwise not be viable.  Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s services were not as direct as their competion (be that other bus companies, the railways or travelling by car) and due to that, and the recession, they have lost passengers and revenue.  In order to gain competitiveness they have, therefore, had to re-design their Expressway services.</p><p>  I appreciate that changes to the bus services have inconvenienced some passengers.  However, given the financial position that Bus &Eacute;ireann and the CI&Eacute; companies find themselves in, there is no alternative for the companies but to ensure that commercial operations operate on a commercial footing and that, unfortunately, limits their scope for changing the services.  I have no plans to privatise Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p></reply>

The Government also intends to hold referendums on abolition of the Seanad and on reform of our Courts system.</p><p>  In addition, the Constitutional Convention will hold its inaugural meeting on Saturday next, 1 December. Over the next year, the Convention will consider a wide range of questions: reducing the Presidential term of office to five years and aligning it with the local and European elections; reducing the voting age to 17; review of the D&aacute;il electoral system; giving citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in Presidential elections at Irish Embassies, or otherwise; provision in the Constitution for same-sex marriage; amending the clause on the role of women in the home and encouraging greater participation of women in public life; increasing the participation of women in politics; removing the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution; and such other relevant constitutional amendments that may be recommended by the Convention.</p><p>  The Government has formally committed to giving a public response, through the Houses of the Oireachtas, to each recommendation from the Convention within four months of receiving it, and we will arrange for a debate in both Houses on that response. If we accept a recommendation that the Constitution should be amended, our response will include a timeframe for the holding of the necessary referendum.</p></reply>

I am also meeting the Cypriot Foreign Minister on 19 December 2012.  In January the College of Commissioners will come to Dublin to meet the Government.</p><p>  Next month I will attend the General Affairs and Foreign Affairs Councils and will have the opportunity to meet my counterparts.

The programme is central to our foreign policy, has an enviable international reputation and enjoys consistently high levels of public and political support.</p><p>  In 2011 Ireland provided &euro;657 million to Official Development Assistance (ODA). This funding was directed to development programmes and to providing life saving emergency humanitarian assistance in over eighty of the world&rsquo;s least developed countries.  The majority of this assistance was delivered through trusted partners - the UN system, International Development Organisations and Non Governmental Organisations and Irish Missionary Organisations. </p><p>  Ireland also has long term, strategic development partnership programmes with a small number of developing countries, called Programme Countries, namely; Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia in sub-Saharan Africa, and Timor Leste and Vietnam in Asia. Timor Leste will cease to be a Programme Country in 2013. In these countries we aim to build government capacities to deliver the essential services that their populations need &ndash; mainly in the areas of health, education and food security. We also work in cross cutting sectors such as governance, gender equality, the environment and HIV and Aids, building systems of accountability that will ensure lasting development results. </p><p>  In Programme Countries, which are at the very core of our aid programme, Ireland seeks to shape and influence development in a way which will ensure that development assistance as a concept will be obsolete within a generation. We are witnessing human progress and growth rates in our Programme Countries and indeed in Africa, which would have been considered impossible only 10 years ago. There is, of course, much more to be achieved and there is still an enormous burden of poverty, but real and tangible progress is being made. Ireland has played it&rsquo;s part in this positive change.</p><p>  In 2011 Programme Countries received approximately &euro;180 million of which two thirds was delivered through Government systems at national, regional and local level. Comprehensive details of how Ireland&rsquo;s total ODA, including this funding, was spent is available in the Irish Aid Annual Report. I am making arrangements for the 2011 Report to be sent to the Deputy. For 2012 we have allocated &euro;178 million to Programme Countries and most of this has been disbursed.  The full details of all expenditure will be available in the 2012 Annual Report which will be published in the New Year.</p><p>  The Government is proud of our aid programme and its achievements. We are determined to maintain and build on its high international reputation, and ensure it continues to build the foundation of real change, future prosperity and well being in the lives of many of the world&rsquo;s poorest people.  </p></reply>

The programme is recognised internationally for its high quality, its strong focus on the fight against poverty and hunger, and its concentration on the poorest countries and communities of sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>In 2011, &euro;657 million was provided by the Government in Official Development Assistance (ODA).Of this total, approximately &euro;520 million, representing 79% of total ODA, was managed by my Department through Irish Aid. The remaining &euro;137 million (including Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU development cooperation budget) was overseen by other Government Departments. </p><p>Irish Aid provides assistance to developing countries either directly through bilateral assistance, or indirectly, through multilateral organisations. Irish Aid delivers bilateral ODA through a variety of channels. These include working in cooperation with Governments, local authorities, local communities, Non Governmental Organisations and international organisations. </p><p>A key element of Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral assistance is our support for long term strategic partnerships with selected countries to support programmes for reducing poverty and advancing national development. The Programme Countries benefiting from this support are Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Timor Leste, Uganda, Vietnam and Zambia. The programme in Timor Leste will conclude in 2013.</p><p>  When deciding the most appropriate delivery channel for particular aid interventions, Irish Aid takes into consideration the stability of the political environment, the reliability, accountability and transparency of government systems and the existence of effective and accountable locally-based and international Non Governmental Organisations. In 2011, &euro;121.6 million (or 27% of bilateral ODA) was directed through Government systems in Programme Countries. The oversight, implementation and the impact of Irish Aid funded activities is closely supervised by staff based at our Embassies and offices. In addition, all proposals for Irish Aid funding in Programme Countries are rigorously appraised by Irish Aid staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as by the Programme Appraisal and Evaluation Group which includes external appraisal.</p><p>  In 2011, &euro;167 million (or 37% of bilateral ODA) was directed though Non Governmental Organisations including missionary organisations. Support was directed to these organisations following a full assessment of their capacity to manage and account for Irish Aid funds received and agreement about what results will be achieved as a result of this assistance.</p><p>The aid programme seeks to achieve a balance of delivery systems to ensure it remains effective. NGOs are supported because they work closely with local communities and groups. They also work closely with government systems in order to provide and supplement national services such as health, education and agricultural extension. Governments are supported because they have responsibility for implementing programmes and strengthening institutions that will have a lasting impact on reducing poverty. To achieve effective results in development it is important to work with NGOs, governments, local authorities and specialised organisations to bring about the lasting change necessary of development aid to become unnecessary. This is the outcome to which we are all working.</p></reply>

Irish Aid responded directly to emergency and humanitarian crisis situations throughout the world including Somalia, Sudan, Kenya, Ethiopia, Liberia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Funding in excess of &euro;20 million was provided through contributions to common humanitarian and pooled funds. This enabled us to provide a rapid response, through trusted and accountable implementing partners, to emergency and crisis situations in countries where there is no direct Irish Aid presence or where such agencies bring additional value and experience. </p><p>  For 2012 the Government has allocated an estimated &euro;639 million to Ireland&rsquo;s ODA programme.

Ireland has no tolerance for fraud or any other form of financial irregularity in relation to our development programme. I have suspended approximately &#8364;16 million of Irish development assistance which was due to be channelled through the Government of Uganda systems in 2012. I initiated an immediate investigation into the misappropriation of funds by the Office of the Prime Minister which has been undertaken by a team from the Evaluation and Audit Unit of my Department. The team&#8217;s report which I have now published found that this fraud was very sophisticated and well thought out involving a high level of collusion at a senior level and that the level of collusion was exceptional and could not reasonably or<font color="#004080"> </font>  normally have been anticipated.  I have strongly emphasised that Irish funding has to be repaid by the Uganda Government and that all necessary actions be taken by the Ugandan authorities to pursue those guilty of this crime. </p><p>  Our Ambassador in Kampala and the Director General of Irish Aid met with the Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance and Economic Development of Uganda to underline my deep concerns and to insist that the misappropriated funds be restored by the Ugandan authorities. The Government of Uganda has expressed their own deep concern at the impact of this corruption scandal on Uganda&#8217;s international reputation and has taken some concrete actions in response. The Ugandan Government have since confirmed that: all Irish Aid misappropriated funds will be reimbursed; that the officials against whom financial impropriety has been established will be fully prosecuted; and that measures will be undertaken to tighten their internal controls. </p><p>  I welcome this commitment and have directed our Ambassador to work with the Ugandan authorities to ensure that the misappropriated funds are refunded to Ireland. Discussions are underway with the Ugandan Minister for Finance and Economic Development and with the other development partners affected by this fraud, namely Denmark, Norway and Sweden in this regard. Our funding remains suspended until this issue is fully resolved. </p><p><i>Ireland&#8217;s aid programme is strongly focused on the poorest people and communities in sub-Saharan Africa and we have strong systems in place for the oversight and monitoring of our aid funding.  </i>  All of our aid programmes are regularly examined and evaluated to ensure we achieve effectiveness and value for money. This is done through: auditors based in our Embassies; the evaluation and audit team at headquarters; international accountancy firms whom we commission to carry out audits; the national audit offices of our partner Governments; and my Department&#8217;s Audit Committee - which provides an independent appraisal of Irish Aid&#8217;s audit and evaluation and also meets with the Comptroller and Auditor General and publishes an annual report on its work. However, it is clear that notwithstanding all these &#8216;checks and balances&#8217; that aid programmes through Governments and other channels in developing countries can be very challenging. We are currently examining our systems in all Programme Countries with a view to ensuring that they are fit for purpose and that there are no issues in relation to fraud or malfeasance.</p><p>  I am committed to ensuring that we learn from this to strengthen our systems of risk identification, management, monitoring and audit in the future to minimise the potential for the misuse of funds.</p></reply>

I share the widespread concerns about the difficult situation faced by the LGBT community in Uganda and certain other countries in the region.  I am particularly concerned about developments in relation to the draft Anti-Homosexuality Bill, which was presented as a private member&#8217;s Bill, and is currently under consideration at committee level in the Ugandan Parliament.</p><p>  Ireland, together with other donor countries in Uganda, has engaged actively on this issue since it first arose in 2009.  We continue to advocate strongly against the adoption of the proposed law. Our Embassy in Kampala has consistently made the case to the Government of Uganda, at all levels, that the passing of any such legislation would be in conflict with Uganda&#8217;s international human rights obligations and would have a detrimental effect on the country&#8217;s relations with its international development partners, including Ireland. </p><p>  I raised the issue directly with the President of Uganda when I visited the country in July.  I asked our Ambassador in Kampala to continue to follow developments closely.  Last week, she and a group of EU Ambassadors outlined our serious concerns in a meeting with the Prime Minister of Uganda.  The official position of the Government of Uganda on the Bill is that it is not part of the Government&#8217;s legislative programme. President Museveni has made a commitment to engage members of Parliament on the implications of this Bill for Uganda&#8217;s international relations and reputation.  We, and the other international aid donors, remain committed to ensuring that the citizens of Uganda do not suffer violence or discrimination on the grounds of their sexual orientation. Our Embassy in Uganda will continue to monitor developments closely in the coming weeks.</p><p><i></i>Uganda is a priority country for Ireland&#8217;s aid programme, with a commitment to long term strategic assistance.  As with the other priority countries, our programme is strongly focused on the fight to end poverty and hunger among some of the poorest people and communities, with assistance channelled through government systems, multilateral organisations and NGOs.  We fund programmes through government systems in order to empower national governments to deliver and take ownership of the provision of services, which is essential if the improvements achieved are to be sustainable in the long term.  Irish Aid funding through governments is for agreed programmes in the social, health and education sectors, which are regularly examined and evaluated to ensure we achieve effectiveness and value for money. In the case of Uganda, as the Deputy will be aware, I have suspended funding of Irish Aid programmes delivered through the Government as a result of the misappropriation of funds intended for the Peace, Recovery and Development Programme.  This suspension will remain in place until the misappropriated funds are returned and we are fully confident that the Government has strengthened its internal financial controls and acted against all officials implicated in the fraud.</p></reply>

Our partnership with Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) represents a very important element of the aid programme. Ireland channels a higher proportion of ODA through the NGO sector than most other international donors.  In 2011, the Government, through schemes managed by the headquarters of Irish Aid, provided over &euro; 105 million for the long term development work of NGOs.  Funding for NGOs is also provided for their work on emergency and recovery assistance, conflict resolution and peace building, and the promotion of human rights.</p><p>To date in 2012, Irish Aid has provided some &euro; 95 million to NGOs in Irish Aid headquarters funding.  Additional funding is provided to NGOs from the development programmes in Ireland&rsquo;s country programmes where we have a commitment to long-term strategic assistance.

However, as the Deputy will know, issues related to the internal governance of the Irish Red Cross fall under the mandate of my colleague, the Minister for Defence, Alan Shatter, T.D.  The engagement of my Department, through the Irish Aid programme, with the Irish Red Cross is focused upon the work of the International Department of that organisation. </p><p>  Funding provided to the Irish Red Cross is channelled exclusively through the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) under a Partnership Agreement signed between Irish Aid and the IFRC, initially in 2010 and renewed again in 2012. Under this agreement, the IFRC allocated a total of &euro;800,000 to the Irish Red Cross for its overseas operations in 2010 and 2011. Of this sum, &euro;700,000 was provided in support of an ongoing livelihoods, food security and capacity building programme in Niger, whilst &euro;100,000 was allocated to health and education programmes in Malawi.</p><p>  In 2012, as part of the wider Partnership Agreement with the IFRC, the Irish Red Cross received &euro;400,000 for its activities in Niger, one of the poorest and most vulnerable countries in Africa. The programme continues to prioritise activities to reduce food insecurity, whilst also addressing water, sanitation and hygiene issues. A key element of this programme is to build the preparedness and response capacity of the Niger Red Cross and vulnerable communities, including through the implementation of preparedness and disaster management initiatives.  </p><p>  The International Department of the Irish Red Cross is small but effective, currently staffed by six officers at headquarters, including one part-time staff member. There are also five Irish Red Cross delegates deployed overseas in South Sudan, India, the Maldives and Niger. The Irish Red Cross also employs a number of local staff to assist in its operations in Niger, where it works in close partnership with the Niger Red Cross.</p></reply>

The Council also supported the efforts of the Government of Egypt and others to talk to both sides and bring about a restored ceasefire.</p><p>  Thankfully, unlike on some previous occasions, these intensive efforts bore fruit fairly rapidly and a ceasefire came into effect last Wednesday evening, 21 November.   At present, this appears to be holding.</p><p>  I have emphasized before that the underlying problems of Gaza must be addressed if conflict of this kind is to be avoided in future.  The present ceasefire agreement amounts essentially to a truce.  It includes, however, provision for discussion of these wider issues.  This would hold out hope for a substantial relaxation of the blockade of Gaza, something approaching normality for the lives of its citizens and in return a genuine and lasting end to attacks directed from Gaza against Israeli towns and cities. </p><p>  I very much hope that these provisions will be acted on urgently and creatively, so that the newly achieved cessation of violence can be more than just a pause and lead instead to a lasting improvement in the security and other conditions under which the people of both Gaza and Israel live.</p></reply>

Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least &#8364;3 billion in 2011, &#8364;3.5 billion this year and &#8364;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their 2011 targets. The Head of the Credit Review Office (CRO), Mr John Trethowan, stated in his recently published ninth quarterly report that &#8220;&#8364;3.5bn of sanctions for each bank is a very challenging target, however the remaining five months typically show more lending activity and I am of the view that, after a slow start to the year, the targets will be a challenge but still may be achieved.&#8221;</p><p>  As the Deputies are aware, one of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme. The Economic Management Council meets the banks on a regular basis and discusses the key issues pertaining to this priority.</p><p>  In addition to the lending targets imposed on the banks,<b></b>the pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets. My Department, in conjunction with the CRO, subsequently analyses the plans and meets the banks to discuss any issues of note. The banks also meet with my Department and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress. The monthly management meetings with the pillar banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by my Department.</p><p>  I should stress however that the Relationship Frameworks with the banks provide that the State will not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the banks or their management decisions including with respect to pricing and lending decisions. These frameworks are published on my Department&#8217;s website at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>.</p><p>  In terms of rejection rates from banks, I would remind the Deputies that the CRO can review decisions by the pillar banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities, including applications for restructured credit facilities, from &#8364;1,000 up to &#8364;500,000. The CRO is overturning 55% of the refusal decisions referred to them and I would appeal to SMEs and farmers who have been refused credit by the banks to avail of the services of the CRO.</p><p>  The overall target for lending to SMEs includes lending to the tourism, transport and hotel sectors. The Government is conscious that these sectors need access to credit. In his seventh quarterly report, the Credit Reviewer notes that whilst each banks&#8217; balance sheets have contracted recently, the monitoring of these figures show that no sector or geographic region has been adversely disadvantaged by either of the banks.</p><p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act provides for a scheme which will facilitate up to &#8364;40million in additional lending to microenterprises over the next five years.  Furthermore, the Government is in the process of facilitating up to &#8364;150m per annum of additional credit through the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme, designed for SME&#8217;s who, because of lack of collateral or because of the specialised sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing bank credit.</p><p>  It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery. However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.</p></reply>

As IBRC is wholly owned by the State, any return to the State will be by way of dividends from IBRC or from the projected final net asset position for IBRC.</p><p>The bank previously informed me that the projected final net asset position for IBRC is considered both commercially sensitive and subject to material uncertainty given the current uncertainties in markets, the deterioration in asset values and the complexities, timescales and risks involved in deleveraging. Whilst significant progress has been made the final position will be driven by a number of variable factors against the assumptions in IBRC&rsquo;s wind down plan. These factors include actual recovery rates achieved for assets, the performance of the domestic and global economies, and the prevailing interest rates in Europe over the duration of the plan.</p><p>The bank&rsquo;s policy is that, due to the commercially sensitive nature of such information as noted above combined with the many external variables involved, it does not issue formal projections.</p><p>However, the Bank&rsquo;s CEO has given an indication previously that the likely total cost for Anglo Irish Bank would be in the &euro;25 - &euro;28 billion region.

I would also remind the Deputy that the State and its bodies must, of course, comply with all provisions of equality legislation in the development and delivery of policies and services.</p><p>  Furthermore, cabinet procedures require that proposals put to Government indicate clearly whether there is any impact of the proposal on, amongst other things, gender equality, persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion and people with disabilities.</p><p>  The Deputy might also be aware that a distributional analysis of proposed budget measures is performed each year based on various income levels for the different categories of income earners, for example single individuals, married one-earner couples with no children and married one-earner couples with children. A distributional analysis which models the impacts on disposable income by income decile using SWITCH, the ESRI Tax-Benefit model, is also undertaken in evaluating various budgetary options. Illustrative examples are contained in the Budget 2012 document.</p><p>  It is also worth acknowledging that Ireland has been consistently assessed highly by the OECD for the progressivity of our taxation system. In the OECD rating system on the progressivity of taxation, where less than 100 is regressive and above 100 is progressive, most EU countries had a progressivity rate of between 120 and 140. Ireland, in comparison, had a progressivity rate of 182 (OECD Taxes and Wages 2010-2011) which was the most progressive tax system of the EU members of the OECD.</p></reply>

When a bank issues a bond, whether by private placement or public issue, it would be usual practice for these to be settled through intermediaries and held by custodians, for example Clearstream or Euroclear.</p><p>  These securities are traded in the open market and settled by clearing house systems. An issuer does not have any access to the records of the clearing house and as such, cannot identify the underlying ownership.</p><p>  Therefore, I can confirm that neither the banks nor the Government have an accurate means of establishing the underlying ownership of securities issued by the banks at a particular point in time.</p><p>  Equally therefore, I cannot advise the deputy in respect of the levels and types of insurance, individual bondholders may maintain in respect to particular bonds held by them.</p></reply>

This included the consideration of a number of acceptable business partners for this purpose. The Bank received many expressions of interest from both intermediaries and principals in assisting the Bank with the recovery of those assets. Fundamental to the Bank&rsquo;s decision making process in this regard was the quality and financial strength of potential partners, their track record in recovering value from distressed assets in both Russia and the Ukraine and advice the Bank received from numerous independent government and non-government sources in these jurisdictions. Following a comprehensive analysis of all considerations, IBRC concluded that recommending a joint venture with A1 represented the most economically advantageous outcome for the Bank, the State and by extension the Irish taxpayer.</p><p>  I have been informed that IBRC has not paid any money upfront in relation to its joint venture with A1. The joint venture with A1 involves significant initial monetary commitments by A1 and a waterfall structure to incentivise maximum recovery. </p><p>  I have also been advised IBRC will not be disclosing any further details regarding the appointment of A1 due to the commercial sensitivities associated with the work to be undertaken and the associated risk that such disclosures may have a detrimental impact on the Bank&rsquo;s efforts to maximise loan recoveries. In addition, as these matters relate to on-going litigation, it would be inappropriate for the Bank to comment any further.  </p></reply>

I assume that in his question the Deputy is referring to the annual earnings cap which operates in conjunction with age-related percentage limits to determine the annual amount of tax-relievable contributions that can be made by an employee or individual to pension savings and to the maximum allowable pension fund for tax purposes at retirement (the Standard Fund Threshold - SFT).   I would point out that the scale of pension saving reliefs available to higher earners, in particular, has been significantly restricted over recent years. The SFT was reduced from over &euro;5.4 million to &euro;2.3m in Budget and Finance Act 2011 while the annual earnings cap which operates in conjunction with age-related percentage limits to determine the annual amount of tax-relievable pension contributions has also been reduced over a period from its peak of over &euro;275,000 in 2008 to its current level of &euro;115,000 per annum. </p><p>  In my 2012 Budget speech in December last, I said that the incentive regime for supplementary pension provision will have to be reformed to make the system sustainable and more equitable over the long term. I said that my Department and the Revenue Commissioners would work with the various stakeholders in the next year to develop workable solutions. On foot of this, a broad informal consultation was undertaken this year across a spectrum of stakeholders in the pensions sector to establish their views on further changes to the incentive regime for pension saving.</p><p>  I will give due consideration to the views of all interested parties in the context of any proposals I may make to Government regarding the incentive regime for pension saving.</p></reply>

The principle of breaking the link between the sovereigns and banks has been agreed by Heads of State and Government. In September the Commission presented legislative proposals for a single supervisory mechanism conferring powers on the ECB for the supervision of all banks in the euro area, with a mechanism for non-euro countries to join on a voluntary basis. The European Council discussed the SSM at its October meeting in the context of a report from President Van Rompuy on work being carried out on the Future of Economic and Monetary Union. The timetable set in the October Council conclusions envisages agreement being reached on "the legislative framework" for SSM by end of the year.   The imperative is to move ahead urgently to implement all of the important decisions taken on 29 June. I am working with ministers from the other Member States at the Ecofin Council to bring about the SSM. My officials are engaged in technical negotiations on the SSM proposal, the implementation of which is a perquisite for the ESM to make direct recapitalisations in banks. The Deputy is aware that the June Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Euro area stated that when the SSM is in "place for banks in the euro area the ESM could, following a regular decision, have the possibility to recapitalize banks directly." It went on to state that "The Eurogroup will examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with the view of further improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme." </p><p>  The timeframe set by the October Council is for the SSM to be fully operational during 2013. It is important that there is no rolling back on commitments made by the Heads of State and Government. In that context I note that the President of the ECB Mario Draghi indicated at the Council that it would take 6-12 months to get the supervisor up and running. This is realistic and the final text should clearly confirm this timeframe for the full implementation of the regulation, with the ECB assuming supervision of the most significant institutions by 1 July 2013 and the remaining credit institutions in Member States by 1 January 2014 at the latest. My officials are working on intensive negotiations at a high level to reach agreement on the SSM proposal within the deadline set by the October Council. I share the view of the President of the European Council Van Rompuy that Europe must not loose the sense of urgency in taking action to stabilize the euro. </p><p>  It is anticipated that the single supervisory mechanism will be funded through industry fees and as such there should not be any budgetary impact. The establishment of the single supervisory mechanism is a crucial and significant first step to completing the banking union. The banking union will also require further work to develop a common system for deposit guarantees and an integrated crisis management framework, while negotiations on the bank capital requirements (CRD IV) should also be concluded as called for by the Heads of State and Government at the October European Council.</p></reply>

As such, the director is legally bound to act in what he or she believes are the interests of the separate legal entity that is the institution itself. To address the scope for actual and perceived conflicts between the fiduciary duties of the directors of financial institutions under company law and the wider public interest in circumstances where those institutions have received financial support from the State, legal clarity, not just to the role of the public interest director but to that of the entire boards of those institutions, was provided under Section 48 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010. It provides that the overriding duty of directors of the covered institutions relates to the public interest as set out in the Act. Accordingly, public interest directors do not have a formal reporting relationship to the Minister or to the Department of Finance and therefore no formal report has been produced by them for either the Minister or the Department of Finance.    As stated in my reply to PQ 49478/12 there are currently no public interest directors on the board of IBRC. However all appointments to the board of the bank are approved by the Minister for Finance under the terms and conditions attaching to the nationalisation of the bank. The Minister for Finance has extensive powers in relation to the appointment and removal of Chairpersons, CEO&rsquo;s and ordinary board members under the Anglo Irish Bank Act 2009. Mr Alan Dukes had been appointed as a public interest director in December 2008 and was made Chairman of Anglo Irish Bank in June 2010.</p><p>I have previously provided information on the remuneration and the terms in office of the public interest directors, including in response to PQ 49980/12. For the record the public interest directors, their dates of appointment/resignation and the fees they earned in 2011 are shown in the table below:</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Bank</b></th><th><b>Public Interest Directors</b></th><th><b>Date of Appointment/Resignation</b></th><th><div><b>Fees 2011 &#8364;</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>AIB</td><td>Mr Dick Spring<br />Mr Declan Collier</td><td>January 2009<br />January 2009/June 2012</td><td><div>59,000<br />71,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>BOI</td><td>Mr Tom Considine<br />Mr Joe Walsh</td><td>January 2009<br />January 2009</td><td><div>90,000<br />79,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>PTSB</td><td>Ms Margaret Hayes<br />Mr Ray MacSharry</td><td>December 2008<br />December 2008</td><td><div>64,000<br />56,000</div></td></tr></table></p><p>Dr Michael Somers is a Government Nominee (not a Public Interest Director) appointed to the AIB board on 14 January 2010 under the terms of the NPRFC&rsquo;s investment of &euro;3.5bn in AIB of May 2009.</p><p>The public interest directors at Bank of Ireland do not have a specified time in office as stated in response to PQ 49476/12. The same situation applies to the public interest directors at AIB. In PTSB, as stated in PQ 49482/12 the public interest directors were appointed until 30 September 2010 but have remained since that date as a replacement Government guarantee scheme has remained in place since then. The Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company require each director to retire every third year but in practice each public interest director has been subject to re-election by shareholders at each AGM since their appointment.</p><p>In general the setting of remuneration policies at the covered institutions rests with the Remuneration Committee of each institution. The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are accessible on the website of each institution. These can be found at:</p><p><b>AIB</b>:   <i>http://www.aib.ie/servlet/BlobServer/document.pdf?blobkey=id&amp;blobwhere=1136826158582&amp;blobcol=urlfile&amp;blobtable=AIB&under;Download&amp;blobheader=application/pdf&amp;blobheadername1=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue1=document.pdf</i></p><p><b>Bank of Ireland</b>  :</p><p><i>http://www.bankofireland.com/about-boi-group/corporate-governance/court-committees/terms-of-reference/</i></p><p><b>PTSB</b>  :</p><p><i>http://www.irishlifepermanent.com/corporate-responsibility/corporate-governance/board-committees.aspx</i></p><p>Both Bank of Ireland and PTSB have a public interest director sitting on the Remuneration Committee. The public interest director will have a vote on decisions being considered by the Remuneration Committee but they do not have any powers to veto such a decision, nor can they act unilaterally to address salaries paid to particular employees. In the case of AIB there is currently no public interest director on the Remuneration Committee. Declan Collier, who was a public interest director of AIB, served on the Remuneration Committee until his resignation from the board in June 2012.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware officials in my Department have been working with Mercer on a remuneration review of the covered banks. The report will provide a comprehensive and professional analysis of remuneration structures and levels across the covered banks both now and before the onset of the banking crisis.</p></reply>

NAMA stated at the time that this includes the completion of properties which are currently under development and the development of land in anticipation of future supply shortages and demand.</p><p>Prior to the announcement NAMA had already committed over &euro;500 million in new working capital and development capital advances for projects which are located in Ireland.  NAMA advises that the &euro;2 billion investment announced in May is in addition to this prior investment.</p><p>The &euro;2 billion investment forms part of NAMA&rsquo;s wider operations and is accounted for in the normal manner.

In this regard, NAMA advises that it is currently assessing a wide range of projects that may be suitable for development by reference to projected demand. Decisions to invest will be based on those projects which are considered most likely to generate a strong commercial return to the taxpayer.   NAMA advises that as project appraisal is still on-going it is not possible to provide the schedule sought by the Deputy.  NAMA advises that it engages, as appropriate, with public bodies, including government departments, state agencies such as the IDA and local authorities, in both the identification and delivery of critical infrastructure development planning linked to this and other investment activities.</p></reply>

I have been advised that the Bank seeks to work constructively and consensually with each borrower to identify the most appropriate approach available to it in order to maximise the repayment of the loan.    The process followed in managing the recovery process is to assess fully all aspects of a borrower&rsquo;s circumstances to establish the most appropriate repayment strategy. This assessment includes consideration of debt, asset, income/salary and lifestyle considerations.  Agreements that are ultimately reached for agreed repayment plans are judged and enforced to provide the best commercial outcome for the shareholder. </p><p>  In circumstances where consensual agreements cannot be reached the alternative of receivership, examinership or liquidation is pursued resulting in rigorous enforcement of all recovery options and rights.</p></reply>

It is charged at rates of 2% on the first &#8364;10,036 of income, 4% on the next &#8364;5,980 and 7% on the balance.  </p><p>  In certain circumstances different rates are applied. Full eligibility for services under Part IV of the Health Act 1970, by virtue of sections 45 and 45A of that Act or Council Regulation (EC) No. 883/2004, entitles an individual to be charged at a rate of USC of 4% on income over &#8364;16,016, rather than 7%.</p><p>  Full eligibility is means tested and where an individual is fully eligible for health services, he or she receives a medical card. Certain categories of workers from other European member states are automatically entitled to medical cards based on EU Regulations and Health Service Executive (HSE) guidelines, and without the need for means testing.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that during 2011, Revenue applied the 4% rate to workers in this State who were resident in Northern Ireland on the understanding that, as EU workers, they were fully eligible for health services as described and, therefore, automatically entitled to medical cards.</p><p>However, following examination of the EU legislation and consultation with the HSE, it was established in 2011 that workers who are resident in other EU Member States and who travel to the State to exercise the duties of their employment (frontier workers) do not have automatic entitlement to a medical card. They may have entitlement to a medical card under Irish legislation where the HSE regards them as being ordinarily resident<sup>1</sup> in the State but such entitlement is subject to a means test as in the case of workers resident in the State.</p><p>Revenue published clarification in December 2011 and details can be found at   <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></p><p>  Accordingly, with effect from 1 January 2012, frontier workers from another EU Member State (including, Northern Ireland) who do not obtain a full Irish medical card, are liable to the normal maximum 7% USC rate, where they have sufficient income for this rate to apply.</p><p>  It should be noted that credit for USC paid in Ireland should be available against tax due in a frontier worker&#8217;s country of residence where there is a tax treaty in place between Ireland and that country. Ireland has double taxation treaties with all member states of the EU.</p><p>  This and further information on the USC is available from the Revenue website at   <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></p><p><sup>  1</sup>The term <b>ordinarily resident </b>as distinct from <b>resident</b> refers to an individual's pattern of residence over a number of years.  If the individual comes to Ireland for the first time and remains resident for three consecutive tax years, he or she will become <b>ordinarily resident </b>from the beginning of the fourth tax year.</p></reply>

To address the scope for actual and perceived conflicts between the fiduciary duties of the directors of financial institutions under company law and the wider public interest in circumstances where those institutions have received financial support from the State, legal clarity, not just to the role of the public interest director but to that of the entire boards of those institutions, was provided under Section 48 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010. It provides that the overriding duty of directors of the covered institutions relates to the public interest as set out in the Act.</p><p>  The public interest directors have no particular role in dealing with individual taxpayer grievances with their bank. Individual taxpayers who have a grievance with their bank can have their issue dealt with through the normal channels, including if necessary the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The Remuneration Committee of each bank is generally responsible for setting remuneration policy. The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are accessible on the website of each institution. These can be found at:</p><p><b>AIB</b>:   <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></p><p><b>Bank of Ireland</b>  :</p><p><i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></p><p><b>PTSB</b>  :</p><p><i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></p><p>  Although there is a public interest director on the Remuneration Committees of Bank of Ireland and PTSB the public interest director cannot act unilaterally to review and reduce the remuneration and pension packages of employees.

This includes NAMA&#8217;s identification of over 3,800 residential units controlled by its debtors and receivers as being available and potentially suitable for social housing and its policy of giving first option to public bodies on the purchase of property in which may be suitable for their purposes.

With regard to reducing the VAT rate applied to car servicing, under EU law it is not possible to reduce the VAT rate applying to car servicing below 12%.  This is because car servicing, including many of the goods and services to which Ireland applies a reduced rate of VAT, is based on an EU derogation under Article 118 of the EU VAT Directive, which provides that as we applied a reduced rate to these items on 1 January 1991, we are entitled to continue to apply that reduced rate to those items, provided the rate is no less than 12%.  Furthermore, while is it possible to reduce the VAT rate on car servicing to 12%, this could only be done through the application of a 12% VAT rate to all goods and services that currently apply at the 13.5%, and such a move would be very costly to the Exchequer.  However, it must be noted that in the majority of EU Member States, where the derogation under Article 118 does not apply, the servicing of cars is subject to a higher VAT rate.</p><p>  In addition, the EU VAT Directive does not make specific provision for a reduced or zero rate to apply to safety equipment in vehicles and potentially life saving technology in new cars, and as such they are subject to the standard VAT rate, which is currently 23%.  With regard to the VRT on optional additional safety equipment and potentially life saving technology in new cars, VRT is charged on the Open Market Selling Price (OMSP) of a vehicle which for new vehicles is defined in Section 133 (2) of the Finance Act 1992 as</p><p><i>&#8220;(2) (a) For a new vehicle on sale in the State which is supplied by a manufacturer or sole wholesale distributor, such manufacturer or distributor shall declare to the Commissioners in the prescribed manner the price, inclusive of all taxes and duties, which, in his opinion, a vehicle of that model and specification, including any enhancements or accessories fitted or attached thereto or supplied therewith by such manufacturer or distributor, might reasonably be expected to fetch on a first arm's length sale thereof in the open market in the State by retail.&#8221;</i></p><p>  There are no plans to reduce or scrap the VRT on optional additional safety equipment as they are &quot;enhancements or accessories fitted or attached&quot; and as such are included in the VRT charge.</p></reply>

The standards established by the OECD are the most widely accepted standards by which countries assess their tax systems and those of other countries.    The OECD and the international community do not regard Ireland as a tax haven. The OECD identifies four key indicators of a tax haven: the first is having no taxes or only nominal taxes; the second is a lack of transparency; the third indicator is an unwillingness to exchange information with tax administrations of OECD member countries; and the fourth indicator is absence of a substantial activity requirement. None of these criteria apply to Ireland.</p><p>  Ireland has a comprehensive taxation system covering income, capital and indirect taxes and has Double Taxation Relief Agreements with 68 other countries. The January 2011<i> Global</i><i>Forum Peer Review</i><i>Report</i>   on Ireland&#8217;s legal and regulatory framework for transparency and exchange of information found that Ireland has an effective system for the exchange of information in tax matters and is fully compliant with OECD standards.  The Irish 12.5% corporate tax rate is a general rate for trading income that requires the trade to have real substance and activity. This rate does not distinguish between small and large enterprises or between enterprises that service the local economy and those that have a multinational focus.  Ireland is bound by the same rules on State Aid, Code of Conduct on Business Taxation, and rulings of the Court of Justice as all EU Member States. Ireland does not support harmful tax competition and participates fully in the EU Code of Conduct Group, which addresses harmful tax competition, and in the OECD Forum on Harmful Tax Practices.</p></reply>

A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits as well as profits from certain petroleum, mining or land trading activities, while capital gains are chargeable at a 30% rate.    Companies are chargeable to corporation tax on their profits after taking account of allowable deductions and reliefs as provided for in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Expenses that are incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade are deductible in computing trading profits, while allowances are available for capital expenditure on plant and machinery, industrial buildings and certain intangible assets used in the trade, with such allowances treated as a deductible trading expense.  Companies are chargeable on their net profits after account is taken of any losses they have incurred.</p><p>  There are certain reliefs available to companies, such as group relief and double taxation relief, which are standard features of corporation tax similar to those applying in other EU and OECD countries. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on corporation tax returns for 2010 accounting periods (the latest available), elimination of group relief and relief for double taxation would provide an estimated <i>nominal</i>   yield of &#8364;408 million and &#8364;618 million respectively, assuming no behavioral change in response to such a measure. Clearly, however, it would not be an option to disallow double taxation relief. This would result in a double charge, imposing a disproportionate and unreasonable tax burden on companies and would also be in breach of tax treaties concluded with other countries. The availability of group relief recognizes the fact that the operations of the companies concerned are closely inter-related and that the group effectively comprises a single economic entity.</p><p>  There are also specific tax reliefs for companies which are targeted at promoting investment in key areas of economic importance, including a 25% tax credit for expenditure on research and development, relief for start-up companies, accelerated allowances for investment in energy-efficient equipment, relief for investment in renewable energy and exemption of profits from commercial occupation of certain woodlands<font color="#0000FF">. </font>Based on information derived from corporation tax returns for 2010 accounting periods, it is tentatively estimated that the <i>nominal</i> full year yield from eliminating these tax reliefs would be approximately &#8364;230 million in total, again assuming no significant behavioural change on the part of corporate taxpayers which would cause the expected increase in tax yield to fall below expectation.</p><p>  I should emphasise that tax reliefs are continually monitored to ensure that they are properly focussed, provide value for money and that there are no loopholes that could be exploited for tax avoidance purposes. Certain tax reliefs, such as the exemption for patent royalty income and incentives for investment in property, have been abolished or significantly curtailed in recent years as these were not providing sufficient economic benefit relative to their Exchequer cost. Also, where a potential loophole emerges or concerns arise in relation to unintended use of a tax relief that the Revenue Commissioners are not in a position to address under existing legislation, amending legislation is introduced in the annual Finance Act to protect the tax base and ensure that the relief is not subject to any abuses. </p></reply>

In relation to SITC 054.61 sweet corn (cooked or uncooked) frozen and SITC 054.69 other vegetables (cooked or uncooked), frozen - the total value of imports in the first eight months of 2012 amounted to &euro;24.9 million, while the value of exports over the same period for these goods was &euro;1.3 million.

The purpose of the report was to identify possible new structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world.</p><p>  The international panel of education experts recommended that teacher education be provided in six &quot;centres for teacher education&quot;.  Currently there are 19 state funded providers of ITE (and three non-state funded) offering more than 40 college programmes in primary and post-primary teaching.  The new collaborations recommended by the international panel will mean that there will be a smaller number of centres for ITE offering education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education.  These centres for teacher education will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions.</p><p>  The HEA has been requested to consult with the relevant parties and to prepare a detailed plan on how to implement the recommendations of the Panel.  I understand that this process has started and a plan is expected by the end of the year.</p><p>  I will consider the implementation plan when received and make a further announcement at that stage.</p></reply>

In addition, I welcome provision of 25 bonus points from Higher Education institutions for Leaving Certificate students who achieve a grade D3 or higher in higher level maths. </p><p>  All of these initiatives, including the 25 bonus points, have contributed to much higher number of candidates taking honours level maths in this year's examinations.

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the rights of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</p><p>  Equality legislation, which also outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. The legislation provides that any school that has this objective may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that last year, I launched a discussion paper on school enrolment. The &quot;Discussion Paper on a Regulatory Framework for School Enrolment&quot; contains suggestions on how to make the process of enrolling in schools more open, equitable and consistent.</p><p>  I invited education partners and interested parties to submit their views to my Department by the 28 of October last year.  The feedback from this consultation will help inform the nature and scope of a new regulatory framework for school enrolment, the primary aim of which will be to ensure that every child is treated fairly and that every child has a place at school.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-27a.652.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112700061#WRM00900"><p>The Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) is independent in the exercise of its quasi-judicial function and I have no direct involvement in its day to day operations.   It is long established practice that Ministers do not get involved with its adjudication function.  However, I understand that the Tribunal received a claim from this claimant on 12th March 2012, under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007, the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 and the Minimum Notice Acts 1973 to 2005.  A notice of appearance has been entered by the employer and a notice of hearing will issue in due course.</p><p>  All claims are listed for hearing in accordance with their date of lodgement with the EAT.  I am informed that the waiting periods at the end of September, 2012, ranged from 9 weeks to 94 weeks.  The reason for the variance in these waiting times is because the Tribunal conducts hearings in about 36 locations. Where the number of cases is relatively small, the Tribunal may wait until a sufficient number of cases are on hand so as to maximise value for money.  Once a critical mass of hearings is assembled, 5 days of hearing in a single location can reduce the waiting time in the area concerned significantly. I have asked the Tribunal to examine if further efficiencies can be achieved through rationalizing their hearing venues.  Delays are also impacted upon by the number of postponement or adjournment applications made by either party.  I understand that the Tribunal targets areas with the longest waiting period and highest level of claims outstanding; using the resources it has currently available.  The Tribunal is actively working to meet this challenge, notwithstanding the high level of claims in recent years and the administrative resources available. </p><p>  I believe it is essential that we have efficient and effective mechanisms to develop harmonious and productive workplaces and to assist employers and employees to avoid and resolve disputes.  </p><p>  When I came into office last year I inherited a system for resolving employment disputes that did not achieve this. The system was frustrating for employers, employees and professionals representing them.  Notwithstanding the efforts of the EAT and others to reduce backlogs, I believe the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable.</p><p>  It is for these reasons I am undertaking a root and branch reform of all five Workplace Relations Bodies.  The Reform Programme I have commenced will deliver a World-Class Workplace Relations structure.  I propose to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure.  This means that from next year two statutorily independent bodies will replace the current five.  We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.  All complaints will be dealt with by a single body of first instance where the aim will be to have a hearing within three months from the time the case is lodged.</p><p>  The activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court will be merged into the new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.  I fully expect the work that I have commenced with regard to the reform of the Workplace Relations Bodies, including the EAT, to significantly improve the quality of service to users including a reduction in waiting times.</p><p>  Since I announced my reform proposals we have undertaken two public consultation processes; published two policy documents; published a new website; introduced a single complaint form and single contact portal and commenced delivery of an Early Resolution Service.  In addition we have prepared the Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill and secured Government Approval for priority drafting of the Bill.</p><p>  I am extremely happy with the pace and quality of the delivery of this important Reform Programme.  It is proof that the public sector can be reformed in a way that can save money for the tax payer, while at the same time greatly improving services for users. The significant progress to date means we now have:</p><p>  A new single contact portal called &ldquo;Workplace Relations Customer Services&rdquo; dealing with all Workplace Relations complaints which has replaced the five separate entry points.</p><p>  - Complaints are now acknowledged, on average, within a week of receipt. This was previously taking up to eight months in some cases.</p><p>  - The employer is also notified, on average, within a week of the complaint being lodged thus increasing the possibility of a resolution being reached without the need for a hearing. Again this was taking up to eight months.</p><p>  - There are now no backlogs for Rights Commissioner hearings.</p><p>  - A Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use.</p><p>  - A new workplace relations interim website www.workplacerelations.ie is in place.</p><p>  - A pilot Early Resolution Service is now seeking to resolve disputes at an early stage without the need for adjudication.</p><p>  I am determined to progress the next phase of the reform and the enactment of the legislation with the same determination and priority that has delivered excellent results so far.</p></reply>

There are almost 97,000 people employed in ICT firms in Ireland. Of these, almost 74,000 are employed in ICT companies that are clients of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  These client companies exported goods and services to the value of almost &euro;50 billion in 2010, representing 30% of national exports.</p><p>  In terms of attracting foreign direct investment (FDI), the ICT sector is one of the country&rsquo;s leading sectors and continues to be an active source of investment and employment.  9 of the top 10 US ICT companies and 9 of the top 10 global software companies have a presence in this country.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s 2012 Action Plan for Jobs identified the ICT sector as having potential for further significant growth in job creation.   The Action Plan, with its focus on, amongst other things, cloud computing, digital games, ICT skills enhancement and broadband connectivity enhancement, will play an important role in helping win new international investment and job creation.  Research Prioritisation in future networks and communications, data analytics, digital platforms and applications, and in enabling technologies such as nanotechnology, microelectronics, photonics and software engineering will also have a role in job creation and new investment.</p><p>  Both the Jobs Action Plan and Research Prioritisation Strategy will ensure that our country fully capitalises on the shift in technologies in the ICT sector, including the growth in mobile devices and will assist PC companies to adapt to changing technologies in the sector.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs outlines a range of short, medium and long term measures to develop a sustainable domestic supply of high quality ICT graduates to support the further expansion and development of the ICT sector. It also identifies a number of other challenges that must be addressed in order for Ireland to realise the potential for future growth in the ICT sector:</p><p>  - Maintaining cost competitiveness in the midst of intensifying competition globally, especially in manufacturing, vis-&agrave;-vis low cost economies where more mature sectoral activities continue to be outsourced.</p><p>  - The need to ensure ongoing availability of competitively priced high speed broadband networks.</p><p>- The limited scope for software SME&rsquo;s to engage in public procurement initiatives from which strong reference clients and partnerships can emerge.</p><p>  - Supporting and fostering digital innovations and the emergence of digital start- up companies.</p><p>  These challenges are being addressed by a number of Departments and Agencies in the context of implementing the 2012 Action Plan for Jobs. A report outlining progress made in this regard will be published shortly.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.</p><p>  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the young unemployed and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies.</p><p>  In terms of education  , the Youthreach programme provides integrated education, training and work experience for unemployed early school leavers without any qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age.  There are almost 6,000 places available nationwide under the Youthreach umbrella.</p><p>  The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) scheme, operated through VECs, provides a range of courses to meet the education and training needs of unemployed people over 21 years of age (particularly early school leavers). The most recent data indicate that there are almost 1,000 participants on VTOS who are under 25 years of age.</p><p>  The Back to Education Allowance scheme run by my Department provides income maintenance, along with a contribution to education costs, for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 6,500 young people participated in the BTEA in the last academic year.</p><p>  Approximately 10,000 persons aged under 25 completed a training course with F&Aacute;S in 2011 (excluding apprenticeships and evening courses). Training allowances on eligible courses exceed what a young person would receive in jobseekers&#8217; payments, providing an incentive to take up training programmes.</p><p>  The Labour Market Education &amp; Training Fund (LMETF) is part of the Government&#8217;s 2012 Action Plan for Jobs initiative.  The Department of Education &amp; Skills has committed &#8364;20m to fund a range of education and training interventions for up to 6,500 individuals who are long term unemployed.<i><font color="#FF0000"> </font></i>  There are four themes to the funding, one of which is dedicated to the cohort of under 25s.</p><p>  In terms of job search assistance, some 17,000 young people registered with Employment Services this year up until September 2012, representing 37% of all registrants.  Registering with Employment Services gives job-seekers access to guidance interviews, job search assistance, and training courses, as well as self-service job-seeking options.</p><p>  Under the National Employment Action Plan (EAP) persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social Protection and referred to Employment Services for interview with the aim of assisting them to enter/re-enter the labour market.  Last year, there were 35,400 referrals of under 25s to the EAP, affecting approximately 25,000 individual jobseekers (those who do not attend initially are referred again).  Of those referred, 62% of clients had signed off the Live Register by the end of the year.<font color="#004080"> </font>  For the first eight months of this year, there were 23,700 referrals affecting 18,300 young jobseekers. The EAP process is being changed on a progressive basis across the country to one where referral will take place immediately on becoming unemployed for those identified, through profiling, as being at greatest risk of remaining unemployed for long periods.</p><p>  There are a number of schemes/programmes available that are focussed on work experience.  The most relevant for young people are JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme), and its predecessor the Work Placement Programme. Over 1,500 young people are currently participating on these schemes. The total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during its first year of operation was 2,600.   Young people will also benefit from the reduced rate of employer&#8217;s PRSI, the purpose of which is to support job creation, as well as from the impact of Revenue Job Assist and the Employers PRSI Incentive Scheme.</p><p>  Finally the European Commission is currently reviewing relevant youth policies across the Member States with a view to making proposals for a European-wide approach to a &quot;youth guarantee&quot; that are to be discussed during Ireland's Presidency of the EU Council. The Commission&#8217;s proposals are expected to be published in December, and achieving political agreement on these proposals in the Council will be a major objective of Ireland&#8217;s Presidency in the first half of 2013.</p></reply>

His average earnings were calculated having regard to his earnings in the year ended 31 December 2011, the latest available P60.  His most recent payslips were also examined but these gave him a higher weekly net income than his P60. The income from his P60 was used in his FIS assessment as this gave a more representative view of his net income over a longer period of time and resulting in him qualifying for a more favourable rate of FIS.</p><p>  It appears that the income of the person concerned changed again from October 2012. However as his entitlement to FIS is determined from 30th of August 2012 for 52 weeks, income changes from October 2012 will not be taken into account until his renewal application in August 2013.</p><p>  An integral part of the FIS scheme is that once the level of payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment. The rate of payment may be increased if an additional child is born during the 52 week period.</p><p>  On the other hand, the rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient&rsquo;s earnings. A key advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants can be certain that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.  This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides a real incentive to workers with families to avail of employment opportunities.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion and it is paid to around 600,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children.</p><p>  Parents of multiple birth children receive an additional monthly premia paid at one and a half times the monthly child benefit payment rate for each twin and double the monthly payment rate for each child in other multiple births. While Budget 2012 maintained this additional monthly payment, the multiple births grant of &euro;635 paid at birth, at 4 years of age and at 12 years of age was discontinued.</p><p>  As a universal payment child benefit assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. The Government is also conscious that child benefit is an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. Bearing this in mind, any plans to change the amount paid in respect of such payments will be a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day.  I do not therefore propose to speculate on any possible approaches to child benefit payment rates changes.</p><p>  I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment incentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will assist the Government in its deliberations.</p></reply>

There are offices in Ballyshannon, Letterkenny, Buncrana, Carndonagh, Dungloe, Milford and Donegal Town as well as a number of outreach services.</p><p>  Between 2002 and February  2011, a full time information officer service was provided  in Buncrana. The combination of funding available under the Jobs Initiative Scheme operated by Inishowen Development Partnership Ltd and a funding allocation from Donegal CIS equivalent to a 0.5 post allowed for the delivery of a service five days a week in Buncrana Citizens Information Centre.</p><p>  Since February 2011, the Jobs Initiative Scheme resource is no longer available.  In order to provide a service in Buncrana,  Donegal CIS reallocated resources to provide cover on two days each week pending recruitment to fill the 0.5 post allocated to the Centre.  Following recruitment in October, a part-time Information Officer has now been permanently allocated to the Buncrana office so that a service can be provided on three days per week.</p><p>  In addition information and assistance on the range of services and schemes offered by my Department can be obtained in Buncrana Social Welfare Local Office.</p><p>  Donegal CIS also provides targeted information sessions to local groups and communities where a need is identified or to meet specific requests.</p><p>  The Citizens Information Board also operates a national helpline, telephone 0761 07 4000, which provides a comprehensive and confidential information service to people throughout the country, Monday to Friday from 9am to 9pm.  Further information is provided on a broad range of subjects on the citizen&rsquo;s information website www.citizensinformation.ie, which aims to meet customer demands for fast, easy access to comprehensive information on rights and entitlements.</p><p>  I am satisfied that Donegal CIS is monitoring demand and keeping the level of service provided in all its locations under regular review in line with available resources.</p></reply>

In addition, factors outside the Department&rsquo;s control can have an impact, for example, insufficient information received from claimants at time of application and delays in claimants furnishing the information requested.  The above figures include approximately 900 EU and bilateral cases awaiting decision which have a significantly longer processing time, the majority of which fall into the &gt;1 year category.</p><p>Following an intensive backlog elimination project in invalidity pension section, all claims which were backlogged have now been examined and are awaiting a medical assessment and/or any additional information requested from the customer.  Upon receipt of the necessary information, a decision will be made without delay.  The majority of those claims fall into the category of &gt;1 month and &lt;1 year.</p><p>It should also be noted that claims from customers whose illness benefit was due to expire were prioritised for processing.  Therefore, most of the customers currently awaiting decision are in receipt of illness benefit at present.</p><p>At present, approximately 220 new invalidity pension claims are received in the Department each week and these are examined within two days of receipt.  Where a medical assessment and/or further information are required these are requested.  Upon completion of the medical assessment and receipt of any further information required, these claims are processed without delay.</p><p>There is a current cadre of 27 medical assessors including the Chief Medical Advisor and the Acting Deputy Chief Medical Advisor.  The medical assessors are fully qualified and experienced medical practitioners who must have at least 6 years satisfactory experience in the practice of medicine since registration with the Medical Council.  Many of the medical assessors have specialist post-graduate qualifications and all have experience/training in human disability evaluation.</p><p>The delay in processing medical assessments is due to a number of factors such as the increase in volume of customer claims to particular schemes, the time involved in assessing cases where there is lengthy medical evidence to be assessed and the recent retirement of 4 of the medical assessors.  The Department is addressing this issue and 3 new medical assessors have commenced employment with the Department since 1 November 2012, from a panel of 14 which was set up following a competition as arranged by the Public Appointments Service.</p><p>Six additional staff were assigned to the invalidity pension area in an effort to deal with the backlog which has been reducing steadily since June 2012.  The number of invalidity pension claims awaiting decision at the end of May 2012 was 7007 &ndash; this has reduced to 4561 at the end of October 2012 and is continuing to reduce.</p></reply>

In 2011 expenditure on FIS amounted to almost &euro;205 million in respect of some 29,000 families.  The FIS payment is designed to preserve the financial incentive to take-up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might be marginally better off in employment than on social welfare payments.  To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in insurable employment which is expected to last for at least three months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week. </p><p>  There are a number of factors that would have to be taken in to account in any consideration of extending eligibility criteria for FIS to include self-employed persons.  In particular, there would be considerable practical difficulties in defining and controlling an alternative to the hours worked condition.  It would be impossible to establish satisfactorily a self-employed person&rsquo;s hours of employment and certify this on an ongoing basis.  Extending FIS eligibility to the self-employed would also need to take into account the fact that there are already arrangements in place to provide income support to self-employed people on low incomes, such as through jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and through farm assist for low-income farmers.  Furthermore, the cost of extending the scheme to the self-employed would be considerable and could only be considered in a budgetary context.  Therefore, an extension of the FIS scheme to the self-employed would in effect change the nature of the scheme and it would not be feasible or desirable to extend FIS in this regard in its current form.</p><p>  None the less, I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including the FIS, raises complex issues about the effectiveness and efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children.  In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been asked to recommend cost-effective solutions as to how employment incentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes.  The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area.  Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will assist the Government in setting out a pathway towards a more appropriate system of child income supports.</p></reply>

As I have indicated previously, all of these issues need to be addressed to the satisfaction of the Government before any decision could be taken on the possible introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme and in the event that the Government was to proceed with such a scheme, an impact assessment &ndash; in particular focusing on small and medium enterprises &ndash; would form part of the preparatory measures. </p></reply>

The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience.  It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.</p><p>  The JobBridge Scheme has made significant progress to-date since it came into operation on the 1<sup>st</sup> July 2011.  12,308 internships have commenced to date with 5,427 participants currently on an internship as at 22nd November 2012 and over 2,000 opportunities presently advertised on .</p><p>  In response to the Deputy&#8217;s specific query, it is must be stated that the Scheme is open to self-employed individuals or companies in all sectors including private, public, voluntary and community sectors provided they have a minimum of 1 full time employee (employed for 30 hours or more per week, subject to tax and PRSI).</p><p>  A host organisation participating in JobBridge must be in a position to provide a substantial commitment to their intern so as to ensure the provision of a quality internship.</p><p>  To this end, a clear set of rules have been developed to protect the intern and safeguard the Scheme from potential abuse.  Potential host organisations can avail of the JobBridge guidelines and full eligibility criteria available on the JobBridge website .</p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the interim evaluation report conducted by Indecon published on the 5<sup>th</sup> of October 2012 found that the majority (58%) of host organisations are small organisations employing less than 50 persons across a broad range of sectors.</p><p>  Furthermore, I wish to advise that the existing terms and conditions of the Scheme including eligibility will be examined as part of this independent evaluation of the Scheme.  This report will also present recommendations on how the Scheme might be improved.  It is anticipated that this Report will be available by year end 2012.  It is at this stage that further consideration will be given to amending the terms and conditions of the Scheme.  Any such amendment or changes will then be notified via the website</p></reply>

PSC design and delivery: The projects to design, develop and deliver the PSC along with the capability to issue, interact with, manage and provide customer support for the card,</p><p>2.   SAFE Registration development: The projects to develop and deliver the SAFE registration business processes and the ICT systems within the Department to support them (and generate PSC requests),</p><p>3.   DSP Deployment: The projects to deploy the functionality in the Department&rsquo;s offices, register clients and issue cards to them, and</p><p>4.   Future use: Projects to oversee the future development and use of the PSC and its infrastructure, including possible use for on-line and financial services both internally and in other public service bodies.</p><p>  The first two programmes of work are essentially complete for issue of the standard PSC.  The detailed project plan to produce a PSC containing the Free Travel application (PSC-FT) and a variant suitable for issue to juveniles is currently being finalised.  The DSP&rsquo;s main focus now is on the deployment of the registration process throughout the Department&rsquo;s offices and rapidly increasing its ability to issue standard PSC&rsquo;s. </p><p>  A PSC is currently issued following a &ldquo;face-to-face&rdquo; registration process which involves the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature, the verification of identity and current address as well as the capture of additional data such as answers to security questions to be used in ensuring the future integrity of customers&rsquo; data.  </p><p>  Letters which are issuing from the Department to a number of customers in relation to registration for their PSC ask them to bring proof of identity and evidence of current address with them.   </p><p>  The roll-out of the SAFE registration functionality on a national basis began in June this year, following recruitment and training of staff. The creation of a SAFE registration environment in a local office involves improving the technical connectivity, installing new equipment and training staff in these offices to support the registration process. To date, this process has been completed in 41 DSP Offices with 72 SAFE Stations in production and some 500 staff have been trained. The total number of Public Services Cards issued now exceeds 60,000. </p><p>  Work is continuing on developing the required bandwidth, installing the appropriate equipment and training staff across the remainder of the Department&rsquo;s local office network. In addition, a number of dedicated public services card registration centres are being progressed.  One such centre has already opened in Gandon House on Dublin&rsquo;s Amiens Street and others will start to come on stream over the coming months.  </p><p>  On the specific issue of the validity period of the cards, this was determined with regard to two issues in particular: the security of the data held electronically and the physical resilience of the card.  After receipt of external expert advice including comparison with other cards, the validity period for the PSC was set at 7 years. This initial policy will be kept under review and changes to it may occur depending on practical experience of the cards&rsquo; durability in the field.</p></reply>

The project involved the development of IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was completed in June 2012.</p><p>  Initial focus was placed on clearing the backlog of CA applications awaiting scanning and registration. An additional 4 temporary staff were allocated to this effort. Over July and August 2012, 4,414 applications were scanned and registered - clearing the scanning backlog completely. Applications are now scanned within a day or two of being received.  The focus then moved to the processing of new applications. Processing of applications was divided into two streams.  One concentrates on dealing with new application intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination. The 4 temporary staff originally allocated to scanning duties were reassigned to CA application processing to support this plan. Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September.  During the month of September 2012 1,147 CA applications were received, while 1,317 were decided. In October 2012 1,061 CA applications were received, while 2,520 were decided.</p><p>  Under the initial plan, elimination of the backlog of CA applications was targeted for the end of May 2013.  However, within the current month, a further additional 10 temporary staff have been assigned to CA section.  This further injection of resources brings the target for backlog elimination the backlog of CA forward to the end of March 2013.</p><p>  The allocation of available resources to this task continues to be monitored and managed to ensure that the backlog is eliminated in the quickest possible time.</p></reply>

FIS claims, both new and renewal, received on or after the 5th November 2012 are currently being processed on receipt.  There are 284 new family income supplement (FIS) applications and 340 renewal applications from the County of Tipperary pending decision since before 5th November.  An in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project has recently been completed for the FIS scheme.  This project focused on optimising output, improving customer service and the elimination of backlogs.  Part of the project was a detailed examination of workloads and a full assessment of existing capacity within the area and what capacity is needed in order to process the volumes of claims, both new and renewal, being received on a weekly basis.  The outcome of this review is a detailed plan outlining the process required to manage both the   continuous weekly intake and backlog claims clearance.  This plan sees the current weekly new claim and renewal intake processed by one team, while the backlog is ring-fenced and a focused team assigned to this work with a clear plan for its elimination.  </p><p>  The team, including additional temporary resources has been identified and is already assigned and working on the backlog claims.  In order to reduce the time it will take to eliminate the backlog, some claims are being processed outside of Longford Social Welfare Services Office.  This team is fully focussed on the elimination of the backlog of claims in the shortest possible timeframe, concentrating in the first instance on those claims which were previously in payment but where payment has expired and continuing on to first-time new claims.  Within those categories, those waiting the longest will be processed first.  It is expected that the backlog will be fully eliminated by the end of March 2013.  Claims which are approved by the backlog team will be backdated to the date of claim or the date of expiry of the previous claim, as appropriate, and all arrears due will be paid.</p></reply>

The EAT upheld that 20 of the 22 appellants were entitled to a statutory redundancy payment from their former employer, the organisation to which the Deputy refers.   The appeals of the other two appellants were withdrawn at the hearing.   </p><p>  Following the EAT decision, redundancy lump sum claims in respect of the 20 eligible employees were received by the Department.   The 20 claims have been awarded and payment of their statutory redundancy entitlement, issued directly to those former employees in May 2012.  It should also be noted that when the project closed, F&Aacute;S offered each JI Participant on the scheme alternative employment with other community employers in Tipperary including the retention of accumulated service and pay. These positions were approved by F&Aacute;S, were additional to existing positions and would not have displaced jobs of existing workers. Only one person took up this offer.  </p><p>  In relation to an enhanced severance package, to which the Deputy refers, I am advised that no basis exists to enable payment of an enhanced severance package to Job Initiative participants, where such sponsors did not have adequate funds for this purpose.

My Department will spend almost &euro;215 million in 2012 on the scheme benefitting almost 400,000 people. </p><p>  The purpose of the fuel allowance scheme is to assist pensioners and householders on long-term social welfare payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full. </p><p>  The allowance is &euro;20 per week and is paid with the person&rsquo;s weekly social welfare payment.  This allows the recipient to purchase whatever type of fuel they wish, be that oil, coal or natural gas.  Vouchers have been used in the past but such schemes, by their nature, introduce stigma to a scheme.  It is also the experience of the Department that voucher systems are administratively complex, inordinately costly and raise fraud and control issues.</p><p>  Given that the face value of any vouchers issued would be relatively small, the administration would significantly add to the cost of the scheme.  Such a system would have to operate across a wide diversity of fuel suppliers, given the range and type of home heating products available, including suppliers based outside the jurisdiction.  It would also require the putting in place of a separate administrative arrangement, adding further complexity to service provision for customers.  Issues would arise with the distribution, reconciliation and control of vouchers.  In addition, vouchers are easily lost and there would be much greater fraud potential, requiring more involved control procedures to minimise risks. </p><p>  Given the Department&rsquo;s previous experience with vouchers and the Department&rsquo;s current e-payment strategy, it is not intended that a voucher system will be introduced in connection with any aspect of the payments made at this time.   I am satisfied that the scheme as it is currently administered allows the greatest flexibility and meets the needs of the customers of my Department.  </p><p>  The regulation of coal standards is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

It seeks to achieve this objective as a result of various practical measures which will better support Gaeltacht families who are raising their children through Irish or who wish to raise their children through Irish. The specific target groups under the Family Language Support Programme include expectant parents and parents of children of preschool and primary school age. </p><p>  Insofar as the Kerry Gaeltacht is concerned, I am glad to report that, as a result of a recent meeting between my Department and relevant stakeholders, a number of specific measures are being progressed. These measures include the dispersal of an information leaflet <i>Ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il do ph&aacute;iste le Gaeilge/Raising your child through Irish</i>   via ante-natal services in Tralee General Hospital and relevant health service facilities in the Kerry Gaeltacht. Arrangements are also in hand which will see the umbrella organisation Comhar Na&iacute;onra&iacute; na Gaeltachta Teo. involved in the dissemination of the leaflet to all preschools operating under its auspices; the introduction of a presentation as part of the ante-natal classes around the issue of language choice. This presentation will include the usage of a short video highlighting the advantages of raising children through Irish which has been developed by my Department as part of the Family Language Support Programme. While my Department is spearheading the programme, it should be noted that Comharchumann Forbartha Chorca Dhuibhne Teo. will play a key role in delivering this part of the programme in the Kerry Gaeltacht as part of their overall remit; and the provision and dispersal of information posters through appropriate public facilities, including libraries and health facilities, in conjunction with Kerry County Council, throughout the Kerry Gaeltacht.</p><p>  The content of the language support pack developed under the programme has been further developed. Almost 300 support packs have been distributed to date, including 57 support packs to Gaeltacht-based families. It is anticipated that this figure will increase as the roll-out of this part of the overall programme continues. </p><p>  The Family Language Support Programme also targets Gaeltacht households with primary school children. In order to better support such families &#8211; insofar as the Kerry Gaeltacht is concerned &#8211; my Department recently sanctioned an allocation of &#8364;241,075 to Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne in respect of the Language Assistants Scheme, which this organisation operates on behalf of my Department in the Kerry Gaeltacht. This represents an increase in funding of almost &#8364;30,000 for the current school-year and will facilitate the further development of the scheme in order to better support primary school children in the Kerry Gaeltacht with improved opportunities for both acquiring and improving their fluency in the language.</p></reply>

My Department has commenced a review of all issues relating to the ongoing management of the lakes in the Park, including all boating activities, with a view to developing a long-term sustainable strategy for the lakes as an integral part of the Park.   It is expected that the review will be completed in the early part of next year.</p><p>  Private boats on the lakes in the Park are regulated by way of mooring discs. Under a scheme introduced in 1991, mooring discs were issued to all boat owners having a recognised traditional mooring on the lakes, subject to an overall limit on the number of discs issued.</p><p>  My Department receives numerous requests for mooring spaces but, unfortunately, the demand far exceeds the number of spaces available. My Department does not permit the placing of boats on the lakes on a daily or casual basis, as boats and engines coming from outside the Park carry the risk of spreading invasive alien species such as zebra mussels and various pond weeds. To facilitate others who would wish to use the lakes, persons applying for discs are placed on a waiting list and, as discs become available, they are allocated to those on the waiting list. In addition, a lottery is held annually to allow 20 additional people use the lakes for a year.</p></reply>

The Act provides for a statutory language planning process under which language plans will be prepared at community level in areas seeking to achieve statutory recognition. This approach puts communities at the centre of the language planning process since it gives them the opportunity to take ownership of their own plan in their own community. </p><p>  In addition to Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas, areas located outside the Gaeltacht may achieve statutory recognition as Gaeltacht Service Towns or as Irish Language Networks, subject to fulfilling language planning criteria. Gaeltacht Service Towns are defined as towns in, or adjacent to, Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas which play a significant role in the delivery of services to those areas. Irish Language Networks are defined as areas, located outside Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas, in which there is a basic critical mass of community and State support for the Irish language.</p><p>  Since &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is central to community development in the Gaeltacht and provides funding to various community-based organisations, it will assist communities in preparing and implementing language plans in the 19 Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas. &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, or Foras na Gaeilge, as appropriate, will assist organisations in towns seeking statutory recognition as Gaeltacht Service Towns with the preparation and implementation of language plans, depending on whether the town is located inside or outside the Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas. In addition, Foras na Gaeilge will assist organisations in areas seeking statutory recognition as Irish Language Networks with the preparation and implementation of language plans in those areas. </p><p>  There will be a need for capacity building in the various community-based organisations involved in the language planning process. &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, in conjunction with Acadamh na hOllscola&iacute;ochta Gaeilge, NUI Galway, are preparing a practical training programme to this end.</p></reply>

In this context, the Strategy proposes that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Appointments Service should devise appropriate arrangements over time to increase the cohort of public servants who are functional bilinguals, having regard to the present constraints on public sector recruitment. </p><p>  The Strategy also provides for these arrangements to be supported by the development, within the existing overall national qualifications framework, of an independent, standards-based accreditation system for Irish language competency within the public service and proposes that a National Diploma in Bilingualism and Language Practice should be designed and offered, so as to support the delivery of quality services to the public in both Irish and English. </p><p>  It should be noted also that the Official Languages Act 2003 has adopted the language scheme as a core instrument for the provision of bilingual services by the public sector and the Strategy provides for future language schemes to specify the posts within organisations that have an Irish language competency requirement.</p><p>  Clearly, the implementation of initiatives such as these would significantly advance the objective of enhancing the delivery of public services in Irish in a satisfactory manner. My Department is in discussion with relevant stakeholders, including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with a view to progressing this objective, while taking account of the significant resource restraints at this time.  As a first step, it has been agreed in principle with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that my Department will assume responsibility for advancing arrangements that will facilitate the training and proficiency assessment of staff in the use of the Irish language in the civil service and certain areas of the public service.  It is expected that arrangements to this end will be put in place from early next year.</p></reply>

These arrangements involve the groups moving to nearby bogs, with the group from Clara Bog having commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June last. Progress has also been made with a view to the relocation of qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation in County Kildare in a similar manner. My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Carrownagappul Bog, Curraghlehanagh Bog and Ballynafagh Bog special areas of conservation will be able to commence turf cutting in the relocation sites in the 2013 turf cutting season.</p><p>  24 qualifying turf cutters have been accommodated at the relocation site in Killeranny. It is envisaged that more will be accommodated at the site for the 2013 cutting season.</p><p>  69 applicants for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme from Carrownagappul Bog special area of conservation, 19 applicants from Curraghlehanagh Bog special area of conservation, and 29 applicants from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.</p><p>  I understand that works to facilitate turf cutting are well advanced in all relocation sites with the exception of that for qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation. It is anticipated that works will also be required at this site and that these works will commence in early 2013.</p><p>  I am advised that of the remaining 49 raised bog special areas of conservation, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 30 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating potential relocation sites. Relocation is unlikely to be required or is likely to be small scale for another 15 raised bog special areas of conservation due, for example, to the small number of turf cutters that have been active on these sites.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that relocation is a very complex process, in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, the infrastructure/drainage works required, establishing the number who can be accommodated on the site, the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements. Accordingly, it will only be possible to bring this process to a conclusion over time in respect of all the relocation sites.</p></reply>

The scheme is a demand-led programme and the Government has committed &euro;76.146 million in Exchequer funding to the programme in 2012.</p><p>  The Better Energy Homes scheme provides financial assistance for improving energy performance of older homes, built any time before 2006.  The scheme enables homeowners to save money, while improving comfort and reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions.  Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Rating (BER). </p><p>  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is delivered through a combination of SEAI appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage. Measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation.</p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to roll out a Pay-As-You-Save (PAYS) retrofit scheme after 2013, to replace the Exchequer funding currently being provided to the Better Energy Programme. The PAYS concept is an innovative financing mechanism that would allow consumers to finance energy efficient upgrades. This should allow consumers to avail of energy efficiency measures, including measures to insulate dwellings, using the money that they would have spent on their energy bill. The PAYS project team has commenced and is working on bringing a detailed design to Government in summer 2013.</p><p>However, at this point in time, I have no plans to make any changes to the grants provided under the Better Energy Homes and Better Energy Warmer Homes schemes or to amend how the schemes are currently administered.</p></reply>

The Affordable Energy Strategy provides a framework for building upon the many measures already in place to protect households at risk from the effects of energy poverty, which include the thermal efficiency-based measures delivered through the Better Energy: Warmer Homes programme.  This programme is a key element of the Affordable Energy Strategy.  The energy efficiency measures, which it funds, are targeted at low income families and will make a lasting impact on fuel poverty in the case of individuals benefiting under the scheme.  Exchequer funding of &euro;23.647 million has been allocated to this programme in 2012.  The scheme has addressed 87,789 fuel poor homes since 2000 of which 7,401 have been delivered since the start of 2012 to the end of October.  So far this year, over &euro;9 million has been spent under Better Energy: Warmer Homes.</p><p>  There are forty-eight actions identified in the strategy that are being implemented over the life-time of the report (3 years).  Five priority measures are identified including a commitment to review the National Fuel Scheme in the context of examining the feasibility of aligning income supports with the energy efficiency and income of the home, the phased introduction of minimal thermal efficiency standards for rental accommodation, ensuring greater access to energy efficiency measures, reforming the eligibility criteria for energy efficiency schemes and the introduction of an area based approach.  Work is ongoing by the IDGAE on the implementation of all the actions contained in the strategy.</p></reply>

The DS3 programme is about developing solutions to the challenges associated with increasing levels of renewable generation, particularly with regard to secure power system operation, as we work to achieve the 2020 renewable targets.</p><p>  The DS3 programme brings together many different strands, including development of financial incentives for better plant performance, and development of operational policies and system tools to use the portfolio to the best of its capabilities. Standards for wind farms and conventional plant are also being reviewed to give enhanced operational flexibility for the future. </p><p>  A central aspect of the DS3 programme is the System Services Review. System Services are products, other than energy, that are required for the continuous, secure operation of the power system.  The System Services Review is being carried out to identify the new system services that are needed to complement the transition towards a power system with high levels of wind generation.  To date, two public consultations have been held related to System Services; a third public consultation is expected in the coming months.  The exact timing of the consultation will be determined by the Single Electricity Market Committee (SEMC). </p><p>It is important to note that the DS3 programme involves a variety of different stakeholders, including the Distribution System Operators, Regulatory Authorities, Conventional Generators and Renewable Generators, as well as the TSOs.</p></reply>

With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.</p><p>  The National Broadband Plan, which I published recently, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically 70Mbps &ndash; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; at least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and a minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.</p><p>  During the preparation of the Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.</p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.</p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known, nor is it possible to set out a definitive timeframe for the roll out of services.</p><p>  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland will have at least 30Mbps connectivity in the shortest possible time.</p></reply>

It was considered that, in light of the complex issues involved, a local property tax would take time to introduce and accordingly to meet the requirements in the EU/IMF Programme, the Government decided to introduce a household charge in 2012 as an interim measure. This was done via the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011.   </p><p>An appropriate broadening of the revenue base for local government will be achieved through the household charge and the forthcoming full local property tax. Income from the household charge and from a future local property tax is critical in ensuring that local authorities have the necessary resources to continue to deliver services to their communities.   </p><p>An independently-chaired Inter-Departmental Expert Group was established earlier this year to consider the structures and modalities for an equitable Local Property Tax to replace the Household Charge. The Group submitted its report and proposals will be brought to Government which will decide on the exact details of implementation .   </p><p>The Government has decided that the Local Property Tax will be collected and administered by the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

I expect local authorities to use their statutory powers as they consider appropriate.While I have no plans to amend the Derelict Sites Act at this time, I will keep the need for further legislative reforms to assist local authorities in addressing issues of dereliction under review.  Local authorities also have powers under other legislation to deal with derelict sites or structures, for example, under the Sanitary Services Act 1963.</p></reply>

It also recognises the approved housing body sector as a key partner in the delivery of social housing solutions for low-income families and persons with specific categories of housing need.</p><p>  I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is framed in a manner which optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to just over &euro;333.7m this year and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities are now operating, a tentative projection of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units is anticipated for 2012.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies (AHBs) for construction and acquisition. In this regard, the Housing Finance Agency has received eighteen applications from AHBs for Certified Borrower status and awarded such status to five bodies, with a number of others currently being assessed. The Agency has approved six applications for 128 social housing units in total (at a valuation of &euro;11.6 million). It is envisaged that further lending will be generated for the Agency in 2013, under this Scheme, with more AHBs applying for Certified Body status and subsequent loan applications for social housing schemes.</p><p>I am conscious that the move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by AHBs to more revenue funded options presents challenges for them. I intend to develop an enabling regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it by Government and to underline its status as a viable and attractive investment opportunity for financial institutions. My Department is actively working with the sector on the development of a voluntary code which I expect most bodies will endorse. This code, which should be finalised and agreed in the coming months, will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop a longer-term statutory framework that will best support the enhanced role of AHBs.   </p><p>Specifically u under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), funding of up to 100% of the approved cost is available for the provision of accommodation to meet the needs of persons with specific categories of housing need including older people, people with an intellectual, physical or mental health disability, the homeless, returning emigrants and victims of domestic violence. My Department&rsquo;s involvement with these voluntary and co-operative housing schemes relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects. The detailed administration of the schemes, and the certification that projects comply with the terms and conditions of the funding schemes, are the responsibility of the relevant local authority.   </p><p>In early 2012, some &euro;46 million in CAS funding was allocated to local authorities in respect of existing commitments on CAS projects then underway. In   July I announced details of a &euro;35 million programme of special needs housing provision which is intended to deliver some 377 housing units at 55 locations across the country. Approvals were based on local housing need and on the priority afforded to individual proposals by local authorities. </p><p>There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).

These Regulations specify the frequency for sampling and analysis of water supplies and prescribe the limits for 48 microbiological, chemical and indicator parameters and standards which water supplies are required to meet.  Drinking water samples are assessed for compliance with &#8216;total indicative dose&#8217; (TID) which is the parametric standard for radiation set out in the Regulations.  </p><p>  Under the Regulations, the EPA is responsible for the supervision of the provision of public water supplies by local authorities, while local authorities are responsible for supervising other water suppliers.  All water suppliers are required to ensure that water is clean and wholesome and this is verified by regular monitoring and sampling.  The Regulations also refer to exempted supplies; these are individual supplies of less than 10 cubic metres per day or serving less than 50 persons and not serving any commercial or public activity.  These supplies are not required to meet the monitoring requirements of the Regulations.  </p><p>  It is a responsibility of the EPA, under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, to publish the results of such water testing. The Act requires such reports to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The most recent drinking water report produced by the Agency, <i>The Provision and Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland, A Report for the Year 2010</i>   was published in 2011. These reports set out details on the monitoring results for drinking water quality. </p></reply>

Under Coroners'  Rules of Practice, as outlined on the Coroners website www.coroners.ie, all maternal deaths relating to childbirth are required to be reported to the coroner. The Coroners Bill 2007, confirms this by providing, inter-alia, in the Third Schedule on Deaths Reportable to Coroner, for the reporting of "any maternal death that occurs during or following pregnancy (up to a period of six weeks post-partum) or that might be related to pregnancy".  </p><p>  The cases cited by the Deputy are indeed tragic and we are all conscious of the anguish of the families concerned. However, it is the case that maternal deaths in this State are very rare and we have one of the lowest maternal mortality rates in the world. Where such deaths occur, they must be reported to a coroner who would normally require that a post-mortem examination be held. It is then a matter for decision by the coroner, having regard to the circumstances of the maternal death, whether an inquest is necessary to determine the circumstances. While an inquest would normally be held, there may be cases where an inquest would be unnecessary and leaving it to the discretion of the coroner is, therefore, considered to be the most appropriate public policy position.</p><p>  The Coroners Bill 2007 is before the Seanad having been restored to the Order Paper on my initiative. The Bill is in the course of being reviewed in my Department with a view, among other matters, to making it as cost-effective as possible. The Bill, as published, provides for the comprehensive reform of the existing legislation and structures relating to coroners and provides for the establishment of a new Coroner Service. The Bill incorporates many of the recommendations made by the Coroners Review Group in 2000 and the Coroners Rules Committee in 2003 and it aims to fulfil various obligations placed on the State by the European Convention on Human Rights and, particularly, the Article 2 requirement in relation to the investigation of deaths of persons involving the State. </p><p>  It would be my hope to progress the Coroners Bill next year.</p></reply>

The person concerned availed of the 'Timed Out' Student transitional measure introduced under the New Regime for Students in January 2011 as a concession  to those student affected by the changes brought about by the New Regime.  The position remains that the person concerned has not secured a work permit or a green card employment permit and is now required to leave the State.</p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that as a final measure in assisting in the transition to the New Immigration Regime for Non-EEA Students , a student probationary extension has been made available to those students who have been continuously resident in the State since before 1 January 2005 (i.e. the student must have received a GNIB certificate of registration during or before 2004 and for each year thereafter) and who commenced their studies on or before the 31st December 2004. These new arrangements will allow eligible students to reside in Ireland for a further period of 2 years on specified conditions. Students who either entered the State or commenced their studies after the 31st December 2004 are not eligible for this extension as they do not satisfy the above conditions. The person referred to by Deputy arrived in Ireland on 19 May, 2006 and as a consequence is ineligible for consideration under the 2004 Student Probationary Extension.</p><p>  Any student who either first entered the State or commenced their studies after 31 December 2004, including the person concerned, is subject to the rules set out under the New Immigration Regime for Full Time non-EEA Students, which was published in September 2010 and which has operated since 1 January 2011.  Comprehensive information notes for non-EEA students are available on the dedicated student page of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service website at www.inis.gov.ie.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

When a manual payment is received, the defendant will be issued a receipt if it is paid in an office or by post.  For on-line payments, the defendant has the option to print or email a receipt.  This receipt is then proof of payment.  If a receipt is lost then either the relevant court office or the Courts Accounts Office can provide a duplicate receipt.    </p><p>  I am also informed that, on occasion, a judge may order the defendant to pay compensation directly to a victim, thereby bypassing the Courts or alternatively pay the compensation to the prosecuting Garda for onward transmission to a victim.  In those circumstances the availability of evidence of payment will depend on what is required by the judge.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Courts are subject only to the Constitution and the law independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and the decision made in any case is a matter for the presiding judge.  However, I have asked the Garda authorities to provide any relevant information on this matter and I will contact the Deputy when the Garda report is to hand.   <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-27a.1122.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112700068#WRU00500"><p>I take the opportunity presented by the Deputy's question to set out generally the legislative provisions relating to the investigation and prosecution of offences which may arise from cyberbullying.  Bullying in any form, including cyberbullying, may amount to harassment and may therefore be an offence under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997, as amended. </p><p>  Section 10 provides that any person who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, by any means including by use of the telephone, harasses another by persistently following, watching, pestering, besetting or communicating with him or her, is guilty of an offence.  For the purposes of Section 10, a person harasses another where (a) he or she, by his or her acts intentionally or recklessly, seriously interferes with the other's peace and privacy or causes alarm, distress or harm to the other, and (b) his or her acts are such that a reasonable person would realise that the acts would seriously interfere with the other's peace and privacy or cause alarm, distress or harm to the other. </p><p>  A person convicted of an offence under Section 10 is liable on summary conviction to a class C fine or to imprisonment for up to 12 months or to both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for up to seven years or to both.  As I stated in the House on 7 November, my attention has been drawn to the difficulty which, it seems, is presented by the need to demonstrate persistence in the harassment.  As I said on that occasion, I have asked the Law Reform Commission to examine the issue and I await its conclusions.</p><p>  The offence of threatening to kill or cause serious harm in section 5 of the 1997 Act may also be relevant.  Anyone convicted of an offence under that section is liable on summary conviction to a class C fine or to imprisonment for up to 12 months or to both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or to both.  The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 may be relevant to some instances of cyberbullying.  The Act prohibits incitement to hatred on account of race, religion, nationality or sexual orientation.</p><p>  The Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 facilitates the investigation of cyberbullying offences.  It permits the retention of and access to data for the purposes of the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of serious offences.  A serious offence is an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of five years or more as well as offences listed in schedule 1 to the Act.  The Deputy will note that the offences at Sections 5 and 10 of the 1997 Act meet the criteria and are therefore considered to be serious offences for the purposes of the 2011 Act.</p><p>  On the question of interpreting the law, the practice in this jurisdiction is that the Oireachtas enacts the legislation, the Gardai (or other relevant agency) enforces it and the courts interpret and apply it. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-27a.1125.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112700068#WRU00700"><p>I refer the Deputy to my reply to D&aacute;il Questions Nos. 153, 155, 156 &amp; 157 of the 22 November (below) which deals with the recent increase in fees for the issue of a Certificate of Registration under the Immigration Act, 2004. </p><p>   Section 9 of the Immigration Act, 2004 provides that a register of non-nationals who have permission to be in the State (in general for a period of three months or longer) shall be established and maintained by registration officers.  Registration officers are members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na: in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, it is the officer in charge of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB); outside of that area it is the Superintendent of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na district.  The Act provides that a non-national is required to pay a fee to the registration officer for the issue of a registration certificate.  This fee is set by regulations made by the Minister for Justice and Equality with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is no requirement to consult with other bodies when contemplating a revision of these or other fees.  Moreover, it is difficult to see what useful purpose would be served by such an exercise as it is unlikely that affected parties or their representatives would signal support for such an increase.  The fee was first introduced in 2006 and was then set at &euro;100.  It was increased to &euro;150 in 2008 and remained at that level until the latest increase came into effect on 19 November, 2012.</p><p>  The introduction of the registration fee in May, 2006 resulted from a policy decision that the fee income was required for the ongoing development of immigration services - both in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  Our migrant population have made a valuable contribution to the economic, cultural and social life of Ireland and will continue to do so.  However, I believe that it is not unreasonable to ask those who benefit from the immigration system to make a reasonable contribution to the cost of services and particularly so in a time when we are seeking to reduce public expenditure.  It is common practice throughout Europe to charge a fee for immigration services; in some instances these may be set at a level above the estimated direct administrative cost of the service based on the value of the service.  By comparison with many jurisdictions the current registration fee represents very good value.  </p><p>  I am also very conscious of the need to maintain and develop good service levels to customers.  In this regard, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is undertaking a number of projects with the aim of developing and improving immigration services.  These include the introduction of a new common format EU Residence Permit for non-nationals which will replace the current registration certificate.  It will provide the user with a more secure immigration document including individual biometrics indicators protected by a sophisticated encryption system and showing the holders&rsquo; immigration status in the State.  This high quality, secure document will be easily recognisable for employers and Government agencies. </p><p>  Furthermore, INIS as part of its reform of in-country aspects of immigration services, is developing a range of measures including on line application and appointment systems for certain services.  Such a service is badly needed, but it costs money to implement.  The nature of immigration requirements such as registration necessitates, to a very great extent, the personal attendance of the applicant.  At certain times of the year this can give rise to long queues and significant delays.  A self-selecting online system will help to greatly alleviate these difficulties and the increased registration fee income will be used to meet a portion of the cost involved in this and other developments. </p><p>  Other projects being progressed are proposals for the civilianisation of certain port of entry functions at Dublin Airport.  For this purpose, a trial is underway at Dublin airport to test the feasibility of a new model for delivery of immigration services at ports of entry to the State by using a combination of civilian staff and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I refer the Deputy to my answer to D&aacute;il Question No. 171 of 4 October, 2012 which sets out the latest position in respect of this project. </p><p>  In recognition of the circumstances of certain categories of person, there are specific exemptions from paying the registration fee set out in the regulations; these are the following: </p><p>- UN Convention Refugees;</p><p>- Family members of such refugees who have been admitted to the State in accordance with section  18 of the Refugee Act 1996;</p><p>- Persons who are under 18 years of age at the time of registration;</p><p>- Spouses, civil partners, widows and widowers of Irish citizens;</p><p>- Spouses and Dependants of EU nationals who receive a residence permit under EU Directive 38/04;</p><p>- Programme Refugees, as defined by section 24 of the Refugee Act, 1996;</p><p>- Persons subject to arrangements for victims of human trafficking.</p><p>The above categories of non-nationals exempted from the fee payment are almost 20% of the total numbers registering.  Last year alone, this amounted to 21, 443 persons and &euro;3.2 million in fees waived&quot;. </p></reply>

The main purpose of the Act is to facilitate the more effective investigation of white collar crime and to reduce associated delays.

The Bill will replace and update existing offences relating to giving or receiving bribes in both the public and private sectors.  It will also introduce new offences in relation to corrupt influence peddling.  The recommendations of the Mahon Tribunal have been taken into account in provisions to be contained in the Bill such as a new offence of making payments knowingly or recklessly to a third party who intends to use them as bribes.</p><p>  I am briefed on an ongoing basis by the Garda Commissioner on the progress of the major white collar crime investigations which are underway and the Commissioner is also aware that any further legislative proposals which he feels would assist in the investigation and detection of white collar crime, or of fraud offences generally, will be positively considered by me.</p></reply>

The results are interesting with the study showing that almost 63% of offenders who were given an alternative sanction by the Courts in 2007 had not re-offended after two years.</p><p>  This study has established reliable recidivism data on offenders under probation supervision and on community service orders and considers variations in recidivism as they relate to the type of original order, gender and age of offenders, category of offence and subsequent offence.  Its findings show that the recidivism or re-offending rate was 37.2% for the particular cohort of offenders who were under probation supervision in the two years after their supervision ended. </p><p>  I believe the value of the work that has been done to produce this report is that it provides a clearer overview of community sanctions outcomes which will better inform the work of the Probation Service in helping to make our communities safer.  I look forward to receiving such evidence-based material on an annual basis.</p></reply>

These undertakings complement those structural reforms in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland aimed at removing restrictions to trade and competition relating to the legal professions and at reducing legal costs.</p><p>  Effect is being given to these structural reform commitments in the form of the Legal Services Bill 2011 which was published, in keeping with the relevant time-line under the Troika Programme, at the end of Quarter 3 of 2011.  The Bill, which remains a priority under the Government Legislation Programme, completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in February and is awaiting Committee Stage.  I have made comprehensive statements on the Bill and its continuing development to the D&aacute;il during Second Stage, at the Annual Conference of the Law Society on 14 of April, and at the conference hosted by my Department on <i>Regulatory Reform for a 21st Century Legal Profession</i>  that took place on 6 July.  The full text of these statements is available on the Department website, www.justice.ie, for ease of reference.  During the Second Stage debate I also recalled to the House the decision taken in May 2011 not to proceed with the appointment of a Legal Services Ombudsman.  This is because the oversight model proposed in the Legal Services Ombudsman Act of 2009 does not meet this Government&#8217;s policy commitment to greater independence in the regulation of the legal professions.  The Legal Services Regulation Bill, therefore, sets out an alternative and more independent supervisory regime. </p><p>  As the Legal Services Regulation Bill approaches Committee Stage it is set to provide for the establishment of a new Legal Services Regulatory Authority that will be independent of the Government, the Law Society and the Bar Council in its appointment and in the discharge of its functions.  The Bill will also establish an independent complaints framework to deal with allegations of professional misconduct to which the public will have direct access - at present such complaints are made through the professional bodies.  There will also be an independent Legal Practitioners&#8217; Disciplinary Tribunal dealing with both solicitors and barristers.  These changes are being augmented by a more modern, consumer friendly and transparent legal costs regime under the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator that will take over the duties of the existing Taxing Master.  The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a set of Legal Costs Principles and the determinations of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, who may also issue legal costs guidelines, will be made public.  The Bill will also open the legal services sector to new business models that will provide new opportunities for legal services providers while also providing greater choice and competition for the benefit of consumers.  </p><p>  I continue to receive submissions in relation to the Bill from various stakeholders and these are being considered in preparation for Committee Stage.  Work on the details of the proposed amendments to the Bill is ongoing at my Department, in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel.  As I have previously stated, the relevant amendments will be made available in advance of Committee Stage, along with the relevant Regulatory Impact Analysis.  It remains my objective, notwithstanding the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments - notably the Personal Insolvency Bill which continues to occupy Members of both Houses - that Committee Stage of the Legal Services Regulation Bill should commence early in the new year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-27a.1162.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112700068#WRU03400"><p>I can assure the Deputy that the Common Travel Area remains in effect and that the continuing existence of the CTA is of immense political, economic and social significance to both Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It is of critical importance that both Ireland and the United Kingdom work closely together to enhance the protection of the CTA.  Indeed, It was very much with this in mind that I agreed a programme of action with the then UK Minister of State for Immigration, Mr. Damien Green MP, as set out in the Joint Statement on the Protection of the CTA.  It was signed by both sides in Dublin on 20 December, 2011.  The Deputy will recall that in the <i>Joint Statement on British Irish relations - the Next Decade</i>, signed by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister on 12 March, 2012 reference is made to the Common Travel Area in the following terms: &#8220;We remain firmly committed to preserving and protecting the Common Travel Area, which allows ease of travel for our people.  We will continue to work together on immigration issues, and to combat potential vulnerabilities from terrorism, illegal immigration and organised crime.&#8221;</p><p>  There is no requirement for citizens of either jurisdiction to carry passports when travelling within the CTA.  However, it is the case that airline carriers in many instances require their passengers to have a passport in their possession before allowing them to board aircraft.  As such, this is not an immigration requirement.  Unlike the operational practices at some UK airports, there is generally no segregation of arriving passengers at Irish ports of entry to the State.  Consequently, Immigration Officers performing immigration control duties at airports in the State do not know where passengers have travelled from when such passengers present at immigration control desks.  It is, therefore, necessary for Immigration Officers to establish where passengers have arrived from, and in order to do this, an Immigration Officer may ask passengers questions with a view to establishing their nationality and port of embarkation.  Once satisfied that a person is a citizen of the Common Travel Area (CTA) and that such person has travelled from the United Kingdom, the Immigration Officer will make no further requirement of that person. </p><p>  In circumstances where a person, who is a national of the jurisdictions that form the Common Travel Area, and who has travelled from within the CTA and is not in possession of a passport, an Immigration Officer, in compliance with their duties under immigration legislation, is duty-bound to ask questions designed to establish that the person is a national of the jurisdictions that form the CTA and has travelled from within the CTA and as such is entitled to benefit from its immigration arrangements.</p><p>  For the sake of completeness, I should add that border entry practices in the UK for CTA arrivals vary considerably from place to place.  For example, in some UK regional airports, police officers on occasion seek identity documents for passengers from this jurisdiction.  In other cases, evidence of having boarded an aircraft in Ireland is sought.</p><p>  In recent years, personnel at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and in the UK immigration authorities have detected abuses within the Common Travel Area.  Movements of illegal persons, suspected human trafficking, illegal immigration and substantial levels of social welfare fraud are among the consequences of such abuse.  The co-operation of all passengers arriving in the State, including Irish and UK citizens who have travelled from the UK, greatly enhances the ability of Immigration personnel, both here and in the UK, to prevent and detect illegal immigration and associated criminality.   </p><p>  It should be noted that in fulfilling their duties at the frontiers of the State, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilise a range of legislative provisions.  In particular, such officers will, where necessary, enforce the provisions at section 33 of Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1988, which states, an authorised officer, in the interest of the proper operation or the security or safety of an aerodrome, or the security or safety of persons, aircraft or other property thereon, may require any person on an aerodrome to-:</p><p>(i) give his name and address and to produce other evidence of his / her identity;</p><p>(ii) state the purpose of his being on the aerodrome;</p><p>(iii) account for any baggage or other property which may be in his possession. </p></reply>

It also includes provisions for the development of enhanced cooperation in relation to law enforcement matters and judicial cooperation.  </p><p>  There are currently 25 fully participating States comprising all EU Member States with the exception of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria and three non-EU States: Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.  Border posts have been removed between Schengen area States and a common Schengen visa allows tourist or visitor access to the area.</p><p>  The Schengen agreement was incorporated into the framework of the European Union under the Treaty of Amsterdam.  The relevant Protocol recognised the fact that Ireland and the United Kingdom are not parties to the Schengen agreement and made provision to allow those Member States to accept some or all of its provisions at any time.</p><p>  Ireland has successfully applied to take part in certain elements of the Schengen agreement.  The activities which Ireland has applied to participate include police cooperation, mutual assistance in criminal matters, extradition and drugs co-operation.  Ireland also applied to participate in related aspects of the Schengen Information System -  a European search database which assists Member State authorities in carrying out border checks and police and customs checks.</p><p>  Ireland's application to participate in these specified articles of the agreement was approved by Council Decision in 2002.  In accordance with this Council Decision, these provisions will come into effect only after a range of technical and legislative measures have been put in place and successfully evaluated by the Council.  The measures which will enable Ireland to meet its Schengen requirements are currently being progressed.</p><p>  Ireland has not, however, applied to participate in the Schengen arrangements to the extent that they deal with the abolition of border checks.  This decision has been taken to maintain the common travel area (CTA) with the United Kingdom which remains a priority for Ireland.  The reality is that the common travel area could not continue to operate if Ireland were to remove border checks with Schengen States generally while the United Kingdom did not do so.  To do so would result in a situation where the land border with Northern Ireland would become the border between the Schengen area and the United Kingdom.  In such circumstances, land border controls would appear inevitable and this is obviously something that no Irish Government would seriously contemplate bringing about.   </p><p>  The Government's focus instead is on doing what it can to maximise the potential of the Common Travel Area as evidenced by the CTA visa waiver programme already introduced and ongoing talks with our UK colleagues on the possibility of a common CTA visa.</p></reply>

Any person issued with a registration certificate from that date will be required to pay the new fee of &euro;300 unless they come within those categories exempted from the charge. </p><p>  In respect of persons who may have been seeking to obtain a re-entry visa, I should point out that the fees for same have not changed.</p><p>  It is an unavoidable consequence, and unrelated to resources, that people seeking to register will fall on the either side of the fee increase introduction.  It is understandable that many people would have sought to avail of the lower rate in advance of the fee increase resulting in numbers at the public office Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), rising to exceptional levels at certain times.  However, I reject the contention that there is insufficient staff in the GNIB public office.  Indeed, there are extended opening hours in operation in the office from Monday to Thursday (8:00 AM to 10:00 PM); on Friday the hours are 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM.  Furthermore, as happens every year, special arrangements are put in place in September and October to facilitate the registration of students in major public and private colleges (who form the bulk of registrations in those months) as they begin or return to their studies.  Periods of time are set aside in the public office of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 specifically for registration of students which this year extended into November.  I understand that the bulk of students were in a position to complete their registration obligations in advance of the fee increase.</p><p>  In addition, it should be noted that in recognition of the circumstances of certain categories of person, there are specific exemptions from paying the registration fee set out in the regulations; these are the following:</p><p>- UN Convention Refugees;</p><p>- Family members of such refugees who have been admitted to the State in accordance with section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996;</p><p>- Persons who are under 18 years of age at the time of registration;</p><p>- Spouses, civil partners, widows and widowers of Irish citizens;</p><p>- Spouses and Dependants of EU nationals who receive a residence permit under EU Directive 38/04;</p><p>- Programme Refugees, as defined by section 24 of the Refugee Act, 1996;</p><p>- Persons subject to arrangements for victims of human trafficking.</p><p>The above categories of non-nationals exempted from the fee payment are almost 20% of the total numbers registering. Last year alone, this amounted to 21, 443 persons and &euro;3.2 million in fees waived.</p></reply>

The increase in the figures in 2011 and in 2012 to date is mainly due to the impact of the Zambrano judgement which was delivered by the European Court of Justice on 8th   March, 2011.  </p><p>  With regard to the numbers evading deportation, it is difficult to produce precise figures.  Persons against whom a deportation order has issued may for short periods fail to report to their local immigration office but many subsequently do so.  In addition, I am informed that a significant number of persons who are the subject of a Deportation Order will have left the jurisdiction.  </p><p>  The processing of cases at the repatriation stage is a complex one with obligations to adhere to both domestic and international law and to make decisions in accordance with the UN Convention on Human Rights.   The process can be a lengthy one often punctuated with judicial reviews taken by the applicants at various stages including at deportation stage.  Accordingly, not all cases fit neatly into particular categories.  For example, in the case of families, one member of the family may have lodged a judicial review which in turn may mean that the remainder of the family may not be processed until its outcome is determined.  In addition, some applicants may also be party to an application under EU Treaty Rights or through marriage to an Irish citizen or may have been granted leave to remain as a result of these applications.  Therefore, it is not possible to provide figures in respect of the remainder of the case load without engaging in a very detailed exercise which could not be justified as it would divert resources from case processing.  </p><p>  Finally, I might add that I recently approved an initiative to put in place a panel with legal expertise who will assist INIS in processing a cohort of repatriation cases thus speeding up the overall process and reducing the time spent by persons in the direct provision system. </p></reply>

A denominational primary or post-primary school may, under this provision, admit pupils of one religious denomination in preference to others and may refuse to take someone who is not of that denomination if this is essential to protect its religious ethos. Application of this provision is, moreover, subject to review by a court or tribunal, such review being on an objective basis and having regard to the need to reconcile the various constitutional rights involved.  I have no plans at present to amend these provisions of the Equal Status Act.</p></reply>

The current effective strength of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve at 4,500 personnel is less than half that for which the organisational structures were designed.   The Permanent Defence Force (PDF) support framework for the Reserve was, therefore, inefficient and the retention of the numbers of full time PDF personnel assigned to Reserve duties was no longer sustainable within a strength ceiling of 9,500 PDF personnel.</p><p>  A central recommendation from the VFM Steering Committee is for the retention of the Reserve with 4,000 personnel spread countrywide, based in PDF barracks and in 16 other locations.  This requires the consolidation of existing Reserve Units throughout the country into a smaller number of full-strength Units.  I accepted the Steering Committee&rsquo;s recommendations.  I also accepted the consequent proposals for new organisational structures submitted jointly by the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General.  These proposals had due regard to capability requirements and the retention of a broad geographic spread.   </p><p>  A new &ldquo;Single Force&rdquo; concept will see PDF Units having Reserve components, rather than a separate stand-alone Reserve as at present.  Reserve Units within barracks will be supported by their parent PDF Unit and the 16 Units outside of PDF installations will be supported by dedicated full time PDF personnel.  </p><p>  The fact that Clonmel was not selected is not a negative reflection on the quality or participation of the Reserve Unit in Clonmel, but reflects that it is not possible to retain all current locations.  I sincerely hope that members of the Reserve in Clonmel will continue to serve in an alternative Reserve Unit in another location and re-training will be available in that regard.</p></reply>

The 2012 National Reserve caters for farmers who commenced farming after 17 May 2010.  Applicants are required to submit a 2012 Single Payment application form detailing all lands which they are currently farming.  In addition, applicants are required to meet certain criteria with regard to income limits and educational qualifications. Off-farm income cannot exceed &euro;30,000 and total income, including farm income, cannot exceed &euro;40,000. Applicants must have obtained a FETAC Level 6 Advanced Certificate in Agriculture or its equivalent. The green certificate in farming is regarded as equivalent for this purpose.</p><p>  The person named was deemed ineligible as he does not hold the necessary farming qualification. The National Reserve is a scarce resource and applicants must therefore fulfil all of the eligibility criteria before an allocation can be made.</p><p>  Funds in the National Reserve are very limited and the Reserve is only replenished by the value of entitlements that remain unused. Where the value of unused entitlements at the end of 2012 is insufficient to meet the requirements of all eligible applicants under the 2012 National Reserve, a linear cut will be applied to the allocation of successful applicants. It is important therefore that available funds are directed at young trained farmers. This matter was thoroughly considered by the Single Payment advisory Committee comprising members of the main farming organisations, Teagasc and officials from my Department who recommended that this change be introduced.</p><p>  It is for the reasons stated above that, regrettably, an exception cannot be made in these circumstances.</p></reply>

In this context, one of the options under consideration is a change to the valuation of single reactors (with the exception of pedigree beef or elite dairy animals) such that single reactors would have a value assigned to them based on an extrapolation of the values assigned to similar animals in valuations of breakdowns where there are 2 or more reactors.  The advantage of this approach for farmers who have a single reactor is they will receive their valuation in a more prompt manner which will allow reactors to be moved off the holding earlier and consequently for the next test cycle to commence.  It would also eliminate the requirement for herd keepers to meet a valuer on a separate date to value their reactor.  This proposal would reduce the cost to my Department of valuing reactors by approximately &euro;230,000 per annum.  My Department is involved in a consultation process with the farming organisations on this and other proposals designed to reduce the cost of administering the TB eradication scheme and at the same time reduce the administrative burden on farmers.  I will make a decision on implementation of these proposals shortly following the conclusion of the consultation process.</p></reply>

The July 2012 figure has since been adjusted upwards arising from work which is ongoing on the disaggregation of the Children and Families resource base from the HSE in preparation for the establishment of the new Agency. The increase has arisen as a consequence of some remapping and classification of social work posts into distinct care groups. It is anticipated that the number of social workers assigned to the Child and Family Support Agency will be subject to some further change as the remapping process is refined between now and the establishment of the Agency.</p><p>  The HSE has made considerable progress over recent years in recruiting additional social workers, with 260 social workers recruited under the Ryan Implementation Plan at end 2011 as had been committed to. A further 10 social worker posts which were to be recruited after 2011 are currently at various stages of recruitment, with the first four already in position. The National Director of Children and Family Services, Gordon Jeyes, will continue to apply his discretion to the filling of social work vacancies, taking account of identified need and subject to services being delivered within available resources.</p></reply>

In advance of the establishment of the new Child and Family Support Agency, work is ongoing regarding the disaggregation of the Children and Families resource base from the HSE. Consequently the number of social workers assigned to the Children and Families Service area will be subject to change as the mapping/classification of posts into care groups is further refined between now and year end.</p><p>  The HSE has made considerable progress over recent years in recruiting additional social workers, with 260 social workers recruited under the Ryan Implementation Plan at end 2011 as had been committed to. A further 10 social worker posts which were to be recruited after 2011 are currently at various stages of recruitment, with the first four already in position. The National Director of Children and Family Services, Gordon Jeyes, will continue to apply his discretion to the filling of social work vacancies, taking account of identified need and subject to services being delivered within available resources.</p></reply>

The large scale, government funded, &lsquo;Growing Up in Ireland&rsquo; longitudinal study has shown that one in four, 4 year olds and one in three 9  year olds are overweight or obese.

The Education Welfare Service, and its network of Education Welfare Officers (EWOs), is a key resource for the Board in delivering on this statutory remit.</p><p>  Following a decision by Government in 2009, the Board undertook strategic and operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme in addition to its Education Welfare Service. The Board was tasked with developing a single strategic approach to attendance, participation and retention in the education system to effectively utilise and target the significant resources available across the three service strands.</p><p>In working to deliver this integrated approach to school support services the Board has committed to a practice model based on the principle of &#8220;<i>One Child, One Team, One Plan</i>  &#8221;. I am advised by the Board that this practice model is now in the final stages of development. </p><p>  The model will sit within the wider continuum of practice encompassing universal and preventative work at one end with targeted and intensive intervention at the other. It has been designed to ensure that the approach used by NEWB services is systematic, professional and based upon best practice. Significantly, this proposed referral-based model takes a consistent approach to working with pupils from point of referral to achievement of outcomes across all schools. The development and implementation of this service model will enhance delivery of NEWB services to children, families and schools with a view to improving educational outcomes. This is a significant step towards realising the commitment in the Programme for Government to protect and enhance the educational experience of children and young people. </p><p>The Board has drawn upon contributions and feedback received from schools over the last 12 months in the development process to date. A consultation process around One Child, One Team, One is currently being undertaken by the Board with staff services and relevant stakeholders.  Both the draft practice model and related schools guidance document are publicly available on . </p><p>  The Board envisages that the model will be finalised shortly with implementation to commence in 2013.</p></reply>

The recommendations of the report, where they concern policies related to children and young people, will be taken into account in drafting both the Children and Young People's Policy Framework and the Youth Strategy, both of which are due to be published in 2013.</p><p>  In the last nine years my Department, and previously the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, has worked to ensure the establishment or consolidation of the following key structures:</p><p>  - Comhairle na n&Oacute;g (local youth councils);</p><p>  - D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g (national youth parliament);</p><p>  - the children and young people&#8217;s participation support team and consultations/dialogues with children and young people.</p><p>  In March 2009 the Children and Young People&#8217;s Participation Support Team was created. The Team is made up of the staff in the Citizen Participation Unit of my Department and three regional Children and Young People&#8217;s Participation Officers, from two national youth organisations (For&oacute;ige and Youth Work Ireland). The reports of the independent evaluation of the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g Development Fund (2008-2009) and (2009-2010) highlight the value of the support, information and training provided by the three regional Participation Officers. They note the marked improvement in the operation of many child and youth councils resulting from the involvement of the Participation Officers. They also note the important role played by these officers in creating a strong link between child and youth councils at local level and my Department at national level.</p><p>  In addition to their direct work with organisers of the 34 child and youth councils, the DCYA Participation Officers were involved in the planning and management of a wide range of children&#8217;s participation initiatives including consultations with children and young people on Reform of the Junior Cycle, the National Children and Young People&#8217;s Strategy (2013-2017) and the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in Primary Schools.</p><p>500 teenagers from the 34 Comhairle na n&Oacute;g around the country attended the first-ever Comhairle na n&Oacute;g National Showcase on Friday, 9<sup>th</sup>   November 2012.</p><p>  On the day there were four TOPIC ZONES run by key decision-makers where young people could seek advice and support on how to become more effective improving the lives of young people in relation to mental health, sexual health, youth facilities and engaging with Decision Makers.</p><p>  My Department provides opportunities for children and young people to contribute their views on issues of national and personal importance, and has conducted national consultations/dialogues with children and young people on a range of issues, including:</p><p>- the<i> Taskforce on Active Citizenship </i>  (2006);</p><p>- the age of consent for sexual activity (2006);  </p><p>- the Irish Youth Justice Strategy (2007);</p><p>- the misuse of alcohol among young people (2007) and</p><p>- Teenage Mental Health: What Helps and What Hurts (2008).</p><p>  A Thematic Group on the development of a national policy on children and young people&#8217;s participation in decision-making was established in  2011, comprising representatives of Government Departments, State Agencies, the research community and other key stakeholders. Its work will feed into the National Children and Young People&#8217;s Policy Framework (2013-2017).</p></reply>

From its establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have service responsibility for:</p><p> - Child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.</p><p> - Child and family related services for which the HSE currently has responsibility including pre-school inspections and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health will work jointly on an impact analysis of proposed future arrangements for this service as they relate to children and family services covered by the Child and Family Support Agency and to services provided by the HSE. </p><p> - The Family Support Agency which currently operates as a separate body under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and will be merged into the new Agency.</p><p> - The National Educational Welfare Board which also currently operates as a separate body under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and will be merged into the new Agency.</p><p>The above decisions are in line with the recommendations made in the report of the Task Force on the Establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency which I published in July on this year. The Task Force also recommended that certain other services, including the children and family aspects of public health nursing, should transfer to the new Agency. I believe further work is required on the additional services to be considered for transition to the new agency. I am committed to working with the Minister for Health on the Task Force's proposals in this regard. I share with the view of the Task Force that in order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency must have a broader focus than child protection. The inclusion of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board functions will broaden the base of the organisation and bring on board a range of additional expertise and service infrastructure which highly is relevant to the children and their families at both universal and targeted level. My priority is to get these services well established and integrated as quickly as possible and to continue to examine in parallel, opportunities for further expansion of the Agency's functions once it is up and running.</p></reply>

In preparation for the establishment of the Agency a comprehensive due diligence and disaggregation process is underway to further review and refine the detailed components of this sub-head. In terms of the establishment of the Agency, it is anticipated that while there will be some costs attaching to its establishment but such costs will be kept to a minimum and the Agency will seek to maximise efficiencies across services through economies of scale and the usage of shared services wherever possible. </p><p>  It is my intention that the new Agency will address the persistent issues which have been raised regarding the standardisation of services, communication, coordination and sharing of risk assessment, management and treatment for many of the children and families with the most complex needs. At the same time, the Agency will have a role in supporting families - providing less complex, less intrusive, less expensive responses which have a preventive function.</p><p>  The new Agency and the wider transformation of children's services represents one of the largest, and most ambitious, areas of public sector reform embarked upon by this Government. </p></reply>

Under section 26 of the Child Care Act 1991, the Court may appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> to a child who is the subject of care proceedings, if it is satisfied that it is  necessary in the interests of the child and in the interests of justice to do so. They are always appointed where a child is subject to Special Care proceedings. </p><p>Currently GAL services are provided by Barnardos, a small number of agencies and a number of self employed independent guardia<i>n ad litem. </i>  The  HSE has advised me that the total GAL costs for 2011 amounted to &#8364;4.6 million.</p><p>  The amendment to the Constitution makes explicit reference to the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration when significant decisions in relation to the child are being made. It means that legislation must be enacted to require that the best interests of the child must be the paramount consideration when a Court is making any decision in relation to proceedings taken by the State where it intervenes to protect the safety and welfare of a child and issues of adoption, guardianship, custody of, or access to, a child in proceedings between any persons. In addition, the amendment gives recognition at constitutional level to the rights of the child to have their views heard and given due weight in such Court proceedings. </p><p>  The ascertaining of the views of the child as specified in the Amendment  in other judicial proceedings, will require a review of all the related legislation to ensure it meets the new constitutional standard. The views of a child do not necessarily have to be mediated by a guardian ad litem, although this is appropriate in some cases. it is likely a range of arrangements will be put in place across both child protection, guardianship, adoption, access and custody proceedings to ensure children's  views are heard. The Minister for Justice and I are reviewing the needs in this area.</p></reply>

The necessary legislative and organisational preparations are being prioritised so that the Agency can be established early in 2013. A precise target date for the transfer of staff will be set when consideration of the legislation is advanced.   From its establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have service responsibility for:</p><p> - Child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.</p><p> - Child and family related services for which the HSE currently has responsibility including pre-school inspections and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health will work jointly on an impact analysis of proposed future arrangements for this service as they relate to children and family services covered by the Child and Family Support Agency and to services provided by the HSE. </p><p> - The Family Support Agency which currently operates as a separate body under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and will be merged into the new Agency.</p><p> - The National Educational Welfare Board which also currently operates as a separate body under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and will be merged into the new Agency.</p><p>At this point it is envisaged that approximately 4,500 staff will transfer to the new Agency after its establishment. Staff who are transferring are not being made redundant. In the circumstances the issue of redundancy payments does not arise.</p></reply>

Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.</p><p>  Funding of &euro;56.806m has been provided to my Department to support the provision of youth services in 2012. Some 477 projects and youth services throughout the country receive support under the schemes.  The annual funding allocations for youth projects are determined by my Department and the funding is administered, on behalf of my Department, by a number of grant administering agencies that includes the City of Dublin Youth Services Board (CDYSB) of the CDVEC.</p><p>  My Department is working on the funding allocation for youth services in 2013.  Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department is seeking to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding.</p><p>  No decisions have been made by my Department neither in relation to the 2013 funding for youth services throughout the country, nor in relation to the funding allocations to be provided for individual projects, including Common Ground.  My Department has been advised that the CDYSB, in anticipation of reductions in the funding allocations next year, has been holding a series of meetings with the projects within its area in relation to 2013.  Any proposals or recommendations that a body administering funding on behalf of my Department, such as CDYSB, makes in relation to the distribution of funding in its locality on account of its local knowledge of the needs of young people would require the approval of my Department before they are implemented.  My Department will be making every effort to advise organisations and projects of their 2013 allocations as soon as possible.</p></reply>

However, in this case my Department became aware of the death of Ms Savita Halappanavar on 12th November as a result of a press query.</p><p>  On receipt of this query my officials checked with the HSE and were informed that this incident was escalated directly from the hospital for the attention of the HSE&#8217;s National Incident Management Team (NIMT) on 1<sup>st</sup> November, in accordance with its <b><i>Risk and Incident Escalation Procedure&#8217;</i></b><i></i>which outlines the steps that must be taken by each manager to escalate risks and incidents, as appropriate, that occur within their own service.  This procedure is to be used in circumstances where a national or integrated response is required.</p><p>  In addition, in the case of a maternal death, a number of standard procedures are followed including a risk review of the case and the completion of a maternal death notification form, through Maternal Death Enquiry Ireland.  Ms Halappanavar's death was also notified to the Coroner as is standard practice and will be the subject of a Coroner's Inquest.</p><p>  On 23rd November the Board of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) following a request from the HSE and in accordance with  Section 9(1) of the Health Act 2007, announced that it will investigate the safety, quality and standards of services provided by the HSE at University College Hospital Galway (UCHG) to critically ill patients, including critically ill pregnant women as reflected in the care and treatment provided to Savita Halappanavar.</p><p>  I am most anxious that we can establish all the facts and address any possible safety concerns that may arise as a result of the investigation and that could have implications for women attending our maternity services as expeditiously as possible.  However, while it is vital that the investigation is expedited, it is also vital to ensure the circumstances surrounding Ms Halappanavar's death are investigated thoroughly.</p></reply>

The assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means of the applicant and his/her dependants.</p><p>  In 2005, the GP Visit Card was introduced as a graduated benefit, so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.  Where a person&rsquo;s application for a medical card is unsuccessful, the application is then automatically considered to determine whether the person is entitled to a GP visit card.  The assessment income threshold for GP visit cards was initially 25% higher than for the medical card. In June 2006, the differential was doubled to 50%.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to extend free GP services to the entire population during the course of this Government.</p></reply>

A second registration board, the Radiographers Registration Board, was established on 16th December, 2011 and its register is expected to be established in the near future.  Three further registration boards, the Dietitians Registration Board, the Occupational Therapists Registration Board, and the Speech and Language Therapists Registration Board have been established with effect from 1st November 2012.  It is also proposed to establish the Physiotherapists Registration Board in early 2013.</p><p>  All the registration boards and their registers for the remaining designated professions should be established by 2015.  Under the provisions of the 2005 Act, there is a two-year transitional period from the date on which the register of the members of that profession is established, during which existing practitioners may apply for registration.  The Council which is an independent statutory body is responsible for setting the level of fees.  The current fee structure is as follows: A registration fee of &euro;100 for new graduates, who have obtained recognised professional qualifications within two years of applying for registration; An annual retention fee of &euro;295 for registrants, including those who paid the lower rate on graduation, is payable on the annual renewal date.</p><p>  All health regulators are self funding by way of annual fee income with operational costs being determined by the complexity and breadth of statutory functions specified in its legislation.  The greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged.  Given the enormous registrant base in teaching and nursing, for example, the annual fee charged amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum.  Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the HSCPC is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions, which can add significantly to operating costs.  The twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 in the case of Clinical Biochemists to a high of 3,000 approximately for Medical Scientists and 5,550 for Social Care Workers, only amount to about 20,000 registrants in total across all professions. is is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.</p><p>  The HSCPC is charged with extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act, registration being only one, and the annual fee of &euro;295 being charged is considered the minimum required to enable the Council to operate.  The fee charged by the Council, which is mindful of the requirement to become self funding by end 2015, is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases.  It is calculated approximately on the basis of the overall projected costs of the agency when fully operational divided by the total number of registrants and then further reduced to &euro;295 to take account of the Council's phased establishment.  The State is currently funding the HSCPC in its establishment phase (&euro;1.937 million in 2012) to offset the current shortfall in income from registration fees and will continue to do so on a reducing basis for the next 3 years.</p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fee, the HSCPC has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for controlling registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures: Where an existing practitioner with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, pays the registration fee of &euro;295 and is granted registration during the transitional period, also known as grandparenting, the application fee will cover them for the remainder of the grandparenting period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of grandparenting.  This concession will only apply to existing practitioners availing of the transitional provisions set out in the Act; the Council has requested the HSE to put in place arrangements for the deduction of the registration fee from monthly salary thereby spreading the cost throughout the year; Finally, the Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost effective operating system.  This will require the enactment of primary legislation in due course.</p></reply>

Within that statutory framework, all private health insurers are free to design their own health insurance schemes and to enter into agreements with health service providers.  As Minister for Health I do not have statutory powers to direct the VHI or any insurer as to what specific benefits are payable under any particular contract.  However, the Health Insurance Act 1994 (Minimum Benefit) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 83/1996 as amended by S.I. 333/2005) set out a minimum level of cover which must be provided by insurers.  In addition, the Health Insurance Act 1994 (Open Enrolment) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 81/1996 as amended by S.I. 332/2005) outline the waiting periods which insurers may require customers to serve in different circumstances, including in relation to pre-existing conditions.</p><p>  Cover for medical expenses under a customer's health insurance contract is a private contractual matter between the customer and the insurer.  If the customer is not satisfied with any decision made by an insurer relating to the benefits payable under their contract, they should first discuss it with the insurer concerned.  However, if the customer remains dissatisfied with the insurer's response, they may contact the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The Financial Services Ombudsman is a statutory officer who deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers. is service is provided free of charge to the complainant.  The decision of the Financial Services Ombudsman is binding on all parties unless the decision is appealed to the High Court.  Customers also have rights of access to the courts in disputes with insurers.</p><p>  Insurers provide a 14 day cooling off period where they will cancel a customer's contract and give a full premium refund.  However, I would advise all private health insurance customers to consider carefully the full range of plans and levels of cover available within the market before taking out a contract, so that they can be sure that their own needs are fully met.  It is important to note that once entered into, health insurance contracts are of one year duration.  Even if the customer is paying the premium in instalments over the twelve month contract term, this does not alter the contract in that respect.</p><p>  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) is the independent regulator of the private health insurance market in Ireland.  It provides information to policy holders in relation to rights and health insurance plans and the benefits provided.  The HIA's web-site is www.hia.ie and has a very useful health insurance comparison tool which may assist the public in finding the most suitable and competitive health insurance plan to meet their needs.  The HIA can also be contacted at Lo-Call 1850 929 166.</p></reply>

In line with this policy and as set out in the recently published Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 - 2015, it is proposed that as far as possible mental health care should be treated in a similar way to other acute episodes of care and funded on a &lsquo;Money Follows the Patient&rsquo; basis.  However, international evidence indicates that this is not easy to achieve in mental health services.</p><p>  I would refer the Deputy to Chapter 10 of the Framework document which describes the plans for the reform of all Social and Continuing Care Services including Mental Health.  As part of the move to Hospital Groups/Trusts, specific arrangements will be put in place to accommodate acute in-patient mental health services.  Such services are increasingly being delivered in or on the grounds of general hospitals.  Specialist Mental Health Services are, however, also provided in a variety of other settings including through day hospitals, day centres, respite houses, community and home based treatment teams.  The strategy is that resources must be efficiently managed, targeted at areas of greatest need, and delivered at the point of lowest complexity.</p><p>  It is anticipated within &lsquo;Future Health&rsquo; that all these services will eventually be provided through a strategic commissioning model which will commission or procure packages of services specified by a care needs assessment.  In the mental health sector, services outside the acute in-patient hospital based services will largely continue to be provided by the public sector in whatever structure or framework is found to best suit its needs and it will be the responsibility of the new Director of Mental Health to ensure the development of effective and efficient governance arrangements to give effect to the new policy within the context of the overall health reform programme.</p></reply>

The procedure or treatment must be codeable in the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry System (HIPE) as a daycase; this typically requires that the procedure or treatment take place in a dedicated daycase ward/area. Treatments or tests are performed for many different surgical or medical conditions and the decision on whether the patient should be treated as a daycase is a clinical one. </p></reply>

The 2008 KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin Area report noted &#8216;<i>it is well recognised that for optimal clinical outcome, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services, or in the case of neonatology and fetal medicine tri-located with adult and paediatric services&#8217;</i>. The report noted that Dublin&#8217;s model of stand alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally and recommended that the Dublin maternity hospitals should be co-located with adult acute services and that one of the three new Dublin maternity facilities should be built on the site of the new national paediatric hospital. Maternity and paediatric service co-location has advantages for infants with congenital malformations, for fetal medicine or complications which require neonatal surgery.  Maternity and adult service co-location has advantages for mothers in providing on-campus rapid and ready access to non-obstetric specialist expertise, and to specialist surgery and intensive care in the case of major obstetric emergency.</p><p>  In this context the proposal in 2008 was that the National Maternity Hospital be relocated to St Vincent's, the Coombe to Tallaght and the Rotunda to the Mater, and the maternity hospitals have been working with the relevant adult sites to progress this.</p><p>  There will be early discussions with the maternity hospitals regarding their maternity /adult co-location plans in the context of the recent Government decision to build the new children&#8217;s hospital on the St James&#8217;s campus.  Notwithstanding this, I am committed to the intent of the report - that the Dublin maternity hospitals be located alongside adult acute services - while also bearing in mind the  need to plan for the provision of tri-located paediatric , adult and maternity services, as is the intention in relation to the new children&#8217;s hospital.    Management and delivery of health infrastructure programmes, including financing, is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. However, maternity service capital projects cannot be dealt with in isolation &#8211; they must be considered in the context of the HSE's multi-annual programme.  In prioritising capital projects within its overall capital allocation, the HSE must take into account existing capital commitments and costs to completion over the period.</p><p>  Work on the draft Capital Plan for the next multi-annual period, 2013-2017, is in progress and will be submitted to my Department in due course. My Department will then review the proposals and follow up with the HSE where further details may be required. The draft Capital Plan 2013-2017 will require my approval, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  My concern, with maternity services as with all health issues, is with patient benefit and patient outcomes. There is a real opportunity for the Dublin maternity service providers to further strengthen their relationship with their partner adult hospital at the earliest opportunity to realise clinical and financial benefits and efficiencies well in advance of physical co-location. We must use, within the acute system, our extremely limited health resources for the maximum possible benefit and to deliver safe, modern services.  Any decision on the future delivery of maternity services in Dublin, including the location of those services, will be made in this context.</p></reply>

This has enabled reporting of Outpatient Waiting Lists from January 2012. Subsequently, waiting times have been published on www.hse.ie each month as part of the HSE Performance Reports. The latest HSE Performance Report for September 2012 shows that the total number of patients waiting for a first time outpatient appointment, as of 18th October is 385,462, 71.1% of whom are waiting less than 12 months. </p><p>  Building on the work done by the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has now taken over the collection of outpatient waiting time data. Its methodology replicates the approach taken with the collection of inpatient and day case waiting times. The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format, revealing the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals, allows the SDU and the NTPF, in the first instance, to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.   Over the course of 2013-2015 the HSE together with the SDU and the HSE Clinical Programmes intends to radically reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. Key elements of this large programme of reform will include on-going validation of waiting lists, the systematic and standardised management of referrals from primary care, a reduction in unacceptably high &lsquo;do not attend&rsquo; rates and appropriate discharging from outpatient services when clinically appropriate to do so. </p><p>  A maximum waiting time target of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013, 26 weeks by 30 November 2014 and 13 weeks by Nov 2015 are the goals for the HSE and the SDU.</p></reply>

My priority is to ensure that the children/adolescents affected are provided with services and supports to meet their health needs.  e HSE and the Department of Education and Skills together provide a comprehensive range of services and supports to those affected.   These supports and services include access to rapid diagnosis, clear treatment pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred. Multi-disciplinary assessments which allow for the appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place are ongoing. e National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected. </p><p>  Both myself and officials from my Department and the Department of Education and Skills has met SOUND on a number of occasions, to outline the services available.  At our most recent meeting, in July 2012,  I reiterated my commitment to bring a Memorandum to Cabinet setting out the full response to the issue.  My Department is considering all possible supports which may need to be put in place for those affected.  Any such supports require my approval and the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  A further meeting with representatives from SOUND will be arranged when the matter has been concluded. </p></reply>

Levels of overweight and obesity have increased in the last 20 years, with a rise from 51% in 1990 to 61 % in 2011.  In men, the increase was 11% -from 59% to 70%.  In women, the increase was also 11% -from 41% to 52%.  In adults aged 65 and over, there has been a decrease in obesity, but an increase in overweight over the last 3 to 4 years and this increase in overweight can be seen particularly in men.  Almost 8 in every 10 adults 65 years and over are overweight or obese, compared to 6 in 10 adults 18-64 years. </p><p>  Recent data for overweight and obesity in the European Union (EU 27) compiled by the International Association for the Study of Obesity ranks Ireland as 1st in Europe for overweight and obesity in males (70%) and 4th for females (52%) </p><p><i>Children </i></p><p>  There has been a two-to-fourfold increase in overweight and obesity in children aged 8&#8211;12 years from 1990 to 2005.  Current figures show that 1 in 4 primary school children are overweight or obese and 1 in 5 teenagers are overweight or obese.  Girls are more likely to be overweight or obese.  The recent Growing Up in Ireland survey found that in children as young as 3 year of age, 1 in 4 are overweight or obese.During 2011, I established a Special Action Group on Obesity comprising key stakeholders and chaired by my own Department.  Its remit is to examine and progress a number of issues to address the complex and multi-factorial problem of obesity. It has long been recognised that alone no single initiative will reverse this growing trend, but a combination of measures should make a difference.  For this reason the Special Action Group is concentrating on a range of measures including actions such as: calorie posting in restaurants, the introduction of a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks, nutritional labelling, marketing of food and drink to children, the supply of healthy food products in vending machines, the detection and treatment of obesity, healthy eating guidelines and the promotion of physical activity.   When necessary the Group will liaise with other Departments and organisations in a cross-sectoral approach to help halt the rise in overweight and obesity  <b>.  </b></p></reply>

As part of these measures, the Government also decided to seek, in the first instance, voluntary waivers of salary of 15%, or by a lesser amount if the application of the full 15% reduction would bring the salary levels of such individuals to below the  proposed pay ceiling of &euro;200,000 for the public service and &euro;250,000 for CEOs of Commercial State Companies.</p><p>  Within the HSE, the then CEO came within the terms of the Government Decision. The HSE made contact with my Department directly on 27 June 2011, to indicate that the CEO would make a voluntary waiver of 15% of his salary. The necessary formal arrangements were put in place to apply the waiver with effect from July 2011.  No cases of non-acquiescence to this waiver arose in the HSE.</p><p>  Apart from the HSE, no CEO/staff members in the non-commercial agencies under the remit of the Department received salaries in excess of &euro;200,000. </p><p>  The Decision did not apply to medical consultants, as a separate process in relation to their salaries and working practices was under consideration.</p><p>  The VHI is the only commercial agency under the aegis of the Department. Accordingly, in July 2011, the Department wrote to the Chair requesting that relevant staff be asked to comply with the request for the voluntary waiver. The VHI response to the Department  in October 2011 indicated that no voluntary waivers of salary would be made by any staff member.      No member of staff of the Department of Health currently receives a salary in excess of &euro;200,000 per annum. However, the annual salary of the former Secretary General of the Department, who retired on April 8th, 2012, was in excess of &euro;200,000 but a voluntary surrender brought his annual salary below the &euro;200,000 figure.          </p></reply>

Day services for adults with disabilities provide a network of support for over 25,000 people who have a wide spectrum of need, ranging from those with severe and profound disabilities who are likely to need long-term specialist service provision to people with lower support needs and greater potential for community participation and inclusion. The demand for services for those who have left school or training continues to grow and this year almost 700 school-leavers and training graduates required new placements. Disability services have been required to cater for demographic pressures such as this from within their existing budgets in 2012, which have been reduced by 3.7% in the current year. The moratorium on staff recruitment has also given rise to challenges in service provision and in addition the physical capacity to provide further services may not be present in all agencies. </p><p>  The training centre in Dooradoyle provides a training programme for young adults over l8 years of age with special needs. Each trainee is funded for a maximum of 4 years and receives a training allowance of &euro;31.80. Individuals with a disability in receipt of this allowance are usually eligible for the Disability Allowance also.  In recent years, on completion of the 4 year programme many of the young adults had no employment option available to them. As a response to this lack of available employment, efforts were made to maintain the young adults within the training environment and continue to pay them the training allowance, although on completion of the training course the payment of the allowance should have ceased. No additional funding was provided for this initiative. The funded 4 year training programme continues to be provided at the centre but the numbers are now at a point where it is not possible to continue to offer a 5 day placement and pay an allowance to the young people who have completed their training due to funding constraints and lack of physical capacity at the training centre. </p><p>  The HSE is currently in discussions with the parents of these young adults on how best to meet their needs. Options being explored include reducing their attendance time from 5 days to 3 days per week and the discontinuance of the training allowance.</p></reply>

The Scheme and its supporting regulatory regime were challenged in the courts by BUPA Ireland.  These challenges were rejected by the European Court of First Instance and by the High Court in Ireland. However, they ultimately succeeded when, in July 2008, the Supreme Court found that the manner in which the Risk Equalisation Scheme was implemented to be <i>ultra vires</i>.</p><p>  While the Supreme Court found the Scheme to be <i>ultra vires, </i>it is important to note that the Supreme Court decision did not strike down the principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover, nor indeed the principle of having a scheme of risk equalisation in place.<b></b>  Following the judgement, there was a need for a prompt response to maintain confidence in the market. It was therefore necessary to introduce measures in order to support community rating and ensure, as far as possible, that market segmentation did not become prevalent due to the introduction of plans aimed at younger, healthier lives. In response the Government introduced a temporary scheme of tax relief/community rating levy in January 2009 which provides a very significant degree of support for the cost of health insurance claims by older people.  </p><p>  The Interim Scheme of Age-Related Tax Credits and Community Rating Levy was introduced initially for the three years from 2009 to 2011 in order to provide direct support to community rating. It achieves this by way of a mechanism which provides for a cost subsidy from the young to the old.  The Scheme was extended for a further year in 2012 under the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 and improved through the use of tax credits on the basis of 5-year age bands. This provides more precise levels of support for community rating than the 10-year bands which had been in place since 2009.</p><p>  The Interim Scheme provides that health insurers receive higher premiums in respect of insuring older people, but that older people (in six age bands ranging from 60-64 yrs to 85 yrs +) receive tax credits equal to the amount of the additional premium so that all people continue to pay the same amount for a given health insurance product. The scheme is designed to be Exchequer neutral and ensures that every customer has the benefit of a community rated health insurance premium. </p><p>  To support the principle of community rating, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place. This is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market. The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012, to provide for this permanent RES, was published on 18 October, 2012<b>. </b> The Second Stage for this Bill has now been completed and<b></b>  Committee Stage is scheduled for later today, 27th November. The main object of the Bill is to ensure that, in the interests of societal and intergenerational solidarity, the burden of costs of health services be shared by insured persons by providing for a cost subsidy between the healthy and the less healthy, including between the young and the old. The key measures in the Bill are</p><p>-  the provision of risk equalisation credits (payable from a new Risk Equalisation Fund (REF) administered by the Health Insurance Authority) in  respect of</p><p>-  the payment of private health insurance premiums by insured persons aged 50 years and over, based on age, gender and type of insurance cover.</p><p>-  each hospital stay involving an overnight stay in a hospital bed in private hospital accommodation</p><p>-  the payments from the REF to be funded by a stamp duty payable by open market insurers in respect of each insured life covered.  The stamp duty will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners and transferred to the REF. There will be four rates of stamp duty, depending on whether the policy provides for advanced cover or non advanced cover and whether the insured life is a child or an adult.</p><p>  The new RES will be operated prospectively by the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), with funds collected via a stamp duty by the Revenue Commissioners. In terms of financial arrangements, the main difference between this and the current Interim Scheme is that risk equalisation payments will be disbursed by the HIA rather than by the Revenue Commissioners. The rates will be set each year by an Act of the Oireachtas. The mechanism for assessing whether over-compensation has occurred will be the same as the mechanism which has operated successfully under the current Interim Scheme since its introduction in 2009.    The new RES will allow for a greater number of risk factors than the existing Interim Scheme, including a measure of health status. One criticism of the Interim Scheme, which has been in place since 2009 and which will finish on 31 December 2012, was that younger people taking out products that provided benefits below the standard level were potentially cross-subsidising standard level benefits taken out by older people. The new RES 2013 will provide for differentiated levels of stamp duty and health credits between higher level (advanced) cover and lower level (non-advanced) cover with a view to addressing this point.   </p><p>  The Government is fully satisfied of the requirement to provide for a permanent Risk Equalisation Scheme. I am confident that the introduction of a permanent Scheme, from 1 January next, along the lines proposed in the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012, will be one that is robust, fully operational and functioning soundly and will further strengthen and maintain stability in the private health insurance market, as we move to develop a new system of universal health insurance.</p></reply>

However, our visitor numbers from Britain continue to be affected by the slow pace of economic recovery and weak consumer confidence in that market, with overall trips from Britain to Ireland falling by around 4% in the first nine months of the year.</p><p>  While British visitors spend less and do not stay as long as other overseas visitors, Britain remains our single most important tourism market. I am determined to restore it to growth.  In this regard, I was pleased to welcome last month's report of the Tourism Recovery Taskforce's (TRT), entitled &ldquo;GB Path to Growth&rdquo;, and I understand that its recommendations for restoring growth in visitors from Britain will be reflected in the 2013 plans of our tourism agencies and businesses.</p><p>  Tourism Ireland has been conducting an extensive promotional programme this year focusing on our main markets, including Britain. Its autumn/winter campaign aims to boost late-season travel to Ireland from around the globe, as well as promoting The Gathering Ireland 2013.  For next year, The Gathering Ireland 2013 will form the central focus of all tourism campaigns, with the TRT recommendations further informing marketing plans and activity in the British market.</p><p>  Growth in visitor numbers from Britain is dependent on improved economic conditions and consumer confidence, as well as the efforts of the tourism industry and agencies.  Using The Gathering as our centrepiece for 2013 and building on the approach set out by the TRT, I know that Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the tourist industry will work to sell Ireland overseas and to strengthen the competitiveness of our product.  I am confident that we can grow tourist numbers, from Britain and further afield, for 2013 and beyond.</p></reply>

Unfortunately PTC is not an isolated example &ndash; there have been other similar failures in other European Member States in the recent past, including in the UK, where students also suffered losses.</p><p>  I understand that a complaint has been made to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in relation to this company and that body is the appropriate body to investigate any potential breaches of company law. </p></reply>

It was, nonetheless, a commercial decision that the airline decided to make as it believed that it could no longer sustain the losses it was incurring on these routes.  The air transport market in the European Union is completely liberalised so airlines are free to decide what routes they will serve based on their own commercial judgements taking account of the demand for services. I understand that the airline is currently concluding a strategic growth plan and has not ruled out returning to Waterford at some point in the future, if the business case can be justified.  I know, also, that Waterford is in discussions with other airlines about new or replacement services.</p><p>  The air transport market to and from Ireland is highly competitive with a very significant number of airlines operating services. It is, of course, open to any Irish or European airline to operate services from Waterford or any other Irish airport.</p><p>  In relation to support for Waterford Airport more generally, there is very significant state support provided to this airport. As the Deputy will be aware it is one of the four regional airports that is in receipt of funding (both current and capital) under the Regional Airports Programme. This is in line with recommendations of the Value for Money Review on the Regional Airports Programme published in 2011, which recommended to reduce the number of airports in this scheme.</p><p>  As part of this, I recently approved &euro;1.2m for Waterford Airport under the Core Airport Management Operational Expenditure Subvention 2012 Scheme. This is the highest level of support provided to any of the four regional airports under this scheme, representing 49.6% of the total funding available under the scheme. </p></reply>

The aim of this Strategy, like all previous, will be to save lives and prevent injuries by reducing the number and severity of collisions on the road.</p><p>  The Strategy will adopt a safe system approach by reinforcing the concept of shared responsibility across organisations, businesses and communities.  Like its predecessors, the Strategy will contain key, definable actions that will seek to achieve the overall aims and close the gap between Ireland and the best performing countries in the EU.  These actions will cover a range of key areas in road safety performance including engineering, enforcement and education.  Education is a vital tool in creating cultural and behavioural changes as it raises awareness across the entire population, young and old.</p><p>  The RSA is currently working with all stakeholders to finalise the Strategy and I hope to be in a position to launch the document early in 2013.</p><p>  In relation to the speed limit review, which I announced earlier this year, a stakeholder group to progress this review has been established by my Department.  This Group includes representatives from the local authorities, the Automobile Association, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority, the National Roads Authority as well as the National Transport Authority.  Much progress has been made and I expect to receive a report from the Group by the end of the year.  I will give careful consideration to implementing any recommendations that emerge from the Report. </p></reply>

An updated business case for the project, taking account of conditions attached to the RO and reflecting the current economic context, has now been completed by the Railway Procurement Agency. The updated business case has also been reviewed by the National Transport Authority.  A further announcement on the project will be made shortly.</p></reply>

Bullying in any form, including cyberbullying, may amount to harassment and may therefore be an offence under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997, as amended. </p><p>  Section 10 provides that any person who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, by any means including by use of the telephone, harasses another by persistently following, watching, pestering, besetting or communicating with him or her, is guilty of an offence.  For the purposes of Section 10, a person harasses another where (a) he or she, by his or her acts intentionally or recklessly, seriously interferes with the other's peace and privacy or causes alarm, distress or harm to the other, and (b) his or her acts are such that a reasonable person would realise that the acts would seriously interfere with the other's peace and privacy or cause alarm, distress or harm to the other. </p><p>  A person convicted of an offence under Section 10 is liable on summary conviction to a class C fine or to imprisonment for up to 12 months or to both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for up to seven years or to both.  As I stated in the House on 7 November, my attention has been drawn to the difficulty which, it seems, is presented by the need to demonstrate persistence in the harassment.  As I said on that occasion, I have asked the Law Reform Commission to examine the issue and I await its conclusions.</p><p>  The offence of threatening to kill or cause serious harm in section 5 of the 1997 Act may also be relevant.  Anyone convicted of an offence under that section is liable on summary conviction to a class C fine or to imprisonment for up to 12 months or to both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or to both.  The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 may be relevant to some instances of cyberbullying.  The Act prohibits incitement to hatred on account of race, religion, nationality or sexual orientation.</p><p>  The Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 facilitates the investigation of cyberbullying offences.  It permits the retention of and access to data for the purposes of the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of serious offences.  A serious offence is an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of five years or more as well as offences listed in schedule 1 to the Act.  The Deputy will note that the offences at Sections 5 and 10 of the 1997 Act meet the criteria and are therefore considered to be serious offences for the purposes of the 2011 Act.</p><p>  On the question of interpreting the law, the practice in this jurisdiction is that the Oireachtas enacts the legislation, the Gardai (or other relevant agency) enforces it and the courts interpret and apply it. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-27a.1765.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112700069#WRU00700"><p>I refer the Deputy to my reply to D&aacute;il Questions Nos. 153, 155, 156 &amp; 157 of the 22 November (below) which deals with the recent increase in fees for the issue of a Certificate of Registration under the Immigration Act, 2004. </p><p>   Section 9 of the Immigration Act, 2004 provides that a register of non-nationals who have permission to be in the State (in general for a period of three months or longer) shall be established and maintained by registration officers.  Registration officers are members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na: in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, it is the officer in charge of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB); outside of that area it is the Superintendent of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na district.  The Act provides that a non-national is required to pay a fee to the registration officer for the issue of a registration certificate.  This fee is set by regulations made by the Minister for Justice and Equality with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is no requirement to consult with other bodies when contemplating a revision of these or other fees.  Moreover, it is difficult to see what useful purpose would be served by such an exercise as it is unlikely that affected parties or their representatives would signal support for such an increase.  The fee was first introduced in 2006 and was then set at &euro;100.  It was increased to &euro;150 in 2008 and remained at that level until the latest increase came into effect on 19 November, 2012.</p><p>  The introduction of the registration fee in May, 2006 resulted from a policy decision that the fee income was required for the ongoing development of immigration services - both in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  Our migrant population have made a valuable contribution to the economic, cultural and social life of Ireland and will continue to do so.  However, I believe that it is not unreasonable to ask those who benefit from the immigration system to make a reasonable contribution to the cost of services and particularly so in a time when we are seeking to reduce public expenditure.  It is common practice throughout Europe to charge a fee for immigration services; in some instances these may be set at a level above the estimated direct administrative cost of the service based on the value of the service.  By comparison with many jurisdictions the current registration fee represents very good value.  </p><p>  I am also very conscious of the need to maintain and develop good service levels to customers.  In this regard, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is undertaking a number of projects with the aim of developing and improving immigration services.  These include the introduction of a new common format EU Residence Permit for non-nationals which will replace the current registration certificate.  It will provide the user with a more secure immigration document including individual biometrics indicators protected by a sophisticated encryption system and showing the holders&rsquo; immigration status in the State.  This high quality, secure document will be easily recognisable for employers and Government agencies. </p><p>  Furthermore, INIS as part of its reform of in-country aspects of immigration services, is developing a range of measures including on line application and appointment systems for certain services.  Such a service is badly needed, but it costs money to implement.  The nature of immigration requirements such as registration necessitates, to a very great extent, the personal attendance of the applicant.  At certain times of the year this can give rise to long queues and significant delays.  A self-selecting online system will help to greatly alleviate these difficulties and the increased registration fee income will be used to meet a portion of the cost involved in this and other developments. </p><p>  Other projects being progressed are proposals for the civilianisation of certain port of entry functions at Dublin Airport.  For this purpose, a trial is underway at Dublin airport to test the feasibility of a new model for delivery of immigration services at ports of entry to the State by using a combination of civilian staff and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I refer the Deputy to my answer to D&aacute;il Question No. 171 of 4 October, 2012 which sets out the latest position in respect of this project. </p><p>  In recognition of the circumstances of certain categories of person, there are specific exemptions from paying the registration fee set out in the regulations; these are the following: </p><p>- UN Convention Refugees;</p><p>- Family members of such refugees who have been admitted to the State in accordance with section  18 of the Refugee Act 1996;</p><p>- Persons who are under 18 years of age at the time of registration;</p><p>- Spouses, civil partners, widows and widowers of Irish citizens;</p><p>- Spouses and Dependants of EU nationals who receive a residence permit under EU Directive 38/04;</p><p>- Programme Refugees, as defined by section 24 of the Refugee Act, 1996;</p><p>- Persons subject to arrangements for victims of human trafficking.</p><p>The above categories of non-nationals exempted from the fee payment are almost 20% of the total numbers registering.  Last year alone, this amounted to 21, 443 persons and &euro;3.2 million in fees waived&quot;. </p></reply>

Accordingly, and very shortly after taking up office, I moved urgently to introduce new legislation, the Criminal Justice Act 2011, which provides vital assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the completion of current and future white collar crime investigations.  The main purpose of the Act is to facilitate the more effective investigation of white collar crime and to reduce associated delays.  In this regard, the Act provides for new procedures to facilitate Garda access to essential information and documentation to assist in the investigation of white collar crime.  </p><p>  I am pursuing other measures in the form of the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill which, when enacted, will clarify and strengthen the law on corruption.  The General Scheme of the Bill is being considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality prior to formal drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government.  The Bill will replace and update existing offences relating to giving or receiving bribes in both the public and private sectors.  It will also introduce new offences in relation to corrupt influence peddling.  The recommendations of the Mahon Tribunal have been taken into account in provisions to be contained in the Bill such as a new offence of making payments knowingly or recklessly to a third party who intends to use them as bribes.</p><p>  I am briefed on an ongoing basis by the Garda Commissioner on the progress of the major white collar crime investigations which are underway and the Commissioner is also aware that any further legislative proposals which he feels would assist in the investigation and detection of white collar crime, or of fraud offences generally, will be positively considered by me.</p></reply>

The results are interesting with the study showing that almost 63% of offenders who were given an alternative sanction by the Courts in 2007 had not re-offended after two years.</p><p>  This study has established reliable recidivism data on offenders under probation supervision and on community service orders and considers variations in recidivism as they relate to the type of original order, gender and age of offenders, category of offence and subsequent offence.  Its findings show that the recidivism or re-offending rate was 37.2% for the particular cohort of offenders who were under probation supervision in the two years after their supervision ended. </p><p>  I believe the value of the work that has been done to produce this report is that it provides a clearer overview of community sanctions outcomes which will better inform the work of the Probation Service in helping to make our communities safer.  I look forward to receiving such evidence-based material on an annual basis.</p></reply>

These undertakings complement those structural reforms in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland aimed at removing restrictions to trade and competition relating to the legal professions and at reducing legal costs.</p><p>  Effect is being given to these structural reform commitments in the form of the Legal Services Bill 2011 which was published, in keeping with the relevant time-line under the Troika Programme, at the end of Quarter 3 of 2011.  The Bill, which remains a priority under the Government Legislation Programme, completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in February and is awaiting Committee Stage.  I have made comprehensive statements on the Bill and its continuing development to the D&aacute;il during Second Stage, at the Annual Conference of the Law Society on 14 of April, and at the conference hosted by my Department on <i>Regulatory Reform for a 21st Century Legal Profession</i>  that took place on 6 July.  The full text of these statements is available on the Department website, www.justice.ie, for ease of reference.  During the Second Stage debate I also recalled to the House the decision taken in May 2011 not to proceed with the appointment of a Legal Services Ombudsman.  This is because the oversight model proposed in the Legal Services Ombudsman Act of 2009 does not meet this Government&#8217;s policy commitment to greater independence in the regulation of the legal professions.  The Legal Services Regulation Bill, therefore, sets out an alternative and more independent supervisory regime. </p><p>  As the Legal Services Regulation Bill approaches Committee Stage it is set to provide for the establishment of a new Legal Services Regulatory Authority that will be independent of the Government, the Law Society and the Bar Council in its appointment and in the discharge of its functions.  The Bill will also establish an independent complaints framework to deal with allegations of professional misconduct to which the public will have direct access - at present such complaints are made through the professional bodies.  There will also be an independent Legal Practitioners&#8217; Disciplinary Tribunal dealing with both solicitors and barristers.  These changes are being augmented by a more modern, consumer friendly and transparent legal costs regime under the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator that will take over the duties of the existing Taxing Master.  The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a set of Legal Costs Principles and the determinations of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, who may also issue legal costs guidelines, will be made public.  The Bill will also open the legal services sector to new business models that will provide new opportunities for legal services providers while also providing greater choice and competition for the benefit of consumers.  </p><p>  I continue to receive submissions in relation to the Bill from various stakeholders and these are being considered in preparation for Committee Stage.  Work on the details of the proposed amendments to the Bill is ongoing at my Department, in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel.  As I have previously stated, the relevant amendments will be made available in advance of Committee Stage, along with the relevant Regulatory Impact Analysis.  It remains my objective, notwithstanding the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments - notably the Personal Insolvency Bill which continues to occupy Members of both Houses - that Committee Stage of the Legal Services Regulation Bill should commence early in the new year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-27a.1802.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112700069#WRU03400"><p>I can assure the Deputy that the Common Travel Area remains in effect and that the continuing existence of the CTA is of immense political, economic and social significance to both Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It is of critical importance that both Ireland and the United Kingdom work closely together to enhance the protection of the CTA.  Indeed, It was very much with this in mind that I agreed a programme of action with the then UK Minister of State for Immigration, Mr. Damien Green MP, as set out in the Joint Statement on the Protection of the CTA.  It was signed by both sides in Dublin on 20 December, 2011.  The Deputy will recall that in the <i>Joint Statement on British Irish relations - the Next Decade</i>, signed by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister on 12 March, 2012 reference is made to the Common Travel Area in the following terms: &#8220;We remain firmly committed to preserving and protecting the Common Travel Area, which allows ease of travel for our people.  We will continue to work together on immigration issues, and to combat potential vulnerabilities from terrorism, illegal immigration and organised crime.&#8221;</p><p>  There is no requirement for citizens of either jurisdiction to carry passports when travelling within the CTA.  However, it is the case that airline carriers in many instances require their passengers to have a passport in their possession before allowing them to board aircraft.  As such, this is not an immigration requirement.  Unlike the operational practices at some UK airports, there is generally no segregation of arriving passengers at Irish ports of entry to the State.  Consequently, Immigration Officers performing immigration control duties at airports in the State do not know where passengers have travelled from when such passengers present at immigration control desks.  It is, therefore, necessary for Immigration Officers to establish where passengers have arrived from, and in order to do this, an Immigration Officer may ask passengers questions with a view to establishing their nationality and port of embarkation.  Once satisfied that a person is a citizen of the Common Travel Area (CTA) and that such person has travelled from the United Kingdom, the Immigration Officer will make no further requirement of that person. </p><p>  In circumstances where a person, who is a national of the jurisdictions that form the Common Travel Area, and who has travelled from within the CTA and is not in possession of a passport, an Immigration Officer, in compliance with their duties under immigration legislation, is duty-bound to ask questions designed to establish that the person is a national of the jurisdictions that form the CTA and has travelled from within the CTA and as such is entitled to benefit from its immigration arrangements.</p><p>  For the sake of completeness, I should add that border entry practices in the UK for CTA arrivals vary considerably from place to place.  For example, in some UK regional airports, police officers on occasion seek identity documents for passengers from this jurisdiction.  In other cases, evidence of having boarded an aircraft in Ireland is sought.</p><p>  In recent years, personnel at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and in the UK immigration authorities have detected abuses within the Common Travel Area.  Movements of illegal persons, suspected human trafficking, illegal immigration and substantial levels of social welfare fraud are among the consequences of such abuse.  The co-operation of all passengers arriving in the State, including Irish and UK citizens who have travelled from the UK, greatly enhances the ability of Immigration personnel, both here and in the UK, to prevent and detect illegal immigration and associated criminality.   </p><p>  It should be noted that in fulfilling their duties at the frontiers of the State, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilise a range of legislative provisions.  In particular, such officers will, where necessary, enforce the provisions at section 33 of Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1988, which states, an authorised officer, in the interest of the proper operation or the security or safety of an aerodrome, or the security or safety of persons, aircraft or other property thereon, may require any person on an aerodrome to-:</p><p>(i) give his name and address and to produce other evidence of his / her identity;</p><p>(ii) state the purpose of his being on the aerodrome;</p><p>(iii) account for any baggage or other property which may be in his possession. </p></reply>

It also includes provisions for the development of enhanced cooperation in relation to law enforcement matters and judicial cooperation.  </p><p>  There are currently 25 fully participating States comprising all EU Member States with the exception of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria and three non-EU States: Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.  Border posts have been removed between Schengen area States and a common Schengen visa allows tourist or visitor access to the area.</p><p>  The Schengen agreement was incorporated into the framework of the European Union under the Treaty of Amsterdam.  The relevant Protocol recognised the fact that Ireland and the United Kingdom are not parties to the Schengen agreement and made provision to allow those Member States to accept some or all of its provisions at any time.</p><p>  Ireland has successfully applied to take part in certain elements of the Schengen agreement.  The activities which Ireland has applied to participate include police cooperation, mutual assistance in criminal matters, extradition and drugs co-operation.  Ireland also applied to participate in related aspects of the Schengen Information System -  a European search database which assists Member State authorities in carrying out border checks and police and customs checks.</p><p>  Ireland's application to participate in these specified articles of the agreement was approved by Council Decision in 2002.  In accordance with this Council Decision, these provisions will come into effect only after a range of technical and legislative measures have been put in place and successfully evaluated by the Council.  The measures which will enable Ireland to meet its Schengen requirements are currently being progressed.</p><p>  Ireland has not, however, applied to participate in the Schengen arrangements to the extent that they deal with the abolition of border checks.  This decision has been taken to maintain the common travel area (CTA) with the United Kingdom which remains a priority for Ireland.  The reality is that the common travel area could not continue to operate if Ireland were to remove border checks with Schengen States generally while the United Kingdom did not do so.  To do so would result in a situation where the land border with Northern Ireland would become the border between the Schengen area and the United Kingdom.  In such circumstances, land border controls would appear inevitable and this is obviously something that no Irish Government would seriously contemplate bringing about.   </p><p>  The Government's focus instead is on doing what it can to maximise the potential of the Common Travel Area as evidenced by the CTA visa waiver programme already introduced and ongoing talks with our UK colleagues on the possibility of a common CTA visa.</p></reply>

Any person issued with a registration certificate from that date will be required to pay the new fee of &euro;300 unless they come within those categories exempted from the charge. </p><p>  In respect of persons who may have been seeking to obtain a re-entry visa, I should point out that the fees for same have not changed.</p><p>  It is an unavoidable consequence, and unrelated to resources, that people seeking to register will fall on the either side of the fee increase introduction.  It is understandable that many people would have sought to avail of the lower rate in advance of the fee increase resulting in numbers at the public office Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), rising to exceptional levels at certain times.  However, I reject the contention that there is insufficient staff in the GNIB public office.  Indeed, there are extended opening hours in operation in the office from Monday to Thursday (8:00 AM to 10:00 PM); on Friday the hours are 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM.  Furthermore, as happens every year, special arrangements are put in place in September and October to facilitate the registration of students in major public and private colleges (who form the bulk of registrations in those months) as they begin or return to their studies.  Periods of time are set aside in the public office of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 specifically for registration of students which this year extended into November.  I understand that the bulk of students were in a position to complete their registration obligations in advance of the fee increase.</p><p>  In addition, it should be noted that in recognition of the circumstances of certain categories of person, there are specific exemptions from paying the registration fee set out in the regulations; these are the following:</p><p>- UN Convention Refugees;</p><p>- Family members of such refugees who have been admitted to the State in accordance with section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996;</p><p>- Persons who are under 18 years of age at the time of registration;</p><p>- Spouses, civil partners, widows and widowers of Irish citizens;</p><p>- Spouses and Dependants of EU nationals who receive a residence permit under EU Directive 38/04;</p><p>- Programme Refugees, as defined by section 24 of the Refugee Act, 1996;</p><p>- Persons subject to arrangements for victims of human trafficking.</p><p>The above categories of non-nationals exempted from the fee payment are almost 20% of the total numbers registering. Last year alone, this amounted to 21, 443 persons and &euro;3.2 million in fees waived.</p></reply>

During the same period, 757, 1,077, 1034, 1334 and 1,234 deportation orders were signed and a total of 161, 338 343, 280 and 246 persons have been removed from the State together with 529, 539 461, 475 and 387 who have voluntarily returned to their country of origin.  These figures do not include approximately 2,500 persons per annum who have been refused leave to land and are subsequently removed from the State. </p><p>  As outlined in my response to PQ Numbers 962, 968 and 971 of 18th April last, a total of 1,052, 512, 232, 1957 and 951 were granted leave to remain in accordance with the provisions of the immigration acts.  The increase in the figures in 2011 and in 2012 to date is mainly due to the impact of the Zambrano judgement which was delivered by the European Court of Justice on 8th   March, 2011.  </p><p>  With regard to the numbers evading deportation, it is difficult to produce precise figures.  Persons against whom a deportation order has issued may for short periods fail to report to their local immigration office but many subsequently do so.  In addition, I am informed that a significant number of persons who are the subject of a Deportation Order will have left the jurisdiction.  </p><p>  The processing of cases at the repatriation stage is a complex one with obligations to adhere to both domestic and international law and to make decisions in accordance with the UN Convention on Human Rights.   The process can be a lengthy one often punctuated with judicial reviews taken by the applicants at various stages including at deportation stage.  Accordingly, not all cases fit neatly into particular categories.  For example, in the case of families, one member of the family may have lodged a judicial review which in turn may mean that the remainder of the family may not be processed until its outcome is determined.  In addition, some applicants may also be party to an application under EU Treaty Rights or through marriage to an Irish citizen or may have been granted leave to remain as a result of these applications.  Therefore, it is not possible to provide figures in respect of the remainder of the case load without engaging in a very detailed exercise which could not be justified as it would divert resources from case processing.  </p><p>  Finally, I might add that I recently approved an initiative to put in place a panel with legal expertise who will assist INIS in processing a cohort of repatriation cases thus speeding up the overall process and reducing the time spent by persons in the direct provision system. </p></reply>

A denominational primary or post-primary school may, under this provision, admit pupils of one religious denomination in preference to others and may refuse to take someone who is not of that denomination if this is essential to protect its religious ethos. Application of this provision is, moreover, subject to review by a court or tribunal, such review being on an objective basis and having regard to the need to reconcile the various constitutional rights involved.  I have no plans at present to amend these provisions of the Equal Status Act.</p></reply>

The current effective strength of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve at 4,500 personnel is less than half that for which the organisational structures were designed.   The Permanent Defence Force (PDF) support framework for the Reserve was, therefore, inefficient and the retention of the numbers of full time PDF personnel assigned to Reserve duties was no longer sustainable within a strength ceiling of 9,500 PDF personnel.</p><p>  A central recommendation from the VFM Steering Committee is for the retention of the Reserve with 4,000 personnel spread countrywide, based in PDF barracks and in 16 other locations.  This requires the consolidation of existing Reserve Units throughout the country into a smaller number of full-strength Units.  I accepted the Steering Committee&rsquo;s recommendations.  I also accepted the consequent proposals for new organisational structures submitted jointly by the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General.  These proposals had due regard to capability requirements and the retention of a broad geographic spread.   </p><p>  A new &ldquo;Single Force&rdquo; concept will see PDF Units having Reserve components, rather than a separate stand-alone Reserve as at present.  Reserve Units within barracks will be supported by their parent PDF Unit and the 16 Units outside of PDF installations will be supported by dedicated full time PDF personnel.  </p><p>  The fact that Clonmel was not selected is not a negative reflection on the quality or participation of the Reserve Unit in Clonmel, but reflects that it is not possible to retain all current locations.  I sincerely hope that members of the Reserve in Clonmel will continue to serve in an alternative Reserve Unit in another location and re-training will be available in that regard.</p></reply>

The 2012 National Reserve caters for farmers who commenced farming after 17 May 2010.  Applicants are required to submit a 2012 Single Payment application form detailing all lands which they are currently farming.  In addition, applicants are required to meet certain criteria with regard to income limits and educational qualifications. Off-farm income cannot exceed &euro;30,000 and total income, including farm income, cannot exceed &euro;40,000. Applicants must have obtained a FETAC Level 6 Advanced Certificate in Agriculture or its equivalent. The green certificate in farming is regarded as equivalent for this purpose.</p><p>  The person named was deemed ineligible as he does not hold the necessary farming qualification. The National Reserve is a scarce resource and applicants must therefore fulfil all of the eligibility criteria before an allocation can be made.</p><p>  Funds in the National Reserve are very limited and the Reserve is only replenished by the value of entitlements that remain unused. Where the value of unused entitlements at the end of 2012 is insufficient to meet the requirements of all eligible applicants under the 2012 National Reserve, a linear cut will be applied to the allocation of successful applicants. It is important therefore that available funds are directed at young trained farmers. This matter was thoroughly considered by the Single Payment advisory Committee comprising members of the main farming organisations, Teagasc and officials from my Department who recommended that this change be introduced.</p><p>  It is for the reasons stated above that, regrettably, an exception cannot be made in these circumstances.</p></reply>

In this context, one of the options under consideration is a change to the valuation of single reactors (with the exception of pedigree beef or elite dairy animals) such that single reactors would have a value assigned to them based on an extrapolation of the values assigned to similar animals in valuations of breakdowns where there are 2 or more reactors.  The advantage of this approach for farmers who have a single reactor is they will receive their valuation in a more prompt manner which will allow reactors to be moved off the holding earlier and consequently for the next test cycle to commence.  It would also eliminate the requirement for herd keepers to meet a valuer on a separate date to value their reactor.  This proposal would reduce the cost to my Department of valuing reactors by approximately &euro;230,000 per annum.  My Department is involved in a consultation process with the farming organisations on this and other proposals designed to reduce the cost of administering the TB eradication scheme and at the same time reduce the administrative burden on farmers.  I will make a decision on implementation of these proposals shortly following the conclusion of the consultation process.</p></reply>

Payment has already issued in respect of the latter.  However, as regards the Single Payment Scheme, entitlements were established for farmers who were farming and in receipt of direct payments under the Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid Schemes during the reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002 and who continued to farm in 2005.  Since the person named did not receive such payments during these reference years, no Single Payment Scheme entitlements were established and therefore no payment is due.  My Department will contact the person concerned directly to explain the position fully.</p></reply>

The Education Welfare Service, and its network of Education Welfare Officers (EWOs), is a key resource for the Board in delivering on this statutory remit.</p><p>  Following a decision by Government in 2009, the Board undertook strategic and operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme in addition to its Education Welfare Service. The Board was tasked with developing a single strategic approach to attendance, participation and retention in the education system to effectively utilise and target the significant resources available across the three service strands.</p><p>In working to deliver this integrated approach to school support services the Board has committed to a practice model based on the principle of &#8220;<i>One Child, One Team, One Plan</i>  &#8221;. I am advised by the Board that this practice model is now in the final stages of development. </p><p>  The model will sit within the wider continuum of practice encompassing universal and preventative work at one end with targeted and intensive intervention at the other. It has been designed to ensure that the approach used by NEWB services is systematic, professional and based upon best practice. Significantly, this proposed referral-based model takes a consistent approach to working with pupils from point of referral to achievement of outcomes across all schools. The development and implementation of this service model will enhance delivery of NEWB services to children, families and schools with a view to improving educational outcomes. This is a significant step towards realising the commitment in the Programme for Government to protect and enhance the educational experience of children and young people. </p><p>The Board has drawn upon contributions and feedback received from schools over the last 12 months in the development process to date. A consultation process around One Child, One Team, One is currently being undertaken by the Board with staff services and relevant stakeholders.  Both the draft practice model and related schools guidance document are publicly available on . </p><p>  The Board envisages that the model will be finalised shortly with implementation to commence in 2013.</p></reply>

The recommendations of the report, where they concern policies related to children and young people, will be taken into account in drafting both the Children and Young People's Policy Framework and the Youth Strategy, both of which are due to be published in 2013.</p><p>  In the last nine years my Department, and previously the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, has worked to ensure the establishment or consolidation of the following key structures:</p><p>  - Comhairle na n&Oacute;g (local youth councils);</p><p>  - D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g (national youth parliament);</p><p>  - the children and young people&#8217;s participation support team and consultations/dialogues with children and young people.</p><p>  In March 2009 the Children and Young People&#8217;s Participation Support Team was created. The Team is made up of the staff in the Citizen Participation Unit of my Department and three regional Children and Young People&#8217;s Participation Officers, from two national youth organisations (For&oacute;ige and Youth Work Ireland). The reports of the independent evaluation of the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g Development Fund (2008-2009) and (2009-2010) highlight the value of the support, information and training provided by the three regional Participation Officers. They note the marked improvement in the operation of many child and youth councils resulting from the involvement of the Participation Officers. They also note the important role played by these officers in creating a strong link between child and youth councils at local level and my Department at national level.</p><p>  In addition to their direct work with organisers of the 34 child and youth councils, the DCYA Participation Officers were involved in the planning and management of a wide range of children&#8217;s participation initiatives including consultations with children and young people on Reform of the Junior Cycle, the National Children and Young People&#8217;s Strategy (2013-2017) and the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in Primary Schools.</p><p>500 teenagers from the 34 Comhairle na n&Oacute;g around the country attended the first-ever Comhairle na n&Oacute;g National Showcase on Friday, 9<sup>th</sup>   November 2012.</p><p>  On the day there were four TOPIC ZONES run by key decision-makers where young people could seek advice and support on how to become more effective improving the lives of young people in relation to mental health, sexual health, youth facilities and engaging with Decision Makers.</p><p>  My Department provides opportunities for children and young people to contribute their views on issues of national and personal importance, and has conducted national consultations/dialogues with children and young people on a range of issues, including:</p><p>- the<i> Taskforce on Active Citizenship </i>  (2006);</p><p>- the age of consent for sexual activity (2006);  </p><p>- the Irish Youth Justice Strategy (2007);</p><p>- the misuse of alcohol among young people (2007) and</p><p>- Teenage Mental Health: What Helps and What Hurts (2008).</p><p>  A Thematic Group on the development of a national policy on children and young people&#8217;s participation in decision-making was established in  2011, comprising representatives of Government Departments, State Agencies, the research community and other key stakeholders.

From its establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have service responsibility for:</p><p> - Child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.</p><p> - Child and family related services for which the HSE currently has responsibility including pre-school inspections and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health will work jointly on an impact analysis of proposed future arrangements for this service as they relate to children and family services covered by the Child and Family Support Agency and to services provided by the HSE. </p><p> - The Family Support Agency which currently operates as a separate body under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and will be merged into the new Agency.</p><p> - The National Educational Welfare Board which also currently operates as a separate body under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and will be merged into the new Agency.</p><p>The above decisions are in line with the recommendations made in the report of the Task Force on the Establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency which I published in July on this year. The Task Force also recommended that certain other services, including the children and family aspects of public health nursing, should transfer to the new Agency. I believe further work is required on the additional services to be considered for transition to the new agency. I am committed to working with the Minister for Health on the Task Force's proposals in this regard. I share with the view of the Task Force that in order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency must have a broader focus than child protection. The inclusion of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board functions will broaden the base of the organisation and bring on board a range of additional expertise and service infrastructure which highly is relevant to the children and their families at both universal and targeted level. My priority is to get these services well established and integrated as quickly as possible and to continue to examine in parallel, opportunities for further expansion of the Agency's functions once it is up and running.</p></reply>

Under section 26 of the Child Care Act 1991, the Court may appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> to a child who is the subject of care proceedings, if it is satisfied that it is  necessary in the interests of the child and in the interests of justice to do so. They are always appointed where a child is subject to Special Care proceedings. </p><p>Currently GAL services are provided by Barnardos, a small number of agencies and a number of self employed independent guardia<i>n ad litem. </i>  The  HSE has advised me that the total GAL costs for 2011 amounted to &#8364;4.6 million.</p><p>  The amendment to the Constitution makes explicit reference to the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration when significant decisions in relation to the child are being made. It means that legislation must be enacted to require that the best interests of the child must be the paramount consideration when a Court is making any decision in relation to proceedings taken by the State where it intervenes to protect the safety and welfare of a child and issues of adoption, guardianship, custody of, or access to, a child in proceedings between any persons. In addition, the amendment gives recognition at constitutional level to the rights of the child to have their views heard and given due weight in such Court proceedings. </p><p>  The ascertaining of the views of the child as specified in the Amendment  in other judicial proceedings, will require a review of all the related legislation to ensure it meets the new constitutional standard. The views of a child do not necessarily have to be mediated by a guardian ad litem, although this is appropriate in some cases. it is likely a range of arrangements will be put in place across both child protection, guardianship, adoption, access and custody proceedings to ensure children's  views are heard. The Minister for Justice and I are reviewing the needs in this area.</p></reply>

The necessary legislative and organisational preparations are being prioritised so that the Agency can be established early in 2013. A precise target date for the transfer of staff will be set when consideration of the legislation is advanced.   From its establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have service responsibility for:</p><p> - Child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.</p><p> - Child and family related services for which the HSE currently has responsibility including pre-school inspections and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health will work jointly on an impact analysis of proposed future arrangements for this service as they relate to children and family services covered by the Child and Family Support Agency and to services provided by the HSE. </p><p> - The Family Support Agency which currently operates as a separate body under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and will be merged into the new Agency.</p><p> - The National Educational Welfare Board which also currently operates as a separate body under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and will be merged into the new Agency.</p><p>At this point it is envisaged that approximately 4,500 staff will transfer to the new Agency after its establishment. Staff who are transferring are not being made redundant. In the circumstances the issue of redundancy payments does not arise.</p></reply>

Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.</p><p>  Funding of &euro;56.806m has been provided to my Department to support the provision of youth services in 2012. Some 477 projects and youth services throughout the country receive support under the schemes.

Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department is seeking to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding.</p><p>  No decisions have been made by my Department neither in relation to the 2013 funding for youth services throughout the country, nor in relation to the funding allocations to be provided for individual projects, including Common Ground.  My Department has been advised that the CDYSB, in anticipation of reductions in the funding allocations next year, has been holding a series of meetings with the projects within its area in relation to 2013.  Any proposals or recommendations that a body administering funding on behalf of my Department, such as CDYSB, makes in relation to the distribution of funding in its locality on account of its local knowledge of the needs of young people would require the approval of my Department before they are implemented.  My Department will be making every effort to advise organisations and projects of their 2013 allocations as soon as possible.</p></reply>

However, in this case my Department became aware of the death of Ms Savita Halappanavar on 12th November as a result of a press query.</p><p>  On receipt of this query my officials checked with the HSE and were informed that this incident was escalated directly from the hospital for the attention of the HSE&#8217;s National Incident Management Team (NIMT) on 1<sup>st</sup> November, in accordance with its <b><i>Risk and Incident Escalation Procedure&#8217;</i></b><i></i>which outlines the steps that must be taken by each manager to escalate risks and incidents, as appropriate, that occur within their own service.  This procedure is to be used in circumstances where a national or integrated response is required.</p><p>  In addition, in the case of a maternal death, a number of standard procedures are followed including a risk review of the case and the completion of a maternal death notification form, through Maternal Death Enquiry Ireland.  Ms Halappanavar's death was also notified to the Coroner as is standard practice and will be the subject of a Coroner's Inquest.</p><p>  On 23rd November the Board of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) following a request from the HSE and in accordance with  Section 9(1) of the Health Act 2007, announced that it will investigate the safety, quality and standards of services provided by the HSE at University College Hospital Galway (UCHG) to critically ill patients, including critically ill pregnant women as reflected in the care and treatment provided to Savita Halappanavar.</p><p>  I am most anxious that we can establish all the facts and address any possible safety concerns that may arise as a result of the investigation and that could have implications for women attending our maternity services as expeditiously as possible.  However, while it is vital that the investigation is expedited, it is also vital to ensure the circumstances surrounding Ms Halappanavar's death are investigated thoroughly.</p></reply>

The assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means of the applicant and his/her dependants.</p><p>  In 2005, the GP Visit Card was introduced as a graduated benefit, so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.  Where a person&rsquo;s application for a medical card is unsuccessful, the application is then automatically considered to determine whether the person is entitled to a GP visit card.  The assessment income threshold for GP visit cards was initially 25% higher than for the medical card. In June 2006, the differential was doubled to 50%.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to extend free GP services to the entire population during the course of this Government.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-27a.2070.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112700074#WRZ02800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 623, 665 and 678 together.</p><p>  The Health and Social Care Professionals Council (HSCPC) and the 12 registration boards to be established under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 are responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals.  The Council (also known as CORU) was established in March 2007 and is working to put in place the necessary structures for registration, education and fitness to practise for the 12 health and social care professions designated under the Act.</p><p>  The first registration board to be established, the Social Workers Registration Board, was established in August 2010, and the associated Social Workers Register opened for receipt and processing of applications on 31st May, 2011.  A second registration board, the Radiographers Registration Board, was established on 16th December, 2011 and its register is expected to be established in the near future.  Three further registration boards, the Dietitians Registration Board, the Occupational Therapists Registration Board, and the Speech and Language Therapists Registration Board have been established with effect from 1st November 2012.  It is also proposed to establish the Physiotherapists Registration Board in early 2013.</p><p>  All the registration boards and their registers for the remaining designated professions should be established by 2015.  Under the provisions of the 2005 Act, there is a two-year transitional period from the date on which the register of the members of that profession is established, during which existing practitioners may apply for registration.  The Council which is an independent statutory body is responsible for setting the level of fees.  The current fee structure is as follows: A registration fee of &euro;100 for new graduates, who have obtained recognised professional qualifications within two years of applying for registration; An annual retention fee of &euro;295 for registrants, including those who paid the lower rate on graduation, is payable on the annual renewal date.</p><p>  All health regulators are self funding by way of annual fee income with operational costs being determined by the complexity and breadth of statutory functions specified in its legislation.  The greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged.  Given the enormous registrant base in teaching and nursing, for example, the annual fee charged amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum.  Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the HSCPC is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions, which can add significantly to operating costs.  The twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 in the case of Clinical Biochemists to a high of 3,000 approximately for Medical Scientists and 5,550 for Social Care Workers, only amount to about 20,000 registrants in total across all professions. is is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.</p><p>  The HSCPC is charged with extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act, registration being only one, and the annual fee of &euro;295 being charged is considered the minimum required to enable the Council to operate.  The fee charged by the Council, which is mindful of the requirement to become self funding by end 2015, is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases.  It is calculated approximately on the basis of the overall projected costs of the agency when fully operational divided by the total number of registrants and then further reduced to &euro;295 to take account of the Council's phased establishment.  The State is currently funding the HSCPC in its establishment phase (&euro;1.937 million in 2012) to offset the current shortfall in income from registration fees and will continue to do so on a reducing basis for the next 3 years.</p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fee, the HSCPC has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for controlling registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures: Where an existing practitioner with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, pays the registration fee of &euro;295 and is granted registration during the transitional period, also known as grandparenting, the application fee will cover them for the remainder of the grandparenting period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of grandparenting.  This concession will only apply to existing practitioners availing of the transitional provisions set out in the Act; the Council has requested the HSE to put in place arrangements for the deduction of the registration fee from monthly salary thereby spreading the cost throughout the year; Finally, the Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost effective operating system.  This will require the enactment of primary legislation in due course.</p></reply>

Within that statutory framework, all private health insurers are free to design their own health insurance schemes and to enter into agreements with health service providers.  As Minister for Health I do not have statutory powers to direct the VHI or any insurer as to what specific benefits are payable under any particular contract.  However, the Health Insurance Act 1994 (Minimum Benefit) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 83/1996 as amended by S.I. 333/2005) set out a minimum level of cover which must be provided by insurers.  In addition, the Health Insurance Act 1994 (Open Enrolment) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 81/1996 as amended by S.I. 332/2005) outline the waiting periods which insurers may require customers to serve in different circumstances, including in relation to pre-existing conditions.</p><p>  Cover for medical expenses under a customer's health insurance contract is a private contractual matter between the customer and the insurer.  If the customer is not satisfied with any decision made by an insurer relating to the benefits payable under their contract, they should first discuss it with the insurer concerned.  However, if the customer remains dissatisfied with the insurer's response, they may contact the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The Financial Services Ombudsman is a statutory officer who deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers. is service is provided free of charge to the complainant.  The decision of the Financial Services Ombudsman is binding on all parties unless the decision is appealed to the High Court.  Customers also have rights of access to the courts in disputes with insurers.</p><p>  Insurers provide a 14 day cooling off period where they will cancel a customer's contract and give a full premium refund.  However, I would advise all private health insurance customers to consider carefully the full range of plans and levels of cover available within the market before taking out a contract, so that they can be sure that their own needs are fully met.  It is important to note that once entered into, health insurance contracts are of one year duration.  Even if the customer is paying the premium in instalments over the twelve month contract term, this does not alter the contract in that respect.</p><p>  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) is the independent regulator of the private health insurance market in Ireland.  It provides information to policy holders in relation to rights and health insurance plans and the benefits provided.  The HIA's web-site is www.hia.ie and has a very useful health insurance comparison tool which may assist the public in finding the most suitable and competitive health insurance plan to meet their needs.  The HIA can also be contacted at Lo-Call 1850 929 166.</p></reply>

In line with this policy and as set out in the recently published Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 - 2015, it is proposed that as far as possible mental health care should be treated in a similar way to other acute episodes of care and funded on a &lsquo;Money Follows the Patient&rsquo; basis.  However, international evidence indicates that this is not easy to achieve in mental health services.</p><p>  I would refer the Deputy to Chapter 10 of the Framework document which describes the plans for the reform of all Social and Continuing Care Services including Mental Health.  As part of the move to Hospital Groups/Trusts, specific arrangements will be put in place to accommodate acute in-patient mental health services.  Such services are increasingly being delivered in or on the grounds of general hospitals.  Specialist Mental Health Services are, however, also provided in a variety of other settings including through day hospitals, day centres, respite houses, community and home based treatment teams.  The strategy is that resources must be efficiently managed, targeted at areas of greatest need, and delivered at the point of lowest complexity.</p><p>  It is anticipated within &lsquo;Future Health&rsquo; that all these services will eventually be provided through a strategic commissioning model which will commission or procure packages of services specified by a care needs assessment.  In the mental health sector, services outside the acute in-patient hospital based services will largely continue to be provided by the public sector in whatever structure or framework is found to best suit its needs and it will be the responsibility of the new Director of Mental Health to ensure the development of effective and efficient governance arrangements to give effect to the new policy within the context of the overall health reform programme.</p></reply>

The 2008 KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin Area report noted &#8216;<i>it is well recognised that for optimal clinical outcome, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services, or in the case of neonatology and fetal medicine tri-located with adult and paediatric services&#8217;</i>. The report noted that Dublin&#8217;s model of stand alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally and recommended that the Dublin maternity hospitals should be co-located with adult acute services and that one of the three new Dublin maternity facilities should be built on the site of the new national paediatric hospital. Maternity and paediatric service co-location has advantages for infants with congenital malformations, for fetal medicine or complications which require neonatal surgery.  Maternity and adult service co-location has advantages for mothers in providing on-campus rapid and ready access to non-obstetric specialist expertise, and to specialist surgery and intensive care in the case of major obstetric emergency.</p><p>  In this context the proposal in 2008 was that the National Maternity Hospital be relocated to St Vincent's, the Coombe to Tallaght and the Rotunda to the Mater, and the maternity hospitals have been working with the relevant adult sites to progress this.</p><p>  There will be early discussions with the maternity hospitals regarding their maternity /adult co-location plans in the context of the recent Government decision to build the new children&#8217;s hospital on the St James&#8217;s campus.  Notwithstanding this, I am committed to the intent of the report - that the Dublin maternity hospitals be located alongside adult acute services - while also bearing in mind the  need to plan for the provision of tri-located paediatric , adult and maternity services, as is the intention in relation to the new children&#8217;s hospital.    Management and delivery of health infrastructure programmes, including financing, is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. However, maternity service capital projects cannot be dealt with in isolation &#8211; they must be considered in the context of the HSE's multi-annual programme.  In prioritising capital projects within its overall capital allocation, the HSE must take into account existing capital commitments and costs to completion over the period.</p><p>  Work on the draft Capital Plan for the next multi-annual period, 2013-2017, is in progress and will be submitted to my Department in due course. My Department will then review the proposals and follow up with the HSE where further details may be required. The draft Capital Plan 2013-2017 will require my approval, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  My concern, with maternity services as with all health issues, is with patient benefit and patient outcomes. There is a real opportunity for the Dublin maternity service providers to further strengthen their relationship with their partner adult hospital at the earliest opportunity to realise clinical and financial benefits and efficiencies well in advance of physical co-location. We must use, within the acute system, our extremely limited health resources for the maximum possible benefit and to deliver safe, modern services.  Any decision on the future delivery of maternity services in Dublin, including the location of those services, will be made in this context.</p></reply>

This has enabled reporting of Outpatient Waiting Lists from January 2012. Subsequently, waiting times have been published on www.hse.ie each month as part of the HSE Performance Reports. The latest HSE Performance Report for September 2012 shows that the total number of patients waiting for a first time outpatient appointment, as of 18th October is 385,462, 71.1% of whom are waiting less than 12 months. </p><p>  Building on the work done by the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has now taken over the collection of outpatient waiting time data. Its methodology replicates the approach taken with the collection of inpatient and day case waiting times. The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format, revealing the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals, allows the SDU and the NTPF, in the first instance, to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.   Over the course of 2013-2015 the HSE together with the SDU and the HSE Clinical Programmes intends to radically reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. Key elements of this large programme of reform will include on-going validation of waiting lists, the systematic and standardised management of referrals from primary care, a reduction in unacceptably high &lsquo;do not attend&rsquo; rates and appropriate discharging from outpatient services when clinically appropriate to do so. </p><p>  A maximum waiting time target of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013, 26 weeks by 30 November 2014 and 13 weeks by Nov 2015 are the goals for the HSE and the SDU.</p></reply>

However, causation has not been established.  My priority is to ensure that the children/adolescents affected are provided with services and supports to meet their health needs.  e HSE and the Department of Education and Skills together provide a comprehensive range of services and supports to those affected.   These supports and services include access to rapid diagnosis, clear treatment pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred. Multi-disciplinary assessments which allow for the appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place are ongoing. e National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected. </p><p>  Both myself and officials from my Department and the Department of Education and Skills has met SOUND on a number of occasions, to outline the services available.  At our most recent meeting, in July 2012,  I reiterated my commitment to bring a Memorandum to Cabinet setting out the full response to the issue.  My Department is considering all possible supports which may need to be put in place for those affected.  Any such supports require my approval and the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  A further meeting with representatives from SOUND will be arranged when the matter has been concluded. </p></reply>

Levels of overweight and obesity have increased in the last 20 years, with a rise from 51% in 1990 to 61 % in 2011.  In men, the increase was 11% -from 59% to 70%.  In women, the increase was also 11% -from 41% to 52%.  In adults aged 65 and over, there has been a decrease in obesity, but an increase in overweight over the last 3 to 4 years and this increase in overweight can be seen particularly in men.  Almost 8 in every 10 adults 65 years and over are overweight or obese, compared to 6 in 10 adults 18-64 years. </p><p>  Recent data for overweight and obesity in the European Union (EU 27) compiled by the International Association for the Study of Obesity ranks Ireland as 1st in Europe for overweight and obesity in males (70%) and 4th for females (52%) </p><p><i>Children </i></p><p>  There has been a two-to-fourfold increase in overweight and obesity in children aged 8&#8211;12 years from 1990 to 2005.  Current figures show that 1 in 4 primary school children are overweight or obese and 1 in 5 teenagers are overweight or obese.  Girls are more likely to be overweight or obese.  The recent Growing Up in Ireland survey found that in children as young as 3 year of age, 1 in 4 are overweight or obese.During 2011, I established a Special Action Group on Obesity comprising key stakeholders and chaired by my own Department.  Its remit is to examine and progress a number of issues to address the complex and multi-factorial problem of obesity. It has long been recognised that alone no single initiative will reverse this growing trend, but a combination of measures should make a difference.  For this reason the Special Action Group is concentrating on a range of measures including actions such as: calorie posting in restaurants, the introduction of a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks, nutritional labelling, marketing of food and drink to children, the supply of healthy food products in vending machines, the detection and treatment of obesity, healthy eating guidelines and the promotion of physical activity.   When necessary the Group will liaise with other Departments and organisations in a cross-sectoral approach to help halt the rise in overweight and obesity  <b>.  </b></p></reply>

Accordingly, in July 2011, the Department wrote to the Chair requesting that relevant staff be asked to comply with the request for the voluntary waiver. The VHI response to the Department  in October 2011 indicated that no voluntary waivers of salary would be made by any staff member.      No member of staff of the Department of Health currently receives a salary in excess of &euro;200,000 per annum. However, the annual salary of the former Secretary General of the Department, who retired on April 8th, 2012, was in excess of &euro;200,000 but a voluntary surrender brought his annual salary below the &euro;200,000 figure.          </p></reply>

The service fast tracks patients into the system ensuring that men are provided with their diagnosis within an appropriate timeframe.  For the vast majority of men who do not have cancer, that short timeframe reduces the anxiety that any waiting period involves.  Men who are diagnosed have their treatment options discussed and considered by an expert multidisciplinary team who ensure that the patient is given all the options and all the information on the best approach to be taken.</p></reply>

Day services for adults with disabilities provide a network of support for over 25,000 people who have a wide spectrum of need, ranging from those with severe and profound disabilities who are likely to need long-term specialist service provision to people with lower support needs and greater potential for community participation and inclusion. The demand for services for those who have left school or training continues to grow and this year almost 700 school-leavers and training graduates required new placements. Disability services have been required to cater for demographic pressures such as this from within their existing budgets in 2012, which have been reduced by 3.7% in the current year. The moratorium on staff recruitment has also given rise to challenges in service provision and in addition the physical capacity to provide further services may not be present in all agencies. </p><p>  The training centre in Dooradoyle provides a training programme for young adults over l8 years of age with special needs. Each trainee is funded for a maximum of 4 years and receives a training allowance of &euro;31.80. Individuals with a disability in receipt of this allowance are usually eligible for the Disability Allowance also.  In recent years, on completion of the 4 year programme many of the young adults had no employment option available to them. As a response to this lack of available employment, efforts were made to maintain the young adults within the training environment and continue to pay them the training allowance, although on completion of the training course the payment of the allowance should have ceased. No additional funding was provided for this initiative. The funded 4 year training programme continues to be provided at the centre but the numbers are now at a point where it is not possible to continue to offer a 5 day placement and pay an allowance to the young people who have completed their training due to funding constraints and lack of physical capacity at the training centre. </p><p>  The HSE is currently in discussions with the parents of these young adults on how best to meet their needs. Options being explored include reducing their attendance time from 5 days to 3 days per week and the discontinuance of the training allowance.</p></reply>

The Scheme and its supporting regulatory regime were challenged in the courts by BUPA Ireland.  These challenges were rejected by the European Court of First Instance and by the High Court in Ireland. However, they ultimately succeeded when, in July 2008, the Supreme Court found that the manner in which the Risk Equalisation Scheme was implemented to be <i>ultra vires</i>.</p><p>  While the Supreme Court found the Scheme to be <i>ultra vires, </i>it is important to note that the Supreme Court decision did not strike down the principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover, nor indeed the principle of having a scheme of risk equalisation in place.<b></b>  Following the judgement, there was a need for a prompt response to maintain confidence in the market. It was therefore necessary to introduce measures in order to support community rating and ensure, as far as possible, that market segmentation did not become prevalent due to the introduction of plans aimed at younger, healthier lives. In response the Government introduced a temporary scheme of tax relief/community rating levy in January 2009 which provides a very significant degree of support for the cost of health insurance claims by older people.  </p><p>  The Interim Scheme of Age-Related Tax Credits and Community Rating Levy was introduced initially for the three years from 2009 to 2011 in order to provide direct support to community rating. It achieves this by way of a mechanism which provides for a cost subsidy from the young to the old.  The Scheme was extended for a further year in 2012 under the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 and improved through the use of tax credits on the basis of 5-year age bands. This provides more precise levels of support for community rating than the 10-year bands which had been in place since 2009.</p><p>  The Interim Scheme provides that health insurers receive higher premiums in respect of insuring older people, but that older people (in six age bands ranging from 60-64 yrs to 85 yrs +) receive tax credits equal to the amount of the additional premium so that all people continue to pay the same amount for a given health insurance product. The scheme is designed to be Exchequer neutral and ensures that every customer has the benefit of a community rated health insurance premium. </p><p>  To support the principle of community rating, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place. This is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market. The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012, to provide for this permanent RES, was published on 18 October, 2012<b>. </b> The Second Stage for this Bill has now been completed and<b></b>  Committee Stage is scheduled for later today, 27th November. The main object of the Bill is to ensure that, in the interests of societal and intergenerational solidarity, the burden of costs of health services be shared by insured persons by providing for a cost subsidy between the healthy and the less healthy, including between the young and the old. The key measures in the Bill are</p><p>-  the provision of risk equalisation credits (payable from a new Risk Equalisation Fund (REF) administered by the Health Insurance Authority) in  respect of</p><p>-  the payment of private health insurance premiums by insured persons aged 50 years and over, based on age, gender and type of insurance cover.</p><p>-  each hospital stay involving an overnight stay in a hospital bed in private hospital accommodation</p><p>-  the payments from the REF to be funded by a stamp duty payable by open market insurers in respect of each insured life covered.  The stamp duty will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners and transferred to the REF. There will be four rates of stamp duty, depending on whether the policy provides for advanced cover or non advanced cover and whether the insured life is a child or an adult.</p><p>  The new RES will be operated prospectively by the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), with funds collected via a stamp duty by the Revenue Commissioners. In terms of financial arrangements, the main difference between this and the current Interim Scheme is that risk equalisation payments will be disbursed by the HIA rather than by the Revenue Commissioners. The rates will be set each year by an Act of the Oireachtas. The mechanism for assessing whether over-compensation has occurred will be the same as the mechanism which has operated successfully under the current Interim Scheme since its introduction in 2009.    The new RES will allow for a greater number of risk factors than the existing Interim Scheme, including a measure of health status. One criticism of the Interim Scheme, which has been in place since 2009 and which will finish on 31 December 2012, was that younger people taking out products that provided benefits below the standard level were potentially cross-subsidising standard level benefits taken out by older people. The new RES 2013 will provide for differentiated levels of stamp duty and health credits between higher level (advanced) cover and lower level (non-advanced) cover with a view to addressing this point.   </p><p>  The Government is fully satisfied of the requirement to provide for a permanent Risk Equalisation Scheme. I am confident that the introduction of a permanent Scheme, from 1 January next, along the lines proposed in the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012, will be one that is robust, fully operational and functioning soundly and will further strengthen and maintain stability in the private health insurance market, as we move to develop a new system of universal health insurance.</p></reply>

The principal actions are in line with the National Strategy.  The HSE's policy states that a health-focused analysis of violence is crucial, not only because the consequences of such violence require a significant amount of healthcare system resources, but most importantly because the health care system is often the first route through which victims seek to access supports.</p><p>  Services to victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence &ndash; including 20 crisis refuges, 27 domestic violence support services and 16 rape crisis centres received &euro;19.182 Million in 2011.</p><p>  In relation to the specific issue raised by the Deputy, as this is a service issue it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

However, our visitor numbers from Britain continue to be affected by the slow pace of economic recovery and weak consumer confidence in that market, with overall trips from Britain to Ireland falling by around 4% in the first nine months of the year.</p><p>  While British visitors spend less and do not stay as long as other overseas visitors, Britain remains our single most important tourism market. I am determined to restore it to growth.  In this regard, I was pleased to welcome last month's report of the Tourism Recovery Taskforce's (TRT), entitled &ldquo;GB Path to Growth&rdquo;, and I understand that its recommendations for restoring growth in visitors from Britain will be reflected in the 2013 plans of our tourism agencies and businesses.</p><p>  Tourism Ireland has been conducting an extensive promotional programme this year focusing on our main markets, including Britain. Its autumn/winter campaign aims to boost late-season travel to Ireland from around the globe, as well as promoting The Gathering Ireland 2013.  For next year, The Gathering Ireland 2013 will form the central focus of all tourism campaigns, with the TRT recommendations further informing marketing plans and activity in the British market.</p><p>  Growth in visitor numbers from Britain is dependent on improved economic conditions and consumer confidence, as well as the efforts of the tourism industry and agencies.  Using The Gathering as our centrepiece for 2013 and building on the approach set out by the TRT, I know that Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the tourist industry will work to sell Ireland overseas and to strengthen the competitiveness of our product.  I am confident that we can grow tourist numbers, from Britain and further afield, for 2013 and beyond.</p></reply>

It was, nonetheless, a commercial decision that the airline decided to make as it believed that it could no longer sustain the losses it was incurring on these routes.  The air transport market in the European Union is completely liberalised so airlines are free to decide what routes they will serve based on their own commercial judgements taking account of the demand for services. I understand that the airline is currently concluding a strategic growth plan and has not ruled out returning to Waterford at some point in the future, if the business case can be justified.  I know, also, that Waterford is in discussions with other airlines about new or replacement services.</p><p>  The air transport market to and from Ireland is highly competitive with a very significant number of airlines operating services. It is, of course, open to any Irish or European airline to operate services from Waterford or any other Irish airport.</p><p>  In relation to support for Waterford Airport more generally, there is very significant state support provided to this airport. As the Deputy will be aware it is one of the four regional airports that is in receipt of funding (both current and capital) under the Regional Airports Programme. This is in line with recommendations of the Value for Money Review on the Regional Airports Programme published in 2011, which recommended to reduce the number of airports in this scheme.</p><p>  As part of this, I recently approved &euro;1.2m for Waterford Airport under the Core Airport Management Operational Expenditure Subvention 2012 Scheme. This is the highest level of support provided to any of the four regional airports under this scheme, representing 49.6% of the total funding available under the scheme. </p></reply>

The aim of this Strategy, like all previous, will be to save lives and prevent injuries by reducing the number and severity of collisions on the road.</p><p>  The Strategy will adopt a safe system approach by reinforcing the concept of shared responsibility across organisations, businesses and communities.  Like its predecessors, the Strategy will contain key, definable actions that will seek to achieve the overall aims and close the gap between Ireland and the best performing countries in the EU.  These actions will cover a range of key areas in road safety performance including engineering, enforcement and education.  Education is a vital tool in creating cultural and behavioural changes as it raises awareness across the entire population, young and old.</p><p>  The RSA is currently working with all stakeholders to finalise the Strategy and I hope to be in a position to launch the document early in 2013.</p><p>  In relation to the speed limit review, which I announced earlier this year, a stakeholder group to progress this review has been established by my Department.  This Group includes representatives from the local authorities, the Automobile Association, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority, the National Roads Authority as well as the National Transport Authority.  Much progress has been made and I expect to receive a report from the Group by the end of the year.  I will give careful consideration to implementing any recommendations that emerge from the Report. </p></reply>

An updated business case for the project, taking account of conditions attached to the RO and reflecting the current economic context, has now been completed by the Railway Procurement Agency. The updated business case has also been reviewed by the National Transport Authority.  A further announcement on the project will be made shortly.</p></reply>
