    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-26a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014062600041#WRA00500"><p>Following on from the public consultation process over the last year a draft National Aviation Policy for Ireland was published on 21 May 2014 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The consultation process covered all elements of aviation policy and the draft National Aviation Policy takes account of the submissions received. Stakeholders now have an opportunity to provide further input before the policy is formally adopted and published. The closing date for submissions is 31 July.  The new policy will be designed to ensure that the right conditions exist for a flourishing aviation industry into the future. It will facilitate the expansion of the industry, help make it more competitive, tackle barriers to growth and facilitate the development of new air transport links.  I expect to publish the National Aviation Policy later in the year.</p><p>  Cork airport is an important part of Ireland's civil aviation infrastructure and this was highlighted during the consultation process. It is Ireland's second busiest airport after Dublin. The Government has already decided that the future of Cork airport is best safeguarded by it remaining for the present as part of the DAA.  I am conscious of the importance of Cork Airport in the development of the economy of the region as a whole and, in particular, for tourism. DAA has established a Development Council for Cork airport which will provide for strong engagement with, and alignment among, key stakeholders in the Cork region.  It will serve to foster a common understanding, particularly at local level, of issues of concern, potential opportunities for growth and the operating performance of the airport. I hope the Council will be successful in its work, as a vibrant Cork Airport will ultimately benefit both Cork and the wider region.</p></reply>

Since the Government came to office, the total number of international visitors coming to Ireland per annum has increased by more than a million and is likely to exceed 7 million this year.</p><p>  The recently published CSO Tourism &amp;amp; Travel release provides a breakdown of the purpose of visits, as well as expenditure and choice of accommodation for the first quarter.  The number of trips to Ireland in the key target market of holidaymakers rose by 7.5% in the first quarter of 2014, when compared with the same period in 2013. Although spending by overseas visitors remained more or less flat when compared to 2013, this may reflect the fact that Easter fell in the second quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2013. In overall terms overseas revenue has increased from under &euro;3.7 billion in 2011 to over &euro;4.1 billion in 2013 - an increase of over 12 per cent.</p><p>  The buoyancy in the sector is also being reflected in employment numbers. By the end of last year, it was estimated by the CSO that 137,000 people were employed in the accommodation and food service sectors alone. This represented an increase of almost 14% or 17,300 extra jobs since 2012.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimates that total tourism employment is approximately 200,000 and could grow by 6-8,000 this year on current trends. </p><p>  The most recent CSO Quarterly National Household Survey reported that seasonally adjusted employment in the accommodation and food sector increased by 14,000 from the first quarter of 2014 when compared to the equivalent period in 2013.  That is an increase of 11% in the year to Quarter 1 2014.  It is also equal to the highest ever employment figure for the sector in the first quarter, which was recorded in Q1 2007.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-26a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014062600041#WRA01200"><p>It should be noted that the overall Ballyvourney to Ovens scheme has been divided into 2 sections; namely Ballyvourney to Macroom and Macroom to Ovens and that the first section (Ballyvourney to Macroom) is considered the higher priority by the NRA.      </p><p>  The general approach I have taken to future capital projects is to keep under review projects at various stages of planning and design which have been evaluated and appraised in order to have a pipeline of suitable &quot;shovel ready&quot; projects ready to avail of any funding opportunities that may arise. The N22 Ballyvourney - Macroom project which has been approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and where land is being acquired is such a project. This project could be advanced as a PPP in the future. Given the state of the public finances it will only prove possible in the medium term to advance projects such as this through PPPs rather than direct Exchequer funding.</p><p>  Work has started on the preparation of the next capital programme.  As the Deputy will appreciate, I will have to prioritise the maintenance and upkeep of existing infrastructure and the scope for progressing new projects under this programme will very much depend on the level of funding available. However I recognise the benefit of this road to the counties of Cork and Kerry and am keen to see it progressed if possible.</p></reply>

Furthermore, within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual national road projects, such as the N71, is a matter for the NRA in accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act.</p><p>  My Department had no record of a report from Cork County Council on proposals to upgrade the N71 between Bandon and Skibbereen. However following inquiries I understand that while a report on this scheme was first prepared  in October 2008, the report was updated subsequently and the most recent update was in August 2013.  Following the Deputy's query and following contact with both the NRA and Cork County Council, the Department has clarified that the August 2013 report divides the full scheme into 8 sections and prioritises those sections that would bring the most benefits.  The total estimated cost for the improvement works is &euro;74.82m. To date the NRA has not been in a position to progress this proposed project.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2015-2017 and Capital Review 2015-2019 have commenced.  The Current and Capital Reviews will consider new ways of achieving Government objectives in the current tight fiscal climate, including the extent to which funding will be available for the maintenance and development of the road network. I cannot say at this point what the outcome of the Comprehensive Review and of the Capital Review process will be.</p></reply>

The 2,036 applications received under the 2014 Sports Capital Programme are currently being assessed by officials in my Department.  Every application will be assessed by one official and reviewed by another.  Given the number of applications received and the detail contained therein, this process takes a number of months to complete.  I hope to announce allocations in the next number of weeks.</p><p>  Applications are first checked to ensure eligibility.  All eligible applications are initially assessed against five criteria, namely the likelihood of increasing participation and/or improving performance and sharing of facilities, level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area, technical merits of the project, level of own funding available and level of Sports Capital Programme funding received in the past.  These criteria are designed to give higher scores to applications that increase participation, where facilities will be shared, that are from designated disadvantaged areas, that have not received substantial funding in the past and that are ready to be progressed as soon as possible.</p><p>  In deciding the final allocations within each county, Minister Varadkar and I will have regard to a number of additional factors, including: ensuring a geographic spread of projects within each county; ensuring an appropriate spread of projects between rural and urban areas within each county; and ensuring that there is a spread of projects among different sports.</p></reply>

F&aacute;ilte Ireland did not produce the map.</p><p>  The Explore Ireland map is a full Ordnance Survey map of the island of Ireland, tailored for the international visitor, with tourist information on the reverse side, including various suggested car tour itineraries in Ireland.  The segment of the tour from Dublin to Tramore in Co. Waterford does not pass through Waterford City.  I have been recently advised by Tourism Ireland that the next edition of the map will include Waterford City in a new selection of tours.</p><p>  Other publications produced recently by Tourism Ireland feature Waterford, including touring and city focused publications featuring the Viking Triangle and Waterford City generally.  A classic driving tour guide was featured at the World Travel Market in London last November and has been used extensively since then, in particular in the Great Britain market.  Furthermore, I am assured that Tourism Ireland continues to highlight Waterford city and its environs, and the fact that Ireland&rsquo;s oldest city is celebrating 1,100 years in 2014.  Waterford City and its events, history, heritage, gardens, outdoor and other activities, the Viking Triangle, the Copper Coast and many other aspects of the area feature prominently in Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s 2014 marketing communications overseas.  I am advised by Tourism Ireland that last year alone, it generated over &euro;24 million (in advertising equivalent values) in positive publicity for Waterford and the South East in key markets overseas.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-26a.32.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014062600041#WRA02200"><p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in its area, is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993.  Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded from these monies is a matter for each local authority.</p><p>  I am familiar with the R624 Cobh Road project which Deputy Stanton has raised with me on a number of occasions, most recently last Friday when I was at the Irish Open. I appreciate the need to upgrade access to Cobh island. However the position at present is that we do not have the funds to complete a project of this scale. </p><p>  For the Deputy's information, an application was received from Cork County Council in 2010 for 100% funding of the R624 Cobh Road Project. This project involves the construction of a new road and bridge at an estimated cost of close to &euro;60 million under the Strategic Regional and Local Roads Programme. The reduced funding available for regional and local roads has meant that it has been necessary to suspend grant allocations for major new road and  realignment schemes and concentrate resources on the maintenance and rehabilitation of road pavements.

I have urged all parties to the scheme to give the report very careful consideration, use its recommendations as the basis for timely constructive engagement, and achieve a resolution in the best interests of all parties. This represents the last best chance to resolve this long-standing problem and to give the scheme members certainty about their future pension entitlements.</p><p>  Aer Lingus has stated that it is reviewing the recommendations of the report and it will issue a further announcement to shareholders in due course.

Under Ireland's Framework for Emergency Management, MRTs fall under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality and are coordinated and tasked by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. However, my Department does administers a grant scheme to the mountain rescue teams and the Coast Guard also chair the National Coordinating Committee for Mountain and Cave Rescue (NCCMCR).  This creates a level of confusion as to which Department is responsible for funding and supporting MRTs. I have discussed this with my colleague Minister Fitzgerald and we are keen to examine this issue and end the perception of MRTs falling between two stools, so to speak.</p><p>  Separate to this, on foot of Deputy Kyne's suggestion late last year, I undertook to consider the possibility of providing a capital grant to assist mountain rescue services. I asked my officials to examine this. Given the role of MRTs in supporting participation in mountaineering and hill walking, I am now in a position to announce a special once-off sports capital allocation of &euro;200,000 to mountain rescue services. These funds are to be used for the purchase of vehicles and equipment, with the precise details to be arranged between my Department and Mountain Rescue Ireland.</p></reply>

In this regard, the agency engaged with the Irish diaspora worldwide and undertook an increased focus on the promotion of roots tourism. Tourism Ireland estimates that the international marketing of The Gathering Ireland reached 200 million people worldwide through a wide range of media and promotional activity. Publicity was an integral element of the promotional programme; 1,500 international journalists visited during the year and subsequently wrote and broadcast about the Gathering, generating an estimated &euro;75 million in positive publicity worldwide.</p><p>  A designated budget of &euro;12 million was provided for the project by my Department; &euro;5 million in 2012 and a further &euro;7 million in 2013. This was supplemented by a further &euro;1 million provided by F&aacute;ilte Ireland. The &euro;13 million core funding was supplemented by a range of cash and non-cash supports leveraged by The Gathering from key partners. The provision of a substantial range of supports by the Dublin Airport Authority and a &euro;1 million Gathering event fund provided by IPB Insurance Ltd were chief among the partner supports secured. Independent research undertaken on behalf of Failte Ireland indicates that in 2013  between 250,000 and 275,000 overseas visitors to Ireland travelled specifically because of &lsquo;the Gathering&rsquo;. This growth in visitor numbers, directly attributable to the Gathering, was estimated to be worth approximately &euro;170 million in revenue in 2013.</p></reply>

By the end of last year, it was estimated by the CSO that 137,000 people were employed in the accommodation and food service sectors alone. This represented an increase of almost 14% or 17,300 extra jobs since 2012.  The most recent CSO Quarterly National Household Survey reported that seasonally adjusted employment in the sector increased by 14,000 from the first quarter of 2014 when compared to the equivalent period in 2013.  That is an increase of 11% in the year to Quarter 1 2014.  It is also equal to the highest ever employment figure for the sector in the first quarter, which was recorded in Q1 2007. </p><p>  In terms of measures to generate further growth in the sector, an extensive promotional programme is underway this year with a view to continuing to grow visitor numbers to Ireland. The year has got off to a positive start and overall sentiment for travel to Ireland is largely positive.  In view of this work by the tourism agencies, and other measures such as the retention of the 9% VAT rate, the reduction of the air travel tax to zero, the recently announced joint visa initiative between Ireland and the United Kingdom and increased air access to Ireland, I am confident that the prospects for Irish tourism remain positive.</p></reply>

Apart from the land transport programme, capital funding is directed mainly towards Sports and Tourism programmes which are generally co-financed and do not place a requirement on the Department for their ongoing maintenance. Details of key infrastructure programmes and projects currently underway under the land transport and maritime programmes are either set out below or will be provided in due course by the agencies responsible.       </p><p>As the level of Exchequer funding available has diminished since the crisis, so too has our capacity to maintain the existing transport network and this has led to a deterioration in parts of our road network in particular. Recent Government Stimulus Plans have gone some way towards addressing this gap. </p><p>In this regard, work is well advanced within my Department on a Strategic Framework for Investment in Land Transport (SFILT). This will provide a framework for future transport investment by prioritising investment that can enhance economic productivity, while also recognising that meeting the needs of people is a critical aspect of transport infrastructure provision.  A key element is to estimate the level of funding necessary to maintain, manage and renew our existing transport infrastructure so as to keep it in an adequate condition, including any ongoing contractual commitments, and so avoid a backlog of  maintenance and renewal which could result in their degradation over time and ultimately lead to higher costs.</p><p>My Department's submission as part of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and Capital Review post-2015 reflects these issues. The outcome of this process will be a matter for Government in the context of the Estimates for 2015 and beyond.  The SFILT document is nearing completion and I intend to publish it as a consultation document. </p><p>As I mentioned already, I have asked the relevant Agencies under my remit - principally, the National Roads Authority and the National Transport Authority - to provide details on specific roads and public transport projects currently underway.

The 2,036 applications received under the 2014 Sports Capital Programme are currently being assessed by officials in my Department.  Every application will be assessed by one official and reviewed by another.  Given the number of applications received and the detail contained therein, this process takes a number of months to complete.  I hope to announce allocations shortly.</p><p>  Applications are first checked to ensure eligibility.  All eligible applications are initially assessed against five criteria, namely the likelihood of increasing participation and/or improving performance and sharing of facilities, level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area, technical merits of the project, level of own funding available and level of Sports Capital Programme funding received in the past.  These criteria are designed to give higher scores to applications that increase participation, where facilities will be shared, that are from designated disadvantaged areas, that have not received substantial funding in the past and that are ready to be progressed as soon as possible.</p><p>  In deciding the final allocations within each county, Minister Varadkar and I will have regard to a number of additional factors, including: ensuring a geographic spread of projects within each county; ensuring an appropriate spread of projects between rural and urban areas within each county; and ensuring that there is a spread of projects among different sports.</p></reply>

Phase 1 of the Western Rail Corridor (WRC) between Ennis to Athenry opened in March 2010 and final close out payments for this phase  have been included in the current capital plan.  Consideration of  the next phase was deferred.</p><p>  Preparatory work on a new government capital investment plan to 2020 has begun. This will involve a focused review of the medium-term capital envelope to take account of investment priorities for the next 5 years. If additional funds are available there will be many competing transport projects across all modes and from all regions. Only projects for which there is a clear identifiable need, which are affordable, have a robust business case and add value to existing infrastructure, will be prioritised for funding to 2020. </p><p>  In terms of specific initiatives being undertaken by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, that is a matter for the management of that company. I have referred the Deputy's question to them for a direct reply. If you do not receive a response within ten working days, please contact my private office.</p><p>  My officials will monitor available European funding opportunities to see if any present themselves. I am advised that when funding for Phase 1 of the WRC was considered in 2006, by a Government of which the Deputy was a member, there was no application made to the EU for funding.  I understand that this was due to the negative Net Present Value (NPV) of minus &euro;137 million. EU funding is generally only available for projects assessed to have a positive benefit to cost ratio and positive NPV. Irish taxpayers' money has been used more liberally in the past.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that I have publicly commented on the importance  of agreement being reached by trade unions and management on payroll savings. There have already been substantial fare increases and the payroll savings must happen in the context of the very difficult financial challenges that the company faces.</p><p>  The Fourth Railway Package consists of six proposals aimed at removing the remaining barriers to the completion of the Single European Railway Area. The Package comprises three pillars which are referred to as the technical, market opening and governance pillars. The technical pillar of the Package reinforces harmonisation of interoperability and safety arrangements and extends the role of the European Railway Agency. It had been politically agreed within the Council of Ministers and will now be considered by the European Parliament in its second reading. Those measures will not impact significantly on Irish Rail.</p><p>  Negotiations have not yet commenced in the Council of Ministers on the proposals for market opening and governance. The Commission&rsquo;s proposal is to introduce mandatory tendering for public service contracts and the opening of the domestic passenger markets to competition. The Irish rail market is the subject to a single public service contract and there are no unsubsidised rail passenger services. These proposals would potentially have a very significant impact for Irish Rail if agreed in their current form. It is notable however that the European Parliament has proposed a significant amendment in relation to the mandatory tendering proposal. I am of the view that the size of the market places a constraint on the potential benefits that could be achieved through competitive tendering. In this context, I will consider seeking a derogation for Ireland.</p></reply>

The principal concern when looking at the future of bus services in Waterford is to provide a better service to those people who currently use those services, and more importantly, getting those people who don&rsquo;t, to use those bus services.  As at present, the fares, timetables and service standards will be set by the NTA. The tendering of these services will therefore not lead to a downgrading of services to bus users. The purpose of the tendering is to secure a better service for the same cost. It will be good for Waterford, its residents and may yet become an example for other places to follow. It is open to Bus &Eacute;ireann to compete in this tender. </p><p>  In the case of Bus &Eacute;ireann not being successful in the competitive process, staff would be protected under the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 (the &ldquo;Transfer Regulations&rdquo; or &ldquo;TUPE&rdquo;). Minister of State Alan Kelly and I met with the unions representing Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann workers in November to discuss this matter. Arising from that we asked the NTA to put a structured engagement with unions in place and the NTA met with the NBRU and SIPTU unions in January and March this year.</p></reply>

The African Development Bank represents a major source of knowledge and expertise in relation to macroeconomic and sector-specific developments across the African continent.  We recognise that an enhanced relationship with the African Development Bank could help further the objectives of the Africa Strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in achieving development objectives and fostering economic and business linkages.</p><p>  Any decision to join a Multilateral Development Bank, however, would be a long term one, with funding implications.  In exploring the issues involved, it will be important to consider the strategic fit between the Bank's and Ireland&rsquo;s development priorities and economic interests, synergies with our bilateral aid programme, the effectiveness and performance of the Bank, and its contribution to poverty reduction.  This process would involve drawing on existing external reviews and evaluations of the Bank and the development results it is achieving, especially the impact on poverty reduction.</p></reply>

An appointment service has been in operation at the Molesworth Street Passport Office for over a year.  The service allows customers to book via a simple web based system a guaranteed time slot between 9:00 and 17:00, Monday to Friday.  The service removes the necessity for any citizen to queue and provides certainty as to the duration of time customers will wait to be seen at the public counter.  Over 200 people per day avail of this service during our peak times.  A similar service commenced operation in Cork Office earlier this month.  The primary purpose of these public offices is to accommodate those with urgent travel needs.  </p><p>  However the vast majority of applications annually are made by Passport Express through some 1,000 post offices across the country and some 70 post offices in Northern Ireland.  This means that no Irish citizen on the island need travel a significant distance to renew a passport.  The attraction and popularity of this service is reflected in the fact that so far this year over 94% of all persons applying for their on the island have used Passport Express.  </p><p>  I am satisfied that the range of service options meets the current demands of passport applicants.  Moreover, given the current financial pressures on the Department's resources, I do not believe there is a value for money basis to justify the opening of any additional regional passport office at this time.</p></reply>

My programme included separate discussions with Cong. Luis Gutierrez, Cong. Paul Ryan, Senator Pat Leahy, members of the Congressional Friends of Ireland Group, House Judiciary Committee Member Cong. Mark Amodei, Cong. Mario Diaz-Balart, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Cong. Xavier Becerra and White House Domestic Policy Council Director Ms. Cecilia Munoz.  I also held a working dinner with Irish-American community leaders, including from the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform, Irish Apostolate USA and the Ancient Order of Hibernians, with whom the Government has worked closely on our shared U.S. immigration reform agenda.   </p><p>  Each of my meetings proved very useful, offering different insights and analyses into the prospects for when further progress might be achieved towards legislation that would provide relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and also a facility for additional future legal migration between Ireland and the U.S.  There was widespread consensus that an already complex political landscape had become even more complicated by the electoral defeat earlier in the month of the Republican House Majority Leader. The general sense which I received from interlocutors was that further time would be needed to assess the full implications of this for ongoing immigration reform efforts, particularly from the perspective of the upcoming Congressional mid-term elections. I was encouraged to note that proponents of immigration reform in Congress appear determined to persist with these efforts and they hope that further progress may yet prove possible this year.</p><p>  As my visit took place, Mr. Kevin McCarthy was elected as the new Republican House Majority Leader. Through our Embassy in Washington and also directly, the Government looks forward to working further with Mr. McCarthy, House Speaker John Boehner and other key Congressional figures on both sides of the political aisle, and with the U.S. Administration, with a view  to advancing Ireland&rsquo;s immigration reform-related objectives.</p></reply>

The agenda was a very busy one with discussions dominated in the main by the latest events in Ukraine and developments in the EU's Southern Neighbourhood, notably Iraq and Libya; a number of other items were addressed at the end of the Council meeting.  The first substantive item for discussion was <b>Ukraine</b>and Ministers were joined for part of this session by the recently-appointed Ukrainian Foreign Minister, Pavlo Klimkin which was most welcome.</p><p>It is evident that there have been several positive developments in recent weeks &ndash; not least the Presidential elections and, the peace plan presented by President Poroshenko.  However, as I stated after the Council meeting, the situation in Eastern Ukraine remains volatile and we must continue to support efforts towards de-escalation and stability in Ukraine.  The signature of the Association Agreement with Ukraine scheduled to take place on 27 June is an important symbol of the EU's commitment and support, and will provide further impetus to political and economic reform efforts.  Importantly, the Council Conclusions agreed at FAC on Monday also re-affirmed the EU's support for the work of the OSCE's Special Monitoring Mission and agreed to establish a CSDP mission to assist Ukraine in the field of civilian security sector reform, including police and the rule of law.  I welcome these positive developments.</p><p>Turning then to the Middle East region, attention was understandably focussed on the grave situation in <b>Iraq</b>&ndash; with some discussion on Syria &ndash; arising from the offensive launched earlier this month by ISIS (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria/al-Sham) which has resulted in the capture of Mosul and several other major cities in northern Iraq.  The situation on the ground in Iraq is clearly very worrying and I share the concern of our EU partners.  The FAC strongly condemned the activities by terrorist groups and attacks on civilian targets in particular.</p><p>Through the Council Conclusions agreed on Monday, the EU has sent a very strong message to the Iraqi government that the emphasis going forward must be on an inclusive political approach which allows for a genuine role for the large Sunni minority.  UN Special Representative for Iraq Nikolay Mladenov &ndash; a former Foreign Minister of Bulgaria &ndash; joined the Council for these discussions and made a valuable contribution towards our understanding of the situation.  As the Deputy will be aware, there is now a considerable humanitarian crisis unfolding. I was glad therefore to confirm last week that Ireland would be distributing &euro;200,000 of emergency assistance in the region &ndash; through GOAL &ndash; in the period ahead. </p><p>On <b>Libya</b>, Ministers had a very useful exchange of views, where there was wholesale agreement that the focus needs to be on supporting the political process in order to avoid seeing the country descending into further instability.  Comprehensive Conclusions were adopted.  It is my sincere hope that the forthcoming elections will represent a turning point and provide an opportunity for a real national dialogue to begin about Libya's future.</p><p>Minsters discussed the case of <b>3 Al-Jazeera journalists on trial in Egypt</b>whose sentences were strongly condemned by High Representative (HR) Ashton after the meeting; Ireland strongly supports this position.</p><p>The Council adopted Conclusions expressing extreme concern at recent developments in Thailand and called on the military leadership to restore the legitimate democratic process and the Constitution, through credible and inclusive elections, and to free all political detainees and remove censorship.</p><p>The Council also welcomed the holding of the second round of the presidential elections in Afghanistan which represents the first opportunity for a peaceful and constitutionally mandated transfer of power in the country's history.  It called on the new President to reach out to all Afghans and reaffirmed the EU's continuing commitment to support the reform process in Afghanistan, focusing on promoting peace and security, reinforcing democracy, encouraging economic and human development and fostering the rule of law and human rights, including the rights of women and girls.</p></reply>

The situation referred to in Question [27613] could arise where a weekly LPT/HHC deduction from a property owner's DSP payment reduces the remaining amount below the weekly 'de minimis' of &euro;186.  The concept of a DSP 'de minimis' amount is enshrined in Social Welfare legislation and it was considered at the time of the introduction of LPT that it was not appropriate to change the law in this regard. </p><p>Given the rates of DSP payments, it is very important that recipients are aware that the LPT legislation provides for full and partial (50%) deferrals of the tax within certain specified thresholds.  For example, a property owner can claim a full deferral where his/her gross income does not exceed &euro;15,000 if single/ widowed or, &euro;25,000 in the case of a couple.  To qualify for a partial deferral, the property owner's gross income must not exceed &euro;25,000 if single/widowed or, &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple. These income threshold limits can also be adjusted upwards by including 80% of any gross mortgage interest payments.  The interest element of any such deferral or partial deferral is 4% as distinct from the normal 8% charge that applies in respect of compliance activity.</p><p>I am assured that the application process for deferral and partial deferral is a simple matter and can be done through the online system at or by contacting the LPT Helpline at 1890 200 255.  In most circumstances where a deferral or partial deferral is granted, it remains in place for the current valuation period, i.e. for the tax years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.    </p><p>Where deferral or partial deferral is not applicable, property owners who wish to pay their LPT/HHC liabilities on a phased basis over the course of the year have a number of different payment options available to them, including deduction at source from DSP payments.  Where the DSP deduction at source option does not facilitate an even spread of payments over the year due to the &euro;186 threshold, property owners can avail of monthly direct debits through their financial institution or certain credit union accounts.  Alternatively they can make regular weekly or monthly payments to one of the four approved payment service providers, which are An Post, Payzone, PayPoint and Omnivend.  Details in regard to the payment service providers including information on the various transaction fees are available on the Revenue website at . </p><p>Revenue has further advised me that where a property owner already availing of deduction at source from a DSP scheme in respect of LPT/HHC liabilities discovers that it is not possible to meet the full amount before the end of the particular year on foot of the &euro;186 threshold, they should immediately contact the LPT Branch helpline at 1890 200 255 to make additional payment arrangements or to avail of the deferral option. </p><p>Revenue has confirmed to me that almost 14,000 property owners availed of deduction at source from DSP payments to meet their LPT liabilities during 2013.  Shortfalls in payment on foot of the &euro;186 threshold occurred in 1,203 of these cases, of which 200 were for less than &euro;10.  Revenue contacted this tranche of property owners in April 2014 to advise on the various payment alternatives available. </p><p>The number of property owners opting for deduction at source from DSP payments in respect of both 2014 LPT and arrears of HHC has risen to almost 25,000 to date. Similarly to 2013, Revenue has identified and contacted almost 2,000 of these cases which are impacted by the &euro;186 threshold to advise on the various payment alternatives and in most cases the shortfalls are being catered for by applying an additional payment option that suits individual circumstances best.</p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or to the mortgage interest rates charged.  It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.  It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the detailed mortgage position of mortgage holders.</p><p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations.  The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997.</p><p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors, including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding.  However, as part of the Central Bank's work on mortgage arrears, lenders were asked to consider all avenues to help customers in arrears, including interest rate reductions.</p></reply>

While this percentage is lower than the 12.5% headline rate, this can be attributed to the availability of a small number of reliefs such as the R&amp;amp;D tax credit, which was the subject of a comprehensive review last year and which was found to give value for money for the Irish taxpayer.</p><p>The extremely low effective rate figures that are sometimes quoted and attributed to Ireland are based on a flawed premise.  The figures are running together the profits earned by group companies in Ireland and in other jurisdictions and incorrectly suggesting that Irish tax does or should apply to both.  Ireland cannot tax profits that are properly attributable to other jurisdictions.  The ability of some multinationals to lower their world-wide rate of tax using international structures reflects the global context in which Ireland and indeed all countries operate.  The best way to effectively address this issue is for countries to work together at the international level and the appropriate action is being considered in this regard by the OECD as part of their project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and Ireland is participating fully in this process.  Unlike some other countries who have a high headline rate of corporation which is then supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs which reduce the overall rate of tax paid, the approach in Ireland is transparent.  We have a competitive headline rate of corporation tax which is applied to a broad base.</p><p>As to the question of increasing the corporate tax take, I would remind the Deputy of my answer to his question in April this year, where I gave assurances that the need to balance the competitiveness of our corporation tax offering for mobile foreign direct investment while ensuring the maximum benefits to the State is a matter that is considered by my Department and others on an on-going basis.  The importance of maintaining the standard 12.5% rate of corporation tax to Ireland's international competitive position in the current climate must be borne in mind.  Ireland, like other smaller member states, is geographically and historically a peripheral country in Europe.  A competitive corporate tax rate is a tool to address the economic limitations that come with being a peripheral country, as compared to larger core countries.  Ireland's corporation tax rate plays an important role in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland and thereby increasing employment here.  As to how successful we are at getting this balance right, I would highlight to the Deputy that the revenue generated by Corporation Tax in Ireland is broadly in line with the EU average.  In 2013 we collected just over &euro;4.2bn which is 11.3% of overall Exchequer tax revenue and equivalent to 2.6% of Gross Domestic Product ('GDP').</p><p>Any increase in the 12.5% rate could unfortunately result in a behavioural change on the part of taxpayers and potentially have a negative impact on economic growth as a result.  In relation to the &quot;tipping point&quot; referred to by the Deputy, I would draw attention to an OECD multi-country study &quot;Tax Effects on Foreign Direct Investment Recent Evidence &amp;amp; Policy Analysis&quot; , which found that a 1% increase in the corporate tax rate reduces inward investment by 3.7% on average.  On this basis, it would take only a 2.5% increase in the rate (to 15%) to decrease Ireland's inward investment by nearly 10%.  This assumes the average applies across the board but in fact the effect is likely to be more extreme for Ireland.  In another report by the OECD, &quot;Tax Policy Reform and Economic Growth&quot;, corporate taxes were identified as the tax which are most harmful to economic growth prospects.  These are just examples of the types of international reports my Department has identified as relevant when looking at the relationship between tax, foreign direct investment and job creation.</p><p>Further, it is worth saying that the certainty around the rate of Irish corporation tax is one of its biggest strengths, and it would be difficult to justify an increase in the context of Ireland's firmly stated position that we will not change our corporation tax rate.  Even a marginal change in the rate of corporation tax would undermine both our long held stance on this issue and the certainty of business, domestic and international, in our resolve to maintain that position.  As I said at Budget time, the 12.5% is settled policy and the Government remains 100% committed to this rate.</p></reply>

In this regard I am assured that Revenue debt management caseworkers are very conscious of the challenges that exist for some taxpayers in meeting their tax obligations in a timely manner.  For that reason the caseworkers will always seek to work proactively with taxpayers and viable businesses that engage positively to agree mutually satisfactory arrangements to overcome temporary cashflow difficulties in preference to deploying enforcement options. However, where a business or taxpayer fails to meaningfully engage with Revenue, then I am fully supportive of the deployment of the necessary collection and enforcement measures to secure the taxes and duties due to the Exchequer.</p><p>One of the enforcement powers available to Revenue to ensure timely tax collection is Attachment.  This power is covered in legislation under Section 1002 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended.  Section 1002 allows Revenue to either directly remove funds from any account held by a financial institution in the name of a defaulting taxpayer, or, to instruct any third party that owes a debt to the defaulting taxpayer to pay those funds directly to Revenue.  Revenue has confirmed to me that it never deploys its enforcement powers, including Attachment, without giving the taxpayer every opportunity to engage and agree mutually acceptable solutions, including phased payment arrangements. The enforcement process only commences when the caseworker has exhausted all other options to encourage voluntary compliance.  Revenue also has strict guidelines in place, including authorisation at a senior level, to ensure Attachment is only used in appropriate circumstances.  Revenue is always conscious that the use of Attachment Orders can have adverse consequences for taxpayers and the power is normally only deployed where other enforcement options have failed to secure the outstanding debt.  For example, during 2013, Revenue issued Attachment Orders in less than 3,000 cases out of a total of almost 27,000 cases enforced.</p><p>In regard to the specific data requested by the Deputy, the number and value of Attachment Orders issued by Revenue and the amounts collected on foot of those Orders in 2012, 2013 and 2014 (to date) is set out at county level in the table in the attached appendix.  It is not possible for Revenue to provide breakdown at county level on a monthly basis because certain cases could become identifiable thereby breaking confidentiality.  However, Revenue could provide such a breakdown at provincial level if the information would be helpful to the Deputy.</p><p>Finally, I am informed that data is not maintained by Revenue in such a manner that would facilitate provision of a response to the Question relating to the number of companies where Attachment Orders were served on their bank accounts and who subsequently went into Examinership, Receivership, Liquidation or who ceased trading.</p><p><b>Appendix : Annual distribution of attachment orders by county</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>2012

This occurs because those earning &euro;352 per week are exempted entirely from the charge whereas those who earn more than this pay PRSI at 4% on their full earnings. This results in an anomalous situation whereby those earning between &euro;353 and &euro;372 per week have a lower take home pay than someone on &euro;352 per week. While such an effect is never ideal, it is necessary to achieve the desired yield, which in itself contributes to keeping workers on incomes lower than the threshold to remain outside the charge to employee PRSI entirely.</p><p>  The effective tax rate including full PRSI and the USC is estimated to be 4.9% for a single individual earning &euro;18,000 per annum and 10.0% for a single individual earning &euro;19,000 per annum. This differential in the two rates is mainly due to the step effect. However, it must be acknowledged that the level of the effective tax rate is still very low in international terms. A single individual earning the equivalent of &euro;19,000 in the United Kingdom pays an effective tax rate of over 12.5%. According to the recent OECD publication, Taxing Wages 2014, Ireland has the lowest tax burden among OECD EU member states on single earners at the average wage in 2013. Furthermore, Ireland has also has the lowest tax wedge among OECD EU member states (6.8%) for one-earner/two children families at the average wage. The average for OECD countries was 26.4%.</p><p>  The Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare (AGTSW), which includes officials from both my Department and the Department of Social Protection, are considering a range of tax and social welfare issues, with a view to increasing the incentives for individuals to return to work. It is expected that the Group will publish its report later this summer and I anticipate its recommendations will form a useful addition towards informing upcoming budgetary deliberations.</p></reply>

This is within the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) ceiling of 3.0 per cent.  The macro-economic forecasts underpinning the SPU have been endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.</p><p>  On the basis of SPU assumptions, reducing this figure to &euro;1bn would, as a first-round effect, add about 0.6 percentage points to the forecast deficit in 2015. However, a lower quantum of consolidation would likely weigh less on economic activity and see higher revenue growth, which would ameliorate the increase in the deficit to a certain extent. It should be noted that the exact impact on revenue and the deficit is difficult to estimate given the significant number of dependent factors, most significantly, assumptions around the composition of adjustment. </p><p>  Overall, given the number of moving parts and only five months of revenue and expenditure data to hand, it is too early to speculate on what the starting position for the Budget will be.  The next formal forecast will be the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditures which will be published in advance of the Budget and will set out the no-policy-change position for 2015. In general, fiscal policy has to continue the process of necessary fiscal consolidation while, at the same time, supporting economic growth and job creation.  Achieving an optimal balance between these goals is essential for maintaining and bolstering Ireland's hard-won market confidence.</p></reply>

There is a specific provision included in those main features, which states that &quot;The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.&quot; Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it. </p><p>  On 10 June 2014, the euro area Member States reached a preliminary agreement on the European Stability Mechanism's (ESM) direct recapitalisation instrument (DRI). This now requires a decision by mutual agreement of the ESM Board of Governors to create a new ESM instrument in accordance with Article 19 of the ESM treaty and the aim is to have this process completed by November this year.  This would allow the ESM DRI to come into effect once the Single Supervisory Mechanism is in place and operational which is expected to be in November of this year. </p><p>  In relation to retrospective recapitalisation, the preliminary agreement states that the potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement. However, as I indicated last week when I was before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, it is not possible to make a formal application to the ESM for retrospective recapitalisation in advance of the Instrument being in place. Therefore, at this juncture, it is premature to make specific policy suggestions on the implementation of retrospective recapitalisation in advance of the instrument being in place.</p><p>  I remain confident that the commitment made by the Euro-area Heads of State or Government in June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns will be respected.  Finally, as I have indicated in the past, both I and my Government colleagues ensure that Ireland's case for retrospective direct recapitalisation is made at all levels as appropriate.</p></reply>

SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.

The NCSE will shortly advise all schools of their SNA allocations for the coming school year.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.

It does not receive core funding, however, my Department provides grant in lieu of tuition fee funding to the College in respect of three approved undergraduate courses. This funding amounted to some &euro;436,000 for the 2013/14 academic year.  The ALBA programme referred to by the Deputy is a part-time course and is therefore not an approved course for free fees funding.  My Department does not have a role in the placement of students in any third level institution and decisions regarding courses to be run are matters for individual institutions as autonomous bodies.  I welcome the fact that the college has stated that it intends to wind down in a phased basis in order to facilitate as much as possible the completion of current students' studies.</p></reply>

Children who were eligible for school transport prior to the introduction of these changes and who are availing of school transport services, will retain their eligibility for the duration of their primary education cycle provided there is no change in their current circumstances.

A further 12 training centres will transfer to 7 ETBs on 1 July 2014.  Each training centre is moving to the ETB in whose functional area the centre is located.

This means the occupational pension is paid on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the State Pension.</p><p>  In instances when the State Pension is not payable, a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable under the relevant public service pension scheme to bring the pension up to the same amount as would be paid to a public servant whose pension is not integrated.  In such cases, a supplementary pension is only payable where the individual, through no fault of their own, does not qualify for social welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate. In order to avoid any difficulty in the payment of this supplementary pension, it is necessary to claim any available social welfare benefits in order to receive a supplementary pension. This situation is not new and in particular applies to public servants who have a retirement age below 65.  While State Pension provision and entitlements are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, I have no plans to introduce any special arrangements in respect of retiring public servants in this regard.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 76,000 rent supplement recipients, of which over 50,000 have been in payment for more than 18 months.  All prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, particularly in urban areas, are now finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties. </p><p>  In view of the current supply difficulties being experienced in the Dublin region, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive in conjunction with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations have agreed a protocol with the Department so that families at risk of losing existing private rented accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf. It is intended that this arrangement will be reviewed in the third quarter of the year.</p><p>  While there are no plans to extend this arrangement to other local authority areas at this time, officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that the accommodation needs of families are met. Staff in the Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service have discretionary powers to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant, for example, when dealing with applicants who are homeless or who are at risk of losing their tenancy.  Such cases are examined on a case by case basis having regard to the situation presented.</p><p>  A review of the maximum rent limits has commenced within the Department and will feed into the budgetary process. This review will involve a comprehensive analysis of information from a range of sources including rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), the Central Statistics Office rental indices and websites advertising rental properties. The Department will also be seeking the views from a number of stakeholders in this area including the local staff administering the scheme,  the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Private Residential Tenancies Board and non-Government organisations such as Threshold, Focus Ireland, the Simon Community and Society of St Vincent de Paul.</p><p>  Officials in the Department are continuing to engage with those in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in progressing the transfer of customers with long term housing needs on the rent supplement scheme from this Department to the local authorities under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).</p></reply>

The number of OFP recipients stood at 77,209 in May, 2014, and an estimated &euro;863 million is due to be spent on the scheme in 2014.  However, despite significant levels of State spending on the OFP scheme, the results have been poor in terms of tackling poverty and social exclusion rates among one-parent families.  These families continue to experience higher rates of &lsquo;consistent poverty&rsquo; in comparison to the population generally.</p><p>The reforms to the OFP scheme aim to assist lone parents escape poverty and joblessness by providing them with enhanced access to the Department&rsquo;s broad range of activation supports and services.  This will assist lone parents increase their skills set and job-readiness and to facilitate their entry into the workforce and hopefully achieving financial independence.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, contains provisions to reduce, on a phased basis, the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which an OFP recipient&rsquo;s payment ceases to 7 years from 2014 for new entrants and from 2015 for existing recipients.  This reduction yielded savings of &euro;2 million in 2012 and of &euro;3.94 million in 2013, and will yield estimated savings of &euro;8.85 million in 2014 and &euro;26.85 million in 2015.</p><p>The next phase of the OFP reform process will commence on 3 July, 2014, when approximately 5,140 customers are due to exit the OFP scheme.  All affected customers have been invited by the Department to attend information sessions, with a view to briefing them on the broad range of Departmental supports that are available.  Approximately 850 affected OFP customers who are in receipt of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) will have their FIS payment automatically adjusted to take account of the loss of 60% of their OFP from 3 July.  Approximately 186 affected OFP customers who are also in receipt of the half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance will have their carer&rsquo;s allowance claim re-rated to a full-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance on 3 July when their OFP ceases.</p><p>It is expected that approximately 3,600 individuals may apply for the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) payment, with approximately 1,500 of these being eligible for the JA transitional arrangement.  This transitional arrangement exempts former OFP recipients whose youngest child is under 14 years of age from having to satisfy the jobseeker conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking full time employment.  The JA transitional arrangement allows lone parents with children under 14 years of age to balance their caring responsibilities and reduces significantly their requirement for child care. </p><p>Child care policy and the delivery of child care services, is the responsibility for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs estimates that the cost of universal child care provision in Ireland could reach around &euro;1 billion per annum.  In light of the current fiscal environment, this level of funding is not available.  However, as part of a package of measures in Budget 2013, I along with then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs announced an after-school child care initiative between our two Departments.  The purpose of the scheme is to help to offset some of the after-school child care costs that are associated with availing of an employment opportunity in a bid to encourage more individuals to take up employment. The scheme provides 800 subsidised places and is open to both jobseekers and OFP recipients. </p><p>By refocusing some of the scheme&rsquo;s original &euro;14 million budget, both the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and I were able to introduce the community employment (CE) child care programme. This scheme provides approximately 1,800 child care places to CE participants and was implemented in January 2014. </p><p>These two schemes are in addition to the existing supports, which are provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. These supports currently provide subsidised child care to approximately 35,000 children of low income parents. This is a vital support to parents that enables them to avail of employment opportunities, which is clearly the best route out of poverty.</p></reply>

Abolishing the bereavement grant provides an annual saving of &euro;22 million.  This allows the Department to protect other more fundamental social welfare payments such as the State pension.  I have no plans to reinstate the grant.</p><p>  There are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  The widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pension which is a weekly payment, based on contributions or a means test.  The widowed or surviving civil partner grant is a once-off payment of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension and carer&rsquo;s allowance, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  There are guardian's payments where someone is looking after an orphaned child.  If a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease, a special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid.  </p><p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. An application can be made under the ENP scheme for assistance with funeral and burial expenses.  The assistance is toward the costs of the necessary basic requirements for a dignified funeral.  However, there is no automatic entitlement to such an ENP payment. An ENP is a means tested payment payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the individual applicant and that of the deceased person including any savings, property, insurance policies, etc. that would render the applicant or anybody else liable for the burial costs.  The Department official will also consider if a bereavement grant is available from any other source including former employer, credit union or trade union.</p><p>  In 2013 the Department of Social Protection spent some &euro;4.4m on 3,198 funerals and burials. To 23 June 2014, there have been 1,443 payments made in respect of funerals and burials at a cost of some &euro;2.2 million.</p></reply>

Where weekly earnings exceed &euro;352, employees become liable for PRSI and PRSI at 4% is charged on all earnings.  As Minister for Social Protection, I am on the record as indicating that one of my key goals is to reform the system of social protection and to put it on a sounder financial footing for the future.  The abolition of the PRSI-free Allowance provides very substantial and immediate additional revenue for the Fund.  When implemented it was estimated that this measure would yield &euro;265 million in 2013 and &euro;289 million in a full year, which contributes substantially towards supporting the future sustainability of the Social Insurance Fund.</p><p>  While the effect of paying PRSI on all earnings once the &euro;352 employee PRSI threshold is exceeded, is an issue, the yield from those paying PRSI contributes to keeping workers on lower earnings (below the threshold) outside of the PRSI net.  For those with families, Family Income Supplement (FIS) plays a significant role in preserving the incentive for persons to take up employment.  The level of FIS entitlement is based on net income after all relevant deductions, including the deduction of PRSI.  The payment effectively preserves the incentive to take up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if s/he were claiming other social welfare payments, even at levels of earnings which bring the worker within the PRSI net.</p></reply>

(For persons paying PRSI at the modified rate of contribution, the PRSI free allowance was &euro;26.)  This allowance was abolished in Budget 2013 and PRSI is now payable on all<b></b>earnings once the &euro;352 weekly threshold is exceeded.  When implemented it was estimated that this measure would yield &euro;265 million in 2013 and &euro;289 million in a full year, which contributes substantially towards supporting the future sustainability of the Social Insurance Fund.</p></reply>

As I stated in that reply, a decision on whether or not to extend the derogation for the use of Irish in EU institutions for a further period of time is required by December 2015 at the latest.  In this context, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Taoiseach, is engaged in discussions with various stakeholders, including the EU institutions, in order to formulate specific proposals on the optimal approach to the derogation.  This matter will be brought forward for consideration by Government in due course.</p><p>  It should also be noted that, as part of the Government's strategy to ensure that a sufficient number of qualified personnel are available to meet the needs arising from the recognition of Irish as an official and working language of the EU, my Department continues to provide substantial funding for a range of specialised third level courses and for the development of Irish language terminology for the EU terminology database, InterActive Terminology for Europe (IATE).</p></reply>

Although the landing of arms at Howth was successfully accomplished, the attempted seizure of the weapons by the authorities ended with fatal shootings of civilians at Bachelors Walk.  Official commemorations and community initiatives will mark the centenary of these historic events on Saturday, 26th and Sunday, 27th July.  The National Museum at Collins Barracks will have special presentations at the Asgard Gallery on Saturday, while commemorations on Sunday will include an acknowledgement at Glasnevin cemetery of those who died.  A memorial mass will also be arranged.  </p><p>An official commemoration will take place at Howth Harbour, followed by a community programme in the harbour with sailing craft of the period.   I am very pleased that the commemorative arrangements will include not only relatives of those involved in the historic events, but also those involved in the conservation and preparation of the yacht Asgard now on display in the National Museum in Collins Barracks.  I am aware that a community programme is also being prepared for 26th and 27th July to commemorate the secondary landing of arms at Kilcoole, Co Wicklow, from the yacht <i>Kelpie</i>.  Arrangements for these centenary commemorations are at an advanced stage of preparation and further details will be announced shortly.</p></reply>

Almost 1,500 submissions have been received and these are being examined at present.</p><p>To enable the draft national SAC plan to be finalised, site specific management plans are being prepared for each of the SACs.  These will determine, for example, whether or not there is a case to be made under Article 6.3 of the EU Habitats Directive for continued cutting on the site in question, where such cutting can be shown not to damage the protected habitat, and what approach will be taken to site restoration. </p><p>In addition, my Department, in partnership with Bord na M&oacute;na, has been working to identify alternative bogs, close to the SACs, to which turf-cutters could be relocated.  Potential relocation sites have been identified for all SACs on which there are active cutters and these are now at various stages of further analysis or acquisition.  Such a site has been identified close to be SAC referred to by the Deputy and has been found to be suitable for turf-extraction.  If, following in-depth examination, it emerges that there are no viable relocation sites for turf-cutters from a particular SAC, there is potential to examine whether the provisions of Article 6.4 of the EU Habitats Directive could be applied.  This process is described further in the draft plan.  </p><p>With regard to the <i>Review of the Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network, </i>I hope to be in a position to propose new sites for designation later this year, which will compensate for the loss of those complete or partial NHA sites which are moving towards de-designation.  These changes were proposed to improve the conservation value of the NHA network, while avoiding, to the extent possible, impacts on active turf-cutters.</p></reply>

Head 6 of the proposed Bill provides for an amendment to section 13 of the Act.  This involves including a new subsection in section 13(2) stating that the posts within public bodies that require an Irish language competency be specified in language schemes.  This amendment reflects the Government decision of 30 October 2013 to replace the practice of awarding bonus marks for Irish language proficiency in civil service recruitment and promotion competitions with a new competency-based system, the objective of which is to increase the cohort of functional bilinguals in the civil service. In addition, it should be noted that the workforce plans of Government Departments and Offices will in future specify the posts/areas of work which require staff that can function in both official languages.  Having regard to the implementation of the Gaeltacht Act 2012, Departments will be asked to pay particular attention to posts that are located in, or that are serving, Gaeltacht areas.</p><p>  I understand from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that it had been intended to pilot the new arrangements in the upcoming Executive Officer (EO) recruitment competition.  However, as priority is now being given to a Clerical Officer (CO) competition and the EO competition will not take place until later in the year, the new arrangements are being piloted in the CO competition which is currently being undertaken by the Public Appointments Service.  It is proposed that a sub-panel of Irish language functional bilinguals, comprising up to 6% of the overall CO panel size, will be created.  Successful candidates appointed from this panel must be able to provide a full range of services in Irish.  I should also point out that, in accordance with section 13(d) of the Official Languages Act 2003, public bodies, when preparing their language schemes, are required to ensure that the particular Irish language requirements associated with the provision of services in Gaeltacht areas are met.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-26a.322.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014062600052#WRM00600"><p>Firstly I should make clear that other than in the case of the 1959 agreement relating to the Kinsale Head gas field, the fiscal regime applying to oil and gas production in Ireland is set down in the Finance Acts and is not a matter of individual contracts.  In March 2014 international sectoral experts Wood Mackenzie were engaged to provide independent expert advice on the &ldquo;fitness-for-purpose&rdquo; of Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal terms, such advice to focus on what level of fiscal gain is achievable for the State and its citizens and, equally important, on the mechanisms best suited to produce such a gain.</p><p>  Having received and considered Wood Mackenzie&rsquo;s comprehensive and detailed report I sought agreement of the Government that Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas fiscal terms should be revised along the lines recommended.  The Wood Mackenzie report was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 18 June 2014.  The principal recommendations made by Wood Mackenzie are as follows:</p><p>  - For now Ireland should maintain a concession system, with industry rather than the State bearing the risk associated with investing in exploration;</p><p>  - Going forward a form of production profit tax should continue to apply in Ireland, but for discoveries made under future licences the form of this tax should be revised;</p><p>  - The tax should be charged on a field-by-field basis with the rate varying according to the profitability of the field and charged on each field&rsquo;s net profits;</p><p>  - That the revised tax should include a minimum payment at a rate of 5% which would function like a royalty and would result in the State receiving a share of revenue in every year that a field is selling production;</p><p>  - That the revised tax rates should be higher than the Profit Resource Rent Tax currently in place, thereby ensuring a higher share for the State from the most profitable fields. This would result in a maximum rate of 55% applying in the case of new licences, compared with a maximum rate of 40% under the current fiscal regime;</p><p>  - That the corporation tax rate applying to petroleum production should remain at 25%; and</p><p>  - there should be no retroactive change to the fiscal terms applying to existing exploration authorisations.</p><p>These recommendations flow from a comparative analysis between Ireland and nine other comparable hydrocarbon producing nations such as Newfoundland and Labrador, New Zealand, Spain and South Africa amongst others.</p><p>  In setting out Government policy on this issue, it is my intention to communicate a clear message in relation to the stability of Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal regime for the oil and gas exploration sector.  For existing licences no changes are proposed and this is also consistent with the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee.  For future prospective licence holders a clear regime is being set out and the rationale for that regime has been explained.  This should further engender industry confidence in the stability and predictability of Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas fiscal terms and allow the industry to focus on effective and timely exploration effort.</p><p>  Ireland has three producing gas fields namely the Kinsale, Ballycotton and Seven Heads fields off the coast of Cork.  There is no commercial production of oil in the Irish offshore.  The revenue generated for the State from the production from these gas fields is received in the form of rental fees, royalty payments (with the exception of the Seven Heads Gas field) and corporation tax. Profits from these three gas fields are taxed at a corporation rate of 25%.  The direct financial return to the State from the Corrib gas field, which is expected to come into production in 2015, will be through the 25% corporation tax on profits.</p><p>  The amount paid in taxation in respect of Ireland's producing gas fields is a matter between the companies concerned and the Revenue Commissioners and not one in respect of which I have a function.  I can observe, however, that as one of the principal factors impacting on the level of taxable profits from a producing gas field is the wholesale price of gas, which is subject to significant movement over time, that attempting to accurately estimate future profitability over the life of any gas field, would be a challenging exercise.</p><p>  In relation to the decision to revise the fiscal regime that will apply in the case of future exploration authorisations, the decision to revise the fiscal regime should be understood as a decision taken in the circumstances that currently prevail and should not be construed as suggesting that the regime now being introduced would have been appropriate at any particular juncture in the past.  This in turn would suggest that a hypothetical comparison would be of no value</p></reply>

This will be achieved by providing:-a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.  Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses.  As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched.  While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns.  Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas.</p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan.  This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.  Central to the strategy will be a long term, future proofed infrastructure build with next generation backhaul infrastructure (likely to be primarily fibre based) as the key component underpinning whatever access technology delivers the service (fixed or wireless).  This infrastructure build will extend to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention.  I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out.  This list is available on my Department's website, .  Currently, a total of 84 areas in County Galway have been identified as requiring an intervention.  This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise. Further locations may be identified as this process continues.  Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. I expect that this mapping exercise will be concluded in the autumn.</p><p>I would point out that the EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on State aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years.  In this regard, I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 57 fibre-based broadband networks in County Galway by July 2016.</p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end strategy for the State led intervention.  It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed strategy. EU State aid clearance will also be required for the intervention once finalised. This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in identified areas as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

Ireland has chosen to partially meet the requirements of Article 7 via the imposition of an Energy Efficiency Obligation Scheme on energy suppliers.  Earlier this year I introduced Statutory Instrument No. 131 of 2014 to give effect to the Energy Efficiency Obligation Scheme in Ireland.  These Regulations require all energy suppliers above a certain threshold to deliver 550GWh of energy savings every year.  Energy suppliers are free to choose the most effective and efficient means of meeting their obligation, be it through internal action or via the use of third parties active in the energy efficiency industry.  It is my understanding that most energy suppliers are working with third parties to deliver energy saving solutions to their customers.</p></reply>

It is open to anyone to submit their views electronically via a dedicated mailbox or in writing to the Department's address at 29-31 Adelaide Road, Dublin 2.  A number of special topic seminars covering the six policy priorities will be organised over the coming months to assist in distilling views on how best to address challenges and opportunities so as to support the three pillars of sustainability, security and competitiveness.</p><p>The Green Paper on Energy Policy in Ireland provides an opportunity to reflect and take stock of the current energy landscape in Ireland and internationally and to adopt a long term approach with regard to the policy, regulatory and societal interventions Ireland needs to make in the coming years.  Government, regulators, industry, system operators and the public will all need to make sound, evidence-based choices to support a flexible and fit for purpose energy system in Ireland to meet our current and future energy needs.  I look forward to an informed and robust debate and encourage everyone to engage actively in the public consultation process, with a view to contributing to the development of Ireland's future energy policy framework.</p></reply>

I am conscious of the difficulties caused by rising rents and the problem of sourcing suitable accommodation, especially in Dublin and other urban centres.  The most recent data from the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) Rent Index shows the extent of rising rents, particularly in Dublin and the major cities. In Dublin, rents for houses increased by 6. 7 % annually, and for apartments the figure was 10.3%. </p><p>The fundamental reason behind the rise in rents is a lack of supply. Increasing both public and private housing supply is a critical issue and just last month the Government published <i>Construction 2020</i><i>-</i><i>A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector</i>. This publication is a blueprint for a properly functioning and sustainable construction sector. It provides for a strategic approach to the provision of housing based on real and measured demand and addresses the full range of relevant issues including the planning process, financing, access to mortgage finance and the construction workforce.   As part of the Construction Strategy, the Government is committed to publishing a social housing strategy by the end of the third quarter 2014 which will set out a vision for social housing and identify ways to increase social housing supply over the next 5 years.  Over half a billion euro in funding is being made available through my Department across a range of housing programmes in 2014 and it is expected that over 6,000 units will be provided for social housing this year.</p><p>Resolution of the housing supply situation is the key element in restoring stability to the market but I recognise that the provision of additional units of housing takes time. Consequently, I recently asked the PRTB to conduct a study to explore options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector due to rising rents and to report back to me with policy recommendations before the end of June. My goal is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.</p></reply>

When taking an estate in charge under the terms of this provision, a planning authority must take in charge any roads, open spaces, car parks, sewers, water mains, or drains within the attendant grounds of the development. The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides for the transfer of responsibility for the provision of public water services from local authorities to Irish Water. In addition, it provides a mechanism whereby water services infrastructure may be transferred by Ministerial Order to Irish Water. Contrary to certain misunderstandings that may exist, there is no specific legal impediment to the taking in charge of water services infrastructure by local authorities.</p><p>  In Circular Letter PL 21/13 issued by my Department to planning authorities on 30 December 2013 in the light of the transfer of certain statutory water services functions from local authorities to Irish Water with effect from 1 January 2014, it was stated that legislative amendments to further clarify the existing provisions on the taking in charge of housing estates would be made in 2014. My Department is currently considering, in consultation with Irish Water, what amendments to section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 will be required in this regard.</p><p>  My Department, in consultation with Irish Water and the local authorities, is currently working on developing a protocol in relation to the taking in charge of estates. This protocol will be finalised shortly, following which further advice will be issued to local authorities in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied complies with the chemical and microbiological parameters set out in the Regulations. The maximum allowable value for lead is 10 microgrammes per litre. There is no requirement to replace lead pipes as part of the metering programme. However, Irish Water will be identifying the location of any lead service connections during the installation programme. </p><p>  The Water Services Act 2007 provides that the owner of a premises is responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the internal water distribution system and shall ensure that it is kept in good order and repair, so as to prevent a risk to human health or the environment and that the water meets prescribed quality standards.  Irish Water is responsible for replacing lead distribution mains and lead service pipes up to the stopcock.  Responsibility for replacing lead pipes from the main stopcock to the house, and within the house, rests with the homeowner.  The introduction of a grants scheme for any purpose must be managed within current budgetary constraints and, insofar as the funds administered by my Department are concerned, there are currently no plans to introduce a scheme for the replacement of lead piping within a household&rsquo;s internal distribution system.</p></reply>

This includes the provision of an out-of-hours service to deal with water and sewerage emergencies and contingencies.  Irish Water is now responsible for customer operational calls, and deals with emergencies as they arise in any local authority area. Irish Water is working to develop consistent arrangements across the 31 local authorities with which it has service level agreements. I understand from Irish Water that twenty five local authorities have specific out-of-hours service arrangements, but arrangements are more informal in remaining authorities for dealing with out of hours matters. Irish Water is working with these authorities (Galway County, Laois, Tipperary, Westmeath, Wicklow and Leitrim) to put in place appropriate cover as it moves towards a national consistent service. </p><p>Any queries or issues in relation to water supply can be reported directly to Irish Water at all times. Members of the public can contact Irish Water by phone on 1890 278 278 (this service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) or by email to <i><font color="#0000FF">customerservice@water.ie</font></i>. Full contact details for Irish Water are available on its website at <i><font color="#0000FF">www.water.ie</font></i>.  Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that it has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. The team can be contacted via an email to <i><font color="#0000FF">oireachtasmembers@water.ie</font></i>or by telephone on 1890 278 278. </p></reply>

Hogan)  My Department gathers quarterly data on staff numbers in local authorities. The number of staff employed by each local authority at the end of each year since 2009 is set out in the table below on a whole time equivalent basis (WTE). The most recent quarterly data collected at the end of March 2014 are also included. From 2013, staff numbers for the combined local authorities of Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council are returned by Limerick City Council. T he 2008 and 2009 figures include Regional Authority.   </p><p>Staffing arrangements within Irish Water are an operational matter for the company and one in which I have no function. Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels. The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water may appoint staff on terms and conditions as it may from time to time determine. Accordingly, the numbers of staff will depend on the organisational needs of Irish Water and its available budget. I understand from data supplied by Irish Water to my Department that 478 staff have been recruited up to 6 June 2014; 147 have been recruited from local authorities, 80 from Bord G&aacute;is, 5 from my Department, with the remaining 246 recruited externally.   <table><tr><th>LOCAL AUTHORITY </th><th><div>December 2009 Quarterly Return (Total WTE) </div></th><th><div>December 2010 Quarterly Return

Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels. The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water may appoint staff on terms and conditions as it may from time to time determine. Accordingly, the numbers of staff will depend on the organisational needs of Irish Water and its available budget. I understand from data supplied by the utility to my Department that 485 staff have been recruited up to 25 June 2014; 146 have been recruited from local authorities, 82 from Bord G&aacute;is, 5 from my Department with the remaining 252 recruited externally.</p><p>Section 18A of the Water Services Act 2013, as inserted by section 47 of the Gas Regulation Act 2013, governs the establishment of Irish Water pension schemes. The details of the pension schemes are currently being finalised by the utility in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The intention is that pension liabilities of former public sector staff recruited by Irish Water in relation to prior service with the Department and local authorities will not be crystallised liabilities on the balance sheet of the utility; the existing pension liabilities for such service will only become a cost as the employees concerned actually retire.</p><p>In terms of external contractors, I understand from Irish Water that some &euro;64.6 million has been expended on external service providers. Decisions on specific operational expenditure are a matter for the company and I have no role in that regard. However, costs incurred by Irish Water will be examined by the Commission for Energy Regulation as an integral element of the independent economic regulation of Irish Water.</p><p>Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that it has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. The team can be contacted via an email to or by telephone on 1890 278 278.</p></reply>

Of this figure, 1,607 units were in areas where the local authority had no demand or where properties were not considered suitable for social housing by the local authority for sustainable communities&rsquo; reasons, such as unsuitable tenure mix. A further 1,095 units originally identified as available were subsequently discovered by NAMA to be unavailable as the units had already been sold or leased by their debtor in accordance with their strategy for repaying their debt, or became unavailable when the loans associated with these properties were sold and NAMA no longer held an interest. Of the total properties originally identified, 1,951 properties are available, have a confirmed demand and are considered suitable for social housing.</p><p>  Of the 1,951 available and confirmed demand properties, 684 have been delivered for Social Housing use at the end of Q1 2014. This figure includes 518 complete and operational units and 166 units where contracts have been signed and final completion works were under way at that point. A further 451 properties are considered as being active transactions whereby terms are agreed or active negotiation is on-going by all parties concerned or where a detailed appraisal (i.e. determining the most likely delivery mechanism) is being carried out. An additional 702 properties are to be further appraised - signalling likely delivery in 2015 and 2016.</p><p>  While it is noted and accepted that delivery was slow within the early stages of collaboration, it is important to note that the process engaged in was novel to all parties concerned and with this came the added complexity of getting agreement from multiple parties operating within an environment subject to a range of legal and financial constraints. Within this context significant progress has been made in respect of delivery and in particular with the introduction of the National Asset Residential Property Services Limited (NARPSL) special purpose vehicle (SPV) of NAMA. The pace of delivery has increased and the process is now operating well as evidenced by the units delivered to date.</p><p>  The process of reviewing units previously deemed unsuitable is on-going. NAMA have been requested to identify the units that are still available and Local Authorities, particularly those in high demand areas, are reviewing the list of NAMA properties to see if innovative solutions can be found in order to bring units into use that were previously not considered suitable for sustainable communities reasons.  My Department and NAMA are also working together to find ways to retain, contractually or otherwise, the units currently identified as having a confirmed demand to avoid their potential loss through portfolio sale. Along with the on-going review of existing properties by local authorities, a greater focus on building out of incomplete units will be required in order to maximise delivery through this process.</p><p>  My Department and NAMA have set a delivery target of 500 units in 2014, an ambitious target which we are confident will be met and which will bring overall delivery of units from this initiative to 1 ,100 by year end.</p></reply>

The 2013 figures are the most up-to-date figures available on waiting list numbers, which are subject to on-going fluctuation due to households being allocated housing and new households applying for housing support.  However, the 2013 results cannot be directly compared to previous results given that this latest summary employed different methodologies and was the first to be carried out under the 2011 Social Housing Assessment Regulations.</p><p>The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing needs through a variety of mechanisms. In terms of the delivery of social housing, the main focus in terms of supports provided by Government will be on meeting the most acute needs &ndash; the housing support needs of those unable to provide for their accommodation from own resources.</p><p>On 14 May 2014, the Government published <i>Construction 2020 &ndash; A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector</i>. The Strategy contains 75 Actions in total and my Department, together with the Housing Agency, will be involved in the delivery of over 30 of those. Under Action 8 of <i>Construction 2020</i>, a Social Housing Strategy is to be published by Q3 2014; to assist in its development, the Housing Agency has invited submissions by 31 July 2014. Further information is available at the following weblink:.</p><p>It is clear that the present and foreseeable economic context in which we must address social housing need is such that innovative, and indeed challenging, solutions must be found which will harness new funding streams. While the local authorities will continue to have the lead role in addressing social housing need, in their capacity as statutory housing authorities, the growing role of the not-for-profit sector, as represented by the Approved Housing Bodies, and other potential investors must also be further developed.</p><p>My intention is that the Strategy will be both challenging and innovative, and will provide the basis for an enhanced approach to social housing provision in Ireland. It will contain clear measurable actions that are to be taken to increase the supply of social housing and, most importantly, reduce the number of people on waiting lists over the next five years.</p><p>With the benefit of the recent injection of &euro;50m for social housing from the Government&rsquo;s May 2014 stimulus announcement, on top of the original housing budget of some &euro;587m, I now expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 6,000 new housing units. The number and method of delivery of social housing units in future years will be determined in the course of the annual Estimates process and will be informed by the Social Housing Strategy now in preparation.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities and the purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.</p><p>In February 2013, I published the Government&rsquo;s <i>Homelessness Policy Statement</i>in which the aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined.

Up to 31 March 2015 milk purchasers cannot accept deliveries from milk suppliers, unless the milk supplier holds a milk quota with that milk purchaser. </p><p>  Given that the rate of the super levy fine is set by EU Council Regulation it is not possible for me to change that rate without the agreement of both the Commission and all other Member States, and such an agreement is not forthcoming.  While I have sought and continue to seek amendments at EU level to improve the &lsquo;soft landing&rsquo; for Irish dairy producers in collaboration with like-minded other Member States, unfortunately there is no common position at the Council of Agriculture Ministers and for the moment such an improvement looks unlikely to be achieved.  However, I expect the matter to be on the agenda for discussion at July Council where I will once again seek to have the matter progressed in favour of Irish dairy farmers. </p><p>  In preparation for quota abolition, I have announced a number of significant investments by my Department in the Irish dairy sector particularly at farm level.  These include the Dairy Expansion Scheme and the TAMS funding for the dairy sector.  The new RDP to commence from next year also contains a number of proposals for additional TAMS funding for dairy farms.  These investments complement the excellent work being undertaken by Teagasc and ICBF in preparing dairy fairy farmers to take advantage of the significant opportunity which quota abolition will present.</p></reply>

The approach to this consultation has centred on:</p><p>- An open call for submissions launched in December, 2012,</p><p>- Stakeholder workshops facilitated by the National Rural Network in July, 2013,</p><p>- A further open call for submissions and a stakeholder event building on the announcement of proposed RDP measures in January, 2014,</p><p>- An open call for submissions based around the Strategic Environmental Assessment of the RDP in May, 2013, and</p><p>- Ongoing meetings between officials in my Department and stakeholders as the design of the RDP has progressed.</p><p>Having taking into account the results of this extensive consultation, the draft RDP is currently being finalised.  The detailed elements referred to by the Deputy will be included in this draft to be submitted to the EU Commission.  This draft will then form the basis for detailed negotiations over a number of months with the European Commission.

Inshore fisheries are particularly important to small-scale coastal communities and a significant proportion of Ireland&rsquo;s inshore fleet operate off the Kerry coast.  There are now 2 development schemes dedicated to supporting the inshore fisheries sector which, taken together, represent a package of &euro;1m and provide opportunities to develop in a sustainable way into the future. This funding is in addition to the &euro;600,000 in co-funding by the Government and the European Fisheries Fund available to the inshore sector through the FLAGs  and represents a significant investment in the future of Ireland&rsquo;s rural, coastal communities, right around the coast.  </p><p>  The package includes an enhanced Shellfish Pot Replacement Scheme, building on the scheme I originally announced in February 2014.  The Shellfish Pot Replacement Scheme administered by BIM is providing 40% of the cost of replacing these lost pots through fixed payments of &euro;24 per lobster/crab pot and &euro;12 per shrimp pot. Due to the limited uptake of the scheme, I have now more than doubled the pot limits from 50 to 200 for boats less than 12m length and from 100 to 250 for boats from 12 to 15m in length.  Existing applicants to the current scheme will automatically be increased to the supplementary pot limits and a call for new applications will be advertised. </p><p>  In addition to replacing lost gear, our inshore sector needs to be encouraged to develop in a smart, sustainable way, to take advantage of the valuable asset that is Ireland&rsquo;s coastal waters.  How seafood is caught today is an important part of ensuring that responsible inshore fishing is commercially attractive into the future.  The new Sustainable Inshore Fisheries Scheme will provide funding for environmentally-friendly fishing gear and equipment, and support for improvements in the areas of quality, hygiene, and standards on board.  In addition the scheme will increase the grant aid for voluntary v-notching lobsters from the existing maximum of 55% to a new maximum of 75% to entice more fishermen to participate in this worthwhile conservation activity.  </p><p>  In relation to co-funding from the European Union, Ireland must prepare an Operational Programme in order to avail of co-financing from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.  Following months of intense lobbying and negotiation, I announced on 12 June 2014 that I had secured &euro;148 million from the new Fund for the period 2014 to 2020 for the development of the Irish seafood industry and the coastal communities that depend upon it. This funding is more than double the amount that was available to Ireland during the last Common Fisheries Policy and will ensure a strong seafood industry in Ireland that can grow and expand to meet its potential up to 2020.  </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s EMFF allocation is to be provided through 5 discrete funding envelopes, namely &euro;71 million for investment in the seafood industry, &euro;32 million for data collection, &euro;37 million for control and enforcement, &euro;5 million for implementation of the Integrated Maritime Policy, and &euro;1.3 million for storage aid. I will be discussing with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the near future Exchequer matching funding, having regard to the general budgetary situation for the coming years.</p><p>  Many investment measures that may be included within the new Operational Programme have the potential to contribute to job creation in peripheral coastal communities in Kerry, including in particular capital grants to support growth and expansion of seafood processing and aquaculture enterprises and capital allocations to Fishery Local Action Groups for dispersal to projects within their coastal areas. Any allocation to these measures is subject to final decisions on overall priorities for the seafood sector and to ex-ante evaluation by independent consultants of the appropriateness of such measures.</p></reply>

An agreement between the world&rsquo;s two major trading blocs has the potential to increase growth and grow jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. In the agri-food sector we have strong offensive interests, both in terms of market access and in eliminating some of the irritants that hinder trade. We are seeking substantial market access for our dairy products and in the prepared foods area. We also want to see action to action to address the question of Grade A equivalence for dairy and the licensing system that applies to dairy imports into the US.</p><p>  Of course we have sensitivities as well.  One of these is our beef sector.  While we see some opportunities for establishing a niche market in the US for Irish beef, we have concerns regarding the prospect of increased beef imports into the EU.  I have raised these concerns on a number of occasions with the EU Commission.  I have proposed that Ireland&rsquo;s sensitivities are reflected in the size and composition of any quota offered to the US. I have argued that the size of the quota should not exceed European market absorption capacity, which is substantially reduced according to the latest forecasts.  I have also proposed that the quota should be designed &ndash; via end use conditions &ndash; to ensure that imports are not all concentrated on high value cuts and I have argued that an in-quota tariff rate should continue to apply to imports within the quota.</p></reply>

The scheme describes the essential quality assurance requirements from primary production through factory processing to final despatch which are necessary to meet customer requirements. In addition, the scheme lays down additional standards to be complied with at each step of the production chain.</p><p>  Producers seeking membership can initially apply directly to Bord Bia or through their meat processor. A special application form will be provided and must be signed by the producer. A producer declaration form will be completed at the audit to establish the proper basis for the audit. The application will then be evaluated and, if appropriate, a full independent audit of the producer will be carried out to evaluate the capability of the applicant to meet all the requirements of the Standard. This audit will be conducted by an independent auditor from a Bord Bia appointed inspection body. When the producer is deemed to have complied with the requirements of the Standard, the herd will be considered for certification under the Scheme. When certified, the producer will be issued with a certificate for the herd which will be listed on the Bord Bia register/database. Before the certification expires, the producer will receive a reminder letter from Bord Bia advising that a further audit is required to maintain certification.</p><p>  At processor level, the scheme sets out a number of essential requirements covering both product and process. There are procedures covering hygiene, chilling, and product traceability along the production chain. Processors must develop a food safety management plan based on the principles of HACCP. Processors are subject to independent audit during which their compliance with each of the scheme requirements will be assessed. When the processor is deemed to have complied with the requirements of the Standard, the processor will be considered for certification under the Scheme. When certified, the processor will be issued with a certificate for the scope of the process audited and will be listed on the Bord Bia database / register and on the member list.</p><p>  Currently there are 44,590 producers in the BLQAS which is made op as follows;</p><p>  - Beef only = 32,349</p><p>  - Lamb only = 2,529 </p><p>  - Mixed = 9,712</p><p>  Currently as per Bord Bia&rsquo;s website there are 53 processors on the members list, with 46 in the Republic and 7 in Northern Ireland.  The system is accredited to internationally standard and compliance is independently verified. Where non compliances are detected, the system requires immediate remedial action to be taken. I am confident that the system, which is accredited to internationally accepted standards, is robust.</p></reply>

In this regard I understand that that there is no legal definition of an &ldquo;au pair&rdquo; in Irish legislation but that the State's body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  </p><p>  I am informed that where the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), which comes within the remit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, receives a complaint involving somebody described as an au pair, NERA will investigate with a view to establishing the person&rsquo;s statutory entitlements under employment law (including whether the term &ldquo;au pair&rdquo; is being used to avoid statutory obligations).  NERA has encountered individuals, described by their employers as au pairs, who have been found to be domestic employees.  In such cases NERA will seek to vindicate the rights of all workers in accordance with its mandate and powers under employment legislation.  </p><p>  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation does not issue Employment Permits in respect of au pairs, child minders or domestic workers and therefore, from the perspective of my Department, there is no immigration permission specifically assigned to these categories of activity.  Accordingly if a non-EEA national sought permission to come to Ireland to work as an au pair they should be refused permission.  That does not prevent EU nationals exercising rights of free movement and engaging in this activity.  I am aware that in some cases non-EEA students may be doing au pair work and this matter is currently being reviewed in my Department in the context of further reform in the area of non-EEA student immigration. </p><p>  I would urge the Deputy, if he is aware of any case where an employee is being exploited in this context, to report the specifics to NERA for investigation.</p></reply>

The general principle is that a person coming here should not be a burden on the State and should accordingly have sufficient funds to maintain themselves during their stay.  For instance a non-EEA student applying for a visa must have &euro;7000 in funds available to them over and above the cost of their course.  A person coming on a work permit is expected to maintain themselves from their earnings while here rather than to have a particular level of savings.  Where applications are being made for family reunification the financial checks are on the basis of the sponsors earnings as opposed to bank balances. </p><p>  In the normal course a person coming to the State to work will require an Employment Permit from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation although some categories of migrants are exempt  from this requirement.  Further Information  is available on the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service website www.inis.gov.ie.  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children under 6 years with access to a GP service without fees.  This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees. </p><p>In line with this policy, the Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill was published on 23 April 2014 and is currently progressing through the Oireachtas.  The Bill was debated and approved at Committee Stage on 19 June 2014 and it is intended that the legislation will be passed by the Oireachtas before the summer break.  This will provide for a GP service to be made available without fees to all children aged five years and younger.</p><p>As you are aware, the Department of Health and the HSE prepared a draft GP contract earlier this year to facilitate the introduction of this service.  As part of the consultation process on the draft contract, I met with the National Association of General Practitioners (NAGP), the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) and the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) on January 31, 2014.  At these meetings, the concerns of the organisations were acknowledged and they were invited to revert with any and all issues they may wish to raise on the draft contract.  </p><p>Following the meeting with the NAGP on the 31 January, the NAGP did not make a submission to the HSE.  They did, however, write to me on 20 February last in relation to the draft contract, stating <i>&quot;Accordingly, the NAGP does not propose to waste any further time considering this document and respectfully suggests that a full re-write is undertaken with the proper and meaningful negotiations with all key stakeholders.  Then, and only then, are we prepared to give your proposals further consideration</i>&quot;.</p><p>Following the meetings on 31 January last, the IMO provided a written submission to the HSE on the draft under 6 contract and subsequently entered into talks with the Department of Health and the HSE.  On 4 June 2014, a Framework Agreement with the IMO was signed.  This sets out a process for engagement concerning the GMS/GP contract and other publicly funded contracts involving General Practitioners (GPs), starting with the provision of GP care free at the point of access for children under 6 years.  This will enable collaboration on the full implementation of a universal GP service and will allow progress on a new GMS GP contract.  The HSE, Department and IMO met yesterday to commence discussions on a new GP contract for children under 6 years in accordance with the terms of the Framework Agreement and are using the draft under 6 contract as published on the HSE website on 31 January as the basis for these discussions.</p></reply>

However, I recognise that there is a balance to be struck to meet both economic requirements and patient safety requirements.  Notwithstanding the need to reduce public service numbers, the HSE has the capacity to recruit where it is necessary to do so in order to ensure patient safety and quality care and to support service delivery. </p><p>  It is imperative that patient safety continues to be maintained in the context of these reductions and achieving this requires that relevant expertise is applied to the decision making process. It is for this reason that I have approved the establishment of a taskforce to develop a framework that will determine the staffing and skill mix requirements for the nursing workforce in a range of major specialties. The focus will be on the development of staffing and skill mix ranges which take account of a number of influencing factors. The taskforce is being chaired by the Chief Nursing Officer.</p><p>  It is important also to note the link between nursing qualifications and safety and to recognise that nurse education levels are also linked to patient outcomes. The Lancet study showed that a 10% increase in the proportion of nurses holding a nursing degree is associated with a 7% decrease in the risk of death.  Ireland has invested significantly in nurse education since the Commission on Nursing in 1998.

The group has been asked to make an early report to the Minister for Health in the autumn.</p><p>The Government was very concerned about the potential impacts on the health of persons with serious illnesses whose discretionary medical cards and GP visit cards were refused renewals since the centralisation of medical card assessment in 2011. Therefore, in the context of the above eligibility policy development, the Government has decided to issue medical cards and GP visit cards to these people.</p><p>The Government recently approved the method by which medical cards and GP visit cards, awarded by way of discretion, can issue to persons with serious medical conditions where renewal was refused having completed an eligibility review.  The cards will issue in the following circumstances:</p><p>- During the period, the person held a medical card or GP visit card issued on a discretionary basis, but the HSE made a decision to refuse its renewal on foot of a completed eligibility review. - The person completed the review process during that period, i.e. provided the information and documentation required to assess their eligibility. </p><p>- The person has a serious medical condition, i.e., which required that their case was referred to a Medical Officer as a part of the review process</p><p>It is anticipated that over 15,000 cards will issue to people with serious medical conditions as part of this process. However, until the HSE has completed its examination on a case by case basis, it is not possible to provide a definitive figure.  Furthermore, it is also recognised that a small number of individuals may not have been able to complete their review during this period due to circumstances relating to their medical condition, e.g., hospitalisation during treatment, change of residence during treatment. Therefore, the Director General of the HSE may act, on his own initiative, to take account of an <i>ad misericordiam</i>appeal (an appeal &ldquo;to pity&rdquo;) on a case by case basis to issue a discretionary card to such a person that has a serious medical condition. </p></reply>

All applicants who are approved for funding are put on the placement list in chronological order by the date of determination of their application. Funding issues to applicants in this chronological order to ensure equity nationally. As such, the average waiting time between assessment and approval is a national figure.  As of the 19th June, there were 1,390 people on the national placement list.

The cost to haulage operators carrying loads outside of Ireland has been considered and a full review carried out of the road charging regimes in other European states, including the system introduced in the UK this year. The relevant European Union legislation in this area has also been examined. I understand that the Group has identified various options for changes to the motor tax regime in Ireland to support the haulage industry and to ensure that transport costs do not negatively impact on Irish businesses, particularly Irish exporters who are driving our economic recovery.</p><p>  I look forward to receiving this report later in the summer.</p></reply>

The principal concern when looking at the future of bus services in Waterford is to provide a better service to those people who currently use those services, and more importantly, getting those people who don&rsquo;t, to use those bus services.  As at present, the fares, timetables and service standards will be set by the NTA. The tendering of these services will therefore not lead to a downgrading of services to bus users. The purpose of the tendering is to secure a better service for the same cost. It will be good for Waterford, its residents and may yet become an example for other places to follow. It is open to Bus &Eacute;ireann to compete in this tender. </p><p>  In the case of Bus &Eacute;ireann not being successful in the competitive process, staff would be protected under the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 (the &ldquo;Transfer Regulations&rdquo; or &ldquo;TUPE&rdquo;). Minister of State Alan Kelly and I met with the unions representing Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann workers in November to discuss this matter. Arising from that we asked the NTA to put a structured engagement with unions in place and the NTA met with the NBRU and SIPTU unions in January and March this year.</p></reply>

No. 6 of 2013), which came into effect as of 19 January 2013.</p><p>  The Directive allows Member States the option of limiting the validity period of licences due to age.  Ireland has a long-standing policy of treating 70 years of age as the cut-off point in these terms.  Therefore, an applicant for a category D licence who is 65 to 67 years of age will receive a licence valid until the day before they turn 70.  An applicant over 67 will receive a three year licence.  When applying for a licence over the age of 70 in any category, an applicant must provide a medical report indicating their continuing fitness to driver.  There is no &lsquo;retirement age.&rsquo;</p></reply>

The agencies also pay due regard to the existing calendar of events in Ireland, to maximise overall visitor numbers, but clearly the State cannot control the decisions of non-governmental bodies that may host events.</p><p>  The hosting of the Giro D'Italia earlier this year, and the Irish Open over the past week showed that the island of Ireland can successfully host large international events and ensure that participants and spectators alike have a great experience when they visit our shores.  Later in the year, Croke Park will host the American Football match between the University of Central Florida and Penn State.  This will build on the success of the Navy-Notre Dame game in 2012.</p><p>  In relation to the potential hosting of the Rugby World Cup in 2023, Minister Varadkar and I met with our Ministerial colleagues from Northern Ireland responsible for tourism and sport last January. We established a working group to examine some key issues and to report back to us in the Summer.  The working group, on which the IRFU and relevant Government Departments from both jurisdictions are represented, has held a number of meetings to date.  I look forward to receiving their report later in the Summer.</p><p>  The Government is also very supportive of the FAI and Dublin City Council's recent bid to host part of the European Soccer Championships in 2020 at the Aviva stadium.</p></reply>

These contracts expire later this year.  The awarding of subsequent contracts is the statutory responsibility of the National Transport Authority (NTA).  The NTA decided in December that all Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann routes will be included in the new five year direct award contracts which the NTA will enter into with the companies next December.  However, the NTA announced that 10% of publicly subvented bus services will only remain within the direct award contracts until the end of 2016. After that they will be operated under separate contracts that will have been competitively tendered. It is open to the two incumbent companies to compete for any tendered routes.</p><p>  In the case of Bus &Eacute;ireann not being successful in the competitive process, staff would be protected under the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 (the &ldquo;Transfer Regulations&rdquo; or &ldquo;TUPE&rdquo;). Minister of State Alan Kelly and I meet with the unions representing Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann workers in November to discuss this matter. Arising from that we asked the NTA to put a structured engagement with unions in place and the NTA met with the NBRU and SIPTU unions in January and March this year.</p></reply>

All of our main markets grew compared to 2012 and we enjoyed our highest ever number of visits from North America. Figures recently published by the CSO show that for the 3 month period of February-April &lsquo;14, overseas visit numbers grew by 7.5 % compared with the same period in 2013.</p><p>  In terms of targets for 2014, the approved Tourism Ireland Business Plan for 2014 contains a target of growing visit numbers to Ireland by a further 4% this year and growing the associated revenue from these overseas visits by 7%. As part of its actions to reach this target, Tourism Ireland is undertaking extensive marketing campaigns in all of our main overseas markets.  Furthermore, I am confident that measures such as the retention of the lower VAT rate for tourism services, the reduction of the air travel tax to zero from April and the increased air access to Ireland will also help to ensure that the targets are met.</p><p>  In relation to the next three years, the approved Tourism Ireland Corporate Plan 2014-2016 includes a target of increasing overseas visits by 13% by 2016 compared to 2013.  The Plan contains a range of actions to achieve this target, in areas such as destination branding, consumer engagement, and collaboration with other agencies and commercial partners.</p></reply>

Information and tracing enquiries are normally dealt with by the organisation that arranged the original adoption placement.  If the adoption agency has closed, the Child and Family Agency Adoption Information and Tracing Service, or the agency that now holds the placement records, will deal with the enquiry. </p><p>  The Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Child and Family Agency and the relevant adoption agency hold records on each individual adoption order granted under the Adoption Act 1952.  The records retained vary but may include basic legal documentation in relation to the adoption, such as application forms, birth certificates for children and adoptive parents, marriage certificates, and consent documentation.  The agency records may contain additional information but this can vary considerably.</p><p>  Non identifying information regarding the birth parent will generally be provided to an adopted person.  This would include whatever background medical information is on file.  However, the medical and social information on record may be very limited and it may be necessary to attempt to contact the birth parents should updated medical information be required.  What information can or cannot be deemed to be identifying or non-identifying can only be determined on a case by case basis taking account of the individual circumstances involved. </p><p>  My Department is continuing work on the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval to publish the Heads of the Bill as soon as possible.  While I am anxious to improve the legal basis for access to adoption records, proposals to Government have to reflect the constraints on the Legislature in providing such access if they are not to fall foul of Constitutional challenge.  The Office of the Attorney General has provided comprehensive legal advice to the Department that has assisted in identifying the Constitutional parameters within which the Heads of the Bill have to be drafted. </p><p>  It is intended to proceed to finalise legislative proposals and I will bring proposals to the Government as soon as possible.  Subsequent consideration by the Oireachtas Health and Children Committee will allow the issues to be carefully teased out and the views of different interested parties on these important and sensitive matters to be fully considered.</p></reply>

This brought order to what had been the system of ad-hoc arrangements in lieu of formal adoption procedures up to this point.  All adoptions, which the Irish state has been involved in since 1952 have been carried out in line with this and subsequent adoption legislation.</p><p>  I am also aware that some arrangements put in place in earlier decades were not within the provisions of the adoption legislation leaving people assuming they were adopted when they in fact were not.  There were also births which were the subject of illegal registrations.  The issue of illegal registrations of births are a matter for the General Registration Office which is the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection however the Adoption Authority of Ireland may also be able to provide assistance in this regard.  However historic private arrangements for obvious reasons and due to social factors of the era, operated in conditions of great secrecy and there were rarely any contemporary written records of these events. </p><p>  Records in relation to adoptions as well as illegal birth registrations are currently held by a number of agencies, including the HSE, the Adoption Authority of Ireland and also by private adoption agencies, maternity hospitals, private individuals and other sources.  Information held by the Adoption Authority is primarily in relation to adoptions which took place since the Adoption Act 1952.  If no adoption took place the Authority would not have an adoption file.  Where no adoption took place, if records exist they may be held by a number of sources including hospitals, GPs, Mother and Baby Homes, religious orders and other sources. </p><p>  The National Adoption Contact Register which is operated by the Adoption Authority was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  When the former Adoption Board launched the National Adoption Contact Preference Register in 2005, provision was made for persons, who were party to the illegal registration of a child, to register an interest in the Register for possible future contact with another party sometime in the future.  Fundamental to the success of the Register is that any persons with information in this regard contact the Information and Tracing Unit of the Adoption Authority.</p></reply>
