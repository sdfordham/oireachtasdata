Niall Molloy in Clara, County Offaly, in July 1985; if he will accede to the request by the family for an independent inquiry into the priest's violent death; and if he will make a statement on the matter. <b>[5660/13]</b></p></ques>

Upon receipt of a report from the Commissioner I will review the situation. I understand that the officers carrying out the examination are continuing to keep the family members of the deceased updated on progress. While I fully appreciate the concerns of the family, in any case where criminal behaviour is suspected it is only through a Garda investigation, and where evidence of criminal wrongdoing is available through the submission of a file by the Garda&iacute; to the Director of Public Prosecutions, that persons can be brought fully to account. Therefore, I hope that the Deputy will agree that, in the first instance, we need to allow the present Garda examination to proceed to its conclusion.</p></reply>

The comparative figure for December 2007 was 2,305. With regard to vehicle safety, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the safe operation of the Garda vehicle fleet is a priority for the Force.  Within that framework specific measures are in place to ensure that all of the vehicles concerned are maintained to a high standard, so that they can function under safe conditions for both Garda personnel and the general public.</p><p>  The Deputies will be aware that an additional 213 new vehicles were purchased in 2012 on foot of an investment of &euro;4 million. These new vehicles are currently being rolled out to Garda Divisions throughout the country. In addition, a further provision of &euro;5 million has been made available for the purchase and fit-out of Garda transport in 2013.  This represents a very considerable financial investment in Garda transport, particularly at a time when the level of funding available across the public sector is severely limited. It is a clear indication of my commitment to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provided with sufficient resources to enable them to provide an effective and efficient policing service.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-06a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020600102#WRA01200"><p>I have no immediate plans to introduce such legislation though, as I have indicated in the past, serious consideration is being given to this issue. </p><p>  I am aware of the long standing wish of many Travellers that such status be granted but there are also some divergent views.  I am also aware that the previous Government was of the view that Travellers are not an ethnic minority. Dialogue between staff of my Department and representatives of Traveller organisations has taken place in the past on the issue, for example, during the course of a seminar on the third State report under the Council of Europe Convention on National Minorities.   In addition, the National Traveller Monitoring and Advisory Committee, on which sit representatives of all the national Traveller organisations as well as officials of the Department of Justice and Equality, in 2012 established a sub-group specifically to consider the issue of Traveller ethnicity.  Arising from the work of this group, among other things, a conference was held in Dublin Castle, supported by my Department.  At this conference various aspects of the ethnicity subject were considered from a wide spectrum of opinion.</p><p>  I would like to remind the house that Travellers in Ireland have the same civil and political rights as other citizens under the Constitution. The key anti-discrimination measures, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977, the Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Acts specifically identify Travellers by name as a group protected. The Equality Act 2004, which transposed the EU Racial Equality Directive, applied all the protections of that Directive across all of the nine grounds contained in the legislation, including the Traveller community ground.<b></b>  All the protections afforded to ethnic minorities in EU directives and international conventions apply to Travellers because the Irish legislation giving effect to those international instruments explicitly protects Travellers. </p><p>  I would like to inform the Deputy that consideration of this issue remains ongoing with a view to ensuring that full analysis of  all aspects of the granting of ethnic status to Travellers is available to Government when coming to a decision on the matter.    <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-06a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020600102#WRA01400"><p>Among the many headaches I inherited when I was appointed Minister for Justice and Equality in March 2011 was the need to unravel the expenditure for the Justice Sector contained in the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government's National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, which, if applied, would have resulted in devastating cuts in Garda services which I would not, and could not, stand over.  The budgetary resources in the Fianna F&aacute;il National Recovery Plan were unacceptable and would have put the Garda Commissioner in an impossible position. Fortunately, I was able to secure additional funding for the three-year period 2012 to 2014 to ensure that sufficient money was available to the Commissioner to allow the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to continue to deliver an effective policing service.</p><p>  Specifically, I secured Euro 2.243 billion for the Justice Sector for 2012 which was Euro 118 more than had been allocated by Fianna F&aacute;il.  For 2013, I secured funding of Euro 2.2 billion which was Euro 191 million more than the Fianna F&aacute;il allocation.  For 2014, I secured Euro 2.065 billion, which was Euro 105 million more than the original Fianna F&aacute;il allocation.  Overall, had I not obtained this additional finance, the Garda&iacute; would have stood to lose an average of Euro 90 million each year under the Fianna F&aacute;il plan over the years 2012 to 2014.</p><p>  In 2013 the Garda financial allocation, which in gross terms amounts to over Euro 1.4 billion, is a substantial amount and I can assure the Deputy, and the House, that this allocation will be spent in the most effective way with the emphasis on the delivery of front-line services.  In that general context, a budget of Euro 5 million has been made available in 2013 for the purchase of additional Garda vehicles and, indeed, the modernisation of the Garda fleet is a crucial part of supporting policing operations throughout the State.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a programme of consolidating the Garda station network is currently under way.  This programme, which has been undertaken on the basis of recommendations made by the Garda Commissioner, yielded the freeing-up of over 160 Garda members in 2012 for operational policing duties.  Moreover, the Garda authorities have indicated that the consolidation measures for 2013 will result in an extra 61,000 Garda patrol hours.</p><p>  The overall objective of the consolidation process is to ensure effective policing.  Furthermore, it has been supplemented by the new Garda roster system which ensures that resources are optimally deployed when and where they are required, to every part of the community, both rural and urban.  In addition, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has available to it a class-leading computer system and a state of the art digital radio system.</p><p>  With regard to the fight against crime, the most recent crime statistics published by the Central Statistics Office show a welcome reduction in 12 of the 14 crime groups for which figures are given, compared with the previous 12 months.  The figures reflect how the Garda&iacute; are making an impact on crime and the Commissioner has indicated that the Force will maintain its focus on criminal activities.  In response to the rise in burglaries, Operation Fiacla has been set up by the Commissioner.  The operation has been very successful and up to the end of December 2012 it has resulted in 3,538 arrests and 1,924 charges.</p><p>  I am determined, as Minister for Justice and Equality, that the resources of our Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be used in the best, most effective and efficient way possible.  Overall, I believe that the primary Garda objective of combating crime will be continue to be achieved, and that, despite the pressure on the public finances, it will be possible for the Force to operate to the optimum benefit of our communities in a manner that will facilitate the prevention and detection of offences.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-06a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020600102#WRA01600"><p>The European Commission has indicated that it will during the course of 2013 publish some guidelines on the interpretation of Council Directive 2003/86/EC on the Right to Family Reunification.  Since Ireland, like the UK, does not participate in the Directive it would not be in a position to contribute formally to the development of the guidelines.  Nevertheless Ireland did participate in the Expert Group on Family Reunification convened in September by the Commission where Member States had an exchange of views on various issues covered by the Directive but which are also relevant to national policies in Ireland.   We would likewise hope to attend any future meetings in this area.</p><p>  The range of issues to be covered in any guidelines are not known at this stage and ultimately that is a matter for the Commission but could be expected to deal with most matters referenced in the Directive, including presumably that of dependency.</p><p>  In terms of family reunification in Ireland it is my intention to publish in the coming period a detailed policy document on family reunification both where the sponsor is an Irish national and where he/she is from outside the EEA. Work has been underway on this for some time and it will  include guidelines on all of the main issues including eligibility, dependency, the financial resources necessary to sponsor a dependent and any personal requirements the person seeking entry must meet.  The purpose is to update the existing policies in operation and to address any gaps in the current regime in the interests of applicants, practitioners and staff.  The aim is to achieve an appropriate balance between the legitimate aspirations of the family and the interests of society at large recognising of course that in many cases these will coincide.</p><p>  It should also be noted that our existing policies in respect of certain classes of migration, for high skilled workers, Researchers, PhD Students, Entrepreneurs and Investors, providing for immediate family reunification of spouse and dependent children would compare very favourably with many other jurisdictions.  Substantial numbers of cases are processed annually.  Therefore it is not a case that Ireland does not offer family reunification and the new guidelines which my Department is working on will provide further clarity on the criteria and the process that will be applied.</p></reply>

These initiatives optimise the use of existing structures and local Garda management ensure that all personnel are fully briefed on the initiative, with Divisional Crime Management Teams playing a key coordination and implementation role.</p><p>  I am further informed that, as of 31 January 2013, 3,903 persons have been arrested and 2,142 persons have been charged as part of the operation, reflecting the very substantial efforts being made to tackle this problem by the Garda&iacute;.</p><p>  In relation to the cost of the operation, it is understood that a separate dedicated budget has not been established for this initiative and it would necessitate a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources to calculate this. However, every effort is being made by Garda management, under the remit of the respective regional policing plans prepared under Operation Fiacla, for duty associated with these initiatives to be conducted as part of routine, rostered, policing activities.</p><p>  I am, of course, conscious of the deep distress which burglary can cause to householders and of the broader impact it can have in terms of fear of crime in our communities. I therefore very much welcome the fact that the Garda Commissioner is deploying the substantial resources available to him in a targeted approach to confront those engaged in this form of criminality.    The latest quarterly figures from the Central Statistics Office for burglary suggest that Operation Fiacla is having an impact, when compared with the quarterly figures prior to its introduction, and I am hopeful that the success of the operation will be continue to be reflected in future crime statistics as they become available.</p></reply>

The scheme, which is similar to schemes operating elsewhere in the public service, provides for a Conciliation Council, an Arbitration Board and an Adjudicator, all of which are designed to deal with conditions of service of members of all ranks of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na up to and including the rank of Chief Superintendent.</p><p>  In addition to this more formal approach, I have also met with AGSI on a bilateral basis. These meetings provide both sides with an opportunity to discuss work related issues, including working conditions. The last such meeting took place on 17 October 2012.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that talks have recently commenced with the trade unions and staff associations on a revision to the Croke Park Agreement.

By comparison with other similar jurisdictions this is still a high number. By way of comparison, there are 83 police stations in Northern Ireland for its population of 1.4 million and 340 stations in Scotland for its population of 5.2 million. In the London Metropolitan area, 66 police stations are due to close, leaving 73 police stations open to the public. </p><p>  Each year the Commissioner prepares a Policing Plan which outlines his proposals for providing the policing service in the country for the following year. Among other things, these plans must include any proposals he has for the re-organisation of the Divisional or Regional network together with any plans he has for the closure of a Garda station. The plans for 2014 and 2015 have not yet been prepared, however, from discussions with the Garda Commissioner I understand that the current consolidation process will be largely completed by the end of this year and it seems unlikely at this point in time that there will be any further station closures in 2014 and 2015.</p><p>  The delivery of the most effective policing service possible to the public will of course remain the objective of future policing plans. It will be for the Garda Commissioner, using his professional judgement, to formulate such proposals, and he will continue to have my support in seeking to maximise the number of Garda&iacute; on active frontline duty, preventing and detecting crime right across the country.</p></reply>

As part of these plans, it is intended to expand the role of the Inspector of Prisons.  I believe this will greatly enhance the Inspector's independent oversight of the prison system.  Under the new proposed arrangements, it is my intention that Visiting Committees will report regularly to the Inspector of Prisons.  In addition, Visiting Committees will be able to report any urgent or major matter to the Inspector at any time.  They will continue their role of visiting prisons.  They will also continue to meet with prisoners and liaise on their behalf with prison authorities, and they will be more effective.</p><p>  Subject to competing legislative priorities, it is expected that the General Scheme will be published early this year.  When work on preparation of the General Scheme has been completed, I will be seeking Government approval for its publication to facilitate a consultation process in advance of drafting and publication of the Bill.</p></reply>

That being said, I can also assure the Deputy that the 2013 Garda financial allocation, which in gross terms amounts to over Euro 1.4 billion, will be spent in the most effective way with the emphasis on the delivery of front-line services.</p><p>  In that general context I can confirm for the Deputy that the Garda overtime budget for this year is Euro 43.9 million.  On any analysis this is a substantial sum of money and it also represents an increase of approximately 3.5% on the actual expenditure on Garda overtime in 2012, which came to Euro 42.4 million.

In accordance with this principle, the role of the Oireachtas has been to specify in law a maximum penalty and a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.</p><p>  There are, of course, a small number of situations where statute has created exceptions to this approach most notably by providing for mandatory sentences for murder and presumptive minimum sentences in the case of certain firearms and drug trafficking offences.  Except for exceptional circumstances, I am of the view that the Oireachtas should be cautious in prescribing mandatory sentences.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.  The Law Reform Commission is currently examining the law in relation to mandatory sentences and I understand this work will be completed this year.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Law Reform Commission, after detailed study some years ago, recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines but favoured non-statutory sentencing principles.  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  Information on over 1,000 cases is detailed on the website and the Committee recently announced that it is shortly to recommence populating the online database with information on sentencing in the criminal courts.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that the ISIS committee also announced they are planning to recommence providing information on sentencing in relation to specific issues in which context an analysis has been published on rape sentencing prepared by the Judicial Researchers Office under the guidance of Mr. Justice Peter Charleton.  I understand that seminars are also planned, including one focusing on the work of the Sentencing Council in the UK.</p><p>  Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, in September 2012, I announced a strategic review of penal policy. I have established a working group to carry out this review which will examine all aspects of penal policy and I expect the Group to report later this year.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p></reply>

The nine beds referred to by the Deputy are allocated specifically for the therapeutic Drug Treatment Programme (DTP) based in the Medical Unit, Mountjoy Prison. This programme is 8 weeks in duration and the model used is a collaborative one using prison based staff and the community/ voluntary sector.  Its aim is to assist prisoners in achieving a drug free status.  At present, any person entering prison giving a history of opioid use and testing positive is offered a medically assisted symptomatic detoxification if clinically indicated.  Patients can, as part of the assessment process, discuss with healthcare staff other treatment options.</p><p>  Drug rehabilitation programmes for prisoners involve a significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and visiting statutory and non-statutory organisations.  Prisoners who on committal are engaged in an opioid substitution programme in the community will have their substitution treatment continued while in custody. Methadone substitution treatment is available in 9 of the 14 prisons (accommodating over 80% of the prison population).  Drug Treatment Pharmacist services are available in Mountjoy, D&oacute;chas, Midlands and Portlaoise Prisons. Pharmacists are responsible for all aspects of drug treatment (mainly methadone) dispensing, administration, recording, ordering, storage etc in those prisons, thus ensuring that drug treatment is provided on an equivalent basis to that available in the community while meeting all legal and professional requirements in those particular prisons. </p><p>  The Health Service Executive provides consultant led in-reach addiction services to Cloverhill and Wheatfield Prisons.  Merchants Quay Ireland provides a national addiction counselling service for prisoners with drug and alcohol problems in prisons and places of detention where prisoners require such a service (with the exception of Arbour Hill Prison).  Drug Free Units currently operate in Mountjoy Prison, Wheatfield Prison, Cloverhill Prison and St. Patrick's Institution. As part of the Irish Prison Service Strategic Plan 2012- 2014 Drug Free Units will be established in all closed prisons. Mountjoy Prison currently has two addiction nurses assigned. A clinical addiction team comprising the Primary Care Addiction Specialist GP, Addiction Nurses, Chief Nurse Officers, Merchants Quay Ireland personnel and Addiction Pharmacists provide a comprehensive overview of addiction services, which has resulted in a more streamlined service, better assessment and through-care outcomes.</p><p>  In line with Action 43 of the National Drug Strategy, the Irish Prison Service ensures the seamless transition of prisoners established on drug treatment into community drug treatment settings as agreed in the protocol developed with the Health Service Executive.  If the prisoner is on a community programme prior to committal to prison, the maintenance programme is continued during the prison term. Prior to a patient being commenced on methadone maintenance in prison, a drug treatment place in the community must be secured to ensure continuation of treatment upon release.</p><p>  The Irish Prison Service has conducted a review of its existing Drug Treatment programmes and proposals have been developed to reorient and extend the treatment options. Recent trends across prisons indicate a significant number of prisoners currently self-detoxing from methadone and a marked reduction in the average dose of methadone.  The proposals which have been adopted by the Irish Prison Service and are currently being rolled out on a phased basis include;</p><p>-  The establishment of a therapeutic Detoxification and Rehabilitation Treatment Programme (DRTP) with the allocation of 10 additional places from March 2013.  The DRTP will also operate in the Medical Unit and will be in addition to the existing DTP  which has 9 places;</p><p>- Circa 50 beds in the Medical Unit, Mountjoy Prison will be used exclusively for Drug Treatment Programmes including:</p><p>- The Drug Treatment Programme (DTP) &ndash; 8 week duration;</p><p>- Dextoxification &amp; Rehabilitation Treatment Programme (DRTP) &ndash; 6 week duration,</p><p>- Slow Detoxification Programme &ndash; maximum duration 6 months, </p><p>- Stabilisation Programme &ndash; maximum duration 6 months'.</p><p>- The Training Unit and Shelton Abbey are being designated as suitable for prisoners on methadone maintenance treatment. Loughan House will be designated as a facility for the treatment of prisoners seeking to return to a drug free lifestyle. </p><p>  The proposals set out above will provide an increased number of options for prisoners who demonstrate a commitment to addressing their substance misuse. Progression from these Programmes will include access to Drug Free Units, open prisons and ultimately the Community Return Scheme, subject to normal operational considerations. </p><p>  The Deputy will note that the Irish Prison Service is adding to the range of programmes, support services and through-care options for prisoners demonstrating a commitment to addressing their substance misuse. </p></reply>

The programme, which was devised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department, was originally scheduled to run on a pilot basis until last October.  The Programme allows tourists or business people from certain countries who have lawfully entered the UK, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa.  There has been a very positive response from tourism agencies and operators to this initiative.  Figures from the Central Statistics Office indicate that the number of visits to Ireland from the countries included in the programme increased by 21% in the twelve months following its introduction.  This is a significant increase and a very positive indicator of the success of the Programme.</p><p>  INIS is continuing to work closely with their UK counterparts towards the implementation of a common visa for short stay visitors.  It is anticipated that such a visa will prove an attractive option for tourists and business visitors, particularly in the context of the island of Ireland by facilitating visitors to travel freely between Northern Ireland and Ireland without the need for a separate Irish or UK visa. </p><p>  One of the prerequisites to its introduction is the requirement that all visa applicants supply fingerprint (biometrics) data electronically which is currently an essential element of applying for a UK visa.  Obviously Ireland does not have the capacity to capture such data for all visa applications worldwide; currently for UK visas this is done in over 150 countries.   Work is ongoing, through the regular Common Travel Area Forum meetings between INIS and the UK Home Office, on an agreed approach to this and other aspects prior to its introduction. </p><p>  The project demonstrates the mutual benefits of working in close cooperation with the UK immigration authorities and of adopting a practical approach which will both enhance the preservation of the integrity of the CTA as well as harnessing the potential to deliver economic and tourism benefits for both countries. Finally, I personally had discussions with the UK Minister for Immigration on 4th February where we reviewed progress on this Joint objective.</p></reply>

I intend to publish the Heads of the Bill as soon as possible in 2013 having regard to the need for consultations and the need to dispose of urgent legislative matters in my Department under the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for the State.</p><p>  In preparing my proposals for legislation, I am considering the detailed recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its Report on the Legal Aspects of Family Relationships<font color="#000080">.</font>   The Commission recommends that legislative provisions be introduced to facilitate the extension of guardianship (parental responsibility) to civil partners and step-parents either by agreement with the other parties who have parental responsibility for the child or by application to court.</p><p>  In that context, I am considering the Commission's specific recommendations on legislative reform, which would put same-sex couples and step-parents on an equal footing with other couples in relation to their children. I am also reviewing existing legislation worldwide addressing the issues of parentage, assisted human reproduction and surrogacy and considering the recommendations contained in the Report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction published by the Department of Health in 2005. Those reforms must ensure that children are able to form a legal connection with their non-biological parent and that kindred relationships flow from such legal connection. In particular, reform of the law is needed in the areas of guardianship, custody and access, and to ensure maintenance and inheritance rights for the children of civil partners.</p></reply>

In the circumstances the Deputies will appreciate that the specific financial information they have sought is not readily available and I understand that the provision of such information would involve a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources which are required for other purposes.</p><p>  However, I have also been advised by  the Garda authorities that the average financial saving estimated to arise in respect of the closure of the stations designated for closure in the Garda Policing Plan for 2013 is Euro 4,000 per station.  To a large extent this estimate relates to heating and lighting costs and it does not take account of specific repair bills, which will vary from premises to premises.</p><p>  As the Deputies will be aware, the closure of the stations has been proposed by the Garda Commissioner in his Policing Plan for 2013 and I would stress that the key objective involved is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than to secure modest cash savings.  In this context the Commissioner has concluded in relation to certain stations that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if the stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In making his recommendations on the closure of Garda stations, the Commissioner reviewed all aspects of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  In addition, the Commissioner has given a commitment that where a station is to be closed local Garda management will consult with local communities on the alternative policing arrangements to be put in place in their area.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Garda Commissioner has indicated he is confident that the implementation of the restructuring proposals contained in the 2013 Policing Plan will not lead to any diminution in the service provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In that regard he has stated that the revised structures will continue to support the Garda community philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs. This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of enhanced patrolling arrangements which, in turn, will provide increased Garda visibility as well as maintaining existing Garda links with communities throughout the country.</p></reply>

In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following the consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p><p>  The person concerned would then appear to have left the State, on a date unknown, and travelled to the United Kingdom (UK). Given that he had no permission to remain in the UK, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 16(1)(c) of the Dublin II Regulations, a formal request was received from the UK's immigration authorities, on 23rd December, 2010, to 'take back' the person concerned. Ireland agreed to the 'take back' request on the basis that Ireland was the Member State responsible for examining the asylum claim by the person concerned. The person concerned was returned to Ireland on 3rd March, 2011 and was returned to the stage of the asylum/immigration process where he had been before he departed for the UK.</p><p>  Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 30th December, 2010, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the then Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</p><p>  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome. In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</p><p>  The Deputy might also wish to note that the person concerned contacted the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in early April, 2011 indicating that he wished to return voluntarily to his country of origin. In response to that request, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service advised the person concerned of the voluntary return options open to him. Specifically, he was advised to contact the Dublin Office of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and while he did so, there were practical reasons as to why the voluntary return arrangement could not be concluded at that time. The person concerned again contacted the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service on 15th June, 2012 indicating that he wished to return voluntarily to his country of origin, but he later withdrew that request. As a result, his case will now be determined in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 and, if necessary, the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), in the order set out above.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that as the asylum claim of the person concerned has already been determined and refused, there is no basis under which he can now be granted refugee status. However, his ultimate position in the State remains to be determined so he should await the outcome of his application for Subsidiary Protection.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

As well as providing for the establishment of a Judicial Council and Board that will promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges, the proposed Bill is aimed at providing a means of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct supported by the establishment of a Judicial Conduct Committee which will have lay representation.</p><p>  In November 2011, the judiciary agreed to establish an Interim Judicial Council pending the publication and enactment of the proposed Judicial Council Bill. A sub-committee of the Board of the Interim Judicial Council was subsequently established to consider the General Scheme for a Judicial Council Bill, a version of which had been published by the previous Government in August 2010. The observations of the sub-committee were conveyed to me by the Chief Justice on 8 May 2012. These observations were duly considered at my Department taking account of intervening developments and of current Government policy. Following this consideration, I conveyed the relevant drafting instructions to the Attorney General in November 2012.  Work on the drafting of the new Bill continues, therefore, in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel and I very much appreciate the ongoing support being given to this initiative by the Chief Justice and her judicial colleagues. Under the Government's Legislation Programme for the Spring Session, announced by the Chief Whip on 15<sup>th</sup>   January 2013, publication of the Bill is expected later this year.</p></reply>

All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are tasked with enforcing all legislation relating to criminal matters, including the relevant provisions relating to racist behaviour. On receipt of any complaint the matter will be subject of a full investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and on completion of such investigation an Investigation File will be submitted to the Law Officers who, on being satisfied that there is sufficient evidence available to warrant a prosecution, will direct what charges, if any, are to be proffered.</p><p>  The Garda Racial Intercultural and Diversity Office (GRIDO) has responsibility for coordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of policing Ireland's diverse communities.  GRIDO monitors the reporting and recording of hate and racist crime on a continual basis.  There are currently a total of 311 Garda Ethnic Liaison Officers (ELOs) appointed to work with minority communities at local level.  These officers combined with GRIDO play a fundamental role in liaising with minority groups and work in partnership to encourage tolerance, respect and understanding within communities in the pursuit of preventing the commission of hate and racist crime.  GRIDO and ELOs provide advice and assistance to victims of hate or racist crime where required or deemed necessary.</p><p>  In addition to the work of the Garda&iacute;, the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration, which operates under my Department's remit,  provides substantial funding to local authorities around the country to support local programmes that educate the public on issues such as immigration, integration and anti-racism.</p></reply>

The Courts Service funded the work of the Committee in initially engaging a junior barrister to carry out research into the area of sentencing and sentencing information systems; funding a visit from Director of the Centre for Sentencing Research at Glasgow Law School who made a presentation in 2005 on the sentencing information system in use in the Scottish High Court and other jurisdictions and funding a visit by Court Service officials to Edinburgh to observe the use of the sentencing information system by the Scottish Courts Service.  The Courts Service also funded the provision of legal advice to the Committee on data protection issues which arose.  The project was progressed by way of a series of pilot projects between 2005 and 2009.  During this period the Courts Service retained the services of a further 9 barristers to collect and collate information on sentencing outcomes.  The Courts Service through its ICT Unit also supported the development of a computer system for the storage of the sentencing data collected and a pilot website which can be accessed by members of the judiciary and the public.  The resulting website became operational as a pilot in August 2010 with information published on over 1000 cases.  The Service has informed me that total expenditure to the end of 2010 was &#8364;397,060.</p><p>  I consider the website has the potential in time to be a valuable tool not only to members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those of us concerned with the needs of victims and their families and I welcome the recent announcement by the steering committee that two interns are shortly to be appointed under the JobBridge National Internship Scheme in order to recommence the detailed work of gathering and providing information via the website. <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>The Courts Service has confirmed that it will continue to support the development and implementation of the ISIS project.</p></reply>

As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, several hundred amendments to the Bill are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature.  On that occasion, I also expressed the considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members.  This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee.</p><p>  Work on the Bill continues, therefore, on that basis, including in cooperation with the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General while also taking account of any relevant rulings by the Courts.  It remains my objective under this new approach, and mindful of our having to deal with the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments, to be in a position to bring a revised Bill to Government for approval and publication later this year.</p></reply>

'Non-intercept' offences are recorded by fixed and mobile speed cameras, which include speed cameras operated by Go Safe as well as Garda mobile speed detection 'Robot' vehicles.  These are distinct from 'intercept' speeding offences which are detected by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in person.</p><p>  I am further informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that information in relation to speeding offences detected by Go Safe is included in the overall number of 'non-intercept' detections.  In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that in the period November, 2010 to December, 2012, 409,296 fixed charge notices issued in respect of 'non-intercept' speeding offences and 44,592 such notices were cancelled.  It should be noted that the figures provided by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provisional, operational and subject to change.</p><p>  As I have set out in response to other questions on this subject today, there can be circumstances where a Fixed Charge Notice may be cancelled, in accordance with Garda procedures drawn up in the light of legislative exemptions and prosecutorial guidelines.  Cancellation occurs where it is believed the evidence would not sustain a prosecution or a prosecution would not be appropriate, fair or proportionate.  The procedures provide authority to District Officers, or Inspectors Acting as District Officers, and an Inspector in the Fixed Charge Processing Office to cancel Fixed Charge Notices.</p><p>  Cancellation can occur in circumstances where, for example, exemptions apply in relation to emergency vehicles or the wearing of seatbelts, or where there are evidential difficulties, such as where the registration number registered by a speed camera does not correspond to the vehicle in question, or where there are emergency medical circumstances such as, for example, a sick child being driven to hospital, an imminent birth, or a medical professional rushing to a sick or elderly patient.</p></reply>

I note, too, the Law Reform Commission's previous cautious approach to pre-emptive costs as expressed in its Report on Judicial Review Procedure (LRC 71-2004).  These are among the many factors which I have been taking into account in my consideration of the issue of protective costs orders and of their possible future application - including in the context of the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 which, though not making specific provision for such orders, provides a new framework for the regulation of the legal professions and of legal costs.

As the Deputy will be aware, the criminal law takes a serious view of offences committed by persons on bail.  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served.  It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p><p>  A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions.  There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.</p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses.  The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.</p><p>  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.</p><p>  I believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  My intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.  I am also taking the opportunity to introduce some general improvements to bail law to improve the overall working of the bail system.  I will bring proposals to Government on the matter as soon as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities.</p><p>  In relation to the statistics requested by the Deputy regarding the number of offences committed by persons while remanded on bail, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  I have requested the CSO to provide relevant statistics directly to the Deputy.</p><p>  Regarding the number of persons recorded as having absconded while on bail, I have requested the Courts Service to supply information on the number of bench warrants issued where a person on bail fails to attend court.  I will contact the Deputy again when the information is to hand.</p></reply>

The objective of the network is to reduce the number of speed related collisions and so save lives, as excessive or inappropriate speeding is a major factor in road traffic collisions and fatalities.</p><p>  A targeted approach to speed enforcement is being undertaken in order to significantly reduce the incidence of fatal and serious injuries and improve road safety.  To this end, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in conjunction with the National Roads Authority, completed an extensive analysis of the collision history on the road network.  Sections of road have been identified where a significant proportion of collisions occurred whereby speed was deemed the primary contributory factor.</p><p>  Based on this analysis, a list of speed enforcement zones has been developed with the aim of providing information to motorists in order to raise awareness of speeding in these zones.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilises these zones in order to direct speed enforcement activity, in a proportionate and targeted manner.</p><p>  I am also advised that safety cameras only operate on sections of road which have a history of collisions occurring where speed was a contributory factor.  The locations of these speed enforcement zones are in the public domain and are available on the Garda website www.garda.ie.</p><p>  These speed enforcement zones are continually reviewed in light of survey data, collision history and local feedback to ensure that enforcement activity is properly targeted.  Surveys continue to be conducted to ensure the appropriate deployment of safety cameras on roads which have been identified as subject of inappropriate speed and where fatal and serious injury collisions continue to occur.</p><p>  I am assured by the Garda authorities that, in accordance with the contract with Go Safe, the service provider is responsible for ensuring that all equipment used in connection with the service is installed, calibrated and maintained in accordance with approved standards.  I am further advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not aware of any issues with regard to equipment or technology utilised by the service provider in the provision of the safety camera service or any issue in terms of data or data transfer.</p><p>  I am determined that resources of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are used in the most efficient and effective way possible.  In that regard, the outsourced safety camera network represents a considerable increase in capacity in terms of road safety enforcement while using Garda resources to the best possible effect.</p></reply>

Under new legislation being prepared, I intend to make Visiting Committees more effective while they continue their role of visiting prisons, meeting with prisoners, and liaising on their behalf with prison authorities.

As part of these plans, it is intended to expand the Inspector of Prison's role which I believe will greatly enhance his independent oversight of the prison system.</p></reply>

In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following the consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p><p>  The person concerned would then appear to have left the State, on a date unknown, and travelled to the United Kingdom (UK). Given that he had no permission to remain in the UK, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 16(1)(c) of the Dublin II Regulations, a formal request was received from the UK's immigration authorities, on 23rd December, 2010, to 'take back' the person concerned. Ireland agreed to the 'take back' request on the basis that Ireland was the Member State responsible for examining the asylum claim by the person concerned. The person concerned was returned to Ireland on 3rd March, 2011 and was returned to the stage of the asylum/immigration process where he had been before he departed for the UK.</p><p>  Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 30th December, 2010, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the then Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006. </p><p>  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome. In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</p><p>  The Deputy might also wish to note that the person concerned contacted the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in early April, 2011 indicating that he wished to return voluntarily to his country of origin. In response to that request, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service advised the person concerned of the voluntary return options open to him. Specifically, he was advised to contact the Dublin Office of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and while he did so, there were practical reasons as to why the voluntary return arrangement could not be concluded at that time. The person concerned again contacted the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service on 15th June, 2012 indicating that he wished to return voluntarily to his country of origin, but he later withdrew that request. As a result, his case will now be determined in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 and, if necessary, the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), in the order set out above.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that as the asylum claim of the person concerned has already been determined and refused, there is no basis under which he can now be granted refugee status. However, his ultimate position in the State remains to be determined so he should await the outcome of his application for Subsidiary Protection.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

The threat which these groups present is a matter of shared concern North and South.  We also share a strong resolve to take all necessary actions within the law to bear down on these groups.</p><p>  The Deputy will know, of course, that these so-called 'dissident republicans' are criminal terrorists who use lethal violence in pursuit of their own, often personal, ends.  They are deeply and inextricably involved in serious crime in order to fund their activities and their lifestyles.</p><p>  I can assure the House that countering the paramilitary threat has always been a priority for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and nothing has changed in that regard.  The Garda&iacute; will continue in their efforts to counteract these groups and their activities.</p><p>  The Garda&iacute; co-operate seamlessly with their counterparts in Northern Ireland in actively bearing down on these groups.  Operational policing co-operation is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI and both have repeatedly emphasised that the close, high quality co-operation between their forces has been instrumental in preventing attacks, combating criminality and saving lives.</p><p>  There is also a close and ongoing working relationship between our officials.  By working together on matters of mutual concern and interest we can improve community safety for all the people on this island.  We will continue, in co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, to spare no effort to ensure that those criminal terrorists who seek to subvert the democratic will of the people will face the full rigours of the law.</p></reply>

The organisation initially sought support to attend a disaster response learning exercise in California.

Under the Rapid Response Initiative, since 2007, ICT specialists have been deployed to a number of humanitarian crises, including those in Haiti, the Philippines, Sudan, Cameroon, Kenya and Mali.</p><p>  Last week, at my request, officials from Irish Aid met with the founder of the organisation to discuss its work and the humanitarian approach of Irish Aid.

Although a bilateral meeting had been scheduled, the Prime Minister of Belgium was detained in Brussels by urgent business.   The focus of my discussions with Prime Ministers Ayrault and Katainen was primarily on the priority issues currently being addressed during the Irish Presidency of the European Union.  The meetings offered the opportunity for me to update both Prime Ministers on Ireland&rsquo;s domestic situation, in particular in relation to the EU-IMF Programme and bank debt.</p><p>  In the context of issues which are to the fore of our efforts as Presidency, we concentrated in both meetings on progress on Banking Union, and in particular in that context on advancing agreement with the European Parliament on the Single Supervisory Mechanism. It was agreed in each discussion that this was a very important first step in meeting the mandate of the European Council on Banking Union. We also had an opportunity to have an exchange of views on the next steps including on Bank Resolution and Deposit Guarantees. This discussion was in the context of bringing stability to the Eurozone through early delivery of the political commitments made by Heads of State and Government.</p><p>  On the MFF, the importance of the work underway amongst Member States and in discussions with the institutions was also a focal point in these bilateral exchanges.  Both Prime Ministers Ayrault and Katainen agreed that it would be extremely important to find a basis on which the European Council could agree at its forthcoming meeting and I briefed them on the informal consultations already underway with the European Parliament.</p><p>  On the matter of jobs and growth, we discussed the potential for progress on a series of single market measures, including the digital single market, public procurement and professional qualifications. The issue of youth unemployment was emphasised as a key priority for the EU as a whole and in that context it was agreed that special effort should be made to reach agreement on the Youth Guarantee. The important contribution which trade agreements with key strategic partners can make to the growth agenda received our full attention and in both meetings the prospects for agreement on a mandate on EU-US Trade, and completion of the EU-Canada agreement were discussed.</p><p>  Finally, I was happy to inform the Prime Ministers of Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing achievements in fulfilling the terms of 8 Troika Reviews of our EU-IMF Programme, which incorporate more than 190 actions, fully signed up to and fully delivered. Both Prime Ministers were generous in their praise of Ireland&rsquo;s delivery on its Programme and welcomed the update in terms of the positive news in terms of our exports and growth prospects. However, I underlined a major concern which remains in terms of the unacceptably high level of unemployment in Ireland, particularly amongst young people. Both Prime Ministers expressed political support for Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing negotiation with the ECB in an effort to resolve the issue of the Promissory Notes. While the negotiations with the ECB remain confidential, I assured the Prime Ministers that the Government was approaching the negotiations in a solution-oriented manner, but that time was not on our side and that we urgently need to resolve the issue in advance of 31 March when the next payment becomes due. </p></reply>

However, they have supplied me with the following information for the information of the Deputy.   Tax Settlements made in accordance with Section 1086 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA), 1997 are published in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il on a quarterly basis. That section provides for the publication of cases where a qualifying disclosure is not made, where the total settlement consists of tax, interest and penalties and is over &euro;33,000 and where the penalty element exceeds 15% of the tax. Publication takes place in the quarter following the quarter in which the settlement is finalised. Until the passing of the Finance Act 2011 on 6 February 2011, settlements reached with Revenue could not be published unless the settlement was either paid in full or was the subject of an agreed phased payment arrangement.  That Act brought in changes to the publication rules and extended the publication requirement to tax defaulters who either failed to agree a settlement or who failed to pay all or part of a settlement.  The change was designed to ensure that the public is aware of the identity of all relevant Tax Defaulters whether on not they have agreed a settlement with the Commissioners or made the relevant payments.</p><p>Accordingly the Commissioners now publish Tax Settlement details where payment in full has not been made and this new requirement first applied to the List of Tax Defaulters published in respect of Quarter 2 of 2011.  In a further change, interest and penalty amounts included in Tax Settlements which up to and including Quarter 3 of 2011 were published as a composite figure in the Lists of Tax Defaulters, are now, since Quarter 4 of 2011, shown separately.</p><p>The Table below sets out quarterly details of Tax Settlements published in accordance with Section 1086 TAC 1997 for the years 2009-2012 inclusive.  Details of publishable cases settled in Quarter 4 of 2012 will be included in the next defaulters list which is due to be published in March 2013.</p><p><table><tr><th><b>2009</b></th><th><div><b>No. of Cases</b></div></th><th><div><b>Tax</b></div></th><th><div><b>Interest &amp; Penalties</b></div></th><th><div><b>Total</b></div></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Quarter 1</td><td><div>105</div></td><td><div>&#8364;15,285,637</div></td><td><div>&#8364;17,315,583</div></td><td><div>&#8364;32,601,220</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Quarter 2</td><td><div>87</div></td><td><div>&#8364;7,848,528</div></td><td><div>&#8364;9,709,283</div></td><td><div>&#8364;17,557,811</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Quarter 3</td><td><div>76</div></td><td><div>&#8364;8,106,761</div></td><td><div>&#8364;9,550,390</div></td><td><div>&#8364;17,657,151</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Quarter 4</td><td><div>88</div></td><td><div>&#8364;11,510,309</div></td><td><div>&#8364;17,442,427</div></td><td><div>&#8364;28,952,736</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><div>356</div></td><td><div>&#8364;42,751,235</div></td><td><div>&#8364;54,017,603</div></td><td><div>&#8364;96,768,838</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>2010</b></td><td><div><b>No. of Cases</b></div></td><td><div><b>Tax</b></div></td><td><div><b>Interest &amp; Penalties</b></div></td><td><div><b>Total</b></div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Quarter 1</td><td><div>88</div></td><td><div>&#8364;7,733,199</div></td><td><div>&#8364;8,695,830</div></td><td><div>&#8364;16,429,029</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Quarter 2</td><td><div>83</div></td><td><div>&#8364;8,581,891</div></td><td><div>&#8364;8,589,044</div></td><td><div>&#8364;17,170,935</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Quarter 3</td><td><div>72</div></td><td><div>&#8364;6,283,075</div></td><td><div>&#8364;6,980,450</div></td><td><div>&#8364;13,263,525</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Quarter 4</td><td><div>62</div></td><td><div>&#8364;9,070,419</div></td><td><div>&#8364;11,785,513</div></td><td><div>&#8364;20,855,932</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><div>305</div></td><td><div>&#8364;31,668,584</div></td><td><div>&#8364;36,050,837</div></td><td><div>&#8364;67,719,421</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>2011</b></td><td><div><b>No. of Cases</b></div></td><td><div><b>Tax</b></div></td><td><div><b>Interest &amp; Penalties</b></div></td><td><div><b>Total</b></div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Quarter 1</td><td><div>78</div></td><td><div>&#8364;6,972,700</div></td><td><div>&#8364;8,585,120</div></td><td><div>&#8364;15,557,820</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Quarter 2</td><td><div>114</div></td><td><div>&#8364;13,519,296</div></td><td><div>&#8364;12,732,398</div></td><td><div>&#8364;26,251,694</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Quarter 3</td><td><div>84</div></td><td><div>&#8364;9,290,456</div></td><td><div>&#8364;9,654,552</div></td><td><div>&#8364;18,945,008</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td><div><b>Tax</b></div></td><td><div><b>Interest</b></div></td><td><div><b>Penalties</b></div></td><td><div><b>Total</b></div></td></tr><tr><td>Quarter 4</td><td><div>90</div></td><td><div>&#8364;7,532,809</div></td><td><div>&#8364;3,642,052</div></td><td><div>&#8364;3,790,073</div></td><td><div>14,964,934</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><div>366</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>&#8364;75,719,456</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>2012</b></td><td><div><b>No. of Cases</b></div></td><td><div><b>Tax</b></div></td><td><div><b>Interest</b></div></td><td><div><b>Penalties</b></div></td><td><div><b>Total</b></div></td></tr><tr><td>Quarter 1</td><td><div>129</div></td><td><div>&#8364;15,383,510</div></td><td><div>&#8364;7,320,923</div></td><td><div>&#8364;6,893,250</div></td><td><div>&#8364;29,597,683</div></td></tr><tr><td>Quarter 2</td><td><div>106</div></td><td><div>&#8364;9,284,194</div></td><td><div>&#8364;5,618,572</div></td><td><div>&#8364;4,896,928</div></td><td><div>&#8364;19,799,694</div></td></tr><tr><td>Quarter 3</td><td><div>113</div></td><td><div>&#8364;10,534,248</div></td><td><div>&#8364;5,261,727</div></td><td><div>&#8364;5,556,466</div></td><td><div>&#8364;21,352,441</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><div>348</div></td><td><div>&#8364;35,201,952</div></td><td><div>&#8364;18,201,222</div></td><td><div>&#8364;17,346,644</div></td><td><div>&#8364;70,749,818</div></td></tr></table></p><p>Regarding the amount of tax actually paid at the end of each of the four years, 2009 to 2012 in respect of these specific cases, I am advised that the information is not available without carrying out an extensive review of Revenue files.

This is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.   The Central Bank&#8217;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears applies to mortgage lending activities with borrowers in respect of their principal private residence in the State. Compliance with the Code is mandatory on all mortgage lenders regulated by the Central Bank.  The Central Bank has the power to administer sanctions for a contravention of the Code under Part 111C of the Central Bank Act 1942. The Code provides a number of protections to borrowers. These include the establishment of a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) to deal with mortgage customers who are in arrears or in pre-arrears, the establishment of a dedicated Appeals Support Unit and a separate internal appeals process by lenders to deal with individuals on a case by case basis. A copy of the Code is available on the Central Bank&#8217;s website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.centralbank.ie</font></i>  .</p><p>  As I stated in the House in answer to Question Number 77 on 20 December 2012, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears applies to the mortgage lending activities of all regulated financial institutions (except credit unions), operating in the State, including:</p><p>-a financial services institution authorised, registered or licensed by the Central Bank of Ireland and</p><p>-a financial services institution authorised, registered or licensed in another EU or EEA Member State and which has provided, or is providing, mortgage lending activities in the State. </p><p>  Where a regulated financial institution sells part, or all, of its mortgage book to another regulated financial institution, the same protections apply to borrowers, namely, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Consumer Protection Code. Where a regulated financial institution outsources part, or all, of its mortgage book, the same protections apply to borrowers, and the institutions have responsibility for ensuring that these protections are applied by the outsourced company. </p><p>  However, if the loan book is sold to a financial institution that is not regulated by the Central Bank, then the provisions of Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears do not apply.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that Central Bank is due to commence a review of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears shortly and a Consultation Paper will be published on the Central Bank&#8217;s website.</p></reply>

The SFT was reduced in Budget and Finance Act 2011 by over 50% to a level of &euro;2.3 million with effect from 7 December 2010 with transitional arrangements to protect the capital values of the pension rights of individuals where these exceeded the reduced SFT on that date.   There is currently no underlying data available to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners on which to base reliable estimates of the savings from a further significant reduction in the SFT to the level indicated in the question. Information on the numbers and values of individual pension funds or on individual accrued benefits are not generally required to be supplied to the Revenue Commissioners by the administrators of pension schemes and personal pension arrangements. The estimated savings indicated at the time in respect the Budget and Finance Act 2011 change in the SFT were quite conservative, based as they were, on incomplete data and using very broad assumptions. Indeed, those underlying data and assumptions may not be directly applicable to determining the effect of a further significant reduction.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware of the announcement which I made in my Budget 2013 speech that changes to the SFT regime and other possible changes to give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government to cap taxpayers&rsquo; subsidies for pension schemes which deliver pension income of more than &euro;60,000 will be put in place in 2014.</p><p>  On page A.10 of the Budget 2013 booklet which accompanied my Budget speech, I indicated that the full year yield from these changes is estimated at &euro;250 million. The Budget 2013 booklet made clear, however, that the estimated full year savings are provisional at this time as further detailed analysis of the necessary changes and their impact will be required.</p><p>  In this regard, my Department has been engaging with representatives of the pensions sector over some time with a view, among other things, to gathering private pensions-related data which may be of value into the future in estimating the costs of potential changes in the pensions&rsquo; tax area. Those engagements will continue in the context of the further detailed analysis of the changes announced in the Budget.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in the past they have used paid advertising to promote the confidential free phone number.  More recently, it is promoted through their website and the phone number is included in press releases relating to cigarette and tobacco seizures which has resulted in the number being referenced frequently in the print media and more recently in social media. In addition, the free phone number is promoted, for example, in radio and television coverage of the illicit tobacco trade and on relevant trade websites and in trade publications.  </p><p>  The Commissioners&rsquo; experience with the hotline is that very few calls are specific enough to lead to seizures of tobacco or other successful control interventions. I recently advised the House in reply to a previous question that 431 calls led to just 18 seizures.  Assessing these calls absorbs skilled resources with limited evidence of impact and in light of this experience, there are not plans at present for advertising of the type envisaged on the Deputy's question, which can be extremely costly. </p><p>  Revenue employs a multi-faceted strategy for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco products. It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and deployment of detection technologies, optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and inland to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved. </p><p>  Revenue will continue to encourage the public to assist in the fight against the illicit tobacco trade by providing information to Revenue, by means of the confidential freephone or otherwise, on the smuggling and sale of untaxed tobacco products, and will keep the matter of advertising under review.</p></reply>

I will consider these proposals and the level of the rebate in the context of the Finance Bill.  It is worth noting that one of key arguments for introducing a rebate for the haulage industry is the fact that a large quantity of fuel purchased by this industry is purchased abroad thus generating no tax revenue for the State.  A rebate should encourage hauliers to start purchasing their fuel in Ireland thus offsetting some of the costs involved. Such an argument does not exist for the most part for the coach industry. </p><p>  The fuel rebate scheme proposed is governed by the terms of Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 which limits its application to auto diesel used in defined categories of road vehicles. </p></reply>

SNAs are allocated to schools in order to provide for the care needs of children with special educational needs attending such schools. The policy of my Department in relation to the SNA scheme is set out in Circular 07/02, which also provides details regarding the role and duties of an SNA.</p><p>  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that SNAs are not allocated to individual pupils. The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of the children, rather than solely by reference to a pupils' disability categorisation.</p><p>  SNAs should then be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  All schools have been advised by the NCSE of their SNA staffing allocations for the current school year. Details of the SNA allocations which have been made to each school are available at www.ncse.ie, detailed on a County basis. Where a school considers that they do not have adequate SNA support from within their allocated provision to provide for the care needs of all qualifying pupils, or where schools have enrolled new students with special educational needs, they may apply to the NCSE to have their SNA allocation reviewed and the NCSE has capacity to make additional allocations to schools.</p></reply>

As such, the governing authority of each institution is responsible for the day-to-day operational affairs, including conditions governing deferral of places. It would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the practice of individual institutions on deferrals. I would however say that individuals, for a variety of reasons and circumstances, consider deferring their courses. </p></reply>

In the case of receipts into the commercial bank accounts, these funds are transferred onwards at short intervals to the Exchequer account held in the Central Bank. While interest accrues on certain bank accounts operated by my Department the Department does not routinely hold money on deposit in commercial bank accounts nor does it hold money in short term bank investments. </p><p>  My Department operates a single interest bearing account in the Central Bank, to bring to account cash contributions from the religious congregations towards the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund.

These sums are held pending the establishment of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board and the transfer of these sums to the NTMA for deposit in the investment account to be established by the Agency pursuant to Section 29 of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act, 2012.

This process is based on ten undertakings committed to by the school's Patron in 2007 in accordance with the requirements of the Education Act 1998 and the Rules for National Schools.  My Department met with the school authorities in October last to discuss the school's current position in relation to the undertakings and with a view to enabling the school to meet the permanent recognition criteria as soon as possible. I understand substantial progress has been made, however, significant issues do remain to be resolved. In that regard, further correspondence has been received recently in respect of the school which are under consideration. It is important to note that the decision regarding full recognition depends upon the satisfactory implementation of all the undertakings.</p></reply>

The supplier, in effect, provides the full infrastructure required for all day-to-day office printing.  Research carried out by the National Procurement Service (NPS) has indicated that such an approach gives best value to the Irish public sector.</p><p>  The majority of public sector bodies currently have ad-hoc print arrangements in place.  A typical Government office has multiple print and imaging devices including photocopiers, scanners and faxes.  These devices can potentially come from a wide range of different suppliers with separate supply and servicing arrangements.   The ratio of print devices to staff is often in the region of 1:2 and in some cases as low as 1:1 where a large number of staff have their own desktop printer.  </p><p>  The MPS Framework Agreement offers all public sector bodies in the State access to a print solution that is strategic, cost efficient and that can be tailored to the specific needs of the individual organisation. Following an open competition, advertised on e-tenders and in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), the Framework Agreement for MPS was established on 8 February 2012. The Framework Agreement will be in place for two years, with an option to extend for a further two years.  The minimum turnover requirement for entry into the Framework was an average of &euro;10 million per annum for the three most recent years of audited accounts or where the date of establishment is more recent for each year the entity has been established.</p><p>  The value of the Framework Agreement over two years was estimated to be &euro;100 million. Taking into account the value of the Framework and the fact that suppliers are required to provide all of the print devices upfront, from their own resources, the view was taken by the NPS that the &euro;10 million minimum turnover requirement was proportionate.  Tenderers who did not have the required turnover in their own right were invited to partner with other entities to satisfy this requirement.  All of the Framework Members have operations in Ireland and provide local employment.   Four of the successful tenderers are indigenous small and medium enterprises (SMEs) (MJ Flood, Bryan S Ryan, Hibernian Business Equipment and Ergo). One of the tenderers did not have the required turnover in their own right to qualify for the Framework and formed an alliance with a large manufacturer to satisfy the turnover requirement.  Furthermore, the Framework Members have indicated in their tender submissions that they will use a further 11 indigenous SMEs in the delivery of MPS. </p><p>  Circular 6/12 specifies that the MPS Framework is mandatory from 1 September 2012.  However, it is important to note that this Framework is only mandatory where a public sector body opts for an MPS solution.  If a public sector body simply wishes to purchase a printer or a photocopier they do not have to use the MPS Framework. It is a matter for each public sector body to determine which route offers the best value for their organisation.</p></reply>

This includes new Oireachtas Members as defined in the Act.</p><p> - Under the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 2009, Ministerial pensions are no longer payable to sitting Members of the Oireachtas following the last general election, or to Members of the European Parliament	following the next elections to the Parliament.</p><p> - Public Service pensions for persons (including former Ministers and members of the Oireachtas) who retired after February 2012 are reduced in line with the substantial pay reductions applied across the Public Service under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts. For those who retired before the end of February the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) applies. I recently provided for an increase in the rate of PSPR that applies to pensions over &euro;100,000 to 20%.</p><p> - The Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012,  introduced a new Single Public Service Pension Scheme with a new minimum pension age of 66, rising in due course with the age at which the State Pension (Contributory) will become payable. This scheme will also apply to all new Members of the Oireachtas, including new entrant Ministers, as defined in the Act. The Act also provides pensions for all Public Servants who are subject to this Act to be based on career average earnings, as opposed to the current final salary basis.</p></reply>

The national arrangements put in place by the National Procurement Service (NPS) are designed to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money. The majority of the aggregated arrangements are not new and have been available to the public service for a number of years. In utilising the national contracts, public bodies are able to take advantage of the NPS&rsquo;s buying power and as a result can purchase supplies at competitive prices. This facilitates ongoing service delivery within tighter operating budgets.</p><p>  In relation to the potential impact of aggregated procurement arrangements, it is worth noting that such arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money and also facilitates SME access. While certain categories of goods and services may be suited to single supplier arrangements (e.g. electricity and gas), it should not be taken that single supplier frameworks are to be accepted as the norm. The greater use where appropriate of multi-supplier frameworks &ndash; for example the supply of managed print services - can address local supplier issues while also ensuring ongoing cost competitiveness of the framework itself. In order to facilitate SMEs, the NPS has encouraged tenderers who did not have the capability in their own right of providing goods and services nationally to partner with other entities to satisfy this requirement. Such multi-supplier frameworks can also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions. </p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS over the past 3 years has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  In 2012 the NPS, working with InterTradeIreland, for the first time brought together a number of the lead Government agencies to create a programme of major events for the Island of Ireland. Attendees could avail of educational seminars on a variety of topics ranging from the technicalities of public service procurement to procedures around consortia-building for SMEs.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,000 SMEs nationwide.  Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-06a.279.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020600106#WRE01700"><p>My Department promotes improved payment practices and monitors the operation of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997, and the Late Payment in Commercial Transactions Regulations 2002.  The European Communities (Late Payment in Commerial Transations) Regulations 2002 (SI No. 388 of 2002) repealed section 10 of the Prompt Payments of Accounts Act 1997.  The rate of late payment interest is now payable under Regulation 4 of this legislation.</p><p>The current penalty interest rate is the European Central Bank main refinancing rate plus 7 percentage points. The ECB rates in force on 1 January and 1 July apply for the following six months in each year. Only one rate will apply to a late payment - that is the rate in force on the payment date.  From the 1st January, 2013, the late payment interest rate is 7.75% per annum (that is based on the ECB rate of 0.75% plus the margin of 7%). That rate equates to a daily rate of 0.021%. Penalty interest due for late payments should be calculated on a daily basis.</p><p>As stated above, the issue of late payment is covered by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 388 of 2002).  Ireland must transpose the Recast of the Late Payment Directive (2011/7/EU) which repeals and modernises the old rules.  I signed the Statutory Instrument transposing Directive 2011/7/EU on 22 December 2012 and this will come into effect on 16 March 2013.</p><p>Details of Late Payment interest paid by my Department and the Agencies under its remit are listed below.  My   Department does not have responsibility for collecting information on late payment interest paid by other Departments and the statutory bodies under their remit.  The Deputy should contact the Government Departments directly in this regard.  As the Deputy is aware, it is a Government requirement that all central Government Departments, the local authorities and all other public sector bodies, (excluding commercial Semi-State bodies) pay their suppliers within 15 calendar days of receipt of a valid invoice. The latest set of quarterly composite figures published by my Department show that 98% of payments made by Government Departments, valued at &euro;1.25bn, were paid to suppliers within 15 days.</p><p>All Government Departments and Agencies are required to publish information in relation to the payment of late payment interest in their annual report.</p><p>Note*1   In the time available since this Question was tabled my Department has not been able to collect the extensive volume of information requested by the Deputy in respect of the 35 City and County Enterprise Boards. Once the available information is collated I will arrange for it to be forwarded to the Deputy.</p><p><table><tr><th>Department JEI and Agencies</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td>Department of Jobs, Enterprise &amp; Innovation</td><td>&#8364;5,019.46</td><td>&#8364;2,405.33</td><td>&#8364;878.43</td><td>&#8364;468.73</td><td>&#8364;188.06</td><td>&#8364;209.45</td></tr><tr><td>Competition Authority</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>&#8364;9.74</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland</td><td>Nil</td><td>&#8364;240.18</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>&#8364;514.48</td></tr><tr><td>Forf&aacute;s</td><td>&#8364;18.54</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>IDA</td><td>&#8364;950</td><td>&#8364;1,718</td><td>&#8364;194</td><td>&#8364;227</td><td>&#8364;283</td><td>&#8364;233</td></tr><tr><td>City and County Enterprise Boards</td><td>See note*1 above</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Health and Safety Authority (HSA)</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Shannon Development</td><td>&#8364;894</td><td>&#8364;2,644</td><td>&#8364;550</td><td>&#8364;1,660</td><td>&#8364;177</td><td>&#8364;108</td></tr><tr><td>National Consumer Agency</td><td>&#8364;7.83</td><td>1.61</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>&#8364;55.12</td><td>&#8364;781.28</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB)</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>&#8364;5,501</td><td>&#8364;735</td></tr><tr><td>National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI)</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>&#8364;45.46</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Labour Relations Commission</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>&#8364;166.66</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Auditing &amp; Accounting Supervisory Authority ((IAASA)</td><td>&#8364;17.97</td><td>&#8364;17.10</td><td>&#8364;32.93</td><td>Nil</td><td>&#8364;13.08</td><td>Nil</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In addition in my Department there is one re-appointed former Assistant Principal post sanctioned by the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform. This is in connection with Departmental issues associated with Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU. The reappointment is for the period 25/10/12 &ndash; 31/7/13 and is at the first point on the Assistant Principal pay scale of &euro;61,966 per annum (pro rata). The total cost to my Department for the period of the reappointment is &euro;51,856.69.  </p><p>  The above appointments were made on the basis of the relevant salary for the posts, with abatement as appropriate of public sector pensions in payment.  More generally, recruitment to my Department is undertaken by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) through competitions advertised in the public press save where, exceptionally, a business need exists to re-engage an individual with specialised skills, and sanction must be obtained in such cases from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as in the case with the Assistant Principal post referred to above.</p></reply>

These range from internships under JobBridge, work placements and training under T&uacute;s and community employment respectively and educational supports in the form of the back to education allowance and the back to enterprise allowance for those wishing to pursue self-employment options.  In general, all supports provided by the Department of Social Protection to enable a person to access these opportunities are predicated on that person being in receipt of one of a range of eligible payments from the Department.  A person not qualifying for a payment from the Department is unlikely to be eligible to access supports.  The same eligibility criteria do not apply in the case of a number of support measures provided by the Department of Education and Skills in respect of a person pursuing education and training opportunities.</p><p>  Intreo is a new service from this Department. It is a single point of contact for all employment and income supports and is designed to provide a more streamlined approach and is not determined by a person&rsquo;s welfare status.

There is no automatic entitlement to a payment.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  The Government has provided &euro;47.6m for the scheme in 2013.  </p><p>  A review of the guidelines on exceptional needs payments was carried out by the Department by a working group made up of former community welfare service staff. One of the recommendations emanating from this review is to address the different approaches taken, in different areas, in relation to the payment of exceptional needs payments in respect of religious ceremonies, mainly Communions and Confirmations, and to ensure that the SWA scheme is responding to financial need and not occasions.  For 2013, the Department has recommended that payment of the allowance specifically in respect of religious ceremonies will cease. Applications can continue to be made under the scheme for assistance with child clothing. This measure will ensure that the ENP scheme will continue to respond to specific need and not to the occasion </p><p>  This recommendation does not affect the discretion available to officers administering the scheme in issuing an ENP to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise. Persons who consider that they have an entitlement to an ENP under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme should contact the local officials administering the scheme.</p></reply>

The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is delivered through a combination of SEAI appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage and via an area based approach.  Measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation and are free of charge to the customer.</p><p>  The Better Energy Warmer Homes programme is an important element of the Affordable Energy Strategy that was launched in November 2011.  The energy efficiency measures are targeted at low income families and will make a lasting impact on households experiencing energy poverty.  Exchequer funding of over &#8364;101 million has been allocated to the programme since 2000, which has successfully delivered energy efficiency measures to 92,563 homes.  In 2012 the programme delivered energy saving measures to 12,175 homes.  Despite the current economic challenges, the Government is committed to continuing to deliver energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme has been allocated Exchequer funding of &#8364;20 million for 2013, and according to the most up to date analysis available to date, it is anticipated that the scheme will deliver upgrades to approximately 12,000 homes this year.</p><p>  The SEAI currently has 7,700 applications on hand which predate the application referred to by the Deputy.  The SEAI anticipates that it will take 9 months to clear the existing waiting list and address the property in question. Queries in relation to individual applications are an operational matter for the SEAI and a dedicated hotline can be reached at 1800 250 204.  In addition, the SEAI has established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members, which can be sent to    and will be dealt with promptly.</p></reply>

It is a matter for the tenant and landlord to agree the terms and conditions of a lease or tenancy agreement consistent with the Act and I do not propose to vary this arrangement. </p><p>  On foot of the commitment in the <i>Programme for Government 2011</i> to introduce a tenancy deposit protection scheme I asked the Private Residential Tenancies Board   (PRTB) to commission research on such a scheme and to report back to me with recommendations.

There can be no question of allowing any person to use the title of architect unless he/she is registered to do so. </p><p>  The arrangements for the registration of Architects are addressed under Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007. The Act provides routes to registration that are open, transparent and fair for potential candidates from a variety of backgrounds including those who are practically trained and have limited or no academic training or qualifications. </p><p>Section 22 of the Act 2007 already provides a route towards registration for longstanding practitioners who had been providing architectural services in Ireland , commensurate with those understood as being provided by Architects for the purposes of the Act ,   for a period of ten years at the time the Act became law. This provision is transitional in nature and enables this category of persons who may not have any formal academic training, qualifications or certification to become registered once they have been assessed as eligible for registration by the Technical Assessment Board in accordance with the practical experience assessment procedure. </p><p>  In addition, Section 14(f) provides a permanent route to registration for practically trained persons who have 7 years appropriate practical experience and who have passed the prescribed register examination. I am satisfied that the statutory arrangements for registration that are currently in place are appropriate and there are no proposals to amend the Act under consideration by my Department. I would encourage all practically trained persons to pursue the routes to registration which are currently open to them with a view to joining the small but growing numbers of practically trained architects already on the register.</p></reply>

The housing authority is responsible for payment of the rent to the landlord and the landlord is contractually obliged to maintain the property in good condition and deal with any repair issues in a timely manner.

The Government&#8217;s approach to radon, which is similar to that of the majority of EU Member States, is to concentrate efforts on increasing public awareness of the risks posed by radon in the home. Through support for the RPII&#8217;s radon advice and awareness work, my Department is supporting efforts to raise public awareness of the risks posed by radon, particularly in the home. Householders, particularly those in known high radon areas, have been strongly encouraged to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake remediation works where necessary . Since 1998 the Building Regulations require all new buildings to incorporate radon protection measures at the time of construction.</p><p>  Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by my Department, <i>Radon in Buildings - Corrective Options</i> , which is also available on my Department&#8217;s website. The RPII has also issued guidance, <i>Understanding Radon Remediation - A Householders Guide</i> , which is available on the Institute&#8217;s website at    , together with a list of companies who can provide a radon remediation service and offer specific advice and recommendations. In addition, the RPII can be contacted for radon advice on freephone 1800 300 600.</p><p>  An Inter-Agency Group, established in September 2011 under the leadership of my Department, has been tasked to develop a National Integrated Strategy for Radon Control. As part of this process, some potential approaches to addressing the radon issue have been developed, and these are currently the subject of a public consultation process. Further information on this process is available on my Department's website at  . The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides the legislative basis for the Household Charge. Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date is liable to pay the Household Charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. The Act does not include a waiver or exemption in connection with radon gas. The Household Charge operated during 2012 and is replaced by the Local Property Tax in 2013.</p></reply>

These provisions introduced a new standard procedure for assessing applicants for social housing in every housing authority. </p><p>  One of the important provisions of the new regulations is that a household may only apply to one housing authority for the purpose of determining whether or not they have a housing need. The idea behind the new arrangements is to streamline the process of applying for social housing support, both for the applicant and the local authority, while at the same time allowing a reasonable level of choice to households as to the areas in which they would like to receive social housing support. There is no provision in the regulations allowing applications to be transferred to a different local authority without having to make a new application. </p><p>However, under the regulations, a household may apply to the housing authority for the functional area:</p><p>-  where it normally resides &ndash; this would include a household residing in rented accommodation, or </p><p>-  where it has a local connection.</p><p>  A household may then specify up to three areas of choice in any housing authority in the county. At least one of these choices must be in the functional area of the housing authority of application. Therefore, a household living in, or having a local connection with, a town council area may make a single application to that town council for housing support in the town but on that application may also express its choice to live in areas within the wider administrative county council area. Alternatively, a household living in, or having a local connection with, the county area may choose to apply to the county council, but also express areas of choi ce within the town council boundaries in the county. Eligible households will appear on the waiting lists of each of the authorities where they have expressed areas of choice.</p></reply>

By comparison with other similar jurisdictions this is still a high number. By way of comparison, there are 83 police stations in Northern Ireland for its population of 1.4 million and 340 stations in Scotland for its population of 5.2 million. In the London Metropolitan area, 66 police stations are due to close, leaving 73 police stations open to the public.</p><p>  Each year the Commissioner prepares a Policing Plan which outlines his proposals for providing the policing service in the country for the following year. Among other things, these plans must include any proposals he has for the re-organisation of the Divisional or Regional network together with any plans he has for the closure of a Garda station. The plans for 2014 and 2015 have not yet been prepared, however, from discussions with the Garda Commissioner I understand that the current consolidation process will be largely completed by the end of this year and it seems unlikely at this point in time that there will be any further station closures in 2014 and 2015. The delivery of the most effective policing service possible to the public will of course remain the objective of future policing plans. It will be for the Garda Commissioner, using his professional judgement, to formulate such proposals, and he will continue to have my support in seeking to maximise the number of Garda&iacute; on active frontline duty, preventing and detecting crime right across the country.</p></reply>

The Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI who are responsible for operational policing co-operation have repeatedly emphasised that the close and high quality co-operation between their forces has been instrumental in preventing attacks, combating criminality and saving lives. Notably, the two police forces operate a joint Cross Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island.  All of these are important elements in enabling the two forces to work more effectively together in tackling crime and promoting community safety for all communities on this island.</p><p>  The Cross Border Policing Strategy includes sections dealing with Operations, Cross-border Investigations, Intelligence-sharing and Security, Information and Communications Technology, Training, Human Resources, and Emergency Planning and both Forces are jointly engaged in developing initiatives in these areas.  I would point out also that the Strategy recognises the value of interagency co-operation in certain areas.  The two Police Services work closely with the Customs Services North and South and with other relevant law enforcement agencies in combatting cross-border organised crime and have had a number of significant successes in disrupting fuel smuggling and tobacco fraud activities.  There is also proactive co-operation with the Irish and British immigration services in managing the Common Travel Area on the island of Ireland. The Cross Border Policing Strategy is a positive and dynamic step in further enhancing and developing joint efforts between the police services on this island to address the common policing challenges which crime presents and, thereby, to underpin efforts to improve community safety.</p></reply>

It is important to remember that while some Garda stations are listed for revised opening hours from 24 hour stations, they will remain as functioning Garda stations on a 24 hour basis. The full list of these details is available in the Policing Plan which is available in the Oireachtas Library and on the Garda web site.</p><p>  The Commissioner has concluded that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front-line if particular stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained or if the public opening hours of other stations could be reduced at off-peak times. He has given a commitment that where a station is to be closed local Garda management will consult with local communities on the alternative policing arrangements to be put in place in their area</p><p>  Furthermore, the Garda Commissioner has indicated he is confident that the implementation of the restructuring proposals contained in the 2013 Policing Plan will not lead to any diminution in the service provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In that regard he has stated that the revised structures will continue to support the Garda community philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs. This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of enhanced patrolling arrangements which, in turn, will provide increased Garda visibility as well as maintaining existing Garda links with communities throughout the country. I fully support the Commissioner in these actions and decisions.</p></reply>

The Deputy will also be aware that judges are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.</p><p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the primary objective for the Service is to maintain the delivery of front line court sittings and services.  The Service continuously works to support the judiciary and assist in ensuring that cases are dealt with as effectively and as speedily as possible.  Available resources and operational and organisational structures are under ongoing review to ensure that resources are targeted and focussed on keeping waiting times in the provision of services to a minimum.</p><p>  Waiting times in the Circuit and District Courts vary from venue to venue based on the number and complexity of cases.  The Presidents of the various courts are determined to achieve improvements in waiting times and they are working with the Courts Service to target judicial resources at the areas with longest waiting times. It should be noted, for example, that in 2011 there were 674 weeks of Circuit Court sittings in venues outside Dublin. This increased to 767 weeks in 2012 and the President of the Circuit Court plans to increase capacity to 888 weeks during 2013, a 30% increase over 2011. The additional weeks will be provided across crime, family law and civil matters.  Arrangements are underway to appoint a small new cadre of specialist judges of the Circuit Court to deal with the new work arising as a result of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012. The President of the District Court is also concentrating judicial resources in the areas of greatest need and is currently considering the allocation of additional judicial resources to the hearing of Family Law cases to address delays in this area.</p><p>  The President of the High Court keeps waiting times under continuous review and has introduced a number of initiatives such as reorganising sittings of the High Court outside Dublin and arranging for additional court sittings during court recesses to reduce waiting times. In addition, the delegation to court officials of administrative functions previously dealt with by High Court judges has increased judicial availability for trial work. These initiatives continue to be reviewed and expanded. While the waiting time for asylum pre-leave applications is high, the allocation of more judges and, particularly, more research support for judges has helped to reduce the waiting time for post-leave applications to its lowest level in over two years. The Courts Service has also advised that despite significant pressure the waiting times in the High Court lists have generally reduced considerably.</p><p>  The Supreme Court, however, continues to experience lengthy waiting times of up to 40 months at present.  Waiting times for priority cases are at 9 months at present.  Although considerable efforts are being made to manage the waiting times, the issue of capacity in the Supreme Court can only be fully resolved through the establishment of a Court of Appeal. The Government is committed to the holding of a Constitutional referendum on Article 34 which is necessary to achieve this and work has commenced in my Department in this regard. </p></reply>

In counteracting these groups and their activities An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na undertake a range of targeted activities designed to disrupt and dismantle their activities. In doing so, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na co-operate seamlessly with their counterparts in Northern Ireland. The Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland have repeatedly emphasised to me that the close, high quality co-operation between their forces has been instrumental in preventing attacks, combating criminality and saving lives. The two police forces operate a joint Cross Border Policing Strategy that includes initiatives on intelligence-sharing and security to enhance co-ordinated efforts to combat the threat from such groups.</p><p>  At the broader international level, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na actively contribute to international law enforcement efforts in tackling serious cross border criminality through, for example,  initiatives co-ordinated by Europol and Interpol.  Ireland also participates very constructively in the negotiation of initiatives and legislative instruments at European level to strengthen police and judicial cooperation,  and continues to promote European advancements in this area under its Presidency.</p><p>  I can also assure the House that I am committed to ensuring that the necessary legislative provisions are in place to give effect to our international commitments  in this area and to support the operational actions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. By way of example, I am currently preparing an amendment to the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 which will provide for the transposition into Irish law of EU and Council of Europe instruments on combating terrorism. The new Bill will create the three new offences of public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-06a.465.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013020600109#WRH02600"><p>I wish to inform the Deputy that the provision of legal aid falls within two separate categories, i.e. civil legal aid and criminal legal aid.  Details in respect of each category are as follows:</p><p><b><i>Civil Legal Aid</i></b></p><p>  State funding of &#8364;32.9 million was allocated to the Legal Aid Board in 2012 and this level of funding has been maintained for this year. This covers funding for civil legal aid and advice, including legal services for asylum seekers, and also funding for the provision of the Family Mediation Service, for which the Board assumed responsibility in late 2011. There has been a significant increase in demand for civil legal aid services in recent years, with a much greater number of people financially eligible as a result of the economic downturn.  Unfortunately, the deterioration in public finances in recent years has meant that it has not been possible to allocate further resources to the Board to meet the increased demand.  As a result, the waiting times to access services have lengthened somewhat.</p><p>  In view of the substantial demand for civil legal aid and the associated waiting times, the Legal Aid Board is focusing on maximising the effectiveness of the resources available to it to deliver a meaningful service. Amongst the measures taken recently to this end are initiatives to increase the use of mediation to resolve family disputes, which leads to reduced legal costs, and the introduction of a 'triage' service to ensure that clients receive initial legal advice within one month of making an application for legal services. The Board is also striving to make its law centre network as effective and efficient as possible and the recent introduction of a new legal case management system will help in this regard. I should also point out that the Board introduced new conditions for retaining barristers in August 2012 which will result in lower fees paid to barristers in cases where they are instructed by Legal Aid Board solicitors.</p><p><b><i>Criminal Legal Aid</i></b></p><p>  There are no waiting lists associated with the granting or processing of criminal legal aid.  As the Deputy may be aware, under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the judiciary are responsible for the granting of criminal legal aid.  The nature of the Scheme is that it is demand-led, driven by the incidence of crime, detection rates and prosecutions of cases through the courts systems. This makes it difficult to anticipate and control costs. A number of measures have been taken however since I took office including a reduction of 10% in the fees payable.  A reduction of 50% was also applied to payments in respect of adjourned sentence hearings and travel and subsistence.  Following these and other measures introduced in the course of 2011, a 10% reduction in total expenditure was recorded in 2012 compared with 2011 which is the first substantial reduction ever recorded under this Scheme.</p><p>  In addition, the Working Group on Efficiencies in the Circuit and District Courts has been pursuing initiatives which can contribute to achieving efficiencies and cost reductions in the system such as, for example, introducing a pilot programme centralising custody cases in four court Districts and the introduction of the pre-trial procedure for criminal trials in the Dublin, Midland and South Eastern Circuits.</p><p>  Finally, a new Legal Aid Bill is planned to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  I hope it will be possible to publish the Bill during the course of this year.</p></reply>

Specifically, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Policing Plan 2013 sets out key actions aimed at tackling organised crime, with a continued focus on drug trafficking, and identifying and targeting organised crime gangs through pro-active, intelligence based operations. The determination with which the Garda&iacute; are putting this Plan into effect is clear from the extent of the Garda operations launched against criminal gangs.</p><p>  Organised crime needs to be combatted by disrupting and prosecuting those involved in its operations, and especially the drugs trade which is at the heart of much of its profits. Substantial efforts by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Customs are therefore devoted to counteracting this form of crime.  A wide range of legislative powers are in place to support the investigation and detection of serious crime, including through covert surveillance, and very serious penalties have been introduced for firearms and organised crime offences.  Furthermore, I have made it clear to the Garda Commissioner that if he feels there are other legislative measures which might be taken in this area I will look at that very positively.</p><p>  Despite the constraints on public finances, substantial Garda resources remain in place and these must be seen in the context of the programme of real reform which is being delivered in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Croke Park Agreement. Fundamentally, the objective of the present reforms is to maximise the time that our well-trained and highly skilled Garda&iacute; spend on operational duties. The Garda Commissioner continues to have my full support in the steps he is taking to tackle organised crime and to bring those involved to justice.</p></reply>

Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven and special initiatives have been implemented in each Garda Region to target suspect offenders.  I am informed that as of 31 January 2013, 3,903 persons have been arrested and 2,142 persons have been charged with burglary offences under Operation Fiacla.</p><p>  Operation Fiacla is the subject of regular monitoring and review by senior Garda management and is focused on identifying and targeting gangs involved in burglaries around the country so as to disrupt their activities and bring them before the Courts.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also places great emphasis on the importance of community partnerships such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch, in preventing and detecting crime, and maintaining a safe environment for everyone.  Garda&iacute; continue to invest time and energy in these partnerships and relationships to the benefit of all. I have also strongly supported the Garda Commissioner in the introduction of real reform, such as the piloting of new rosters, the closure of under-utilised stations and the consequent freeing-up of Garda&iacute; for operational duties, and the merger of Garda Districts which will bring about much greater administrative efficiency.  These reforms are vital to ensure that the best use is made of Garda resources and that the most efficient and effective policing service is delivered to the public<b><font color="#000080">.</font></b></p></reply>

The Garda authorities monitor these and all other crime trends carefully and the Garda Commissioner is deploying the substantial resources available to him in a targeted approach to confront those engaged in burglaries, in particular through Operation Fiacla. This Operation is the subject of regular monitoring and review by senior Garda management and is focused on identifying and targeting gangs involved in burglaries around the country so as to disrupt their activities and bring them before the Courts.  I am informed that as of 31 January 2013, 3,903 persons have been arrested and 2,142 persons have been charged with burglary offences under Operation Fiacla.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Garda National Crime Prevention Unit (NCPU) and Crime Prevention Officers at divisional level provide advice, information and support to organisations, businesses and individuals aimed at reducing burglary crime and the opportunity to commit burglary. These specially trained officers are skilled at identifying environmental design risks and provide advice on what mitigating action can be taken to reduce opportunities to commit burglary and other property crime.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also works closely with Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch and other local groups with a view to providing support and assistance in crime prevention.</p><p>  Insofar as the particular statistics sought by the Deputy are concerned, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.

In the circumstances set out in the Deputy's Question, the Irish national and her non-EEA national partner must demonstrate that they are in a relationship for two or more years to quality for defacto status. If granted this would give the non-EEA national the right to work in the State without a work permit.</p><p>  Similar to immigration systems worldwide, public policy in respect of rights of residence and access to the labour market is formulated taking into account the prevailing economic and labour market conditions which in the case of Ireland remain extremely challenging. Therefore, in circumstances where unemployment remains high, together with the need to maintain the integrity of the immigration system, the qualifying criteria for a Defacto partnership is necessary to ensure that the granting of defacto status is only given to persons who are in a genuine and subsisting relationship. The absence of such criteria would create conditions where immigration controls could be easily evaded. This would do a great disservice to all genuine applicants, which I have no doubt would include the persons referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that the immigration service makes every effort to facilitate the defacto family to live together; however, for the reasons outlined the granting of defacto status must be subject to criteria and conditions. I believe these are appropriate and fair, particularly when considered in the context of the right to work in the State without a work permit which the granting of such status extends. Any other system would be amenable to abuse and would place unsustainable pressures on the employment and related welfare systems. </p></reply>

I should emphasise that the certificate is a disclosure to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued. Each time a new vetting application is received, new and full vetting checks are conducted. This is to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. The non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the certificate protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting system.

The Deputy will be aware that following the publication of the Inspector's Report in October last year, I published the Irish Prison Service's Action plan for implementing the Inspector's recommendations.</p><p>  A new prisoner complaints procedure was introduced with effect from the 1 November 2012. All complaints made by prisoners alleging serious ill treatment, use of excessive force, serious intimidation/discrimination or threats by a member of staff of the Irish Prison Service, are now investigated by an independent investigator. In addition, a number of the new investigators have been appointed to carry out an examination of historical complaints in St Patrick's Institution, including those referred to by the Inspector in his report<font color="#004080"> </font>and following an initial review , 8 cases are being further examined.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that should breaches of discipline be found to have occurred, disciplinary action will be initiated under the Prison (Disciplinary Code for Officers) Rules, 1996. The Deputy will also be aware that the Government committed, in the Programme for Government, to ending the practice of sending children to St. Patrick's Institution. The practice of sending 16 year old boys to St Patrick&#8217;s ceased on 1st May, 2012. The detention of all children in St. Patrick&#8217;s Institution will end with the provision of more appropriate accommodation and regimes in the new detention facility at Oberstown by mid-2014. As part of the Irish Prison Service 3-Year Strategic Plan 2012-2015 the Prison Service is devising a specific strategy for the management of young offenders, working with its partners and other agencies to ensure that the regime for young offenders is age appropriate and that best practise is observed. As part of this strategy the Prison Service will also review the overall approach taken to the placement of 18-21 year olds, in line with my intention to introduce primary legislation for the purpose of closing St. Patrick's Institution as a detention centre for persons aged 21 and under. </p></reply>

Training will also be provided in international humanitarian law, the protection of civilians and human rights. It is envisaged that the training component of the mission will be made up of approximately 250 personnel, and this will be further supplemented by additional troops who will be deployed to provide force protection.   The Council has tasked the Mission Commander, General Fran&ccedil;ois Lecointre, with preparations for the early launch of the mission and to this end force generation for the mission is currently ongoing at EU level. All Member States have been invited by the Mission Commander to provide contributions to the mission.  The mission will be conducted at the invitation of the Malian Government and in close coordination with the UN, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and other key partners.</p><p>  Ireland is currently considering the provision of a small number of Defence Forces personnel to the mission.

The Marine Institute is responsible for monitoring shellfish for the presence of naturally occurring phytoplankton toxins. Toxicity can occur at any time during the year and the periods of closure can vary considerably from year-to-year. The monitoring programme is designed to detect toxicity in shellfish growing areas before harvesting, thereby providing the necessary information to restrict the placement of toxic shellfish on the market. Regulatory controls, which are enforced by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, exist to support these restrictions. </p><p>  Cromane Bay has been on a closed biotoxin status on an almost continuous basis since July 2012 for azaspiracid toxins, with levels of azaspiracids detected occasionally up to 9 times the regulatory limit. Azaspiracid shellfish poisoning can cause diarrhoea, nausea, headaches and chills.  I am advised that the azaspiracid toxicity event is expected to pass in the near future.</p><p>  I am aware of the difficulties that these naturally occurring toxicity events cause for shellfish fishermen and aquaculture operators.  I understand that mussel farmers in Cromane have been unable to bring their product to market because of this toxicity event, but the State controls are there to protect public health and indeed the international reputation of Irish seafood thereby ensuring the future of this important sector.  </p><p>  While there are no specific funds available for operators affected by these natural occurring events, which are an inevitable occasional feature of operating aquaculture farms in Irish coastal waters, a range of financial support measures co-funded by the European Fisheries Fund are available to the seafood sector through the Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013.</p></reply>

This Government is changing that. The Special Delivery Unit is now dealing with the issue of outpatient waiting lists on my instruction, with the assistance of the NTPF.</p><p>  Work has commenced on the systematic and automatic collection of waiting time data at an individual patient level, in a standardised format, from all hospitals providing an outpatient service. This will be the first time that such detailed data will be available at a national level from all hospitals. The collection and analysis of outpatient waiting time data will allow the SDU and the NTPF to address issues at regional, hospital, speciality and consultant levels.  The Special Delivery Unit and NTPF recently published the first set of validated outpatient waiting time data, on www.ptr.ie. Published data is broken down by region and by hospital.</p><p>  The target maximum waiting time for a first outpatient appointment in 2013 is that no patient should be waiting more than 12 months by the end of November.  Hospitals will be held responsible and accountable for ensuring that patients are seen in outpatient departments within this maximum waiting time. The Special Delivery Unit and the NTPF will assist hospitals in targeting their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen, assessed and appropriately treated.  In parallel with reducing the numbers of those waiting longest, the Special Delivery Unit will also commence work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen by the right health professional at the right time.</p><p>  The goal of the measures outlined above is to improve access by implementing an Outpatient Service Performance Improvement Programme that will underpin a radical transformation of how outpatient services are delivered in Ireland.</p><p>  I have arranged for the question to be forwarded to the HSE, who will respond directly to the Deputy in relation the particular case referred to the Deputy's question. </p></reply>

The population of Ireland has grown very rapidly in recent years, and the 2011 Census confirms a continuation of this trend, though at a more moderate pace. Furthermore, the distribution of the population across age groups is also changing with numbers in the older age groups growing in absolute terms but also representing a higher proportion of the total population. At the other end of the age spectrum, Ireland has experienced high rates of fertility by EU standards for many years and this continues to be the case. </p><p>  The Governments acknowledges the financial pressures caused by changing demography, and &euro;90m has been allocated in the current year to mitigate the effect of these pressures within the health sector. This will be applied against a range of cost pressures which are detailed in Appendix 1 of the HSE's National Service Plan 2013 which is available on their website.</p></reply>

This was in response to budgetary and service issues in relation to Galway and the movement of services between Roscommon and Portiuncula hospital in line with the principles of the smaller hospitals framework, that service should be delivered as close to a person&rsquo;s home as possible. This is commensurate with the need to ensure quality and safety in service delivery such that more complex work generally needs to be carried out in larger hospitals. The Group consists of University College Hospital, Galway, Merlin Park Hospital, Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe and Roscommon Hospital.  The Group was established on a co-operative, administrative basis as significant legislative work is required to allow hospitals to form Hospital Trusts.  </p><p>  In June 2012 I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups. A Project Team was tasked with developing criteria to assist my Department in the development of policy in relation to the composition of hospital groups, governance arrangements, current management frameworks and linkages to academic institutions.  The Team carried out a comprehensive consultation process with all acute hospitals and other health service agencies as well as reviewing a significant number of written submissions. The experiences of both the Galway/Roscommon University Hospital Group and of the Mid-Western Hospital Group, which were related to the project team as part of that consultation process, were both useful and informative.</p><p>  Work is nearing completion on the draft report on the wider issue of hospital groups.  Prof. John Higgins will submit that report to me in early February; I will then bring it to Cabinet for decision. The Government will then decide on the initial make up of hospital groups which will be established on an administrative basis pending the legislation required to set up hospital trusts by 2015. Before those trusts are established the composition and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed. As such I cannot comment at this time on the final composition of the new Hospital Groups.</p><p>  The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients. Under the Programme for Government 2011-2016, the Government committed to developing a universal, single-tier health service, which guarantees access to medical care based on need, not income.  On foot of this commitment the Government will introduce a system of Universal Health Insurance (UHI).  The development of independent not-for-profit hospital trusts is a key stepping stone to this new system.</p><p>  Each Hospital Group will have a single consolidated management team with responsibility for performance and outcomes.  It is intended that non-executive Boards, consisting of persons with expertise in key competencies such as clinical/business/legal/medical academic/patient advocacy, will oversee each Hospital Group management team and will have responsibility for decisions in relation to services in all hospitals in the Group.  The Galway/Roscommon University Hospital Group has gone some way towards realising the governance arrangement which will be recommended by the Report with the appointment of Mr. Noel Daly as chairperson of the Board in May 2012.  Mr. Daly is former Chief Executive of An Bord Altranais and he has also served in senior management posts in the health services in Ireland and in the UK.</p><p>  On 29th January 2013 the HSE established an interim Board on an administrative non-statutory basis, pending the establishment of Hospital Trusts to manage public hospitals in line with the Government's programme for reform of the health service. The competencies of the individuals appointed are the key to better management of hospitals and it was on this basis that the interim Board appointments were made. No meeting of the Board has yet taken place. The interim Board will be replaced in due course by a Trust Board on a statutory basis and may be dissolved and reconstituted at any time to facilitate the development of Hospital Trusts.</p></reply>

It is intended that services will be provided by a team of nurses and consultant neurologists working as a virtual national network supporting all acute and primary care locations. Rapid Access Clinics (separate to the Epilepsy Monitoring Units) have been developed at four of centres so far, and 10.5 (WTE) Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANPs) have been recruited to lead these clinics, so that a total of 12 ANPs are now in place across the four centres. </p><p>  Regarding the Epilepsy Monitoring Units in CUH and Beaumont, these when open will increase pre-surgical evaluation capacity. Monitoring is required for the most vulnerable patients with the worst effects of epilepsy and their development is therefore a priority for the Programme. Patients at these units will require 24/7 care and the staffing requirements to enable the units to be safely opened have been identified.  </p><p>  With regard to Beaumont, the HSE has advised that Beaumont Hospital and the HSE are working jointly to fill the posts necessary to support the service development. I am advised that the staffing required for the unit includes five staff nurses, one consultant neurophysiologist and three technicians. Of these, three staff nurse posts and one technician post remain to be recruited and I am informed that this is being prioritised. The recruitment of nursing personnel is a key element to facilitate phased opening of the unit as nursing staff come into post.  </p><p>  With regard to Cork, the HSE has advised that the Service Plan for 2013 for CUH is being drawn up currently and will be finalised in the coming weeks, and that the provision of additional staff for the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit is being considered as part of that process.</p></reply>

Consequently, the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has developed a range of initiatives aimed specifically at supporting young people who are suicidal and also supporting their peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts.</p><p>  Key initiatives progressed by the NOSP in 2012 include<b><i></i></b>the<b></b>provision of a wide range of awareness and training programmes including safeTALK and ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Training) which trains participants to become more alert to the possibility of suicide in their community, the continuation of the National Awareness Campaigns which, last year, specifically targeted men and young men, the funding of partner agencies and projects, a number of which provide support services to young people, and the development of Guidance for Post Primary Schools on Mental Health &amp; Suicide Prevention developed with the Department of Education and Skills which was launched last week.</p><p>  The annual budget for suicide prevention has increased this year to over &#8364;13m, of which &#8364;8.1m is available to NOSP to fund voluntary and statutory agencies delivering services in the area of prevention, intervention, postvention and research and the remaining &#8364;5m is available regionally to fund Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives. The Department of Health is currently in discussions with the NOSP to develop a programme of measures that will reduce the tragic loss of life through suicide.  The implementation of the recommendations contained in the <i>Young Men and Suicide Project Report </i>  will be considered in the context of those discussions.</p></reply>

There were a number of meetings between the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner, representatives from my Department, the HSE, and the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street which resulted in agreement that NSCs older than 10 years would be destroyed. Retention of NSCs for ten years was deemed appropriate for the purposes of checking an initial diagnosis.</p><p>  I requested the HSE to conduct a review of this decision. This review examined both the legal and ethical basis for the retention of NSCs and the potential use of the existing cards for research purposes. The Review Group report and recommendations were submitted to me in January 2012. Having carefully considered the issue, I accepted the recommendation of the review group that in order to meet our legal and ethical obligations, particularly in relation to the Data Protection Acts, NSCs older than ten years will be destroyed. The review group also explored how the material could be made available to the research community in a way which was compatible with our ethical and legal obligations.</p><p>   However, I recognise the potential value of the material for research purposes. As deputies are aware, the HSE has begun an information campaign offering members of the public the opportunity to have their NSC returned to them prior to any destruction of the cards taking place. This will ensure that anyone who wishes to donate their or their child's Newborn Screening Card to research will be afforded the opportunity to do so. The HSE is actively engaging with the research community to facilitate the direct transfer of cards where this may be more convenient for parents. To this end, the HSE has contacted a number of research organisations to inform them of this position and has invited these organisations to provide a plan setting out a governance system for the storage and future use of the card or cards for clinical or research purposes, prior to any agreed transfer.  I consider that the people to whom the NSCs relate, or their parents if they are under 18 years of age, are the people who should choose what happens to their cards. I am confident that the approach adopted by the HSE will ensure that their choices will be respected.</p></reply>

However such arrangements involve certain additional costs, such as a fee to the agency concerned as well as Value-Added Tax (VAT) at 22%.   As such, health service management must tightly control the extent to which agency staff are used, particularly to substitute for staff who have left the health service, given the requirement to reduce employment levels to a net 98,955 wholetime equivalents by the end of 2013.</p><p>  The HSE's National Service Plan 2013 notes that considerable savings have to be achieved from changes to the manner in which staff are deployed, with tight control of the use of higher-cost staffing arrangements and in particular the use of agency staffing and overtime. The Plan includes a target saving of &euro;10m set against the recruitment of graduate nurses to directly offset spend on agency and overtime. It also recognises the need for systematic reviews of rosters and a focused approach to addressing staff absenteeism and implementing revised new sick leave arrangements.</p></reply>
