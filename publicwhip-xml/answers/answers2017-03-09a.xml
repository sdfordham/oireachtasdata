    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-09a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017030900062#WRA00600"><p>The Green, Low-Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) has a maximum annual payment of &euro;5,000 under the general scheme with provision for payment up to &euro;7,000 (known as GLAS+) where the farmer is required to give exceptional environmental commitments in a limited number of cases.  Applications under the first two tranches of the GLAS scheme resulted in almost 38,000 farmers being approved into the scheme in its first year of implementation which represented an unprecedented level of interest in the first year of an agri-environment scheme.  A further, just under 14,000 applications, were received under GLAS 3 which closed in mid-December last.  Approvals have now issued in respect of over 90% of these applications, with the remaining applications currently being examined by the Department with a view to issuing further approvals where appropriate.  This will bring the overall participation levels in GLAS to well over the targeted participation level of 50,000 farmers.</p><p>Under the EU Regulations governing GLAS and the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS) a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue.  </p><p>My Department as the accredited Paying Agency must ensure that, before payment issues, everything in an application that can be checked is checked as required under the regulations.  Therefore, payments can only issue where all the required validation checks have been successfully passed. </p><p>2016 payments represent the first full year of payment under GLAS.  At the end of December 2016, there were approximately 37,500 active participants in the GLAS scheme, of which 27,400 or over 71% received payments valued at over &euro;97m, representing 85% of their 2016 payment.</p><p>As issues with outstanding GLAS cases are resolved they are being paid in weekly payment runs.  Further payments are issuing on a weekly basis with payments valued at over &euro;110m now issued and over 84% of participants now paid.  Further payments are issuing on a weekly basis.</p><p>Currently some 25,578 farmers are active GLAS 1 and a further 11,577 are active in GLAS 2 of which 21,686 in GLAS 1 and 9,524 in GLAS 2, have successfully completed the GLAS prepayment checks in respect of the 2016 scheme year and a first payment instalment of 85% has issued. </p><p>The current position is that 3832 farmers in GLAS 1 and 2,053 farmers in GLAS 2 have yet to receive their payment and their applications continue to be processed to payment stage, where appropriate.</p><p>Outstanding payments under both GLAS 1 and GLAS 2 are largely delayed due to declaration of incompatible parcel usage on the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) application for a chosen GLAS action; changes in parcel boundaries on which a GLAS action is chosen including splitting or merging of parcels; an applicant no longer claiming a parcel on their 2016 BPS; incomplete documentation such as incorrect information on Low-Emission Slurry Declaration forms, incomplete interim commonage management plans and incompatible data and parcel history on Department databases.</p><p>Payments under the Scheme will continue to issue on an ongoing basis as issues are resolved and cases are cleared for payment. </p><p><b></b>I am well aware of the need to process all 2016 payments without delay and are ensuring that all resources required both on the I.T. and administrative side are directed towards resolving the outstanding queries on these cases.  </p><p>In relation to the online application system for GLAS, I would point out that it will in fact be a mandatory regulatory requirement under the governing regulations from the 2018 claim year onward to have on online system.  The Department launched an ambitious development programme to move to an online application and payment processing system for the GLAS scheme.  Compared to our closest neighbours, where farmer interest in agri-environment schemes is also very strong, this is a significant achievement as these areas remain in the early stages of approving applications. </p><p>In the context of the recently launched consultation process on the future of the CAP it is in Ireland&rsquo;s interests that we have a fully developed robust electronic processing and payment system that will give the necessary assurances that disbursement of EU funds is managed to the highest standards.  Not only will this act as a protection against potential disallowances in this programming period but will also serve to strengthen our position in negotiating funding for a future agri-environment Scheme in the next programming period.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-09a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017030900062#WRA00900"><p>The Irish food and drink sector has recorded seven consecutive years of export growth, passing the &euro;11 billion mark in 2016.  The strongest performers last year were dairy, pigmeat, sheepmeat, beverages and prepared foods.  While export markets look set to remain challenging in this year, amid some market uncertainty, the pickup in dairy demand is expected to continue while further opportunities are likely in beverages.  </p>  <p>  International markets led the growth in exports in 2016, contributing over 80% of total growth in exports and rising by an estimated 13% to just under &euro;3.5 billion or 31% of exports.  International trade in 2016 was led by stronger exports of dairy, beverages, prepared foods, pigmeat and beef.  Overall, international exports were driven notably by the US, where exports increased by 23% to &euro;955 million and China which recorded an increase of 35% driven principally by dairy and pigmeat.  Increases were also recorded in other Asian markets. </p>  <p>  Exports to the UK were 8% lower at &euro;4.1 billion, affected by a weaker sterling.  The share of exports to the UK declined from 41% to 37% by contrast to the increases in international and other European markets.</p>  <p>  Exports to the other European markets increased by 3% in 2016 to reach just over &euro;3.5 billion or 32% of total food and drink exports.  Increases were recorded in meat, seafood and prepared foods.  Growth was driven by strong performance on the Netherlands, German and French markets.  Exports to Spain, Poland and Scandinavian markets also increased.</p>  <p>  The bulk of Irish food and drink production is destined for markets outside Ireland.  Policy has been both to build on existing markets and to identify opportunities for further market diversification.  FoodWise 2025 highlights the importance of retaining a presence in mature markets and the huge potential for growth in exports beyond EU markets, in particular China, South East Asia , Middle East and Africa.</p>  <p>  The programme of trade missions which I have undertaken with my Department and agencies in the past reflects this trajectory.  We will continue to review progress market by market in the FoodWise High Level Implementation Committee, which I chair, and in interdepartmental fora.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-09a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017030900062#WRA01100"><p>Most meat produced in Ireland is exported.  Exporters and Bord Bia are engaged on an ongoing basis in identifying market opportunities and building market relationships based on the high quality of quality assured and sustainably produced Irish beef and sheepmeat.  As export markets may have a local preference orientation, it is impressive that Irish beef was exported to 84 export markets in 2016.</p><p>Prices paid for R3 steers by Irish meat plants during the week ending the 25<sup>th</sup>of February averaged &euro;3.72/kg excluding VAT.  This compared with an average price of &euro;4.17/kg for R3 steers in the UK and an average price of &euro;3.75/kg paid for R3 young bulls around continental Europe.  The British price in Sterling terms has fallen consecutively each week of 2017.  The current Irish cattle price has been largely stable since the beginning of 2017 while cattle supplies have been increasing.  The most recently available data show that weekly throughput at Irish export premises reached almost 36,000, its highest level for this time of year for over ten years.</p><p>In the lamb sector, reported prices at Irish meat plants averaged &euro;4.61/kg excluding VAT for the week ending the 25<sup>th</sup>of February.  This represents a 12% decline on this time last year, when hogget prices averaged &euro;5.26/kg.  It is below the levels of 2015 and 2016 but on a par with 2014 and previous years and an improvement on January and February.  To-date in 2017, Irish sheep supplies have risen by 15%, or 53,000 head.</p><p>For pigmeat, the latest reported price for week ending the 25<sup>th</sup>of February was &euro;1.60/kg excluding VAT, a 17% recovery on equivalent 2016 levels.  This is largely driven by growing demand for frozen pork and offal products in China and a fall in production there.  The medium-term outlook for the sector is optimistic . </p><p>Supplies have tightened somewhat in recent weeks, and UK prices have also recovered somewhat.</p><p>Irish beef exports in 2016 reached 535,000 tonnes in 2016, the highest level in more than a decade and were valued at &euro;2.38 billion. Overall exports of Irish meat and livestock were valued at &euro;3.66 billion.  This represented one third of total food and drink exports.  Both Irish pigmeat and sheepmeat exports increased in 2016, by four per cent to &euro;615m and &euro;240m respectively.  </p><p>Winning customers in global markets is achieved by demonstrating the quality of our produce and the Bord Bia Quality Assurance Scheme and Origin Green initiative are critically important in this endeavour.  Irish beef is purchased by the largest three UK retailers, arguably the most valuable market of scale.  Beef exports to Germany have almost trebled in value over the past five years.  The membership of the Bord Bia Chef's Irish Beef Club attests to the high reputation of Irish beef.  Last week Bord Bia welcomed the first member from outside Europe at an event in Dubai.  This club which comprises over eighty award winning chefs who are advocates of Irish beef is evident of the premium positioning of our product in export markets.</p></reply>

From 2018 eligible areas must instead be designated using a set list of bio-physical criteria.  In cases where a Member State does not introduce this new system for payment, the old scheme remains in place but payments must phase out on a digressive basis. </p><p>The biophysical criteria set out in the legislation to underpin the new system of designation are:</p><p>- Low temperature </p><p>- Dryness</p><p>- Excess soil moisture</p><p>- Limited soil drainage</p><p>- Unfavourable texture and stoniness</p><p>- Shallow rooting depth</p><p>- Poor chemical properties</p><p>- Steep slope.</p><p>My Department has commenced work on this project, and relevant technical experts are currently working on sourcing and analysing the data in relation to the new criteria.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-09a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017030900062#WRA01500"><p>I would like to remind the House that I and my Department have been actively engaged in assessing the impact of the Brexit vote on the Irish agri food sector, consulting with appropriate stakeholders and engaging with the relevant politicians and institutions.  This work is being done in conjunction with the overall Government response being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  I fully recognise the potential difficulties that the agri food sector could face in the event of a hard Brexit.  The sector is of critical importance to our economy and its regional spread means it underpins the socio-economic development in rural areas in particular.  The sector employed approximately 173k people (i.e. 8.6% of total employment) in 2016, and the total value of agri food exports was more than &euro;11 billion.  </p>  <p>  The highly integrated nature of agri food trade between Ireland and the UK is shown in CSO  trade figures, with some &euro;4.8bn (39%) of  exports to the UK last year, and  &euro;3.7bn (46%) of agri food products  imported from the UK. </p>  <p>  A number of credible analyses have been conducted on the potential impact on Ireland of a UK exit from the EU, and all of these show that the result will, most likely, be unambiguously bad for the Irish agri-food sector.  The more immediate impacts relate to the significant drop in the value of sterling against the euro and the effects this is having on industries with significant trading activity in the UK, particularly the mushroom and forest products sectors.</p>  <p>  The medium to longer term impacts will revolve around the potential application of tariffs, the implications of divergence in regulations and standards, border controls with the Great Britain and Northern Ireland and certification, including the related areas of veterinary and animal health certification.  There will also be difficult challenges in relation to potential restricted access to fishing grounds and resources.</p>  <p>  In response to the challenges being posed by Brexit I have undertaken a number of important steps within my Department, which include the establishment of a Brexit Response Committee and a dedicated Brexit Unit.  I have also created a Stakeholder Consultative Committee, which is complemented by frequent contact with representative organisations and companies on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  In addition I hosted two All-Island Civic Dialogues for the agri-food sector, to which interested stakeholders from both sides of the border were invited.  The first of these - focusing on the dairy, cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry sectors - took place on 15 December 2016.  The second - dealing with the prepared consumer foods, horticulture, forestry and cereals/animal feed sectors - took place on 8 February 2017.  A Civic Dialogue for the seafood sector was held on 1 February 2017.   All of these opportunities for consultation allowed me and my Department establish the issues of critical concern to industry stakeholders.</p>  <p>  I am also in regular communication with Commissioner Hogan and my officials have taken part in meetings with the Commission and the Barnier Task Force.</p>  <p>  At EU level, I have had regular contact with the Commission and with  counterparts in the UK and other member states, including meetings with  my Spanish and Maltese colleagues on the margins of last Monday&rsquo;s Council of Ministers.  Arrangements are currently being made for further formal bilateral meetings over the coming weeks involving &ndash; Germany, The Netherlands and Denmark over St. Patrick&rsquo;s weekend and Poland, Austria and Estonia at the end of the month.</p>  <p>  In all of these engagements I am making clear our demand for continued unfettered access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures, as well as keeping the UK market viable for Irish producers by minimising the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries. </p>  <p>  In relation to fisheries, Ireland wants to maintain current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal and protect our quota share for joint fish stocks. </p>  <p>  Last October, as part of Budget 2017, I announced measures aimed at alleviating the pressures of income volatility and the potential impact of Brexit.  These measures included the introduction of the &lsquo;Agri Cashflow Support Loan&rsquo; fund of &euro;150 million; enhanced taxation measures and an additional allocation of &euro;1.6m in 2016 and &euro;2m in 2017 to Bord Bia to ensure that they are in a position to provide Brexit-related supports to affected companies.  I also provided for increased funding under the Rural Development Programme and Seafood Development Programme.</p>  <p>  I recently awarded over &euro;1.8 million in grants to 19 seafood enterprises under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme for the seafood sector.  The aim of these grants is to incentivise seafood innovation and new product development as a means of meeting the Brexit challenge.</p>  <p>  The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU reinforces the need to develop as many outlets for our agri-food exports as possible, in order to minimise our dependence on any one market. Indeed this principle of market development is already a key component of Food Wise 2025.  We have been very active in recent years in our efforts to diversify markets, and in aiming to respond to consumer demands in emerging markets.</p>  <p>  Inward and outward trade visits will play a key role in our efforts to provide as many markets as possible for Irish agri-food products.  Last September Minister Doyle and I led very successful trade missions to China, Singapore, Vietnam and South Korea and to North Africa in November.  I have just returned from leading a trade mission to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates which was very successful and I am currently considering potential further destinations for later in 2017. </p>  <p>  In relation to CAP payments the UK decision to leave the EU will result in a loss of the UK contribution to the EU budget of between 5 and 10%.  This could have implications for future spending decisions in what is already a very tight budgetary framework.  Given that the CAP accounts for some 37% of the EU budget, we could expect additional pressure for further contraction in CAP funding in the years ahead. However, it is important to remember that the amount of CAP funding per Member State under Pillars 1 and 2 is fixed under 2020 in the Regulations of the Council and European Parliament and it will require a co-decided amendment on these Regulations to change the figures.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the future of the CAP is of course a very important issue for Ireland&rsquo;s agriculture sector.  I strongly believe that the CAP has evolved considerably and very effectively in recent years in response to changing market, consumer and environmental demands.  </p>  <p>  At the Council of Agriculture Ministers earlier this week, I stressed the importance of ensuring that the CAP continues to evolve in the way that it has over recent reforms, and that it supports the achievement of European strategic objectives.  This will help to reinforce the relevance and effectiveness of the policy, and to secure a strong CAP budget for the period post-2020. </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the House that the Government remains very focused on supporting the agri-food industry through the challenges ahead.

In 2015, a joint inspection programme of dog breeding establishments involving both Departments was conducted with a view to ensuring that these establishments complied with the provisions of the 2013 Animal Health and Welfare Act.  While most of the establishments were found to comply  with the provisions of the Act, corrective action was taken carried out in an integrated manner by officers of my Department and the relevant Local Authorities where necessary following the discovery of individual cases of non-compliance.</p><p>My Department liaises on a daily basis with Local Authorities in relation to the enforcement of the Control of Horses Act 1996 and the provisions of the Animal Health and Welfare Act generally.  Under Section 37(2) of the Act, the manager of a local authority may appoint authorised officers to exercise functions conferred on them for the purposes of enforcing the 2013 Animal Health and Welfare Act.  With regard to the Control of Horses Act, the removal of stray or abandoned horses is frequently undertaken jointly by officials of my Department and of the Local Authorities.  In addition, the development of urban/traveller horse projects, which seek to reduce the number of stray horses and educate young people in the care of animals, is an outcome of the co-operation between my Department and the Local Authorities.  I am glad to report a major improvement in horse welfare outcomes in recent years.</p><p>My Department also works collaboratively with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Areas of engagement include those covered under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-09a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017030900062#WRA01900"><p>There are a number of challenges facing the beef industry in the short and medium term, including exchange rate volatility, Brexit and political uncertainty both within the EU and in third countries.  I am also aware, as I am sure the Deputy is, that a number of forecasts have predicted an additional 100,000 head of cattle to be available for slaughter in 2017, with the majority of these to go to plants in the early part of the year according to Bord Bia's performance and prospects publication. </p>  <p>  While concerns have been raised about the impact of the supply of cattle on prices in 2017 I note however that R3 steer prices have held steady, and actually risen slightly, since the beginning of the year, despite increased slaughter numbers, which is a relatively positive start to 2017.</p>  <p>   One of the key elements in coping with all challenges facing the beef sector is ensuring that there are sufficient markets for Irish beef.  A strong demand for meat, including beef exists globally, and figures from the European Commission's most recent Short Term Outlook for meat markets showed a 2.1% projected growth of per capita beef consumption for 2016. </p>  <p>  While we exported approximately 97% of our beef exports in 2016 to the UK and EU, I am acutely conscious of the importance of growing third country markets as a valuable outlet for any increase in Irish beef production.  Indeed, this is a crucial component of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  Very significant progress has been made in this regard in recent years, and my Department is currently in the process of securing beef access to a range of third countries including China, South Korea, Ukraine, Thailand and Vietnam. </p>  <p>  One of my priorities now, particularly in the context of Brexit, is to further increase the market opportunity for Irish food and drink internationally.  We are after all an exporting nation, with 90% of our food produce leaving the island.  I have just returned from a successful trade mission to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates last week during which enhanced access to the Saudi market was achieved for Irish beef.  This builds on the opening of some major markets in the last two years including the US, Canada and Japan.  To date this year we have also secured new market access for Irish beef to Egypt.  This is a vital means of providing our beef sector with as many commercial opportunities as possible for Irish beef in addition to our traditional European markets. </p>  <p>  I am also very conscious of the vital role that live exports play in providing an alternative market outlet for Irish farmers, especially in an environment where the number of calf births has increased, as in recent years.  The opening of the Turkish market for live cattle exports in 2016 has been a good example of this, with approximately 20,000 live cattle exported there over the course of the last few months of 2016.  I also note that exports of live cattle to Libya have recommenced, which is a positive and welcome development.  My Department is also currently actively examining the possibilities of bilateral health certificates for the export of cattle to Kazakhstan and Montenegro and for breeding cattle to Morocco.  I remain actively committed to ensuring that Irish beef producers have the option of exporting to as many markets as possible.</p>  <p>   My Department and state agencies such as Bord Bia will continue to work to ensure that any increase in production from the Irish beef herd can deliver a viable return to the primary producer.  I allocated additional funding to Bord Bia in Budget 2017 for the specific purpose of dealing with the impact of Brexit which will help to support Irish food and drink exports in 2017.  This, in addition to the opening of a new office by Bord Bia in Singapore this year, will ensure that exports of Irish beef are promoted effectively to provide viable export markets for any increases in Irish beef production.  Bord Bia has been very proactive in recent years in its promotion of Irish Beef in Europe and further afield and this work allied to our trade missions and  promotional work will help to ensure there are a growing number of viable markets open to Irish beef this year and into the future.</p></reply>

This will take approximately six weeks of public consultation.  The RIA for the other elements of the draft Bill has already been carried out.</p>  <p>  Thereafter, I plan to submit a Memorandum to Government seeking approval for the drafting of the Bill along the lines of the General Scheme and the forwarding of the General Scheme for consideration to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This will provide for Pre-legislative Scrutiny prior to its submission to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.</p></reply>

Therefore, payments can only issue where all the required validation checks have been successfully passed.</p>  <p>  In relation to 2016 payments, under AEOS the previous agri-environment Scheme, just over 8,600 AEOS participants were due a payment.  AEOS II participants completed their 5-year contracts on 31 December 2016.  Under the EU Regulations governing this Scheme and all other area-based payment schemes, a full check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System must take place before the final payment can issue.  As all AEOS II participants will be receiving their final payments under the scheme, re-checks on payments made for all scheme years must be completed before final payment can be processed.  This is the same procedure as applied to AEOS 1 participants finishing in that Scheme. </p>  <p>   To date, AEOS 2016 payments amounting to over &euro;22m have issued.  The remaining cases are currently being checked and payments will continue to issue on an ongoing weekly basis as these cases are cleared.</p>  <p>  A total of 49 farmers in Co.

Kilkenny is that 63 farmers in GLAS 1 and 37 farmers in GLAS 2 have yet to receive their payment and their applications continue to be processed.   </p>  <p>  Outstanding payments under both GLAS 1 and GLAS 2 are largely delayed due to declaration of incompatible parcel usage on the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) application for a chosen GLAS action; changes in parcel boundaries on which a GLAS action is chosen including splitting or merging of parcels; an applicant no longer claiming a parcel on their 2016 BPS; incomplete documentation such as incorrect information on Low-Emission Slurry Declaration; incomplete interim commonage management plans and incompatible data and parcel history on Department databases.</p>  <p>  Payments under the Scheme will continue to issue on an ongoing basis as issues are resolved and cases are cleared for payment.</p></reply>

These schemes were designed to provide financial support to young farmers and new entrants to farming during the crucial early years immediately following the setting up of a farming enterprise.  </p>  <p>  A young farmer is defined as a farmer aged no more than 40 years of age in the year when they first submit an application under the Basic Payment Scheme and who commenced their farming activity no more than five years prior to submitting that application.  A new entrant to farming is defined as a farmer who commenced their agricultural activity during the previous two years and did not have any agricultural activity in their own name and at their own risk in the five years preceding the start of the present agricultural activity.</p>  <p>  The National Reserve provides for an allocation of entitlements at national average value or a top-up on existing entitlements that are below the national average value to two mandatory categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo;.  The National average value of entitlements is approx. &euro;185.  In 2015 the National Reserve fund was based on a 3% cut to the Basic Payment Scheme financial ceiling and provided some &euro;24 million in funding.  Some 6,250 applicants were allocated entitlements under the 2015 National Reserve.  The Young Farmers Scheme is a separate scheme that provides for an additional payment to young farmers based on activated entitlements.  Over &euro;24 million is allocated to the Young Farmers Scheme each year from 2015 to 2019.  The National Reserve and Young Farmers schemes together with the value of associated Greening payments provided for an allocation of Pillar 1 payments in excess of &euro;52.5 million in Ireland in 2015.</p>  <p>  I was glad to announce recently that funding of just over &euro;5 million will be made available to fund a National Reserve in 2017.  Full details in relation to the application process for the National Reserve and the Young Farmer&rsquo;s Scheme in 2017 will be available in the coming weeks and will be widely advertised in the farming media and on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The closing date for applications under both schemes will be 15th May 2017.</p>  <p>  The Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme of TAMS II provides grant aid for a range of investments aimed at facilitating the entry of farmers and generational renewal.  The TAMS Scheme specifically targets support at young farmers by offering them a greater rate of aid intensity at 60% compared to the standard grant aid rate of 40%.  In addition, support is being provided for grant aid for dairy buildings specifically for qualifying young farmers.</p>  <p>  There are a number of tax measures specifically aimed at young farmers, specifically &lsquo;100% Stock Relief on Income Tax for Certain Young Trained Farmers&rsquo; and &lsquo;Stamp Duty Exemption on Transfers of Land to Young Trained Farmers&rsquo;.  The Agri-taxation Review was published as part of Budget 2015 and set out the main policy objectives for continuing support through agri-taxation measures including:</p>  <p>  - Increasing land mobility and the productive use of land</p>  <p>  - Assisting succession and the transfer of farms.</p>  <p>  Both objectives are especially relevant to young farmers and Budget 2015 included a number of new measures in this regard, as well as measures to enhance and strengthen the existing supports.</p>  <p>  In addition I recently announced that the &lsquo;Succession Farm Partnership Scheme&rsquo; has been approved and administrative arrangements are being finalised for its commencement this year.  The Scheme provides for a &euro;25,000 tax credit over five years to assist with the transfers of farms within a partnership structure and will promote the earlier inter-generational transfer of family farms.  It will encourage and support important conversations within farm families about succession planning.</p></reply>

This scheme builds on the pilot Beef Genomics Scheme in 2014 and is a key component of our national Rural Development programme and our supports for the Irish suckler sector.  It is a scheme which I firmly believe will provide a lasting positive impact on the national suckler herd both in terms of genetic gain and environmental sustainability.</p>  <p>  The scheme is now firmly established and its benefits are already clearly being seen.  Its credibility as a progressive and meaningful scheme for suckler farmers is well known and there are consistent demands for its re-opening as a result of this.  I have listened to calls for the reopening of this scheme to new applicants and to that end officials in my Department are currently examining the possibility of this in the context of an assessment of budgetary priorities, the operation of the Rural Development Programme and the potential impact both upon the scheme itself and other schemes.</p></reply>

My Department is  currently assessing budgetary priorities and commitments under the RDP and in this context, is considering the feasibility of opening the BDGP to new applicants on a limited basis.</p>  <p>  When all the above relevant factors have been considered in full, I will make an announcement regarding the reopening of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The calls to reopen the scheme are very much a positive reflection on the experience of those who are currently participating in the scheme.  The scheme itself combined with other measures introduced by my Department such as the Mart Modernisation Scheme have concentrated the minds of suckler farmers on the genetic quality of their herds.  Commercial farmers when making breeding decisions for their beef herds are now making those decisions based on both economic and scientific data which is easily accessible to them when purchasing replacement stock using Eurostar data displayed clearly at mart ringsides.  This is an example of two Department schemes complementing one another in a positive manner.  The BDGP is an important factor in driving continued efficiencies in Irish suckler production.</p>  <p>  The suckler sector is a vital component of Ireland&rsquo;s rural economy and the provision of support for the suckler sector is critically important.  It is a sector that I want to ensure continues to survive and prosper in this country.  The range of supports under the CAP such as Pillar I payments and schemes under the RDP such as GLAS, ANCs and indeed the BDGP represents a balance between direct income support for the sector and measures designed to improve its competitiveness and sustainability.  I believe that it is entirely appropriate to maintain this balance of developmental and income supports into the future.</p>  <p>  Having recently returned from a successful trade mission in the Middle East I have once again seen at first hand the high esteem in which Irish beef is held by consumers all over world, for its taste, animal welfare standards and environmentally sound production systems.  The reputation of Irish beef as a premium sustainable product was one of the key factors in gaining enhanced market access in Saudi Arabia.  The BDGP aims to re-enforce these vital qualities by further enhancing our production to be at the forefront of Irish and international efforts to tackle climate change.  The benefits that this scheme will bring to the Irish suckler herd are cumulative and permanent and are an essential element of the future sustainability producing beef from our suckler herd.</p></reply>

Therefore, payments can only issue where all the required validation checks have been successfully passed.</p>  <p>  In relation to 2016 payments, under AEOS the previous agri-environment Scheme, just over 8,600 AEOS participants were due a payment.  AEOS II participants completed their 5-year contracts on 31 December 2016.  Under the EU Regulations governing this Scheme and all other area-based payment schemes, a full check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System must take place before the final payment can issue.  As all AEOS II participants will be receiving their final payments under the scheme, re-checks on payments made for all scheme years must be completed before final payment can be processed.  This is the same procedure as applied to AEOS 1 participants finishing in that Scheme.</p>  <p>  To date, AEOS 2016 payments amounting to over &euro;22m have issued.  The remaining cases are currently being checked and payments will continue to issue on an ongoing weekly basis as these cases are cleared.</p>  <p>  A total of 8,640 farmers nationally were due a 2016 payment in AEOS of which 6,935 have been paid and 33 are awaiting payment 1,705.</p>  <p>  2016 payments represent the first full year of payment under GLAS.  At the end of December 2016, there were approximately 37,500 active participants in the GLAS scheme, of which 27,400 or over 71% received payments valued at over &euro;97m, representing 85% of their 2016 payment.</p>  <p>  As issues with outstanding GLAS cases are resolved they are being paid in weekly payment runs.  Further payments are issuing on a weekly basis with payments valued at over &euro;110m now issued and over 84% of participants now paid.  Further payments are issuing on a weekly basis.</p>  <p>  Some 25,578 farmers are active GLAS 1 and a further 11,577 are active in GLAS 2 nationally of which 21,686 in GLAS 1 and 9,524 in GLAS 2 have successfully completed the GLAS prepayment checks in respect of the 2016 scheme year and a first payment instalment of 85% has issued.</p>  <p>  The current position is that 3,832 farmers in GLAS 1 and 2,053 farmers in GLAS 2 have yet to receive their payment and their applications continue to be processed.</p>  <p>  The balancing payment due will issue later in the year when the last of the required on the spot inspections has been initiated.</p>  <p>  Payments under the Scheme will continue to issue on an ongoing basis as issues are resolved and cases are cleared for payment.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that all available European Union funds available will be fully drawn down over the programming period.</p></reply>

While ultimately we will only find out how effective this new approach will be over time, I firmly believe that by operating a bottom-up community-based approach like this we can secure real benefits not just for the bird, but for the farmers who manage these lands.</p></reply>

The Government in its National Policy Position adopted an &ldquo;approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The EPA is the lead in compiling Ireland's annual greenhouse gas emission inventories and projections including those related to sequestration under the land use land-use, change and forestry (LULUCF) categories.  This allows the Government to assess progress in terms of meeting key targets and to inform policy development.</p>  <p>  We continue to engage at EU and international level to raise understanding of the particular profile of the Irish agriculture sector and how best to develop a coherent and cost-effective approach to the twin challenges of sustainable food production in the light of rising global demand, and climate change mitigation and adaptation in the light of overall EU and global objectives.</p>  <p>  The 2013 EU decision on LULUCF will help to recognise the importance of the link in the medium to long term approaches to agriculture in order to avoid perverse actions and encourage good carbon management practices such as crop rotation, protection of permanent pasture, afforestation, forest management and agroforestry.</p>  <p>  The inclusion of access to LULUCF credits in the EU proposals of last July will go towards addressing the lower mitigation potential of agriculture while providing a means of encouraging the sustainable intensification of food production, and optimising the sector's contribution to greenhouse gas mitigation and sequestration, including through incentivising afforestation and other forest sector activities and investments.</p>  <p>  Farm practices such as the establishment and maintenance of permanent pasture and landscape features which can assist with achieving carbon sequestration benefits are supported through our Rural Development Programme.  Our forests sequester carbon by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and then storing it in trees, other vegetation and in soils.</p>  <p>  We are engaging in research focussed on the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural soils and continue to direct research funding to improve our understanding of carbon stock changes, which will contribute to the development of a more robust inventory and underpin future accounting for these categories.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that Ireland has elected to report on cropland and grazing land management activities under the Kyoto Protocol (KP).  This will allow Ireland to take advantage of any sequestration benefits that may be allowed in the future from these activities.</p>  <p>  We are at the forefront in developing carbon-efficient food production systems through investment in such areas as Knowledge transfer and in conducting carbon assessments on Bord Bia Quality assured farms.  The ambition to continue this leading position is set out in the industry-led Food Wise 2025 strategy for the development of food production in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage internationally both in terms of policy and research.  Just last month we hosted a meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to discuss the special report on climate change, agriculture and food security.</p></reply>

The sector faces a number of significant challenges and it is widely acknowledged that there need to be improvements in finance, governance and regulation in the sector.  These issues are well flagged in the Indecon Report, which was commissioned by my predecessor, which made a number of recommendations in relation to these matters.  Bord na gCon is endeavouring to implement these recommendations, some of which may  involve difficult decisions.</p>  <p>  In so far as governance and regulation are concerned, I am pleased to say that Cabinet has approved the draft general scheme of the new Greyhound Industry Bill, which addresses the governance of Bord na gCon, strengthens regulatory controls in the industry, modernises sanctions and improves integrity with a view to building a reputation for exceptional regulation in the sector.</p>  <p>  I look forward to working with the Joint Oireachtas Committee for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on this, when the Heads of the Bill are brought to pre legislative scrutiny.  I am confident that with a collaborative approach to finalising the Bill, we can together make a real contribution to laying down a solid legal framework for the development of the sector.</p>  <p>  On the question of improving the financial performance of the sector and reducing Bord na gCon's significant debt burden, there are no easy answers.  While Indecon made a number of recommendations in this regard, the sale of assets, including Harold's Cross Stadium, was a central recommendation.  Bord na gCon has already disposed of the old Henry Street Head Office in Limerick and recently announced the closure of Harold's Cross Stadium.  The operation of greyhound stadia is a matter for the Board.</p>  <p>  I understand from Bord na gCon that this was a very difficult decision, taken against the very challenging background I have outlined above.  It has led to understandable concern among supporters of Harold's Cross Stadium, and in this regard I understand that an effort at mediation between Dublin GOBA and Bord na gCon, under the chairmanship of Mr. Kieran Mulvey, is at present underway.</p></reply>

This work is being done in conjunction with the overall Government response being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  I fully recognise the potential difficulties that the agri food sector could face in the event of a hard Brexit.  The sector is of critical importance to our economy and its regional spread means it underpins the socio-economic development of rural areas in particular.  The sector employed approximately 173k people (i.e. 8.6% of total employment) in 2016, and the total value of agri-food exports was more than &euro;11 billion.</p>  <p>  The highly integrated nature of agri food trade between Ireland and the UK is shown in the trade figures.  Some &euro;4.8bn (39%) of these exports went to the UK last year, while &euro;3.7bn (46%) of agri food products was imported from the UK.</p>  <p>  A further significant issue in relation to cross border trade is the de facto all-island milk market that currently exists.  Significant volumes of manufacturing milk processed in Ireland come from Northern suppliers and any reestablishment of a hard border would pose significant difficulties for both processors and suppliers.  In addition, a significant component of the sheep and lambs slaughtered in Irish processing facilities is of Northern Irish origin.</p>  <p>  The implications for North-South trade, and for the movement of raw materials, including milk, meat and live animals, are potentially severe.  The implications for animal and plant health procedures on both sides of the border are also potentially very serious.  Put quite simply, this substantial trade would be massively affected by the constraints of tariffs, customs controls, veterinary/phyto-sanitary certification and any deviation by the UK from EU common regulatory provisions and standards.</p>  <p>  In preparation for the upcoming negotiations I have had a number of meetings with key officials in the Commission, the UK and in other Members States, and this process will continue in the coming months.  At EU level, I have had regular contact with counterparts at AgriFish Council meetings, including meetings with my Spanish and Maltese colleagues on the margins of last Monday&rsquo;s Council of Ministers meeting.  Arrangements are currently being made for further formal bilateral meetings over the coming weeks involving Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark over St Patrick&rsquo;s weekend and Poland, Austria and Estonia at the end of the month.</p>  <p>  I am also in regular communication with Commissioner Hogan and my officials have taken part in meetings with the Commission and the Barnier Task Force.</p>  <p>  In all of these engagements I am making clear our demand for continued unfettered access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures, as well as keeping the UK market viable for Irish producers by minimising the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries.</p>  <p>  In relation to fisheries, we want to maintain current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal and protect Ireland&rsquo;s quota share for joint fish stocks.</p>  <p>  Referring now specifically to meetings with my Northern Ireland and UK counterparts, I have met the outgoing Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Michelle McIlveen on at least six occasions since last September and I have had bilateral meetings with Secretary of State Leadsom on two occasions &ndash; initially on December 1 in London and then at the Berlin Food Show last January.</p>  <p>  While we exchanged views on what we view as the immediate and longer-term impacts of the UK vote on Irish agri food sector, I fully observed the line agreed at EU level whereby no negotiations could take place with the UK until Article 50 has been triggered.  As you know, Ireland will be part of the EU27 team and will work with our fellow Member States in delivering the best possible result for Ireland and for the EU.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the House that the Government remains very focused on supporting the agri-food industry through the challenges ahead.  I will continue to consult with the industry as the negotiations develop, and I will continue to press Ireland's case for continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures.</p></reply>

A supplier shall not be required to obtain goods or services from a third party from whom the company received payment for the arrangement (Regulation 6).  Restrictions are placed on payment from a supplier as a condition of stocking, displaying or listing a product, and a payment period of 30 days is set down except where provided differently by contract.</p>  <p>  Relevant grocery goods undertakings must designate and train members of their staff to ensure compliance with the regulations.  The Regulations are enforced by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) as provided by Act of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  Relevant grocery goods undertakings (RGGUs) must submit their first annual compliance reports to the CCPC by 31 March 2017, including a detailed account of compliance, including where a breach or alleged breach of the regulations has been identified by, or notified to them and steps taken to rectify it.</p>  <p>  It is important to assess these reports for the first year of operation of the new regime, before considering initiating further legislation.  In this connection it is worth noting that neither the Irish nor the UK Regulations guarantee prices; they regulate practices.

The NFI is the principal means of monitoring national forest cover in Ireland and records and assesses the extent and nature of Ireland&rsquo;s forests, both public and private, in a timely, accurate and reproducible manner.  The exercise is repeated every 5 years with work on the next NFI currently underway.</p><p>Under &ldquo;Forests, products and people, Ireland&rsquo;s forest policy&rdquo; the aim is to increase forest cover to 18% by 2046.  Following publication of new afforestation targets under the new forestry programme launched in 2015, the estimated year in which this level of cover will be reached has been updated to 2050.  It is difficult to say what rules will be in place that far forward but currently the establishment of new forests are subject to rigorous checks and balances which undergo careful planning by professional foresters.  Furthermore, all new forests must be established in compliance with national and EU legislation and the Department&rsquo;s requirements as set out in the Forestry Standards Manual, Scheme Documents, Code of Best Practice &ndash; Ireland, the suite of environmental guidelines and requirements, and relevant procedures and protocols such as Forest Service Appropriate Assessment Procedure, consultation with statutory consultees and adherence to the Acid Sensitivity Protocol.  Only projects which receive prior written approval from the Department in line with Statutory Instrument No. 558 of 2010 (as amended by S.I. No. 442 of 2012), and in compliance with sustainable forest management can proceed to planting.</p><p>I believe that forestry has an important role to play in improving the quality of life in rural Ireland both for farmers and others living in rural communities.  These wide-ranging benefits are economic, environmental and social.  Firstly forestry generates economic activity in parts of rural Ireland that other forms of investment can&rsquo;t reach.  On the environmental side, forests protect and enhance water quality, they can alleviate flooding and they are the most important land use option for climate change mitigation.  There are also social benefits that can be enjoyed from forestry in the form of amenity and recreation.  Furthermore, forestry can be complementary to existing farming activities particularly where land is being underutilised.  For example, where animals are grazing poor land which is more suitable for forestry, animals can be moved onto the better fields and the poorer ground can be planted.  In other words, forestry does not necessarily mean a reduction in agricultural output nor does it mean converting the entire farm to forestry; instead where land is underutilised, it signals a more efficient use of land bringing the entire farm closer to its productive potential.  Most importantly this approach introduces a more stable and additional income into the farm.  This new income stream can be used to develop the farm business as part of the overall plan for the farm.</p></reply>

In cases where a Member State does not introduce this new system for payment, the old scheme remains in place but payments must phase out on a digressive basis.</p><p>The biophysical criteria set out in the legislation to underpin the new system of designation are:</p><p>-  Low temperature</p><p>-  Dryness</p><p>-  Excess soil moisture</p><p>-  Limited soil drainage</p><p>-  Unfavourable texture and stoniness</p><p>-  Shallow rooting depth</p><p>-  Poor chemical properties</p><p>-  Steep slope.</p><p>My Department has commenced work on this project, and relevant technical experts are currently working on sourcing and analysing the data in relation to the new criteria.  Department officials have also been in contact with the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and DG Agri in the EU Commission in relation to technical issues arising.  Over the coming months this analysis will identify areas deemed to be facing natural constraints, which will in parallel be subjected to a refinement process.  It is envisaged that stakeholders will be consulted as this process develops.</p></reply>

This has provided farmers a measure of income stability from the Basic Payments Scheme while allowing them to adjust production in response to market demand.</p>  <p>  This approach to the reform of the CAP was one that was recognised as being the most suitable approach to take and my view remains that the best interests of farmers lie in retaining the flexibility to calibrate production to market demand without compromising income from the Basic Payment Scheme.</p>  <p>  Future supports should in my opinion be targeted at improving the efficiency of existing suckler cows and I believe the existing BDGP is a good example of such a targeted support.  This current model of funding provides support to enable suckler farmers to improve efficiency and profitability by improving the overall genetic merit of their beef herd.  The BDGP builds on the substantial investment in data recording and genomics which has been made in recent years and will continue to drive further developments and improvements in this area.</p>  <p>  Finding suitable means of supporting suckler cows in such a manner will of course provide its own challenges in the context of the review of the CAP but I am confident that it is a challenge that Ireland, through its team of dedicated and experienced negotiators, will be able to deal with in order to secure the optimum outcome for the Irish suckler herd when the time comes.</p>  <p>  I do not believe that a mandatory coupled support is the most appropriate means of providing support to the suckler industry and I note that some Member States that retained coupled supports for their suckler cows have not been immune to the challenges faced by the beef sector across Europe in recent times.</p>  <p>  The introduction of a &euro;200 coupled suckler cow payment would involve a redistribution of funds allocated to farmers under Pillar I.  This would necessitate a linear cut across payment to all BPS beneficiaries.</p>  <p>  In relation to funding under Pillar II of the CAP, the Beef Data and Genomics Programme as already outlined is the current main support for the suckler sector and provides farmers with some &euro;300 million of funding over the next six years.  It is important that this programme is supported through the lifetime of the current RDP.  This is of course in addition to the other supports for suckler farmers under the RDP notably GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer groups.</p>  <p>  I am of course conscious of the challenges faced by suckler farmers currently and am aware of the importance of the sector to Ireland&rsquo;s rural economy.  It is a sector that I intend to ensure receives the support of my Department both at this time and also during the future review of the Common Agricultural Policy.</p></reply>

Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p>  <p>  If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee which drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy believed that ambitious growth projections were achievable by 2025; including</p>  <p>  -  increasing the value of agri-food exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; and</p>  <p>  -  the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agri-food sector, all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Oireachtas Committee&rsquo;s recommendation to review the strategy in the light of Brexit, it is important to understand that Food Wise 2025 is a living and evolving strategy. I chair quarterly meetings of the High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC), with high level representatives from all the relevant Departments and State agencies.  The committee reviews progress on detailed actions on a quarterly basis, in order to identify and solve problems quickly.  Brexit has now been included as a standard item on the agenda of each meeting of the HLIC. </p>  <p>  It is not yet clear what the final outcome of the UK's Brexit decision will be. While the value of agri food exports to the UK declined in 2016, primarily as a result of the reduction in the value of sterling, the overall value of exports increased. A hard Brexit involving the imposition of WTO tariffs would have a more significant adverse affect on the value of exports, but our stated aim is to avoid such a scenario. </p>  <p>  In any event it is clear that the implementation of the Food Wise recommendations, particularly those related to market development, competitiveness and innovation, will assume even greater importance in the light of the UK decision, regardless of the ultimate outcome.</p></reply>

Therefore, payments can only issue where all the required validation checks have been successfully passed. </p>  <p>  In relation to 2016 payments, under AEOS the previous agri-environment Scheme, just over 8,600 AEOS participants were due a payment. AEOS II participants completed their 5-year contracts on 31 December 2016. Under the EU Regulations governing this Scheme and all other area-based payment schemes, a full check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System must take place before the final payment can issue.

This is the same procedure as applied to AEOS 1 participants finishing in that Scheme. </p>  <p>   To date, AEOS 2016 payments amounting to over &euro;22m have issued.

At the December Agrifish Council, the Coastal State agreed TAC was confirmed by Ministers and the internal EU allocation agreed in accordance with the longstanding relative stability rules. This has now been given legal effect in Council Regulation (EU) 2017/127 of 20 January 2017. </p>  <p>  The one aspect that has changed since then is that ICES has issued revised advice for the stock for 2017 and I assume that this is what the Deputy is referring to. Due to an overestimation of the stock size during the assessment phase, ICES has stated that its TAC advice for Mackerel is now 857,185 tonnes as opposed to 944,302 tonnes in its original advice - a 9% reduction in the advice. It is important to note that the Coastal States set the 2017 TAC at 1,020,996 tonnes in line with the agreed Long Term Management Plan.  As such, there were no mistakes in how the allocation of the mackerel Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for 2017 was made.</p>  <p>  The revised ICES advice was issued on 26 January 2017.</p>  <p>  As the mackerel stock is subject to the Coastal States process, the way that 2017 TAC would  be changed is, if there were agreement in the first instance at Coastal States level.  In that situation it is likely that the AgriFish Council would amend the current EU Regulation. If an adjustment to the TAC, based on the new advice, were to be agreed and given legal effect, the increase for Ireland in 2017 would amount to 2,627 tonnes instead of 10,589 tonnes.</p>  <p>  I have not received any indication from the Commission that any adjustment to the TAC is being actively considered, notwithstanding the revised ICES advice, given the practicalities and the situation that most Coastal Sates have already made their allocations to operators for 2017.  The revised estimation of the overall stock size will play a part in determining the advice for 2018.</p></reply>

Already in the first two months of this year, just over 20, 000 head, including 12, 000 calves, were exported, up from 18, 900 in the same period last year.  The number of calves exported in January and February increased by 3,000 over last year. I recently reduced the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves under three months of age to &euro;1.20 per animal from &euro;4.80, in order to bring greater equity in the fees payable per consignment in respect of calves, weanlings and adult cattle.  The live calf export trade with the EU has proved difficult in recent years for a number of reasons, including changes in animal health rules in Belgium and changes in the interpretation of the EU rules on animal transport in the Netherlands.  However, my Department has been working closely with the Dutch authorities on the transport issue and nearly 7,000 calves were exported to the Netherlands in February, double the number for February 2016.  </p>  <p>  Last year saw significant developments in exports of cattle to third countries. We exported almost 20, 000 head to Turkey in 2016 and the indications are that there will be further shipments this year. In relation to the other significant potential third country markets for live exports, Ireland reached agreement with Egypt in 2016 on a health certificate for slaughter cattle. My Department has been actively discussing with the Egyptian authorities the possibility of agreement on a health certificate for fattening cattle. Good progress has been made on this matter and I am optimistic that an agreement can be finalised in the near future.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also looking at the possibility of bilateral health certificates for the export of cattle to Kazakhstan and has identified Israel as a live export market of potential interest to exporters. Agreement on health certificates has been reached by my Department with all other live export markets identified as being of potential interest to Ireland.  At present 9 non-EU markets (Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Libya, Montenegro, Morocco, Serbia, Tunisia, and most recently Turkey) are currently open to live cattle from Ireland, in addition to all EU Member States.  Demand from North Africa and the Middle East for live cattle will depend on the political environment there as well as, Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness.   </p>  <p>  My Department works with all those involved &ndash; including farmers, marts, exporters, assembly centre operators and transporters - to ensure the export trade is carried out to the highest animal health and welfare standards.  We have a comprehensive legislative framework in place governing vessels that export animals and we have rigorous controls and procedures in place to ensure compliance with this legislation.  My Department also supports on-going efforts by international organisations such as The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), to improve welfare standards at slaughter plants worldwide and will continue to promote and maintain an environment in which live exports can continue in both an economic and sustainable manner and with due regard for the welfare of all animals exported. </p></reply>

The remainder is made up of a wide range of species including over 25% broadleaves including several native species, mostly ash, oak and birch. </p>  <p>  Ireland, however, has very few native tree species compared to other European countries.  Native trees are often selected by landowners whose objectives include optimising the recreational and biodiversity aspects of the new forest while Sitka spruce is normally selected by landowners whose objectives include optimising the economic return. Where a landowner wishes to plant Sitka spruce they must plant a minimum of 10% broadleaves and have 10 to 15% unplanted Areas of Biodiversity Enhancement. In all cases the landowners plan must be examined and approved by my Department. </p>  <p>  Under the Forestry programme 2014 &ndash; 2020 my Department operates a package of measures, aimed specifically at protecting and expanding Ireland&rsquo;s native woodland resource. These measures, which are 100% funded by the exchequer, represent a key biodiversity component within Ireland&rsquo;s national forest policy. My Department provides higher grants and annual premiums to landowners who wish to establish native woodlands.</p>  <p>  Native Woodland Establishment as represented by Grant &amp;amp; Premium Categories (GPC) 9 and 10 under the Afforestation Scheme, funds the establishment of new native woodland on open &lsquo;greenfield&rsquo; sites. The Native Woodland Conservation Scheme, promotes the appropriate restoration of existing native woodland, including the conversion of non-native forest to native woodland, through the provision of financial support to forest holders towards the cost of appropriate works. A third strand in my Department' strategy to support and expand Ireland&rsquo;s native woodlands is the Seed Stand and Seed Orchard Scheme. This Scheme encourages the registration of seed stands comprising of native species on the National List of Basic Material. Most importantly the scheme supports the improvement and management of sessile oak and pedunculate oak seed stands within ancient woodlands. The establishment of indoor and outdoor seed orchards for both native and non native species is also supported under this scheme.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s climate allows a wide range of native and exotic species to be grown, as can be seen from the great diversity of both herbaceous and woody species that grow successfully side-by-side in Ireland&rsquo;s gardens and arboreta. The ability to grow many species of trees presents foresters with opportunities to use different species, not only to maximise site productivity for the production of specific wood products, but also to enhance the amenity, landscape and biodiversity values of the forests.  Under the Afforestation and Creation of Woodlands measure the selection of species, and provenances of trees take into account all the site  conditions of the area concerned.  The need to select species resilient to climate change has been described in my Department&rsquo;s recent  &ldquo;Draft Adaptation Plan for the Agriculture and Forest Sector&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  Species selection to ensure that the most suitable species are planted is guided by the COFORD publication &lsquo;A Guide to Forest Tree Species Selection and Silviculture in Ireland&rsquo;.</p></reply>

I am focused on working with the industry to meet these difficulties in the months and years ahead.</p><p>Budget 2017 underpins my Department&rsquo;s efforts through strategic investment in key areas, such as in its agencies and in the agrifood sector. As part of Budget 2017 I secured an additional &euro;700,000 in funding for capital investments in the Commercial Horticulture sector.  This means that this year&rsquo;s budget for the scheme will be &euro;5 million. In addition, the Horticulture sector will have access to the &euro;150 million low interest cash flow support loan fund announced in Budget 2017, providing access to highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000, at an interest rate of 2.95%. </p><p>The impact that the devaluation of Sterling is having on mushroom producers and grower margins is a problem that has happened over a very short space of time. Grower production of this highly perishable product must be well aligned with demand and the mushroom sector, like many other exporting sectors, is particularly at risk because of the high dependency on the UK market. I am monitoring the situation regarding Sterling volatility closely and in my own Department I have established a dedicated unit to consider the direct impact of Brexit on our industry. Although it is still a serious situation, the Sterling exchange rate has stabilised and is now holding at around 85p to 86p to the Euro.</p><p>My Department, along with the various State agencies, in particular Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland, are working closely with the industry to provide the necessary support and assistance.  Bord Bia is actively supporting the sector in the areas of Market Intelligence, UK consumer research and Quality Assurance. Towards the end of 2016 they held a currency and negotiation workshop specifically targeted at the sector which I understand was very well received by the mushroom industry. Bord Bia is also running a Marketing Intensification Programme which aims to<b></b>provide targeted marketing supports to companies with high dependency on UK markets. Grant supports will be prioritised to assist companies in strengthening their position in that market, and in their efforts to identify new markets.  The CEO of Bord Bia and I have held a series of meetings with senior executives from the UK retailers, to highlight the obstacles that our producers are facing. I understand that representatives of mushroom growers have recently met with a more positive reaction from their UK Multiple customers, to their need for fair and reasonable returns for their produce from the marketplace. A pilot programme on LEAN processes has been initiated, with the assistance of Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland. The programme has commenced with 6 mushroom growers, to assess efficiency across all aspects of the business, including supply chain, innovation, marketing and logistics. It is hoped that a template could be developed through this programme that will enable growers to optimise their production costs further. </p><p>I would also draw attention to support being provided to the industry through National and EU Schemes. </p><p>Under the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007 &ndash; 2013 my Department implemented the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector.  During this period my Department paid out over &euro;4 million in grant payments to mushroom growers which supported &euro;10.1 million in investment.</p><p>To ensure ongoing support for the sector, my Department extended, under EU sanction, the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector to run until 31 December 2019. In the years to 2016, a further amount of &euro;2.0 million in grant aid was paid to mushroom growers.  The grant aid paid supported some &euro;5.0 million in investment by these growers. </p><p>Under the 2017 Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector, my Department received a total of 164 applications, 20 of these from mushroom growers. All applications received are currently being assessed and it is hoped to issue approvals shortly. I have also provided a commitment to ensure that payments under this scheme are made as early as possible, so as to try to alleviate any financial pressure that growers are currently facing.</p><p>The EU Producer Organisation Scheme is also a vital support for mushroom growers, with around 80% of Irish growers in a producer organisation at present. This scheme provides an important mechanism for growers to achieve greater bargaining power in the marketplace by becoming part of a larger supply base. Between 2005 and 2016, a total of &euro;40.5 million was paid to mushroom producer organisations as part of the EU Producer Organisation scheme. </p><p>In February 2017 my Department received applications for EU aid, under this scheme from participating producer organisations.  These applications are currently being processed and will be paid as soon as practically possible.</p></reply>

I am deeply conscious of the serious issue of road safety and mindful of the increase in 2016 of road traffic fatalities on the corresponding figure for 2015.  I am also mindful of the traumatic impact of road traffic collisions on those directly affected and their families, as well as the impact of dangerous driving more generally on the quality of life of residents in local communities across the country. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that I have no direct role in the enforcement of road traffic legislation, which is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am informed that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as through a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies. Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including driving while intoxicated, as well as speeding and use of a mobile phone.  Both strategic, targeted operations and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's road traffic enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to target persistent offenders, make optimal use of the Garda PULSE system and utilise Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology to identify and target vehicles, with 'warnings' also placed on the ANPR system. I am informed by the Garda authorities that 19,290* offences of driving without a driving licence, contrary to section 38 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 as amended, were detected in 2016. This is the category of offence which drivers caught driving while disqualified are prosecuted under.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has identified a number of key road traffic initiatives in the Annual Policing Plan 2017, as follows:</p><p>- Work in partnership with other agencies including the Road Safety Authority, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, and Road Safety Officers in local authorities to reduce road deaths and serious injuries,</p><p>- Increase use of technologies and analytical tools to develop and implement plans to reduce the occurrence of road collisions, and the use of our roads for criminal activity,</p><p>- Expand the Fixed Charge Processing System, including penalty points,</p><p>- Strengthen and re-develop the Traffic Corps to tackle all forms of criminality on our road network, and</p><p>- Ongoing planning, risk assessment and operational preparation for major emergencies in conjunction with major emergency management partners. </p><p>Underpinning road traffic enforcement measures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme (2016-2021) sets out key strategic objectives for Road Policing which will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Road Policing plans over the next 5 years. Under the Programme, the Garda Commissioner will undertake a number of road safety traffic enforcement initiatives, including expanding the use of technology and increasing checkpoints. </p><p>A number of important actions are being taken to build on the vital work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Road Safety Authority (RSA) and other stakeholders: In January, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated that there will be a 10% increase in the traffic corps during the course of 2017, which should also lead to better outcomes in relation to road traffic enforcement.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also indicated that it was intended to have a stronger focus on road traffic enforcement in the training provided to new recruits at Templemore;</p><p>- The Deputy will be aware that road traffic legislation is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr Shane Ross, T.D.  I am, however, informed that the  Road Traffic Act 2016 (the 2016 Act) provides for insurance companies to collect driver numbers and other details when selling insurance policies, and to validate them with the National Vehicle and Driver File, which will ensure that disqualified drivers are not able to obtain insurance.  I am further informed that this project is currently in development and a test version is due to be ready later this year;</p><p>- The Deputy will also be aware that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is working with key stakeholders to introduce the new roadside tests for drugs provided for in the 2016 Act, which will be known as preliminary drug tests.  It is intended that the provisions will be commenced at the Easter Bank Holiday weekend.  This will provide a valuable opportunity to highlight the dangers of drug driving over the Bank Holiday weekend. I look forward to the introduction of the preliminary drug tests and am confident that these new road traffic enforcement measures will impact positively on road safety;</p><p>- The Deputy is aware that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport announced earlier this year that his Department will review Section 29 of the Road Traffic 2010 with the intention of ensuring that all drivers, if caught drink driving, will, in future, receive a mandatory disqualification. I support Minister Ross's intention to amend section 29 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, which should assist us in ensuring more effective enforcement of road traffic offences and making our roads safer.  My Department will continue to assist the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport  in bringing these changes forward.  <b><font color="#000080"></font></b></p><p>By working together with the RSA and other agencies, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to confront dangerous road-user behaviour through public presence, legislative enforcement, education and partnership. </p><p>*(Figure is operational, provisional and liable to change and is valid as of 6 March 2017.)</p></reply>

In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that 838 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 76 of whom have been assigned to the DMR West Division. I am also informed that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Community Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the DMR West Division, in the coming years.</p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.  </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the number of Community Garda&iacute; assigned to each Garda station in the DMR West Division as of 31 January 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is 53 and are as set out in the following table.</p><p><b>DMR West Community Garda&iacute; 31 January 2017</b><table><tr><th>Station</th><th>-</th></tr><tr><td>Cabra</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Finglas</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Lucan</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Ronanstown</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Ballyfermot</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Rathcoole</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>53</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In determining whether to make a deportation order, in addition to the factors set out in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, I must also consider all relevant constitutional and international human rights arising, including those enshrined in the Refugee Convention, the UN Convention  Against Torture and the European Charter of Human Rights. The question of not returning a person to a place where certain fundamental rights would be breached (or <i>non refoulement</i>as it is commonly referred to) is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order. This involves consideration of whether returning the person would result in the life or freedom of that person being threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, or whether the person would be subjected to torture <font color="#212100">or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  </font></p><p>A deportation order requires the person concerned to remove themselves from the State and it is only where they fail to do so that the State is forced to remove them and enforce the rule of law.  The process leading to deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to deportation orders.  Where persons have been identified as a threat to national security by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it remains open to me to make deportation orders against such persons and I have done so in the past and will continue to do so where appropriate.</p><p>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department that the information sought by the Deputy is as set out in the following table: <table><tr><th>Month</th><th>DOs Signed</th></tr><tr><td>March 2016</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>April 2016</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>May 2016</td><td>115</td></tr><tr><td>June 2016</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>July 2016</td><td>184</td></tr><tr><td>August 2016</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td>September 2016</td><td>153</td></tr><tr><td>October 2016</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>November 2016</td><td>158</td></tr><tr><td>December 2016</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>January 2017</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>February 2017</td><td>53</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the fuel grant, the scheme is estimated to have cost of the order of &euro;65m in 2016. This figure does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p><p>The disability criteria for the tax concessions available under the scheme have changed over time. When the scheme was first introduced in 1968, the legislation only allowed for one medical ground. In 1989, four new medical grounds were added and in 1994, one new medical ground was added. </p><p>I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities. I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation. From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria. While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

These hurdles must be overcome before any such proposals can be brought to a successful conclusion. Detailed work on the design of a funding vehicle is ongoing, and the actual establishment, management and operation of such a vehicle will require further time, investment and engagement.</p></reply>

More specifically, in the details supplied, he asked why it is that under Section 599 those aged 55-65 pay no CGT if transferring qualifying assets to their children, or to a niece or nephew who has worked in the business (as the Act states "substantially on a full-time basis, for the period of 5 years ending with the disposal), but those aged 66 and over can only enjoy relief from CGT where the assets concerned are valued at no more than &euro;3 million.     </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that individuals aged 66 or over who transfer qualifying assets to their children can qualify for CGT retirement relief provided those qualifying assets were owned and used by the individuals concerned for business or farming purposes for a period of at least 10 years prior to the disposal. Full relief from CGT applies on a gain arising in respect of a transfer of qualifying assets on or after 1 January 2014, where the market value of the assets is &euro;3m or less. Where the market value of the assets is greater than &euro;3m and the disposal is on or after 1 January 2014, section 599 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that relief will apply as if the value of the assets transferred were &euro;3m. Only the gain on the amount in excess of &euro;3m will be charged to CGT at the rate of 33%.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the details supplied I should clarify that if an individual is aged 66 or over and transfers qualifying assets to their children, and if the value is more than &euro;3m, relief is given to the individual transferring the assets on the gain up to the amount of &euro;3m.</p>  <p>  Marginal relief does not apply in the case of transfers by individuals aged 66 or over to their children. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to amend the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of this matter.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. </p>  <p>  However, I do accept that it is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise the market and deal with factors contributing to the cost of insurance.  Consequently, I established the Cost of Insurance Working Group and appointed Minister of State Eoghan Murphy as Chair. The Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was finalised in December 2016, approved by Cabinet on 10 January, 2017, and subsequently published.  It contains 33 recommendations and 71 actions which are detailed in an action plan contained in the Report with agreed timelines for implementation.  Work on carrying out these recommendations is well underway and I am confident that the report's 71 action points will be implemented by the end of 2018, with 45 due for completion this year.  The Working Group continues to meet regularly and will report on a quarterly basis detailing its progress.  As part of its second phase, the Working Group is now examining issues related to Employer Liability and Public Liability insurance including the impact of the cost of insurance on the competitiveness of particular business sectors. </p>  <p>  With regard to the road passenger industry in particular, the issues are in the main similar to those affecting drivers generally, notwithstanding that there are risks that are specific to the sector.  While there is no simple solution to reduce the cost of insurance, I believe that with cooperation and commitment between all parties, fairer premiums can be delivered for consumers, including coach companies, without unnecessary delay.  This in turn should lead to greater stability in the pricing of motor insurance and should help prevent the volatility that we have seen in the market in the past. It should also better facilitate new entrants to the market.  Taken together, these measures should address many of the issues raised by the road passenger industry.</p></reply>

This in turn should lead to the increased availability of flood insurance.  To achieve this aim, there is a focus on:</p>  <p>  - prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities, </p>  <p>  - development and implementation of plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes, and </p>  <p>  - improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas. </p>  <p>  This strategy is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance companies in Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed.  In this regard, the Insurance Ireland/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.  A further meeting of this working group is scheduled this month. </p>  <p>  A sub-group has also been set up to explore the technical and administrative arrangements that may allow for the further sharing of data on flood insurance cover for those 300 areas where OPW has mapped flood risk through the CFRAM programme.  The first meeting of this sub-group was held in January. </p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, the consumer has already recourse to the Financial Services Ombudsman to make a complaint in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.  In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.  </p></reply>

Dividend payments are therefore made to the ISIF. Payments from the ISIF to the Exchequer arising from the proceeds of the disposal of the State's shareholdings in the Banks are provided for under the NTMA (Amendment) Act 2014. This legislation allows the Minister to direct the Agency to make such payments after having consulted the Agency.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the sale of financial assets, these type of transactions do not result in a beneficial impact to the General Government Balance (GGB) under the European System of Accounts (ESA) framework. This is due to the fact that it is classified as a 'financial transaction' whereby it is essentially the exchange of one form of asset (shares, equities, loans) for another kind (cash). Consequently, the sale of any shareholding in Allied Irish Bank (AIB) would not count as general government revenue. Accordingly, there will not be increased capacity to spend on capital projects as a result of the sale of shares in AIB without affecting the general government balance.</p>  <p>  However, while not improving the deficit, cash proceeds arising from the sale of AIB shares that are transferred to the Exchequer would reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement and ultimately result in lower general government debt. A lower level of debt is not only beneficial in terms of the fiscal sustainability of the State but would also result in reduced interest payments in future years. The strategy of reducing the national debt is consistent with the Government policy of repaying the borrowing previously undertaken to finance the recapitalisation of the banking sector during the financial crisis. It is my view, therefore, that because public indebtedness rose partly due to the recapitalisation of the Banks, it is appropriate to use one-off revenue from divesting the State of its banking assets to reduce debt </p>  <p>  Regarding proceeds from dividends, these are typically recorded as property income in the ESA framework. Therefore any dividend payments would be recorded as General Government Revenue and, as such, would improve the General Government Balance. </p>  <p>  As to what this revenue can be spent on, money in the Exchequer is fungible. Accordingly, there is no linkage between specific receipts and specific expenditures.</p></reply>

This represents an increase of around 12% compared to 2016 levels.</p>  <p>  - VAT on goods either (i) imported into Ireland from outside the EU and paid at the point of entry; or (ii) on exciseable goods released from bonded warehouses; accounts for around 12% of receipts in the period. This represents an increase of 34% compared to 2016 levels.</p>  <p>  - VAT receipts received under the Mini One Stop Shop (VAT MOSS) account for around 4% of receipts in the period. On 1 January 2015, new EU VAT rules came into effect changing the place of supply in respect of all supplies of telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic (TBE) services to consumers from the place where the supplier is located to the place where the consumer resides. VAT MOSS, which is an optional scheme, also came into operation on 1 January 2015 allowing business to submit returns and pay the relevant VAT due to Member States through the web portal of one Member State, instead of having to register for VAT in multiple Member States.</p>  <p>  - VAT receipts of around &euro;15 million were collected through settlement of audits and other compliance interventions in the period.  In addition to the above, I am advised that:</p>  <p>  - VAT collected by Revenue and remitted to other Member States for services under the EU rules governing the place of supply TBE services totalled &euro;244 million in January and February 2017. The total value of payments due to other Member States, but not yet remitted to them is less than &euro;1 million.</p>  <p>  - The value of VAT repayments made as part of normal business activity in the period was approximately &euro;670 million. All figures noted above are provisional and may be revised.</p></reply>

The intention to make a disclosure has been indicated to Revenue in two other cases, and a payment on account of &euro;47,000 has been made in one of them.</p>  <p>  The work of Revenue s offshore assets project has been undertaken primarily by way of enquiry letters issued on the basis of information relating to offshore transactions that Revenue obtained from financial institutions on foot of High Court orders. In the period from 2010 to 2016, 8,942 enquiry letters were issued, and most of these enquiries were resolved through explanations provided about the offshore transactions in question. During those years, settlements amounting to some &euro;71 million in tax, interest and penalties were made in 525 cases, including a number of cases involving voluntary disclosures.</p>  <p>  The data received by Revenue on foot of High Court Orders included information showing movements of funds in and out of solicitors  accounts. Some 730 cases of this kind have been identified and, after conclusion of legal issues arising from earlier enquiries, Revenue issued 47 enquiry letters to solicitors in 2015 and 67 in 2016. This work is ongoing.</p>  <p>  The international environment is changing with closer co-operation and information sharing between tax authorities worldwide aimed at identifying those who hide their profits or gains offshore. Ireland has been an early adopter of such initiatives including FATCA   the Inter-Governmental Agreement to share financial account information with the United States and the OECD Common Reporting Standard. In this context I introduced specific measures in the Finance Act 2016 to ensure that from 1 May 2017, tax defaulters whose default relates directly or indirectly to offshore matters will be unable to avail of the benefits of the current disclosure regime. It makes no sense to provide an incentive, in the form of a disclosure regime for defaulters, in respect of information which Revenue will have, as a result of these exchange of information initiatives. </p>  <p>  If a taxpayer has tax compliance issues relating to offshore matters there is however still an opportunity, if they come forward before 1 May 2017, to avail of the current qualifying disclosure benefits. These are set out in the Code of Practice for Revenue Audit and other Compliance Interventions (the Code) and include reduced penalties, avoiding publication in the list of tax defaulters and not being investigated by Revenue with a view to prosecution. Full details of the Code and the disclosure scheme, including Frequently Asked Questions, are available on the Revenue website.</p></reply>

The number of builders that have been approved as qualifying contractors, and whose details are published on the Revenue website, is 115.</p><p>Furthermore, the number of Help To Buy (HTB) applications received up to 7 March 2017 was:<table><tr><th>No. of Applications</th><th>Successful applications</th><th>*Pending</th></tr><tr><td>3,753</td><td>1,488</td><td>2,265</td></tr></table></p><p>*Pending means that the applicants either have to file an outstanding return or address a compliance issue, the application is to be reviewed by Revenue, or the applicant needs to finalise his or her application.  The processing time for pending applications depends on the time it takes an applicant to resolve any outstanding matters and Revenue is encouraging prospective applicants to file any necessary tax returns and resolve any outstanding issues before making the HTB application.We are all aware that purchasing a home is a lengthy and potentially complex process.  Revenue has designed the online HTB application, claim and verification processes to be straightforward and easy-to-follow.  It is very important, however, that all applicants have filed any necessary returns or cleared up any outstanding matters or balances on their record, in advance.The bulk of applicants to date are PAYE taxpayers and if a Form 12 tax return is outstanding it can be filed online very quickly by using 'PAYE Services' in myAccount.  If there is a tax due it can be paid using the 'Payments' facility in myAccount.A HTB application can be approved very quickly, where there are no outstanding issues.</p><p>Once an application is successful, the time taken for the claim to be submitted depends on the claimant.  If he or she has already purchased a home or drawn down the first tranche of the mortgage, then the necessary evidence is available for the claim to be made.</p><p>The required evidence for first-time purchasers is a signed contract, mortgage agreement, deposit details and details of the property.  When the claim is made the first-time buyer needs to give the HTB Claim number and access code to the Qualifying Contractor so they can verify the claim and input the bank account details to facilitate payment.</p><p>The required evidence for first-time self-build claimants is evidence of drawdown of the first tranche of the mortgage and details of the property.  When the claim is made the first-time self-builder needs to give the HTB Claim number and access code to the solicitor who can verify the claim and input the necessary loan bank details to facilitate payment to the self-builder's mortgage institution.  Once the claim is verified by the contractor or solicitor, the refund can be made very quickly thereafter.  More detailed information and guidance regarding these requirements is available on the Revenue website.</p><p>Of the 1,488 successful applications there have been 562 claims, which is about 40% of the total.  230 claims have been verified and paid and 332 pending verification, as set out below.  <table><tr><th></th><th>Claims</th><th>Verified &amp;amp; Paid</th><th>Pending verification</th></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>562</td><td>230</td><td>332</td></tr></table></p><p>Claims are verified by the qualifying contractor for first-time home purchases or by the solicitor for first-time self-built homes.  Of the 115 Qualifying contractors listed on the Revenue website, I am advised that over half of these have already verified claims and received refunds.  Additionally, over 60 solicitors have registered their details and 14 of them have already verified self-build claims.</p><p>Up to 7 March 2017, &euro;3.48 million has been refunded in HTB claims.  This is in line with my Budget estimates, as we expected a number of retrospective cases to make claims early in 2017.  Of the 230 claims verified and paid, 158 are retrospective cases.</p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that income tax returns in respect of 2016 are not yet available.  </p>  <p>  Prior to the announcement of the introduction of the EIC in Budget 2016, it was estimated that, based on 2013 returns, the number of income earners who would be in a position to benefit from the introduction of the EIC would be in the order of 112,000.  Based on the most recent data (2014 returns) and on the basis of the qualifying criteria announced in Budget 2016, it is now estimated that the number of income earners who would currently be in a position to benefit from the EIC is in the order of 147,500.</p>  <p>  The EIC is available to taxpayers with active self-employed trading or professional income and to business owners or managers who do not have access to the PAYE credit on employment (salary) income from their business.  The credit was increased in Budget 2017 from &euro;550 to &euro;950.  If an income earner also qualifies for the PAYE tax credit, the combined value of both the EIC and the PAYE tax credit cannot exceed &euro;1,650.</p></reply>

To estimate the yield from these amendments into the future requires predicting changes in property prices as well as behavioural changes; as such it is still too early for the Department or Revenue to estimate any potential yield beyond 2017. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to identify separately any element of the combined yield from the two measures in the tax yield in January and February 2017.</p></reply>

This exemption is referred to as the "dwelling house exemption".  In Section 52 of Finance Act 2016, I made changes to this exemption with respect to gifts or inheritances taken on or after 25 December 2016.  The changes have two principal effects.</p>  <p>  Firstly, the dwelling house exemption is generally only available for inheritances.  With one exception, it is no longer possible to receive a tax-free gift of a dwelling house.  The exception is where a person gifts a dwelling house to a dependent relative.  For this purpose, a dependent relative is a direct relative of the donor, or of the donor's spouse or civil partner, who is permanently and totally incapacitated because of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or who is over the age of 65. </p>  <p>  Secondly, the inherited dwelling house must have been the deceased person's principal private residence at the date of his or her death.  This requirement is relaxed in situations where the deceased person had ceased to occupy the house before the date of death because of ill health; for example, to live in a nursing home.</p>  <p>  The recent changes made to the dwelling house exemption have no retrospective implications for gifts or inheritances of houses received before 25 December 2016.  The conditions that have to be met to qualify for an exemption and to avoid any subsequent withdrawal of the exemption are those that are in force at the date of the gift or the inheritance.  With regard to the specific circumstances provided by the Deputy, if the qualifying conditions were met on the gift of the house three years ago, a withdrawal of the exemption will not arise if that individual continues to occupy the house for the six year period following the gift.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, it is likely that the recent exchange rate movements may signal a longer term, rather than cyclical, change in the value of Sterling. </p><p>These challenges make the current range of Government supports for the provision of credit even more vital.  State backed, low cost, flexible credit can assist SMEs to restructure their cost bases and re-price their products and services so that they can continue trading with the UK in the weaker Sterling environment.  Loans made to SMEs, on the basis of viable business plans, can also give them the opportunity to diversify into other markets and reduce their exposure to the UK. </p><p>In this context, it is encouraging to note that SMEs can access lower cost, flexible finance from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).  To the end of December 2016, the SBCI has lent &euro;544 million to 12,593 SMEs supporting an estimated 67,150 jobs.  The SBCI's goal is to increase the availability of funding to SMEs at a lower cost and on more flexible terms than has been available in recent times on the Irish market.  The SMEs who received SBCI finance are from a variety of business and economic sectors.  More than 80% of loans are for investment purposes and the average loan size is &euro;43,200.  There is a broad regional spread of the SMEs supported, with 84.8% of them based outside Dublin. </p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs 2017 has committed the Government to roll out an Export Finance Initiative to support Irish exporting SMEs this year.  Officials from my Department are working with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the SBCI, Enterprise Ireland and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to develop a product that will support the working capital needs of exporting Irish SMEs.  It is intended to launch this Initiative on a pilot basis initially, for a period of one year.  As part of this process, my Department and the SBCI are engaging with DG Comp to address any potential State Aid issues.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that, aside from the SBCI, there are significant Government measures to support the financing needs of SMEs that are facing challenges.  These measures include the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices and the Credit Review Office. </p><p>The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is a cross-government initiative.  By answering eight simple questions, SMEs will receive a tailored list of available Government supports to suit their needs.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at .  </p><p>The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.  Further information is available on the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation website. </p><p>The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, is an additional source of credit that provides loans for up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people.  Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund <i>(</i><i></i>).</p><p>The Credit Review Office<b></b>(CRO) is another government initiative that helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank.  The CRO overturns more than 50% of appeals it receives.  Further details are available at <i></i></p><p>Another recent initiative is the &euro;150 million Agri Cashflow Support Loan Fund announced in Budget 2017 and developed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in conjunction with the SBCI.  This fund will provide highly flexible, low interest loans to farming SMEs to assist them in addressing the current difficult market conditions and commodity price volatility. </p><p>Government has and continues to work to ensure that the wide range of State supports currently available are tailored so that they provide effective support to SMEs affected by emerging challenges.</p></reply>

However, the provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks.  In my role as Minister for Finance, I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation, and neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses.</p>  <p>  While it is not possible for me to comment in detail on this matter in the absence of details of the particular properties in Sallins, I have been advised by the Office of Public Works that a grant of &euro;500,000 to Kildare County Council was approved on 1st June 2010 for funding towards Flood Alleviation Works, under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works Scheme.  Kildare County Council has confirmed that by 2012, this 'Culvert Upgrade and Embankment at Sallins' project was completed which aimed to reduce the risk to the Waterways Estate in particular.  I understand that these works were completed to the 1:100 year flood event standard.  </p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland has informed me  that its members, since 1 June 2014, have factored data on all completed flood defence schemes, provided by the OPW, into its assessment of flood risk within these areas.  This information has been provided as part of an information sharing arrangement entered into between OPW and Insurance Ireland (Memorandum of Understanding).  The nature of this arrangement is such that it should lead to a greater availability of flood cover in previously higher risk areas, and at better prices. </p>  <p>  The most recent Insurance Ireland survey of approximately 85% of the property insurance market in Ireland indicates that of the 16 completed defence schemes, 90% of policies in areas benefitting from permanent flood defences include flood cover, while 77% of policies in areas benefitting from demountable defences include flood cover.  The particular issues in relation to the remainder of policies is actively being explored with the insurance industry through a working group in which the OPW, the insurance industry and the Department of Finance participate.  Further meetings of this group are scheduled this month.</p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.  In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.</p></reply>

This amount matched by equal amounts from our European Social Fund (ESF) allocation and from the Exchequer, giving an overall allocation of &euro;204m.  The YEI is integrated into ESF programming as a dedicated priority axis within the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020.   Seven actions were originally selected for YEI funding, namely the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance; JobBridge; JobsPlus Incentive Scheme; T&uacute;s; Youthreach, Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme and Momentum.  These actions are underway and are being fully funded up-front by the Exchequer.  </p>  <p>  This funding is available for drawdown before the end of 2018 and while a claim for funding has not been made to date it is expected that the funding will be fully drawn down.  The ESF Managing Authority and the Operational Programme Monitoring Committee (PMC) maintain an ongoing overview of the funding allocations under the PEIL and will re-allocate the available funding as required, in accordance with the EU Regulatory provisions.  The PMC has agreed in principle to the inclusion of the Community Training Centres, which are funded by the ETBs in consultation with SOLAS, as an approved activity under the YEI with effect from 1 January 2017. </p>  <p>  The ESF co-financed Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) for the period 2014-2020, contains a total budget of &euro;1.153 billion, comprising ESF and Exchequer contributions of &euro;542.43m each and an EU Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) budget contribution of &euro;68.145m.   The overall YEI allocation is &euro;204m.   The PEIL includes proposed allocations for over 20 activities, including the YEI, being implemented across a range of bodies.  </p>  <p>  While no claim for funding has been made to date, it is expected that the funding allocated will be fully drawn down during the programming period.  Furthermore, as the activities concerned are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer there is no resulting reduction or delay in the funding available to those activities.</p>  <p>  The ESF Managing Authority, within my Department and the Operational Programme Monitoring Committee (PMC) maintain an ongoing overview of the funding allocations under the PEIL and will re-allocate the available funding as required, in accordance with the EU Regulatory provisions, over the lifetime of the PEIL.   </p>  <p>  Under the ESF Regulations, initial and annual pre-financing is provided by the Commission, resulting in receipts of &euro;51.8m for the PEIL to date.  Of this &euro;51.8m, &euro;28.3m relates to ESF advances and &euro;23.5m relates to YEI advances.  &euro;20.4m (&euro;18m ESF and &euro;2.4m YEI) of these receipts have been distributed, while the remaining &euro;31.4m (&euro;10.3m ESF and &euro;21.1m YEI) has or will be reimbursed to the Commission in the absence of a claim being made.  Work on the designation of the relevant ESF authorities, including the provision of a national computerised accounting and information system for EU funds to meet the 2014-2020 functionality requirements is continuing. </p>  <p>  I understand that my Department expects that this designation work will be completed in the coming months and that it is proposed to commence the preparation of a first interim claim for payment from the Commission once the process of designation has concluded.  This claim will be made within the EU Regulatory deadlines to ensure no loss of ESF receipts.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-09a.293.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017030900067#WRF02900"><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that new Circulars which provide details of the scheme for the new model for allocating special education teachers to mainstream schools have now been published on my Departments website.  DES Circular 0013/2017 provides details for primary schools while DES Circular 0014/2017 sets out the position for post primary schools.</p><p>Schools will also receive details of their allocations under the new model this week.</p><p>The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p><p>No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p><p>An additional 900 teaching posts will be provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011, when 5265 teachers were allocated, as opposed to provision for 7542 posts in the current school year.</p><p>The additional funding will provide extra supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model. Supports for children with special educational needs is a huge priority for this Government.  We currently spend over &euro;1.6 billion, or one fifth of the total education budget, on supports for children with special educational needs. </p><p>This investment will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils who require such support. </p><p>Under the new allocation model, schools will be provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile. </p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need and pupils in each school. </p><p>Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school's profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as they will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils, or pupils transferring in to the school, who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p><p>DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools. </p><p>Schools will be able to appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017/18 allocation.</p><p>In advance of the submission of an appeal, schools should read carefully the DES circulars and in particular the relevant section, which relates to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.</p><p>Taking this into account, the NCSE will publish details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: on 20th March 2017.  Should a school wish to appeal they should do so by March 31st 2017. </p><p>The appeal will consist of a review of whether the correct data was correctly applied to one, or all, of the components of the schools profile and a correct allocation made.  It is envisaged that decisions on the appeals will issue to the relevant schools by 31st May 2017.</p></reply>

This includes investment in top quality researchers, physical infrastructure, equipment and structures to commercialise research. </p><p>Investment in research is key element of overall enterprise policy and seeks to drive innovation and competitiveness in business and the public sector and enable the creation of sustainable jobs.  Higher education institutions are central to the delivery of this ambition.</p><p>In that context, the Deputy may already be aware that the national IP Protocol &ldquo;Putting public research to work in Ireland&rdquo; was developed by a task group comprised of leaders from industry, the investment community and TTOs in 2012.  The new protocol built on earlier guidelines and codes of practice, using the lessons learned from their use. </p><p>In 2013 the Government established a centralised function with responsibility for technology transfer in the State which led to the creation of Knowledge Transfer Ireland, launched in May 2014.  Knowledge Transfer Ireland (KTI) now has responsibility for setting direction for research performing organisations (RPOs) best practice to enable compliance with IP policy and procedures.</p><p>The publication of the national IP protocol in 2012, and its subsequent refresh in 2016, sought to establish policy and guidelines on the interactions between industry and Ireland&rsquo;s Higher Education Institutes, including the treatment of intellectual property.  It provides guidelines and sets expectations for the RPOs and for industry.</p><p>The national IP Protocol 2016 comprises two volumes:</p><p>-  the National IP Protocol policy document which sets out the framework underpinning research collaboration and access to intellectual property from state-funded research</p><p>- the IP Protocol Resource Guide which provides an overview of the national IP management guidelines and links to resources and template documents, available for industry and RPOs.  It also provides an overview of the knowledge transfer structures in Ireland and the kinds of agreements that can be used to formalise research-industry engagements.</p><p>The protocol explains the National IP Management Requirements and requires that RPOs have in place and operate internal IP management systems that meet or exceed these.  The protocol also includes &ldquo;good practice&rdquo; that will normally be followed.  However, industry and RPOs are free to adopt a different approach where this is in the best interests of successful relationships and research commercialisation.Practices are also highlighted that may be followed if industry / RPOs choose to do so.</p><p>The IP Protocol is a key reference source for Ireland&rsquo;s HEIs and research funders. HEIs have developed IP policies that are in line with national guidelines and good practice.  These will include policy on spin-out formation.  The detail of policies will differ amongst institutions. </p><p>The research funding agencies for the publicly funded research system all require that the higher education institutions own the intellectual property arising from research projects that they fund.  Each University and IoT has a set of policies that cover how they will govern the use of that IP.</p><p>The national IP Protocol explains that commercialisation may benefit HEIs and provide incentives to the researchers involved in creating IP.  IP may include protectable IP and know-how.  Furthermore, the national IP management requirements make provision for HEIs to have in place a system for sharing of income from commercialising within the organisation, including with relevant researchers.</p><p>It is international practice that researchers may hold shares in spin-out companies.  The national IP Protocol makes it clear that HEIs should have policies and procedures in place that minimise or manage potential or actual conflicts of interest concerning the commercialisation of IP.</p><p>The IP Protocol (National IP Management Requirements) refers to conflict of interest as it applies to commercialisation of IP.</p><p>The national IP Protocol is clear on the policy and processes to identify, protect and commercialise IP that arises in HEIs.  This includes guidance on licensing of IP.  A suite of Model Agreements, available for use if HEIs and companies choose, covering a range of IP licensing scenarios is available on the KTI website.</p><p>In addition, all HEIs are requested yearly as part of their governance statements to state that a code of conduct for Governing Body members and a Code of Conduct for Employees has been adopted and is being monitored.  Guidelines for these codes are included in the IOT and University Codes of Governance (section 3.2).</p><p>The University Code of Governance has been implemented since 2007 and was updated in 2012.  A copy of the code is available here:  <i></i></p><p>The Institutes of Technology Code of Governance published in 2012 replaces an earlier document published in 2003: A copy of the code is available here:</p><p><i></i></p><p>At institutional level, the Code of Conduct for employees and members of governing authorises would include statements related to conflict of interest and outside employment.  </p><p>For example, one institution policy states: </p><p>&ldquo;Any employment, business or professional interest, including shareholdings, directorships, professional relationships and so forth that could involve a conflict of interest or could materially influence the member in relation to the performance of his/her functions as a member of the Authority.  If, during the duration of his/her membership any new development on the lines outlined above transpires, the member should advise the Secretary.&rdquo;</p><p>Implementation of the policies and procedures outlined above are a matter for the institutions in the first instance.  My officials have been made aware that there is an internal review underway in one institution with a view to confirming that the institution&rsquo;s interest had been appropriately represented and protected, all relevant policies, protocols and procedures had been complied with and satisfactory governance processes had been applied.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-09a.322.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017030900068#WRG01800"><p>Under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, the Government committed that compulsory redundancy would not apply to public servants.  This protection is not available to staff who are outside the terms of that Agreement.  By deciding to reject the Lansdowne Road Agreement, the ASTI has placed its members outside that Agreement and therefore the Agreement&rsquo;s benefits and protections will not apply to its members.  The Department of Education and Skills made this position clear to the ASTI prior to its recent ballot.</p>  <p>  The redeployment process takes place in the first half of each year and takes effect from the start of the following school year.  The process operates and deals with any surplus for the following school year.  </p>  <p>   The staffing and redeployment process for the 2017/18 school year is currently underway in the Department.  Last month, 60 secondary schools were identified as possible surplus schools for the 2017/18 school year.  These 60 schools received a letter notifying them of their surplus and were given an opportunity to respond to same.  This represents the total number of schools where potential surpluses could arise. </p>  <p>  However, at this stage of the process it is too early to say what the final position as regards the level of surplus will be, either generally or in particular schools.  The level of surplus is influenced by many factors including retirements, career breaks, job-sharing etc. and additional allocations for the forthcoming year in respect of demographics.  This continues to evolve as new information is received from relevant schools.  Given that Budgets 2016 and 2017 did not negatively impact on teacher allocations, it would not be surprising that the level of redeployment would be lower than in recent years. </p>  <p>  The Department expects to know the final position in relation to the number of surplus teachers by late March.  This is no different to what transacted in the previous years.</p></reply>

The Agreement also applies to teachers employed in Designated Community Colleges, Community and Comprehensive Schools and Voluntary Secondary Schools who are TUI members and who have identified themselves as such through submission of the &ldquo;LRA Teacher Consent Form&rdquo; attached to the Circular.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2013 and 2015 as set out in Section 3 of the Circular applies to all other teachers employed in Designated Community Colleges, Community and Comprehensive Schools and Voluntary Secondary Schools.  The circular is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and can be accessed at:</p><p>In addition, a comprehensive FAQ document is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website:  </p><p>As is the norm with public service collective agreements, the Lansdowne Road Agreement was negotiated with trade unions which are recognised as representing staff in the public service (including teachers).  It is normal practice in the public service that the decision of the trade union recognised as holding representative rights for a particular grade or sector will determine the position for all relevant staff in that grade/sector.  This context does not allow for acceptance or rejection of collective agreements by staff on an individual basis.</p><p>Accordingly, there is no proposal at this time to treat teachers separately based on the fact that they are not a member of a trade union.  However, since the announcement of the ASTI ballot result my Department has received a number of queries from both ASTI members and teachers who are not members of a trade union about union membership.  Therefore, having regard to the circumstances of the dispute with the ASTI, this is an issue that I will keep under review going forward.</p></reply>

The DEIS Plan for 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy.</p><p>A key element of DEIS Plan 2017 is the availability of a new identification process for the assessment of schools for inclusion in DEIS using centrally held CSO and DES data.  </p><p>The key data sources are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.  This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  This data is applied uniformly across all schools in the country.  Through the use of centrally held data, schools were not required to submit an application for inclusion in the programme.</p><p>Further information on the development of the identification process is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at </p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.  Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme.</p><p>Schools included in the list published by my Department on 13th February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  This includes 15 new Urban Band 1 schools, 30 Urban Band 2 schools raised to Urban Band 1 status, 51 new Rural DEIS schools and 13 new Post Primary DEIS schools. </p><p>Schools which have not been included or upgraded at this stage, including the school referred to by the Deputy, are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new model, which is fair and objective.</p><p>The new DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to social_inclusion@education.gov.ie</p><p>It is important to note that the school details published on 13th February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. </p><p>However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.</p><p>Once this work has been completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p><p>In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.</p><p>It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.</p></reply>

DES Circular 0013/2017 provides details of the scheme for primary schools while DES Circular 0014/2017 sets out the position for post primary schools.</p>  <p>  Schools will also receive details of their allocations under the new model this week.</p>  <p>  The new allocation model replaces the previous system of a General Allocation Model for Primary school and resource teaching allocations from the National Council for Special Education, with a single allocation for schools.</p>  <p>  The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts will be provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011, when 5265 teachers were allocated, as opposed to provision for 7542 posts in the current school year.</p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide extra supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model. Supports for children with special educational needs is a huge priority for this Government.  We currently spend over &euro;1.6 billion, or one fifth of the total education budget, on supports for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  This investment will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils who require such support. </p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model, schools will be provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile. </p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need and pupils in each school. </p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school's profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as they will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils, or pupils transferring in to the school, who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline the basis on which the allocations have been made to schools.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p><p>The NCSE recently published a list of special classes for the 2016/17 school year. In total there will be 1,153 special classes available, which is an increase of over 100% in the number of special classes which were available in 2011, which was 548.</p><p>The NCSE has advised that for this school year there will be 127 early intervention classes, 525 primary ASD classes and 237 post-primary ASD classes, which represents an increase of approx. 16% on 2015/16 classes for children with autism. </p><p>The NCSE continues to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas and has capacity to establish such new special classes where necessary subject to the willingness of schools to open classes.</p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on www.ncse.ie in county order.</p><p>The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents/guardians of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  However, parents of children with special needs who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) as soon as possible for information on available places. The local SENO contact details are available on <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p><p>Children with autism may also be eligible for home tuition if a school placement is not available for them and/or where a determination is awaited in respect of an expulsion or refusal to enrol taken under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998.  Details in relation to the Home Tuition schemes are available on my Department's website at  <i>www.education.ie.</i></p><p>Home Tuition will not be available where a school placement has been identified by the NCSE.  Similarly, failure to enrol a child in school will not give rise to eligibility under this scheme.</p><p>As the matter raised by the Deputy refers to a particular child, I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be forwarded to the National Council for Special Education for their attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

DES Circular 0013/2017 provides details for primary schools while DES Circular 0014/2017 sets out the position for post primary schools.</p>  <p>  Schools will also receive details of their allocations under the new model this week.</p>  <p>  The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs. Large amounts of research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year. No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts will be provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model. The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools. This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011, when 5265 teachers were allocated, as opposed to provision for 7542 posts in the current school year.</p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide extra supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model. Supports for children with special educational needs is a huge priority for this Government. We currently spend over &euro;1.6 billion, or one fifth of the total education budget, on supports for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  This investment will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils who require such support. </p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model, schools will be provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile. </p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need and pupils in each school. </p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school's profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as they will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils, or pupils transferring in to the school, who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline fully the basis on which the allocations have been made to schools.</p></reply>

The DEIS Plan for 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy.</p><p>A key element of the DEIS Plan 2017 is the availability of a new identification process for the assessment of schools for inclusion in DEIS using centrally held CSO and DES data.</p><p>The key data sources are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area. Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools. The data is applied uniformly across all schools in the country.  There is no adjustment to take account of whether the schools is an &quot;all boys&quot; or an &quot;all girls&quot; school.</p><p>Further information on the development of the identification process is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at<i></i></p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme. Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme.</p><p>Schools included in the list published by my Department on 13th February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  This includes 15 new Urban Band 1 schools, 30 Urban Band 2 schools raised to Urban Band 1 status, 51 new Rural DEIS schools and 13 new Post Primary DEIS schools. </p><p>Schools which have not been included at this stage are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new model which is fair and objective.</p><p>In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others. Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006. The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy's queries as regards Special Education resources, new Circulars setting out the scheme for the new model for allocating special education teachers to mainstream schools have now been published on my Departments website. DES Circular 0013/2017 provides details for primary schools while DES Circular 0014/2017 sets out the position for post primary schools.</p><p>Under the new allocation model, schools will be provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile. </p><p>The Circulars set out the reason why the social context of the school has been taken into account in developing the school profiles.</p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need and pupils in each school. </p><p>Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school's profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as they will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils, or pupils transferring in to the school, who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis. The allocations include provision for additional teaching support to be made for pupils with specific learning disabilities such as Dyslexia.</p><p>For students who start school from September 2017, either in junior infants or transferring from another school, the resources they need will already be in the school under the new model and guidelines will be provided to schools in relation to how they should manage their allocations to ensure that all pupils who needs additional teaching support can receive such support.</p><p>DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline fully the basis on which the allocations have been made to schools.</p></reply>

In the case referred to, as the activity was not a class of activity set out in either Annex 1 or 2 of the EIA Directive, nor was it within a Natura 2000 site, an EIA was not required.The application was subject to the normal public consultation process which ran from 12 December 2009 until 15 January 2010. The application was advertised in the Southern Star newspaper and the application documents were displayed in Bantry Garda Station for the duration of the public consultation period. There were no submissions on the application from members of the public.</p><p>In addition to the public consultation process, written submissions were received from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Underwater Archaeology Unit of the Dept of the Environment, the Marine Survey Office, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board, the Central Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute. The views submitted by these bodies were considered in the context of the decision on the licence application.</p><p>The licence granted in this case is to mechanically harvest specific types of seaweed within certain specified zones in Bantry Bay, on a rotational basis. 5 zones for harvesting within the bay are identified as A, B, C, D, and E on the map supporting the application. E is divided into E1 and E2. Only one of the zones marked as C, D, E1 and E2 will be harvested annually allowing for a four year regeneration. The A &amp;amp; B zones are stand by areas only to be harvested if conditions do not allow for harvesting in zones C to E. The effect of this is that although the licence covers an area of some 750 hectares, the annual harvest will be restricted to less than 200 hectares per annum, a very small percentage of the area of the bay. </p><p>The licence is on a trial basis, subject to strict monitoring and should provide valuable scientific information which can feed into further policy development in this area.</p><p>All of the details regarding the application, supporting documentation and maps identifying the areas described above can be found at the following link: <i></i></p></reply>

The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. I am satisfied that the current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this - they provide for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources. However, a review of the income eligibility limits for social housing supports as part of the broader social housing reform agenda set out in the Social Housing Strategy 2020 is scheduled to commence later this year.</p></reply>

It should also be noted that the provision of land rather than houses remains the default position if the developer wishes to exercise that option. In addition, some developments completed in 2016 may have been subject to older Part V agreements made before 1 September 2015, when other options - such as a financial contribution, the provision of fully or partially serviced sites or the provision of land elsewhere in the functional area of the planning authority - were available. </p><p>It is anticipated that over the lifetime of the <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness,</i>at least 4,700 new social homes will be delivered through the Part V mechanism.

PIA is the process by which government departments, local authorities and State agencies assess policies and programmes at design, implementation and review stages in relation to the likely impact that they will have or have had on poverty and on inequalities which are likely to lead to poverty, with a view to poverty reduction.</p>  <p>  In line with this requirement, the Cabinet Handbook states that memoranda for Government involving significant policy proposals should "indicate clearly the impact of the proposal on groups in poverty or at risk of falling into poverty".  Poverty Impact Assessment is also fully embedded in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) process, as per Department of An Taoiseach Revised RIA Guidelines 2009.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of individual government departments and other bodies developing policy to undertake a poverty impact assessment in adherence with official guidelines.  The Guidelines for Poverty Impact Assessment 2008 and templates for process requirements are available on the Department&rsquo;s website at: www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/PIAGuidelines.pdf.</p>  <p>  The Government decided in 2012 to incorporate PIA into an integrated social impact assessment (SIA) in order to support the implementation of the national social target for poverty reduction and to ensure greater policy coordination in the social sphere.  SIA is an evidence-based methodology which estimates the likely distributive effects of policies on household incomes, families, poverty and access to employment.  My Department undertakes rigorous and extensive ex-ante and ex-post SIAs of the main welfare and direct tax budgetary policies using the ESRI&rsquo;s tax/benefit micro simulation model, SWITCH.  The Department has published ex-post SIAs of the main welfare and direct tax measures in annual budgets, since Budget 2013.  They are available on the Department&rsquo;s website at: www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Examples-.aspx.</p></reply>

There was a 47% increase in applications from 2012 and a 20% increase in applications in 2016 over 2015.</p>  <p>  Once a claim is in payment, any one of the 71,850 carers can seek a review at any stage and my Department seeks to process these requests as quickly as possible.

CA is a means-tested social assistance payment, made to persons who are providing full-time care and attention to a person who has a disability such that they require that level of care.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify, applicants must show that they are habitually resident in the State, that their means are less than the statutory limit, that they are providing full-time care and attention and that the person being cared for requires full-time care and attention.</p>  <p>  Once claims are in payment, my Department periodically reviews them to ensure that there is continued entitlement.  Depending on the circumstances in each case and to make best use of resources, a review may only concentrate on a specific condition of entitlement.</p>  <p>  For example, when reviewing the entitlement of a carer who cares for an elderly person with dementia, only the means or provision of care would be reviewed.  My department would not review the need of the care recipient for full-time care and attention.</p>  <p>  In other cases, a review may be carried out to confirm that full-time care and attention is still being provided to a care recipient by a carer.  In such a case there may be no need to review the carer&rsquo;s means.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a person can at any stage request their own review of entitlement.  Normally such a review request is only in relation to the person&rsquo;s means and my Department would be unlikely to review the other conditions unless there were indications that those conditions were no longer being satisfied.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The estimated cost in a full year of increasing the weekly personal rate of Disability Allowance by &euro;20, from &euro;193 to &euro;213 per week, is &euro;140.3 million. Each &euro;1 increase in the weekly personal rate would cost &euro;7.0 million in 2018 and a full year.</p>  <p>  There is an analogous social insurance payment, Invalidity Pension, which is paid to persons who are permanently incapable of work (subject to satisfying the relevant medical criteria and the minimum number of paid PRSI contributions).  Each &euro;1 increase in the weekly personal rate of Invalidity Pension would cost &euro;3.2 million in a full year.</p>  <p>  In addition, Blind pension is available for those aged 18 to 66 who are blind or visually impaired.  The cost of a &euro;1 weekly personal increase in the Blind Pension is &euro;0.07 million in a full year.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that (i) in the event of the Disability Allowance weekly rate exceeding the Invalidity Pension rate, some Invalidity pensioners (number not determinable) would transfer to the means tested Disability Allowance scheme to avail of the higher rate on that scheme; (ii) the costs shown above do not include the cost of proportionate increases for qualified adults; (iii) any additional costs which might arise as some persons in receipt of other welfare schemes might potentially apply for and qualify for Disability Allowance thereby also benefitting from a higher rate of payment than that which applies to their current scheme or (iv) offsetting savings on the Rent Supplement scheme as the additional weekly increase would reduce the level of entitlement under that scheme.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that these costings are subject to change over the coming months in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients for 2018.</p></reply>

To participate on the scheme an employee must work a minimum of 21 hours per week up to a maximum of 39 hours per week.  In the past 5 years the numbers on the scheme have increased from just above 1,000 to 2,349 participants in February 2017.</p>  <p>  The EmployAbility service is a national employment and recruitment service dedicated to improving employment outcomes for job seekers with a disability. The service is currently delivered by 23 limited companies, each with a specific geographical remit and each fully funded by the Department. Budget 2017 provides &euro;9.64 million to run the service.</p>  <p>  Each service is required to operate at a ratio of 1 Job Coach to 25 participants.

The Taoiseach has been in regular contact directly and personally with the Egyptian President about this case.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I am continuing to devote very considerable time and effort to this case.  I travelled to Cairo to raise the case with the Egyptian authorities at the highest levels.  I have raised the case with my Egyptian counterpart on many occasions, in meetings, on the phone and in writing.  My most recent meeting with Foreign Minister Shoukry took place on 6 March and I again raised this case in the most forceful terms.  This was my second meeting with Minister Shoukry to discuss this case in six weeks.  I also raise the case regularly with the Egyptian Ambassador in Dublin and did so again most recently in late February following reports of the citizen&rsquo;s move to the hospital wing of the prison at Torah.  A team of officials from our Embassy in Cairo visited this citizen on March 1st and discussed his situation with him at first hand during a visit which lasted 40 minutes.</p>  <p>  In all of our dealings with the Egyptian authorities we have called on them to return this citizen to Ireland.  In doing so, we have stressed the humanitarian aspects of this case, including this citizen&rsquo;s young age, the isolation of his situation, his separation from friends and family, the very long time that he has been detained without having been convicted of any wrongdoing, and the concerns about his health.</p>  <p>  The clear and consistent response from the Egyptian authorities has been that they must respect the separation of powers, that the Egyptian Government cannot intervene in a matter that is before the courts, and that the Egyptian President will only consider using his discretionary powers to return this citizen to Ireland after the trial process has ended.</p>  <p>  I and my colleagues in Government will continue to work day-in and day-out on this citizen&rsquo;s behalf, and will continue to engage with the Egyptian authorities to seek to ensure his early return to his home and his family in Ireland.</p></reply>

Particular responsibilities attach to the two parties who are entitled to nominate a First Minister and deputy First Minister to engage with each other, and to advance discussions with all eligible political parties, on the formation of a new Executive.</p>  <p>  Discussions commenced this week in Belfast.  I met yesterday with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and a number of the parties, and I am continuing this engagement today.  In our first round of discussions with the parties, both I and the Secretary of State have emphasised to the party leaders the significance of the electoral mandate they have each received and discussed with them the role that each party might play in creating the conditions that allow for the formation of a new power-sharing Assembly and Executive.  We have also discussed with the parties the ways forward on the full implementation of past agreements and addressing the legacy of the past.</p>  <p>  The heart of the Good Friday Agreement is its interlocking political institutions.  However, they can only be sustained on the basis of partnership, equality and mutual respect.  As a co-guarantor, the Irish Government is determined to uphold the principles of the Agreement and to protect its institutions.  These institutions, including the Assembly and the Executive, are indispensable for addressing the needs and concerns of people in Northern Ireland, including peace, prosperity, reconciliation and indeed the considerable challenges posed by the upcoming Brexit negotiations.</p>  <p>  In this regard, I hope that the new Northern Ireland Executive will be in place as soon as possible.  The interests of the island as a whole and protecting the gains of the peace process will remain a priority for the Government in the upcoming Brexit negotiations.  It will remain part of our ongoing engagement with the Northern Ireland parties.  The Government&rsquo;s All-Island Civic Dialogue is also a central strand of our approach to preparing for and managing Brexit.  The Government will continue to be proactive in seeking input on Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests, as we prepare for the Brexit negotiations.</p>  <p>  In the coming weeks I will continue, in cooperation with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, to engage intensively with the political parties to see the power-sharing Assembly and Executive restored to effective and harmonious operation.</p></reply>

As a direct follow-up to this, to reflect on the main issues raised, the Government organised a series of fourteen sector-specific events which have been hosted by Ministers in a range of locations across the country.  A number of those events were held in border areas.  The second plenary meeting of the All-Island Civic Dialogue, which took place on 17 February 2017, brought together the work from the sectoral dialogue meetings and discussed further the preparations for Ireland&rsquo;s response to Brexit.

The meetings have been valuable opportunities for Ministers to engage directly with stakeholders on the implications of the Brexit process for their sector.  Over 1100 industry and civic society representatives have participated in the meetings and many compelling and constructive discussions have been held around the implications for the border regions.  The Civic Dialogue will continue to inform the process ahead and the Government is considering the best way through which to continue the discussions.  The response to Brexit requires a cross-Government response.  This is coordinated across Government, being led by the Department of An Taoiseach in close partnership with my own Department.  Within this framework, each individual Government Department is taking forward preparations for negotiations in the specific areas under their remit.</p>  <p>  In particular, I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that, in order to help address the specific issue raised by the Deputy, additional resources have been provided to InterTrade Ireland, the Cross Border Body which has responsibility for developing Cross Border Trade, in order to enable that Body to provide additional services and support to such companies.  </p>  <p>  The Government is very conscious of the specific challenges facing businesses in the border region who export to Northern Ireland, and will continue to respond to them in any way we can.</p></reply>

EU Foreign Ministers met in joint session with our defence colleagues to discuss progress since the December European Council on implementation of the security and defence elements of the EU Global Strategy.  I was pleased to be joined by Minister Paul Kehoe for this discussion.  In particular, we discussed how to step up the Union&rsquo;s efforts to counter instability in the European Neighbourhood and beyond.  The Global Strategy envisages a comprehensive approach using political, diplomatic, economic development cooperation, governance capacity building and peace support instruments in a coherent way.  Improving the EU&rsquo;s capacity, through the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), to contribute to international peace and security, particularly in support of the UN, is an important part of that work.  High Representative Mogherini briefed the Council on her recent trip to the Western Balkans.  Ministers reaffirmed the need for continued EU engagement with the region.  There are worrying signs of instability in a number of these countries and the EU has a lead responsibility to assist these countries on their path to peace and stability.</p><p>My EU counterparts and I had an informal discussion on Egypt with the Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry.  Following that discussion, I had a bilateral meeting with Minister Shoukry where I conveyed directly my concerns about Irish citizen, Ibrahim Halawa.  In particular, I emphasised my concern for Ibrahim&rsquo;s health and welfare during his incarceration and the strong desire of the Irish government and the Irish Parliament to see Ibrahim returned to Ireland.</p><p>EU Foreign Ministers had a general exchange of views on the Middle East Peace Process, in particular in light of a number of recent developments - settlement expansion, the recent Legalisation Act; and other issues.</p><p>The Council also adopted conclusions on the Democratic Republic of Congo, and had a short discussion on migration, Ukraine and Yemen.</p><p>As we move closer to the triggering of Article 50, it is more important than ever that the Government maintains engagement with our EU partners, to ensure that our priorities are heard and understood across Europe.<i></i>In the margins of the Council, I had bilateral meetings with my Danish and German counterparts where I discussed Ireland&rsquo;s situation in relation to Brexit, in particular with regard to Northern Ireland, the Common Travel area and our trade situation.  While we all have some common concerns, Ireland is in a unique situation.  Both Ministers were understanding of Ireland&rsquo;s unique challenges and I am pleased that both have accepted my invitation to visit Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-09a.495.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017030900071#WRK03200"><p>I propose to take Questions 178 and 179 together.</p>  <p>  I am deeply concerned about the situation of the more than 20 million people currently facing famine, or threat of famine, in Somalia, Yemen, South Sudan and north east Nigeria.  It is also of grave concern that intractable conflict is the main driver of the humanitarian emergencies for people in these countries.  </p>  <p>  Ireland, working with our international partners, will continue to support a strong focus on the need for peaceful resolution of these conflicts.  In addition, the provision of timely humanitarian assistance will remain a key foreign policy priority.  In 2016, we provided a total of some &euro;190 million in humanitarian assistance to people affected by crisis and conflict including in Somalia, Yemen, South Sudan and north east Nigeria.  </p>  <p>  The EU is providing very significant humanitarian assistance to each of the four crises and the European Commission&rsquo;s humanitarian budget now amounts tom some &euro;1 billion annually.</p>  <p>  We are keeping these situations under close review and I would expect we will provide further humanitarian support to each of the four crises in the coming period.  </p>  <p>  Famine was declared in parts of South Sudan in recent weeks and 7.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance.  Severe drought, compounded by years of conflict, has led to emergency levels of food insecurity and risk of famine in Somalia, where 6 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance.  We are currently preparing a package of humanitarian assistance to cover both of these crises and this will be released in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  This will be in addition to the over &euro;31 million Ireland has provided to South Sudan since December 2013 and over &euro;27 million for Somalia since 2012.  </p>  <p>  We are also gravely concerned about the situation in Yemen where 70% of the population of 27 million is now in need of assistance.  Ireland has provided almost &euro;6 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen since the conflict began in early 2015 and we intend to maintain similar levels of support in 2017.  </p>  <p>  At the recent Oslo Conference for north east Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, Ireland made an indicative commitment of at least &euro;5 million in humanitarian funding for 2017 in response to the ongoing severe humanitarian crisis in this region, which encompasses the dire food security situation and risk of famine in North-East Nigeria. </p>  <p>  We use every opportunity we have internationally to focus on the unprecedented level of humanitarian need globally, including at the Foreign Affairs Council.  The crisis in Yemen was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council this week.  Ministers agreed to increase efforts towards greater humanitarian access.  South Sudan was last discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in December 2016 and the Council issued a strong political statement calling on all parties to end the violence, and to allow unhindered humanitarian access to those in need.  </p>  <p>  Together with our EU partners, we will continue to monitor these crises closely and to provide significant life-saving humanitarian assistance for those in most need.</p></reply>

This scheme does not apply in normal course to storm damage repairs.  However, as an exceptional measure, funding for such work was provided under the scheme in 2014 and 2015 arising from the Government Decision of 11 February 2014 which allocated total funding of up to &euro;69.5 million for clean-up, repair and restoration works in relation to public infrastructure that was damaged in the severe storms during the period 13 December 2013 to 6 January 2014.  Of this sum of &euro;69.5 million, up to &euro;19.6 million was allocated for repair of existing coastal protection and flood defences based on submissions and cost estimates made by the local authorities concerned to the then Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.  This funding was made available to the local authorities via the OPW based on programmes of works submitted by the local authorities.  The Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Agriculture, Food and the Marine were responsible for the approval of programmes of work and the disbursement of funding for repair of other damaged public infrastructure such as roads, piers, harbours and other community facilities and amenities.</p><p>The identification and assessment of problems of flooding or damage to properties due to ongoing coastal erosion is a matter for local authorities in the first instance.  If the local authority can identify an economically and environmentally viable solution to address the problem through improving coastal defence infrastructure or some alternative measures then it is open to it to undertake that work using its own resources or, if that is not feasible, to apply for funding under the OPW's Minor Works scheme.  Any application received will be assessed under the scheme's eligibility criteria.  I would emphasise that the Minor Works scheme is not a grant scheme for individual householders and is not operated in that way. It is a funding mechanism between OPW and local authorities to enable the latter to undertake smaller scale, localised works.  All applications must be received from the local authority and, if funding is approved, the works must be organised, contracted and paid for directly by the local authority.  Under the scheme, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost up to &euro;500,000 in each instance.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects, with the balance being funded by the local authority concerned.  Local authorities submit funding applications in the prescribed format, which are then assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific technical, economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a cost benefit assessment.  With regard to the latter, proposals must meet a minimum benefit to cost ratio of 1.5:1 in order to qualify.  Full details are available on the OPW website <i>www.opw.ie.</i></p><p>The scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame.  Proposals for larger scale works would require more detailed technical, environmental and economic assessment by the Council.</p><p>A review of the Minor Works Scheme is currently underway with a view to examining the criteria for consideration within the Scheme, including for example the various thresholds for the assessment of benefit and the financial limits for applications under the Scheme.  The review, which includes consultations with Local Authorities, is examining any potential improvements, administrative or financial, which will encourage applications under the scheme.  It is expected that the review will be completed shortly.</p></reply>

The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) has service contracts in place with the official agencies performing official controls, to verify compliance with the extensive requirements of food labelling legislation.  The official agencies performing these controls include the Health Service Executive (HSE), the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM), Local Authorities, Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and National Standards Authority of Ireland.  Authorised officers work with food businesses to raise standards and ensure compliance with food Regulations.</p>  <p>  During 2015, 36,353 official control inspections were carried out in HSE Environmental Health Service supervised establishments; 15,011 inspections were carried out in DAFM supervised establishments; 5,033 inspections were carried out in Local Authority supervised establishments; and 2,015 inspections were carried out in SFPA supervised establishments.</p>  <p>  During 2015, 25,649 labelling inspections were carried out in HSE-supervised establishments.  7,587 of these resulted in labelling infringements (Beef Labelling - 2,117; Country of Origin for Beef - 751; Fish Labelling - 237; and General Labelling - 4,482).</p>  <p>  The FSAI monitors the Irish market to ensure that foods not authorised for irradiation are not offered for sale within the EU and that those authorised for sale are labelled correctly.  In 2015, no breaches were identified in this regard.</p>  <p>  In 2015, the FSAI coordinated the sampling and analysis of 48 food samples (maize, soya and rice) by the HSE's Environmental Health Service and the Public Analyst Laboratories respectively, for the authorised presence and appropriate labelling of genetically modified food ingredients.  Four of the samples analysed (two containing maize and two containing soybean) were found to contain authorised GM ingredients at below the labelling threshold.</p>  <p>  In other official agencies' inspections, food labels are checked at production and processor level as part of routine food controls.</p>  <p>  The DAFM Egg and Poultry Inspectorate is responsible for controls in barn egg producers, free range producers and egg packing centres.  This inspectorate is also responsible for verification of compliance with the marketing standards for eggs and poultry from primary production through to retail.  DAFM, through its Animal Feed Division, is responsible for the enforcement of legislation in relation to eggs and poultrymeat marketing.  Checks are carried out at primary production, retail and processor level to ensure compliance.</p>  <p>  The FSAI advice line responds to consumer and industry concerns on food issues, including labelling.  Labelling complaints amounted to 192 in 2015 and 221 in 2016.  One of the most common queries in 2016 was in respect of legislation on food labelling requirements.  A large proportion of the calls to the Advice Line in 2015 (1,900) sought advice on food labelling.  The FSAI has also produced several guidance notes to inform the food industry of the legislation on food labelling and to assist them in meeting their legal obligations.</p></reply>

This is in line with international best practice.</p>  <p>  Invasive cervical cancer is extremely rare in women aged under 25, with less than 5 women in this age group being diagnosed with this condition in Ireland each year.  While changes in the cells of the cervix are very common for those under 25, in the vast majority of cases these changes will settle and return to normal without intervention.  If the screening age was lowered to invite those under 25 for smear tests, young women could be subjected to unnecessary treatment that could have potential long-term negative effects on their health and fertility.</p>  <p>  My Department encourages all women aged under 25 to be vigilant about their health and to consult their GP immediately if they have any symptoms which would raise the suspicion of cervical cancer.  If necessary, their GP will refer them to a gynaecology clinic for further investigation.  Similarly it is recommended that any woman concerned about cervical cancer on the basis of family history should discuss this with their GP.</p></reply>

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria.</p><p>1. The health needs of the public.</p><p>2. The cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services.</p><p>3. The availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement.</p><p>4. The proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks.</p><p>5. The potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item.</p><p>6. The clinical need for the item or listed item.</p><p>7. The appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety.</p><p>8. The efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it eats a condition than existing therapies).</p><p>9. The resources available to the HSE.</p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Respreeza, for reimbursement of maintenance treatment of emphysema in adults with documented severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency.</p><p>In June last year, the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment on the cost effectiveness of this treatment.  The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation on 9 December 2016.  The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug and did not recommend it for reimbursement.</p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: .</p><p>The HSE considers the NCPE assessment, and other expert advice, as part of its decision-making process for reimbursement, which is made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed that the drug Respreeza was considered by the HSE Drugs Group, which did not make a recommendation for reimbursement on clinical grounds.  The HSE Leadership team has accepted the Drugs Group recommendation of non-reimbursement.</p><p>Under the HSE statutory assessment process, the HSE is required to set out a notice of any proposed decision to an applicant company.  The HSE is legally required to provide at least a 28 day period (from the formal written notice of proposal), to enable the company to consider any such proposal not to reimburse and to make representations to the HSE if it wishes to do so.  The HSE is required to consider any such representations in advance of a formal decision.</p><p>Therefore, as the statutory process is still ongoing, the company has an opportunity to have further discussions with the HSE.</p><p>In relation to the compassionate access scheme operated by the manufacturer I note its decision to extend the scheme by a further two months.  However it is important to point out that the operation of compassionate schemes is at the discretion of manufacturers.  As Minister for Health I have no role in the operation of these schemes.  There is no provision in Irish legislation for the approval of compassionate use programmes for specific groups of patients with an unmet medical need.</p><p>I have previously said that any attempts by manufacturers to link continued access, for patients already being treated with a new medicine, with decisions under the statutory reimbursement process is both inappropriate and unethical.  Manufacturers should operate such schemes in a compassionate and not a commercially-motivated manner.  There should be no link between compassionate use schemes and reimbursement decisions and manufacturers should be open with patients and clinicians from the outset.</p></reply>

I received the Authority's report &lsquo;Cannabis for Medical Use &ndash; A Scientific Review&rsquo; on 31 January last.</p><p>On 10 February, I published the report and announced that I would establish an access programme for cannabis-based treatments for the following conditions;</p><p>- Spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis resistant to all standard therapies and interventions;</p><p>- Intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, despite the use of standard anti-emetic regimes;</p><p>- Severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy that has failed to respond to standard anticonvulsant medications.</p><p>- Patients accessing cannabis through the programme are required to be under the care of a medical consultant.</p><p>The report has been referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health for consideration.  Meanwhile officials from my Department and the Health Products Regulatory Authority will consult with stakeholders on how the access programme will operate.  It will be particularly important to engage with the clinical community in the development of a framework.  Officials are also examining legislative changes that will be required to underpin the access programme.</p><p>I intend to progress the establishment of this access programme as a priority.  However, to be clear, patients accessing cannabis through the cannabis access programme will need to be recommended for cannabis treatment by a medical consultant involved in the patient's care.  This recognises the relevance of such treatment for overall case planning and management of the underlying medical condition.</p><p>For the period during which this access programme is being established, it remains open to me as the Minister for Health to grant a licence under the Misuse of Drugs Act for access to cannabis for medical purposes in individual cases.  Such applications will be considered on a case by case basis.  The granting of a licence must, however, be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.</p><p>The main elements of a licence application are expected to include:</p><p>- An outline of the treatment the patient has received to date and justification from the doctor as to why it is appropriate in their patient&rsquo;s specific circumstances to prescribe a Schedule 1 drug.</p><p>- If the patient&rsquo;s consultant is not the applicant, the views, if any, of the consultant in relation to the application.</p><p>- Details of the cannabis-based product which it is proposed to prescribe and administer to the patient.</p><p>- The source of the cannabis-based product.</p><p>The appropriateness of any particular treatment is a matter between the patient and their doctor, I have no role in this process.</p><p>This information has been provided to the Oireachtas and is also contained in a recent Department of Health Press Release which outlines the advice provided by the Chief Medical Officer to me in relation to the use of cannabis for medical reasons.</p></reply>

In excess of 2,000 daycases will be managed through this process.

Public patients may access the healthcare they require in either the public or private healthcare system of another Member State under the Cross-Border Directive (CBD). Access to healthcare abroad is based on patients following public patient pathways, i.e. they must demonstrate they have followed the equivalent public patient pathways that a patient would follow if accessing public healthcare in Ireland.  It is important to note that reimbursement is confined to the costs of the care itself and that the rates of reimbursement cannot exceed the cost of provision of the care if it were provided in the Irish public health service.  Referral for care under the CBD may be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other HSE clinicians. The CBD excludes certain health services, e.g. services of public health, long term care, organ transplantation, etc. All persons on public waiting lists, other than for such exempt health services, are eligible for the Scheme.

The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders. </p><p>The programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community. In May 2016, 2725 people lived in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under <i>&lsquo;Transforming Lives&rsquo;,</i>the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions. I welcome the fact that the needs of people moving from congregated settings will be fully taken into account during this process as the model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan. </p><p>At the end of December 2016, less than 2,600 people with a disability were living in congregated settings. The HSE's 2017 National Service Plan has set a target of 223 to move from institutions in 2017. This will  ensure that people are able to move out of congregated settings, and into their own homes in the community. I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres.</p><p>In addition, I am pleased to note that the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government (DHPCLG) is providing funding under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) to provide suitable accommodation for people transitioning from institutions in 2017. CAS funding will also be available to provide housing for people with disabilities in the community more generally that is not specifically targeted at deinstitutionalisation</p><p>This demonstrates the joined up commitment of both Departments to support the de-congregation programme. </p><p>As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on <i>Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion, </i>I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe.  Lyme disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe.</p>  <p>  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered. In Ireland, treatment by most clinicians is based on that laid out in evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and babesiosis published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America in 2006.  </p>  <p>  A Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre has been established to look at methods of raising awareness especially in those areas (including recreation areas) where Lyme carrying ticks can be most expected to be found. The aim of this Sub-Committee is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  The membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health, an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency, an Environmental Health Officer, and a member of Tick Talk who has been invited to be the patient representative on the Sub-Committee.  The initial work stream involves a survey of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, the development of Lyme borreliosis guidance for general practitioners, the publication of medical media articles to highlight diagnostics and laboratory methods relating to Lyme borreliosis available in Ireland for general practitioners, and ongoing work in drawing together the Final Report of the Sub-Committee.</p>  <p>  As the services referred to in the question are available in Ireland there is no requirement for people to travel to other countries for diagnosis or treatment.</p></reply>

Its functions relate to the regulation of pharmacy services in Ireland (5,840 pharmacists, 1,900 pharmacies and 360 pharmaceutical assistants).  Under the Act, the PSI inter alia is responsible for the registration of pharmacists, pharmacies and pharmaceutical assistants and the education, training and continuing professional development of pharmacists, as well as the inspection of pharmacies, enforcement of medicines and pharmacy legislation and the operation of fitness to practise functions. </p>  <p>  These functions are funded by fees paid by registrants.  The setting of fees for the pharmacy profession is governed by the Act which requires the PSI to make an application for ministerial consent to any fees that it proposes to charge.  This process allows for the consideration, and examination, of the Society&rsquo;s fee proposals by my Department.  Following an extensive review fees were reduced by 10% in 2010 and most fees by a further 5% in 2014.</p>  <p>  The PSI receives the majority of its income from registration fees in the last quarter of each year (70%) and this income is reflected in the PSI Financial Statements for that year.  However, this income is required to enable the PSI to fulfil its statutory obligations under the Act in the following year.</p>  <p>  In relation to the PSI superannuation scheme, the Department of Finance granted sanction in May 2008 to the PSI to operate, on an administrative basis, a superannuation scheme based on Public Service Model Scheme terms.  On 10 March 2016, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland Superannuation Scheme 2016 (S.I. 136 of 2016) was approved and signed by the Minister for Health with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER). The Scheme came into operation on that date.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the SI is to adopt the Rules set out in the Schedule to the Rules for Pre-existing Public Service Pension Scheme Members Regulations 2014 (S.I. No. 582 of 2014) as a scheme for the granting of superannuation benefits to the Registrar and staff of the PSI who are not members of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme.</p>  <p>  The PSI operates its superannuation scheme on a 'pay as you go' basis from existing cash reserves as well as from employer and employee superannuation contributions.  Contributions to the Scheme are currently held in a designated deposit account until such time as the funding mechanism is formally approved.  The amount held in the deposit account is reflected in the PSI cash balances.  The current value of the funds held on deposit is &euro;3.7m.  The approval of a funding model is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) and it is currently considering the appropriate funding mechanism which should apply.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the superannuation scheme and the funds held pending the approval of the funding mechanism by DPER are separate to PSI funds required to fulfil its statutory requirements under the Act.</p></reply>

In 2011 my Department officials met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies into the possibility of establishing a new sugar and bioethanol production facility, using sugar beet, in this country.  The figures published by the interested groups who are investigating the possibility of building a new facility, indicate that the overall capital costs involved could range from &euro;250 million to &euro;400 million, depending on what type of facility will be constructed. </p>  <p>  My Department officials informed both groups at the time and many times since that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility in Ireland, would have to be a viable commercial proposition, and supported by a sufficiently robust business case in order to attract the funding from investors for the very substantial capital investment required.  My Government colleague Minister Coveney clearly informed both groups at the time that it was his job to look for agreement at EU level to allow for the growing of sugar beet for the manufacture of sugar, at the earliest possible date.  In this connection, he secured agreement as part of the overall CAP reform package at the final EU Council of Agriculture Ministers, which he chaired in June 2013, to abolish all sugar quotas by 30 September 2017.  This agreement removes, with effect from 1 October 2017, the current EU quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member State's, wishing to re-establish a sugar industry. </p>  <p>  The current Programme for a Partnership Government makes clear that &ldquo;State enterprise bodies will be asked to examine any substantial business plans related to rebuilding the industry with a view to considering appropriate State supports&rdquo;.  The opportunity remains therefore for interested parties to move the project forward and to garner sufficient commercial and financial support to turn their plans into a viable reality.</p>  <p>  Through the EU Research and Innovation funding stream currently called the Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking - ongoing for the period 2014-2020 - there is the possibility to submit proposals for evaluation to a competitive funding process in relation to, inter alia, producing industrial chemicals from sugar beet.  This Joint Undertaking is a &euro;3.7 billion Public-Private Partnership between the EU and the Bio-based Industries Consortium.  The programme operates under Horizon 2020, the EU Funding Programme for research and innovation, and it is driven by the Vision and Strategic Innovation and Research Agenda (SIRA) developed by the Biobased Industry Consortium.</p>  <p>  Proposals to the  Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking may cover research and innovation, pilot and demonstration and flagship actions.  The annual work plan for the Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking indicates the topics eligible for funding each year.  This plan is now available for 2017.  The call for proposals will open in April and submissions must be made by early September 2017 with indicative results of proposal evaluations provided in December 2017.</p>  <p>  A number of Irish participants have so far accessed the EU funding opportunity under the Bio Based Industries Joint Undertaking.  To date Irish academic institutions and industry have been funded to the value of &euro;2 million in four projects.  These include University College Dublin (UCD), Trinity College Dublin (TCD), University of Limerick (UL), Mongahan Mushrooms, Eire Composites Teoranta and Celignis.  The projects concerned have dealt with a diverse range of issues  such as valorising residues and by-products from the agriculture and food processing industry to extract valuable bio-compounds; valorisation of agro-residues from mushroom industrial cultivation into bio-based functional additives and biopolymers; development of a biorefinery concept based on the cascading use of spent mushroom  substrate (SMS) supplemented by wheat straw and other seasonal underutilised lignocellulosic feedstocks; and also producing carbon fibres from forestry by-products.</p></reply>

At international level, Ireland&rsquo;s development aid programme has a strong focus on food and nutrition, including through funding from my own Department to the UN FAO and WFP (World Food Programme).</p><p>At EU level, the Commission has established a High Level Forum on a better functioning food chain.  The High Level Forum has a mandate to consider factors affecting the competitiveness and sustainability of the food supply chain, including business to business trading practices, innovation and prices, market access and trade.  Membership includes Member States and a wide spectrum of stakeholders in the food chain, including producers, trade bodies and NGOs.  The programme for this year focuses on how best to address Unfair Trading Practices, an issue highlighted by the Agriculture Council, and price monitoring tools.  The Environment Council Conclusions in 2016 on the Circular Economy also contribute to ensuring the sustainability of the food chain and food security over time.</p></reply>

In general terms an eligible hectare is one that is used for an agricultural activity or, where the area is also used for a non-agricultural activity, is predominantly used for such activities.  An area is predominantly used for agricultural activity if that activity can be exercised without being significantly hampered by the intensity, nature, duration and timing of the non-agricultural activity.</p>  <p>  While cases involving solar panels will be examined on an individual basis, it is currently envisaged that the area covered by the solar panels will be deemed ineligible for the purposes of claiming BPS.  Furthermore, in line with the Department&rsquo;s current approach on land eligibility, where the area of a parcel covered by solar panels is 70% or greater of the overall parcel, that parcel will be wholly ineligible.  If less than 70% is covered by solar panels and the agricultural activity is not hampered by the presence of the solar panels, the area not covered by solar panels may be eligible.</p>  <p>  With regard to entitlements it is important to note that a farmer must use all entitlements every two years.  Therefore if the land is deemed ineligible for BPS the farmer would lose the entitlements after two years unless he (a) got more land (b) leased out his entitlements or (c ) sold the entitlements.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that all agricultural land used to claim BPS must be owned/leased, used and managed by the applicant.  If the applicant is not the owner of the land, they must have a lease or rental agreement in place with the owner of the land.  There must be independent and suitable access for animals and/or machinery for the farming enterprise being conducted. Independent access means access by public or private roadway or by a defined right of way.  Access over adjoining landowners land, or over land which is subject to a lease or rental agreement to another person, is not acceptable.</p></reply>

SBCI are not providing funding, but along with the European Investment Fund&rsquo;s COSME (the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs) is providing the guarantee required to underpin the loan&rsquo;s flexibility and lower the cost of the loans.

However such agreements must be balanced and must serve both our offensive and defensive interests. This does not, of course, obviate the need to have regard to the potential impact of particular trade deals on sensitive sectors such as the beef sector.  </p>  <p>  Nonetheless I  welcome the Commission&rsquo;s latest study particularly as it takes in a broad range of examples.  It used the EU trade agreements with Mexico ("first generation" trade agreement), South Korea (new generation Deep and Comprehensive Trade Agreement DCFTA) and Switzerland (specific sectorial agreements) and this gives a balanced overview of such agreements.  </p>  <p>  The study shows that the agreements contributed to increased trade in both directions, with increased EU exports and increased imports of products from these three countries, giving EU consumers and business greater access to agri-food products.  Importantly, it suggests that these increased imports have little impact on domestic EU production. Instead, they reflect mainly a replacement of imports from other third countries or an increase in EU consumption.</p>  <p>  The study underlines the importance of closely following the trade negotiations of the EU's main competitors to make sure that the EU does not fall behind in access conditions to important markets for agri-food products.  It also shows that more recently, ambitious agreements such as the EU-Korea trade deal, which entered into force in 2011, have a higher positive impact than older and less comprehensive agreements like the 2000 EU-Mexico agreement.  This is a sign of the increasing quality and effectiveness of EU trade agreements in terms of removing barriers and of the success of the sector in improving competitiveness.  </p>  <p>  The study also emphasises the importance of EU promotion and information campaigns in helping EU exporters access new markets and grow their businesses in existing markets.  The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is of course an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agri-food sector, as evidenced by its placement right at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development over the coming decade.  Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular.  </p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region.  This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.  </p>  <p>  Overall this study illustrates the potential for European agriculture products to increase exports even within the existing scope of the trade agreements.  The additional export demand enhanced by trade agreements could translate into an important source of growth, jobs and value added for the Irish and European agricultural and food sectors.  </p></reply>

The CAP has demonstrated its capacity to evolve very effectively in response to changing market, consumer and environmental demands in recent years, to the point where it now plays a central role in delivering the smart, sustainable and inclusive growth sought under the Europe 2020 strategy. </p>  <p>  It is vitally important that the CAP continues its market orientation, and to evolve in a way that supports the achievement of European strategic objectives.  This will help to reinforce the relevance and effectiveness of the policy, and to secure a strong CAP budget for the period post-2020.</p>  <p>  The Maltese Presidency identified a number of priorities for the future CAP, based on recent discussions, and which formed the basis of the discussion at Council.  These priorities are - building resilience; responding to environmental challenges; investing in rural viability and vitality; ensuring generational renewal; maintaining a market orientation; and, strengthening farmers&rsquo; position.</p>  <p>  These priorities largely coincide with what Ireland views as the key challenges ahead.  In our view, the overriding priority must be to support the sustainable intensification of food production, in order to meet the requirements of a growing global population while at the same time facilitating adaptation to climate change and mitigation against further change.</p>  <p>  This can be achieved by sharpening the focus on outcomes, and by reducing the regulatory and audit burdens on Member States and farmers as they implement measures to achieve these outcomes.</p>  <p>  In terms of addressing these priorities, I am of the view that a more holistic approach is needed. For example, in the case of sustainable intensification, Member States need to be able to identify objectives, such as the production of food in an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable way, and then be allowed to implement measures which will enable them to achieve those objectives.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Beef Data &amp;amp; Genomics Programme is a good example of a measure that achieves multiple objectives (improving efficiency, profitability and sustainability) while not fitting neatly within the existing, somewhat restrictive, regulatory framework.  A greater focus on outcomes combined with Member State flexibility on the means to achieve them would help to address this problem.</p>  <p>  This holistic approach can equally be applied to our efforts to build farmer resilience in the face of market volatility.  The use modern and innovative measures such as futures markets, fixed price contracts and hedging arrangements have a role to play, but the direct payments system provides stability and certainty for farmers in the face of market volatility and should remain a key component of the CAP, as should other useful existing measures such as intervention, which has proven very effective in dealing with recent market difficulties.</p>  <p>  However, in order to achieve these priorities, it is important that a strong CAP budget is maintained.  The future of the CAP budget will be discussed in the context of the Multiannual Financial Framework for the post-2020 period.  It is expected that the CAP budget will come under increasing pressure, which will be compounded further by the loss of the UK&rsquo;s contribution to the EU budget.  It will be important therefore to ensure that there is a commensurate CAP budget in place post-2020 in order for the new CAP to achieve its objectives.</p></reply>

This data collection programme, which is substantially complete, together with the setting of Conservation Objectives, will enable all new and renewal aquaculture applications to be assessed.</p>  <p>  Conservation Objectives have been set for Ballyness SAC.  The next step in the process is the carrying out of an Appropriate Assessment by the Marine Institute.  This is being progressed taking account of the need to facilitate the use of scientific and other resources on a flexible basis across the full range of bays.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-03-09a.834.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017030900078#WRR04400"><p>I am acutely  aware of the challenges being posed by the UK vote on Brexit for our agrifood sector.  For the last number of months Government has been actively engaged in assessing the impact of the Brexit vote, consulting with appropriate stakeholders and engaging with the relevant politicians and institutions to ensure that our priorities are well understood by those likely to be in a position of influence in the course of the negotiations.  This work is being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  The agrifood sector is of critical importance to our economy and its regional spread means it underpins the socio-economic development of rural areas in particular.  The sector employed approximately 173,000 people (i.e. 8.6% of total employment) in 2016, and the total value of agrifood exports was almost &euro;12.2 billion.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU reinforces the need to develop as many outlets for our agrifood exports as possible, in order to minimise our dependence on any one market.  Indeed this principle of market development is already a key component of Food Wise 2025.  We have been very active in recent years in efforts to diversify markets, and in aiming to respond to consumer demands in emerging markets.</p>  <p>  While Ireland exported some &euro;2.4 billion worth of beef to approximately 70 countries last year, I am still very cognisant of the need both to expand the number of beef markets but also to enhance existing market access given the current exposure to the UK beef market.</p>  <p>  In terms of the beef market access, 2016 saw the extension of our access to the US, as well as the opening of the Canadian, New Zealand and Israeli beef markets.  So far 2017 has seen the re-opening of the Egyptian market to Irish beef although we need to complete the remaining technical steps before the resumption of beef exports.  The recent Trade Mission to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates saw the extension of our beef access to Saudi Arabia following a period of detailed engagement with the Saudi Arabian Food and Drug Authority (SFDA).  Priorities in terms of market access for 2017 include further advancing beef access to China which is a very high priority.  The Department is also pursuing beef access to a number of other Third Countries including South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand and Ukraine, and is working to simplify certification procedures in a number of markets to which we already have access.</p>  <p>  In relation to dairy, Irish dairy products have a highly rated and hard earned reputation in terms of quality, safety and sustainability, and this gives them a competitive edge in markets over the world.  My Department, in conjunction with other stakeholders, including the Irish dairy companies and agencies such as Bord Bia, are playing a key role in building the market for Irish dairy.  In 2016 Ireland exported dairy products to over 130 countries.  Against the backdrop of our efforts to significantly increase dairy output and grow the sector, export market diversification is obviously of the upmost importance, and this is particularly true in the context of a post-Brexit scenario.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Irish seafood industry Brexit poses a very significant threat.  On average, over one third of our current landings are from inside the UK zone.  While some benefits may accrue in terms of increasing market share in EU Member States, overall these will be more than offset by three main threats - (i) loss of access, (ii) substantial loss of quota share and (iii) displacement into our zone &ndash;as well as a high level of uncertainty in the short term.  The Irish fishing industry is focussed on these three threats.</p>  <p>  My Department is also working on expanding market access for sheepmeat, pigmeat, poultry and cooked meats across a range of markets.  On sheepmeat the market in Iran opened in 2016.  Access to China is a high priority for the industry but cannot be gained until after beef access with China has been progressed further.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I consider it vitally important that our key message of remaining as close as possible to the current trading arrangements is heard and understood across Europe, and for that reason the extensive consultations currently being undertaken with our EU counterparts at political and official levels will continue, and indeed intensify, over the coming months.</p></reply>

It includes recommendations on the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.  Driving the implementation of these recommendations, particularly on market development, competitiveness and innovation as well as moving up the value chain, will assume even greater importance in the light of the UK decision.</p>  <p>  Diversification of exports remains a key focus. Over half of the growth in Irish food and drink exports since 2010 has come from markets outside of the European Union. This includes a six fold increase in exports to China, more than doubling of trade to North America and South East Asia and an increase of almost 40% in the value of exports to the Middle East and Africa.  The value of exports to EU markets other than the UK increased by 40% since 2010 led by growth to Germany, France, Poland, Northern Europe and the Netherlands.</p>  <p>  The UK is expected to remain just 60% self-sufficient in food and therefore will continue to have a significant import requirement post Brexit.  Bord Bia activities in the UK market are focused on working with key customers to deepen existing relationships and identifying opportunities to meet emerging needs in the market.</p>  <p>  In relation to other European and international markets Bord Bia has adopted an Insights driven approach to identifying new opportunities, backed up by in-market activities to help companies identify potential leads and develop new business opportunities.  These activities include 24 international Trade Fairs in 2017 which will attract over 1 million buyers, increased market presence through new offices in Singapore and Warsaw and increased resources in Africa.</p>  <p>  Activities undertaken are developed and implemented in close consultation with industry.</p>  <p>  Given the rate of population growth in many emerging regions, the corresponding growth in demand for food and limited self-sufficiency, import demand for food products continues to grow.  Irish exporters have been successful at establishing a good understanding of the market requirements in regions such as Asia, Africa and the Middle East and are well placed to avail of further growth opportunities as they emerge over the coming years.  The further growth anticipated in dairy output, the continued drive of the meat sector to deliver added value solutions and the potential for growth in beverages, seafood and prepared foods all point to further growth potential.</p></reply>

Growth prospects for the sector are positive overall, driven by increased consumer interest in the provenance of food, environmental concerns, health and a desire to support the local economy.  While the possible impact of the UK referendum on consumer sentiment remains to be seen, it is estimated that the sector may have grown in value to &euro;700 million in 2016, including &euro;500 million in this jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  Artisan and speciality food businesses can have a significant impact on local economies as businesses are typically owner managed and may be closely linked to local farms. Recognising the value of the sector and its development and employment potential, FoodWise 2025 recommended actions to support it, including festival markets, a pipeline for new entrants to the Artisan Food Market at Bloom, promoting meet the buyer opportunities, delivery of small business specific consumer and market insights, and programmes to assist producers to extend business reach. A number of artisan businesses have participated in Food Academy (developed by Bord Bia, Local Enterprise Offices and Musgraves/Supervalu and delivering growth and jobs) and Food Works (developed by Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland for start-up food entrepreneurs). </p>  <p>  The farmhouse cheese sector alone includes over 50 cheese makers producing more than 150 types of cheese valued at over &euro;12 million a year at farm gate level. My Department has supported a three year Bord Bia programme under the EU Promotion regime. It is estimated that output of farmhouse and specialty cheese could increase to over 4,500 tonnes a year and &euro;33m in value without significant additional capital expenditure. </p>  <p>  In terms of small food businesses in general, close to 500 food companies with a turnover of &euro;100k-&euro;3.5m are registered with Bord Bia for supports and services.  These owner managed businesses tend to produce high-end products with a strong focus on the domestic market. </p>  <p>  In addition, over the last 5 years over 400 new companies with revenues of less than &euro;100k have entered the sector. Through the Food Academy Start programme, these companies typically start with a support package delivered nationally by the Local Enterprise Offices. This collaborative approach ensures that early stage companies develop skills and capabilities through a &lsquo;learn by doing&rsquo; approach. Over 300 companies have been given the opportunity to get product on the Food Academy fixture.  </p>  <p>  As a follow on to Food Academy Start, a select number of companies annually are identified as having high potential and progress to Food Academy Advance, an advanced stage, where they have access to expertise in branding, market research, business development and distribution, with the aim of scaling up production and even securing a national listing.  In all, 13 companies were signed up to start Food Academy Advance in February 2017, the third wave of companies to participate on this programme.</p>  <p>  Although these businesses are individually small, cumulatively the Irish small food business sector is a critical component of and contributor to the strength of local and rural economies. Entrepreneurship is the seedbed for innovation and entrepreneurial supports such Food Works help to embed the culture and belief in scalable start-ups through innovation. </p>  <p>  Farmer&rsquo;s markets and other direct routes to market continue to play a vital role to companies in the start-up phase and beyond by giving low risk market access and direct consumer feedback. Food Wise 2025 recognises the importance of direct selling and includes a recommendation for the introduction of a Direct to Consumer development workshop. Bord Bia developed a regional workshop programme in 2016 to help support new and existing members of the food market network as they seek to grow their business directly with consumers.  These were expanded in 2017 and workshops have taken place in Dublin, Donegal, Cavan and Kerry.</p>  <p>  The Food Market at Bloom 2017 also provides a platform for marketing, promotion and sales for up to 62 food and drink producers to reach around 100,000 consumers. The Food Market at Bloom is an established feature at Bloom and is also an important showcase opportunity for producers with trade buyers, from Ireland and the UK.   It increases awareness of smaller and new food companies and provides an opportunity for food companies to engage with and sell directly to the consumer.</p>  <p>  For a number of years my Department has provided bursaries for the UCC Diploma in Speciality Food Production, a food science and business course for food producers, potential start-ups and those interested in developing businesses and /or promoting the artisan sector. Over 180 students have graduated, many are successfully running small artisan and speciality food businesses.  My Department will continue to fund bursaries over the next 4 years to maintain this momentum. </p></reply>

The Act puts clear obligations on owners regarding the need to look after animals under their care. </p>  <p>  My Department employs a large team of veterinary inspectors to enforce the provisions of the Act. Inspections, both announced and unannounced, are undertaken on a regular basis to ensure that the requirements of the Act are strictly adhered to. These inspections are scheduled on both a random and targeted basis. My Department also operates an anonymous helpline through which members of the public can express animal welfare concerns. These reports are promptly examined by trained veterinary staff countrywide and corrective action is taken in those cases where the Act has been breached. The Act also provides for severe penalties in the event of successful prosecutions.</p>  <p>  The Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council (FAWAC) was established by my Department in February 2002 on a non-statutory basis. It has been instrumental in promoting animal welfare in a practical way and providing a forum for different interest groups to meet, exchange views and reach consensus on the various challenges relating to animal welfare on farms.</p>  <p>  While my Department remains the central reporting point for animal welfare concerns, it also works collaboratively on a range of issues with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. Under Section 37(2) of the Animal Health and Welfare Act, 2013, the manager of a local authority may appoint authorised officers to exercise functions conferred on them for the purposes of enforcing the Act. </p>  <p>  One area of such co-operation is the governance of canine welfare. A joint inspection regime of dog breeding establishments, involving the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Local Authority Veterinary Service, took place in 2015 for the purpose of inspection and follow up action. While a very high percentage of inspections found the conditions of the animals to comply fully with the Act, corrective action was taken where necessary following the discovery of individual cases of non-compliance (mainly infrastructural in nature). </p>  <p>  My Department also liaises on a daily basis with Local Authorities in relation to the enforcement of the Control of Horses Act 1996. The development of urban / traveller horse projects is one outcome of this co-operation. These projects seek to reduce the amount of stray horses and educate young people in the care of animals. I am glad to report a major improvement in horse welfare outcomes in recent years.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be assured that this level of monitoring, enforcement and education will remain in place in the future, both by my Department and the State agencies.</p></reply>

I am focused on working with the industry to meet these difficulties in the months and years ahead.</p><p>Budget 2017 underpins my Department&rsquo;s efforts through strategic investment in key areas, such as in its agencies and in the agrifood sector. As part of Budget 2017 I secured an additional &euro;700,000 in funding for capital investments in the Commercial Horticulture Sector.  This means that this year&rsquo;s budget for the scheme will amount to  &euro;5 million. In addition, the Horticulture Sector will have access to the &euro;150 million low interest cash flow support loan fund announced in Budget 2017, providing access to highly flexible loans for amounts up to &euro;150,000, at an interest rate of 2.95%, for up to six years. </p><p>The impact that the devaluation of sterling is having on mushroom producers and grower margins is a problem that has happened over a very short space of time. Grower production of this highly perishable product must be well aligned with demand and the mushroom sector, like many other exporting sectors, is particularly at risk because of the high dependency on the UK market. I can assure you that my Department is closely monitoring the situation regarding sterling volatility to consider the direct impact of Brexit on our industry. Although it is still a serious situation, the sterling exchange rate has stabilised and is now holding at around 85p to the euro. </p><p>My Department, along with the various State agencies, in particular Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland, are working closely with the industry to provide the necessary support and assistance.  Bord Bia is actively supporting the sector in the areas of Market Intelligence, UK consumer research and Quality Assurance. Towards the end of 2016 they held a currency and negotiation workshop specifically targeted at the sector, which I understand was very well received by the mushroom industry. </p><p>Bord Bia is also running a Marketing Intensification Programmewhich aims to<b></b>provide targeted marketing supports to companies with high dependency on UK markets. Grant supports will be prioritised to assist companies in strengthening their position in that market and in their efforts to identify new markets.</p><p>My Department is also providing funding for a pilot programme on LEAN processes, with the assistance of Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland. It has started with 6 mushroom growers, to assess efficiency across all aspects of the business, including supply chain, innovation, marketing and logistics. It is hoped that a template can be developed through this programme that will enable growers to optimise their production costs further. </p><p>I would also draw attention to support being provided to the industry through the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007 &ndash; 2013, mainly through the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector.  To ensure ongoing support for the sector, my Department extended, under EU sanction, the Scheme to run until 31 December 2019. To date some &euro;6m has been paid out in grants under the Scheme to support about &euro;15m in investment.</p><p>Applications for 2017 under the Scheme are currently being assessed.</p><p>I wish to assure the House that the Government remains very focused on supporting the agri-food industry through the challenges ahead. I will continue to consult with the industry as the negotiations develop, and press Ireland's case for continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures.</p></reply>

Fertilisers  are mainly traded in US dollars and are thereby subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A weak euro means increased costs for fuel and fertiliser imports and this has impacted on price trends in recent years.</p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office (CSO) monitors the price of fertilisers on a monthly basis. My Department receives data on the type and quantity of fertilisers and lime sold on a Quarterly basis from Industry.</p>  <p>  Most recent CSO data on fertiliser prices (December, January and February 2017) show some increases in the price of fertiliser such as Urea and CAN recently. However current prices remain below prices in early 2016. (The price of Urea has increased from &euro;330/tonne to &euro;365/tonne.  Prior to this in 2016 we had seen a decrease in Urea price of 18% from &euro;396/ tonne in January  2016 to &euro;321/tonne in December 2016 and overall fertiliser prices reduce by over 20% in 2016 based on CSO data).</p>  <p>  Currently, Europe is only 80% self-sufficient in fertiliser production and must import 20% of its requirements. As such, European and Irish fertiliser prices are strongly linked to global prices and heavily influenced by supply and demand.</p>  <p>  I understand that the price of fertilisers is an important issue for farmers.  Over the past 20 years fertiliser use has decreased by 28% reflecting improved environmental controls brought about by schemes like REPS, AEOS and GLAS. The Nitrates Directive limits the amount of Chemical Nitrogen and Phosphorus based on stocking limits and crop types. There is a greater awareness of the value of slurry which is being used to replace nutrients as chemical fertiliser prices increased. Farmers would benefit from using the cheaper ureic form of Nitrogen- Urea fertiliser, which has a price advantage over calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) per unit of nitrogen. </p>  <p>  Teagasc has identified that soil pH has a large influence on nutrient availability with 64% of grassland soils below optimum pH. Grassland soils can release up to 80 kg N/ha per year when soils are at optimum pH. This can be achieved by the application of ground limestone based on soil analysis results.</p></reply>

This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns. The CFP specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY. This is being phased in gradually and is due to be complete by 2020 at the latest for all stocks.   This will result in more fish being left in the sea to mature and reproduce leading to increased abundance of fish, and over time to higher quotas for Irish fishermen. </p>  <p>  The EU Commission has noted that the state of fish stocks in European Atlantic and nearby waters continues to improve which I believe indicates that we are continuing to see the benefits of prudent and responsible fisheries management practices. </p>  <p>  The ongoing implementation the  landing obligation, which began in 2015 will also contribute to an improvement in the state of the stocks of importance to Ireland and will result in increased fishing opportunities for the Irish fishing industry.</p>  <p>  My overarching goal for fisheries is to ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to safeguard fish stocks for future generations. This will ensure that families dependent on fishing can look forward to being part of a vibrant, productive and resilient Irish fishing industry and can expect to continue to achieve a reasonable return for their efforts and investment. </p>  <p>  Our seafood sector, supported by Bord Bia, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Enterprise Ireland, has focused much effort on developing business in the emerging seafood markets in Asia.  Bord Bia plays a key role in assisting the Irish seafood sector in developing sales in a number of emerging seafood markets through its international office network.  Through the range of services provided to seafood clients in areas such as trade research, customer profiling, buyer-supplier contact events, in-store and online seafood promotions and trade awareness events, Bord Bia has been instrumental in assisting the Irish seafood sector establish a foothold in these markets in the past 5 years.  Bord Bia will focus its trade and market development efforts on Japan, Vietnam, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan in 2017.  This will be in addition to the China seafood development programme already in place.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Operational Programme is supporting Bord Bia&rsquo;s increased seafood promotion effort through &euro;800,000 additional funding per year.  In addition, the EMFF Operational Programme is funding a suite of schemes implemented by Bord Iascaigh Mhara to support our seafood processing sector develop new value-added seafood products, put in place the capital investment to produce new and more seafood products, develop business and marketing strategies to take advantage of the export opportunities, and to work cooperatively with other seafood enterprises to develop marketing resources in potential export markets.</p></reply>

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) statistics, published in January 2017, illustrate Ireland&rsquo;s current progress towards meeting EU waste targets including WEEE. The most recent WEEE statistics are with respect to 2014 and demonstrate that 7.2 kg of household WEEE was collected per person in Ireland, compared to the EU target of 4 kg per person, and that Ireland is also meeting recovery rates of 80% and 90% across different recycling processes. This information is available on the EPA&rsquo;s website <i></i>.</p><p>These statistics are tangible proof of the positive response to the implementation of the WEEE directive in Ireland. Since the introduction of the Irish WEEE legislation, some 100 million waste electrical items have been collected and over 300,000 tonnes of WEEE diverted from landfill. The Irish public have supported the WEEE system and have fully utilised the network of free collection facilities and take-back options available to them. In so doing, they have played an important role in eradicating the visible blight on our countryside and towns caused by waste fridges and washing machines and other electro-scrap.</p></reply>

Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Rating (BER). In 2016 over 15,000 homeowners had energy efficiency works carried out to their homes which resulted in &euro;17m being spent on this scheme. </p><p>The following table details the numbers of homes that have received grant support and the amount of grants paid over the past five years.<table><tr><th>Better Energy Homes</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Total number of homes completed</td><td>26,423</td><td>13,710</td><td>9,927</td><td>12,339</td><td>15,265</td><td>77,664</td></tr><tr><td>Total grant amount paid</td><td>&euro;28.945m</td><td>&euro;13.159m</td><td>&euro;9.915m</td><td>&euro;14.326m</td><td>&euro;17.029m</td><td>&euro;83.374m</td></tr><tr><td>Total number of measures completed</td><td>72,440</td><td>36,627</td><td>25,488</td><td>30,354</td><td>36,099</td><td>201,008</td></tr></table></p><p>The Better Energy Warmer Homes (BEWH) scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty, who meet the eligibility criteria. The measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation. These measures can deliver the most energy savings at the lowest cost to the greatest number of homes. In 2016, 6,743 homes received energy efficiency upgrades under the BEWH scheme and the level of funding was just over &euro;20m.</p><p>The Better Energy Communities Programme (BEC) aims to encourage community based partnerships to improve the thermal and electrical efficiency of the building stock and energy poor homes and facilities, encouraging the implementation of deeper and more technically and economically challenging measures. These partnerships can be between the public and private sectors, domestic and non-domestic sectors, commercial and not-for-profit organisations and energy suppliers. The community and business supports leverage considerable additional private investment. In 2016, almost &euro;17m in funding provided for energy efficiency upgrades to more than 2,600 homes and almost 300 community and commercial facilities. </p><p>Beginning this year the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme will be co-funded by European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) as part of a wider package of State expenditure of &euro;150m which is required to draw down &euro;75m in ERDF grant funding. My Department also continues to explore ways to avail of EU funds in the form of financial instruments, which would be re-payable to the EU. It is necessary to bring forward projects of significant scale, with robust business cases, for such EU funding. Exploring options to develop projects of sufficient scale is a key objective of the range of energy efficiency pilot schemes, which have either begun, or are being becoming operational in 2017, particularly in the residential sector where the need for alternatives to the Exchequer will be necessary to fund the scale of deeper renovation required to place that sector on the trajectory required to meet long term emissions reduction targets. </p></reply>

In addition, 100% of the Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann city fleets are wheelchair accessible, as well as 80% of the Bus &Eacute;ireann coach fleet.</p>  <p>  With regard to existing infrastructure, there is an ongoing programme to upgrade public transport infrastructure and facilities to help improve transport accessibility across the country.  The programme is managed by the National Transport Authority (NTA) on behalf of my Department.  The bulk of this funding has been provided for the upgrading of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann rail stations to make them accessible and to enable wheelchair users to travel on Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann buses.</p>  <p>  In 2017 under the Accessibility Grants Programme, funding is being provided to the NTA for accessibility upgrade works at a number of rail stations; for accessible bus stops and bus stations; and for a Wheelchair Accessible Taxi Grant Scheme.  Funding is also provided via the NTA for the Travel Assistance Scheme which is run by Dublin Bus.  Under the scheme an assistant can accompany people who need help using public transport and to plan a journey on Dublin Bus, Luas and the DART.</p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility for the administration of the accessibility grants programme, I have referred the Deputy's question to the Authority for a more detailed reply in relation to the costings requested.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days. </p></reply>

Some local authorities allow free designated parking for a period of time while a plug-in electric vehicle is charging but it is a matter for each individual authority to consider how to treat this.</p><p>I am, of course, committed to exploring mechanisms to encourage increased take up of electric vehicles.  My Department, together with the Department for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, have convened an Interdepartmental Low Emissions Vehicle (LEV) Task Force to consider the range of measures and options available to Government for the purpose of accelerating the deployment of low carbon technologies, especially EVs, in line with the &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; commitment. </p><p>The LEV Task Force has begun its work and has divided its work into three workstreams.  It will review the full suite of possible measures to encourage increased take up of LEVs.  Public parking and charges will be considered in this context.  The Task Force also intends to provide an opportunity for stakeholders and members of the public to contribute to the issues considered.  Progress being made by the Task force will be available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

My Department's Statement of Strategy 2016-2019 lists publication of a new Public Transport Policy Statement as a key indicator of progress.  My Department plans to undertake this work later this year.</p>  <p>  The Statement will take cognisance of relevant initiatives in several other areas of public policy on which Government is already deeply engaged including the preparation of a new National Planning Framework (NPF), the Action Plan for Rural Development and a National Mitigation Plan and Climate Adaption Paper for the transport sector.  There are a number of other considerations which will also have a bearing on the development of policy.  For example, we will have to deliver a step change in the funding of public transport if we are to deliver and maintain a well-functioning transport system that will support economic recovery and deliver modal shift.  I will be ensuring that a strong case in this regard is made as part of the Mid-Term Review of the Capital Investment and Expenditure Review.</p>  <p>  However, while all of these considerations are important, I'm clear that the ordinary citizen must be at the heart of public transport policy.  Placing the citizen at the heart of our policy will allow us to realise the true potential of public transport and allow it to play its full role in promoting both social progress and economic prosperity.</p></reply>

These routes are not eligible for any taxpayer funding and frequently operate in competition with other commercial licensed operators.</p><p>As I have stated on numerous occasions, in cases where a commercial operator, such as Expressway, decides to alter or withdraw a route, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has the statutory powers available to it to respond as appropriate to ensure continued transport connectivity.</p><p>In response to Bus &Eacute;ireann's recent announcement of service changes, the NTA has published an assessment of the proposed changes and indicated what action it believes is necessary to ensure that continued connectivity.</p><p>As indicated in that published assessment, the NTA does not believe that connectivity issues arise on the route 33 corridor following the proposed withdrawal of Expressway's route 33. In publishing its assessment the NTA has invited feedback on its proposals.  A copy of their assessment is available on www.nationaltransport.ie</p><p>The Deputy is aware that the county as a whole, and the route 33 corridor in particular, is served by a number of public transport options such as  -</p><p>-  Expressway's route 32 services serving Dublin to Letterkenny (with connections possible at Strabane for onward journey to Derry);</p><p>-  Translink's X3 services serving Dublin to Derry;</p><p>-  A private licensed operator serving Monaghan to Dublin; and</p><p>-  Bus &Eacute;ireann PSO routes providing regional connectivity with Dundalk and Drogheda.</p><p>In light of the information I have provided I think it more beneficial if a meeting were to be arranged with the NTA and I have therefore forwarded the Deputy's request to them for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive responses within ten working days.</p></reply>

Even prior to the referendum result, there was a commitment in the Government's Tourism Policy Statement <i>&quot;People, Place and Policy &ndash; Growing Tourism to 2025&quot;</i>to prioritising tourism marketing efforts towards those markets providing higher revenue returns.  The Programme for Government commits to implementing the policy objectives in the policy statement and achieving the targets for Irish tourism contained therein.  The UK vote does not change this.</p><p>A key element of Tourism Ireland's strategy since 2014 has been market diversification.  In 2017, Tourism Ireland will continue to implement its market diversification strategy and intends to maximise holiday revenue through investment in Mainland Europe and North America.  In addition the depreciation of sterling against the euro since the UK referendum means that value for money will be a key message for Tourism Ireland in Britain this year.  Looking to the medium term, Tourism Ireland's plan for the period from 2017-2019 includes the agency's response to marketing Ireland in Great Britain in the new situation that has developed following the referendum. </p><p>I should also highlight that I am aware of the challenges faced by the border region which were confirmed when Minister of State Patrick O'Donovan and I hosted an All-Island Dialogue on the impact of Brexit on the tourism and hospitality sector in Dundalk on 23 January.  The feedback from tourism industry participants at the event reaffirmed the Government's analysis in relation to the implications of Brexit for tourism and I am committed to an ongoing dialogue with the tourism and hospitality industry as the Brexit negotiations proceed.</p></reply>

I set the work programme in consultation with the CLRG at least once in every two years under section 961 of the Companies Act 2014.  The current work programme began in June 2016 and runs to the end of May 2018 and work on these matters is ongoing.  A copy of the work programme is available on www.clrg.org.</p>  <p>  Receivership is a remedy that derives from the courts of equity.  The relevant law in relation to receivership is largely made up of rules which the courts have developed by applying general contract law and equitable principles.  A receiver has specific statutory duties under section 439 of the Companies Act 2014, which provides that:</p>  <p>  (i)  receivers must achieve the best price reasonably obtainable at the time of sale; and</p>  <p>  (ii)  the receiver must not sell by private contract a non-cash asset of a company to a person who is or who, within three years prior to the date of appointment of the receiver, has been, an officer of the company unless the Receiver has given 14 days&rsquo; notice of his or her intention to do so to all creditors of the company who are known to him or her or who have been intimated to him or her. </p>  <p>  These statutory duties make it imperative that the receiver obtains expert legal and valuation advice in relation to the sale of property, consistent with the duty &ldquo;to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable&rdquo;.  Breach of a receiver&rsquo;s statutory duties may result in the receiver being held personally liable for any loss incurred. </p>  <p>  The work programme of the CLRG does not include a review of the law where receivers are appointed to buy to let properties.  However, the Deputy may wish to note that a cross-departmental working party, chaired by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, is currently examining, in the context of the Government's Strategy for the Rental Sector, ways in which landlord obligations could be enforced during receiverships. </p></reply>

While the Czech Republic had not been an EU member at the time of the agreement in 1996, in 2004 the country had become an EU member and the legal framework under which both countries operated had therefore changed.  The main provisions of the Agreement were terminated in 2010 by a formal diplomatic note received from the Czechs.  A Government Decision in 2011 authorised the Minister for Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Innovation, to arrange for the termination of the BIT with the Czech Republic.  All provisions of the BIT were terminated with effect from 1 December 2011, which was one month after the notification by the Czech Embassy that their internal legal procedures had been completed.   </p>  <p>  The European Commission at the time were looking at the issue of Intra-EU BITs and had taken the view that there was no need for agreements of this kind in the Single Market.   </p>  <p>  The Commission considers that BITs between EU Member States fragment the single market by conferring rights to some EU investors on a bilateral basis and that their provisions overlap and conflict with EU single market law on cross-border investments.  The Commission requested Member States which continued to have intra-EU BITS to terminate these BITs.</p></reply>

In this respect, work has progressed well on developing a policy response to the Programme for Government commitment to address the increased casualisation of work and to strengthen the regulation of precarious employment. We intend to include protections aimed particularly at low-paid, more vulnerable workers.  Our proposals will address the issue of employees on low hour contracts who consistently work more hours each week but whose contracts do not reflect the reality of their hours worked.  The proposals will also seek to ensure that employees are better informed about the nature of their employment arrangements and their core terms at an early stage in their employment.</p>  <p>  The policy response is being informed by the University of Limerick study on zero hour contracts and low hour contracts as well as the extensive material and practical examples provided by respondents to the public consultation conducted by my Department.</p>  <p>  Developing policy proposals in this area is a complex matter.  A balance needs to be found between protecting the rights of employees and avoiding unintended consequences on business which may negatively affect the competitiveness of the Irish economy. </p>  <p>  My Department engaged in an intensive dialogue process with ICTU and IBEC in an effort to secure broad agreement before finalising proposals.  The intention now is to submit our proposals to Government in Q1 2017 for consideration and approval to draft a Bill giving effect to those proposals. I envisage that the proposed legislation would, subject to Government approval, be published as a matter of priority once a Bill is drafted.   </p></reply>

Launched last year, the Action Plan for Education 2016 &ndash; 2019 contains a range of actions to be implemented with a particular focus on identifying and addressing the skills needs of employers in skills areas such as engineering and STEM related skills demands.  The National Skills Strategy 2025 also launched in 2016, contains over 140 Actions, a number of which of which are aimed at identifying and addressing skills shortages across various sectors including engineering and STEM related skills demands.</p>  <p>  The 9 Regional Skills Fora have been established and a Regional Skills Manager has been appointed to lead the activities of each Forum.  The Managers have established a strong network of working relationships between the relevant stakeholders in the region, with particular focus on liaison between enterprise and education and training providers in advancing the objectives of each Forum which include addressing identified skills demands by using evidence based data in the various sectors in each Region.  </p>  <p>  The expert report on education in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) in Irish primary and post-primary schools was published in November 2016 by the STEM Education Review Group.  The report presents a detailed examination of the provision of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education in Ireland.  One of the recommendations of the report is for the development of an integrated National STEM Education Policy Statement by end June 2017 and that this Policy Statement should include a detailed implementation plan with responsibilities and timelines clearly outlined.  </p>  <p>  Within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, significant improvements have been made in the planning and funding of provision since the publication of the FET Strategy in 2014.  Education and Training Boards engage in a service planning process annually against a range of detailed parameters set by SOLAS.  This process has been refined and improved each year and includes the use of strengthened labour market data provided by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit to ensure that the skill needs of learners and enterprise are met.  </p>  <p>  The FET Services Plan published by SOLAS each year since 2014 sets out measures to address FET skill needs in line with labour market and EGFSN forecasts.  ETBs are currently reviewing existing provision for the purpose of matching capacity with potential demand for specific programmes e.g. apprenticeship, engineering, entrepreneurship and IT.  This will also enable the realignment of course provision to meet identified skills needs.</p>  <p>  In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was initiated by SOLAS in collaboration with the ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice.  The Career Traineeship model of work-based learning is currently being piloted with the Hospitality and Engineering sectors, with the involvement of seven ETBs.</p>  <p>  Funding is provided to the Higher Education Institutions to support summer camps in Computer Science for second level students.  The aim of the camps is to encourage more students to take up Computer Science at third level.  In 2016, 29 camps were funded accommodating over 1,245 students.  Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) computing departments are centrally involved in supporting coder dojos, providing facilities to host dojos, third level computing students to run clubs and lecturers to provide mentoring strategies.  HEIs link their computing camps and computing outreach activities to Coder dojo activities and use these to foster greater links with secondary schools within their region.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 provided for an additional &euro;1 million to support 200 places on Level 9 ICT conversion courses for graduates of non ICT courses to convert to this skill shortage area.</p>  <p>  All Higher Education Institutions work within their own region to promote STEM courses examples include Limerick for IT and Limerick for Engineering where organisers host events aimed at second level students and their parents with invited industry and higher education institution representatives to promote STEM as a career.</p>  <p>  The Higher Education Authority has recently issued a further Call for course proposals to be funded under Springboard+ 2017.  Springboard+ provides jobseekers with free part-time upskilling and reskilling higher education opportunities in areas of identified skills need to include skills shortages in STEM.</p>  <p>  In relation to the employment of non-EEA nationals, the State's general policy is to promote the sourcing of labour and skills needs from within the workforce of Ireland and the European Economic Area (EEA).  The employment permits system, which the Department Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation  administers, is intended to offer an interim solution for employers where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA.  </p>  <p>  The system offers a conduit into the Irish labour market for non-EEA nationals with in-demand skills and is operated as a vacancy-led system.  Vacancies must be for eligible occupations &ndash; the system is ordered by the use of lists which determine which occupations are highly demanded and which are ineligible for consideration for employment permits.  </p>  <p>  Changes to access to the Irish labour market for specific occupations via the employment permits system are made on the basis of research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) in tandem with a consultation process, as part of a package of measures to meet those skills needs.  Such changes are made on the basis of bi-annual reviews, which include a public consultation process.  </p>  <p>  Non-EEA engineering professionals with specified skills in electrical, electronics, mechanical, design and development, and production and process, as well as material scientists are currently included on the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List for employment permits, which means that such professionals may be granted Critical Skills Employment Permits if they choose to work in this State.  </p>  <p>  Critical Skills Employment Permits confer a number of benefits to their holders which are additional to those offered by other employment permit types, including immediate access to the Irish labour market for specified family members.  All other types of engineering professional are eligible for employment permits, and may apply for a General Employment Permit if they don&rsquo;t meet the criteria for a Critical Skills Employment Permit.  </p>  <p>  The next review of the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List will take place in the 2nd quarter of 2017, and submissions relating to in demand occupations will be invited, via the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (www.djei.ie), during that review.</p></reply>

I understand that information on children's absences from care is being collected in all administrative areas, and is being used in service and care planning for children in care.  However, it may not be collated in the manner referred to by the Deputy.  I have asked Tusla, the Child and Family Agency for the information and I will respond to you when their reply has been received.</p>  <p>  A child in care would be expected to have an Absence Management Plan.  This is used to assess the risk in the event of a child going missing and the action to be taken.  A child in care is considered to be missing when his or her whereabouts are unknown and the Absence Management Plan indicates concern for the child&rsquo;s safety.  For example, a child in care can be subject to curfews as part of their placement plan that reflect their ability to keep themselves safe.  It should be remembered that most children in care live in family settings in the community.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that I have been assured that there is strong inter-agency co-operation to promote the safety and welfare of children who are reported missing from care.  In this regard, a Joint Protocol between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, sets out the procedure to be followed in the event that a child in care goes missing.  Children in care are recognised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla as being among the most vulnerable in our society.</p></reply>
