    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-12a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/997" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031200045#WRA00600"><p>The proposed State intervention under the National Broadband Plan represents a very significant capital investment project for the State.  The Minister has undertaken to complete a detailed intervention strategy that will be submitted to Government in mid 2015. This process is complex and will include close examination of issues such as:</p><p>- The appropriate ownership model for the infrastructure;</p><p>- Whether there will there be a single contractor or multiple contractors to build the infrastructure;</p><p>- The potential cost of the intervention;</p><p>- Funding options;</p><p>- The appropriate duration of the contract; and</p><p>- How the service quality is to be measured and assured.</p><p>Because a very competitive procurement process is anticipated, it would be neither advisable nor appropriate to speculate about potential costs at this stage and it is preferable to allow the market players bid what they deem an appropriate price, taking account of the Government's decisions on the key issues, such as those I have already outlined.</p><p>There are a number of different perspectives in relation to the Deputy's reference to job creation.  There will obviously be jobs created during the construction and deployment of a new high-speed network.  The precise numbers will be very much a matter for the successful bidder or bidders to determine, particularly as it is very likely that the contract with the State will contain clear deadlines for the completion of this work.</p><p>More importantly, the delivery of high quality reliable broadband to every premises in Ireland will open up new job opportunities right across the economy.  The digital economy currently represents 5% of GDP and is one of the fastest growing sectors in the economy.  Irish consumers spend around &euro;700,000 per hour, 24 hours a day online and the digital industry supports almost 100,000 direct and indirect jobs</p><p>The importance of focusing on digital and its potential to contribute to economic growth and job creation cannot be under-estimated. In a fully functioning digitally enabled economy, research from McKinsey suggests that for every job displaced by digital, 1.6 additional jobs will be created.  Research also shows that companies which have a meaningful online trading presence grow twice as fast, export twice as much and employ twice as many people.  Ensuring that all businesses have access to reliable broadband is therefore important.  It will also allow the opportunity for new digital enterprises to emerge. </p><p>In delivering a reliable high speed network the Government aims to catalyse employment opportunities, particularly in rural areas, which heretofore may have struggled to create and sustain employment.</p></reply>

This process included:</p><p>- a public written consultation process where members of the public had ten weeks in which to lodge their submissions;</p><p>- six seminars, one on each of the policy priority areas identified for consideration in the Green Paper;</p><p>- a separate seminar on the broad topic of energy costs for businesses; and</p><p>- four regional seminars.</p><p>Over 1,200 submissions were received as part of the written consultation process.</p><p>The six &quot;priority&quot; seminars and the &quot;costs&quot; seminar were organised by the Department and held in Dublin.  The four regional seminars were organised by Irish Rural Link on behalf of the Department to ensure, insofar as was possible, that local, rural and regional interests were represented and provided with an opportunity to express their views on all aspects of Irish energy policy.</p><p>The purpose of the public consultation and stakeholder engagement events was to invite observations and suggestions from interested parties, to tease out the most important points highlighted, to express any other views, whether in writing or orally, and to identify policy points for consideration. </p><p>The next stage, now underway, involves a thorough analysis of the issues raised to distil the main themes into the policy paper.  In this regard, the Minister will be advised by the expert members of the Energy Policy Advisory Group, which he established in September 2014.  The members of the group are Professor John FitzGerald, formerly of the Economic and Social Research Institute, Ms. Helen Donoghue, a member of the Institute of International and European Affairs, and formerly of the European Commission, and Dr. Brian Motherway, CEO of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  The forthcoming policy paper will, when published in September 2015, set a clear policy framework out to 2030.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-12a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/997" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031200045#WRA01200"><p>The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers.  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020, to be achieved through 40% renewables in electricity, 12% in heat and 10% in transport. In 2013, 7.8% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy.</p>  <p>  Transitioning to greater use of renewable energy is important for sustainability.  Using our indigenous resources is also important given that we currently import 89% of our total energy use including all of our oil, and over 95% of our gas. In 2013 we spent approximately &euro;6.7 billion on imported energy.  Keeping some of that &euro;6.7 billion in our own economy would facilitate investment, growth and jobs, and enhance our balance of payments.</p>  <p>  There are a range of policies in place to incentivise the increased use of renewable energy.  The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies, including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind.  To date, wind energy has been the most cost effective renewable technology in the Irish electricity market, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. </p>  <p>  Part L of the Building Regulations supports the uptake of renewable heat and the recently published Draft Bioenergy Plan recommends the introduction from 2016 of a Renewable Heat Incentive for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources.  The Biofuels Obligation Scheme and grant support for the purchase of electric vehicles underpin the deployment of renewable energy in the transport sector. </p>  <p>  Looking beyond 2020, the October 2014 European Council endorsed a binding EU target of at least 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 2030 compared to 1990. In addition, an EU target of at least 27% is set for the share of renewable energy consumed in the EU in 2030, and an indicative target at EU level of at least 27% is set for improving energy efficiency in 2030 compared to projections of future energy consumption.</p>  <p>  Ireland intends to make a cost-effective, achievable and fair contribution to these high level EU goals.  The Department is overseeing detailed and rigorous energy system and economic modelling to identify the contribution which is appropriate for Ireland, taking account of our specific economic circumstances.  This analysis will address issues such as the quantum of additional renewable electricity we should seek to achieve by 2030, the technologies that should be supported in this regard, and the level at which any future supports should be set.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-12a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/997" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031200045#WRA01600"><p>The National Broadband Plan aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service.  This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services with approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016.  This map is available at . The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016. The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention.  The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises/home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. </p><p>A public consultation on the map, which commenced in November, closed on the 12th February last.  29 submissions have been received to date and will be assessed over the coming weeks.  This will help inform the key decisions that reqiure to be taken in order to finalise the comprehensive Intervention Strategy whichthe Minister intends publishing for consultation in July next. </p><p>The strategy will address a range of important issues in relation to the intervention including the optimum procurement model, ownership and governance options, funding issues and levels of service for end-users.  Part of the analysis being undertaken involves consideration of identifying and prioritising strategic connection points such as enterprise parks, schools, and other points of economic or social activity within rural communities. </p><p>The proposed Intervention will also be subject to State Aid clearance from the European Commission. </p><p>Following the public consultation this summer, a detailed procurement process, in line with EU and Irish procurement rules, will be undertaken in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders.  The Department will design the tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible.  I anticipate that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having all premises connected within a 5 year period.</p><p>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government.  It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

These assessment processes will commence shortly.  The draft Plan sets out the broader context for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s biomass sector, and the current status with regard to the range of policy areas that must be coordinated in order to create the conditions necessary to support the development of this sector.</p>  <p>  The analysis underpinning the draft Plan is that an additional bioenergy focussed measure in the heat sector would represent the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals including reducing the emerging gap, in terms of meeting our 2020 Renewable Heat target, anticipated in the heat sector. Accordingly, the draft Plan recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive to incentivise larger heat users in the industrial and commercial sector to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources in order to deliver the additional heat required in the context of meeting 12% of heat demand from renewable sources by 2020. There are no plans at this time to introduce such a scheme for domestic heat users.</p>  <p>  The design of the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme will commence this year and will include public consultation, the first stage of which will be launched shortly.  The consultation process will seek views on a range of issues including the technologies that should be included.  Once designed, it will require State Aid clearance from the European Commission and further Government approval. Subject to these approvals, it is proposed to have the scheme in place in 2016.</p></reply>

Reflecting the cross-sectoral nature of bioenergy research, the working group will draw membership from the relevant Departments and Agencies, including Teagasc as well as engaging with third level institutions and commercial bodies.</p>  <p>  The Department does not directly provide bioenergy research funding to Universities nor does it do do so for Teagasc.  It does, however, provide the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland with funding to support research, development and demonstration projects in the area of renewable energy, including bioenergy. </p>  <p>  I am advised that Teagasc, along with other research bodies, applies for research funding through competitive research programmes such as the Research Stimulus Fund and from other sources such as EU funds and industry.  It is also in receipt of an annual grant-in-aid allocation from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to fund the delivery of core research, advisory and education services to the agriculture and food sector.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services with approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November the Minister published a national high speed coverage map for 2016.  This map is available at .  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016.  The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention.  The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises/home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. </p><p>A public consultation on the map, which commenced in November, closed on 12 February last.  28 submissions have been received to date and will be assessed over the coming weeks.  This will help inform the key decisions that require to be taken in order to finalise our comprehensive Intervention Strategy which the Minister intends publishing for consultation in July next. </p><p>The strategy will address a range of important issues in relation to the intervention including the optimum procurement model, ownership and governance options, funding issues and levels of service for end-users.  Part of the analysis being undertaken involves consideration of identifying and prioritising strategic connection points such as enterprise parks, schools and other points of economic or social activity within rural communities. </p><p>The proposed Intervention will also be subject to State Aid clearance from the European Commission. </p><p>Following the public consultation this summer, a detailed procurement process, in line with EU and Irish procurement rules, will be undertaken in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders.  The Department will design the tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible.  It is anticipated that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having all premises connected within a 5 year period.</p><p>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government.

The Directive also requires the involvement of energy distributors and retailers in meeting this obligation. Ireland has decided to meet this target by imposing a lower target of 0.75% on the energy industry, with additional Government measures to deliver the remaining 0.75% of the EU target.  By splitting responsibility for the required savings between industry and Government, an appropriate balance has been struck that allows Ireland to meet its obligation at a lower cost to the consumer.</p>  <p>  To implement this obligation, Energy Efficiency Notices have issued to energy suppliers under Statutory Instrument No. 131 of 2014.  These notices impose legally binding energy saving obligations on all energy suppliers that sell more than 600 gigawatt hours of energy for the years 2014-2016.  Suppliers have considerable flexibility in how they seek to achieve the required energy savings.  However, 70% of the required savings must be delivered in the commercial sector, a further 25% in the domestic sector, with 5% focused on customers experiencing energy poverty. </p>  <p>  The obligation encourages suppliers to offer more innovative energy service products to their customers.  Developing the scope for energy consumers to manage their energy use is becoming increasingly important in the transition to a more sustainable energy system.</p>  <p>  It is the Minister's intention to publish a report on the operation of the obligation scheme later this year.  This report will detail the energy savings achieved in 2014 and the costs associated with achieving those savings.  The Minister is confident that this EU obligation can be achieved at a minimal cost to consumers.  It is up to energy suppliers how they reflect these costs on consumers' bills, subject to the regulatory requirements of the Commission for Energy Regulation.</p></reply>

The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020, to be achieved through 40% renewables in electricity, 12% in heat and 10% in transport.</p>  <p>  Policies and schemes are in place to incentivise the use of renewable energy.  The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies, including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind.  To date, wind energy has been the most cost effective renewable technology in the Irish electricity market, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. </p>  <p>  Part L of the Building Regulations supports the uptake of renewable heat and the recently published Draft Bioenergy Plan recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. </p>  <p>  The Biofuels Obligation Scheme and grant support for the purchase of electric vehicles underpin the deployment of renewable energy in the transport sector. </p>  <p>  Looking beyond 2020, the October 2014 European Council endorsed a binding EU target of at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.  In addition, an EU target of at least 27% is set for the share of renewable energy consumed in the EU in 2030, and an indicative target at EU level of at least 27% is set for improving energy efficiency in 2030 compared to projections of future energy consumption.</p>  <p>  Ireland intends to make a cost-effective, achievable and fair (in terms of effort sharing among Member States), contribution to these high level EU goals.  The Department is overseeing detailed and rigorous energy system and economic modelling to identify the contribution which is appropriate for Ireland taking account of our specific economic circumstances.  This analysis will address issues such as the quantum of additional renewable electricity we should seek to achieve by 2030, the technologies that should be supported in this regard, and the level at which any future supports should be set. </p></reply>

Since their introduction in 2011, more than 120,000 meters have been distributed.  These meters have proved to be effective in helping to reduce disconnections.  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has recently reported a 38% fall in disconnections for quarter three of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.  I understand the CER views Pay As You Go meters as contributing significantly to this improvement. </p>  <p>  In light of the assistance that Pay   As You Go metering is providing to households under financial pressure, it is critical that these households do not incur any charges for availing of them.  In recent months the Minister has publically called for an end to this practice by retailers.  Senior officials from the Department have also met with the payment service providers to communicate to them the critical importance of them making every effort to address this issue.  The payment services providers have advised that the level of customer complaints is low and that they are working with energy suppliers to investigate and address persistent problems.  The willingness of the payment service providers to engage is acknowledged, and the Minister would wish to see such a response from representatives of the retail sector.  In the coming weeks the Department will be meeting with some retailers principals.  Should the problem of surcharging continue, the Minister is prepared to consider the legislative options thay may be open to him. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, it is recommended that consumers would report any instances of the application of surcharges to Pay As You Go transactions to both their energy supplier and the relevant payment service provider.</p></reply>

The Minister has no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.</p>  <p>  The CER, in 2006, approved a network connections policy which enabled reassessment of the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.</p>  <p>  This policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Uneconomic projects are not permitted as they would increase costs for all energy consumers.</p>  <p>Under the CER&rsquo;s policy framework, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and more recently Gaslink, carried out a comprehensive review of towns not connected to the national gas network.  Gaslink published its New Towns Analysis Phase 3 report in 2010.  It assessed the feasibility of connecting 11 towns in the West and North West region which are the focus of the Western Development Commission paper, &ldquo;Why Invest in Gas&rdquo;.  However, the Gaslink review found that none of the towns qualified for connection on economic grounds.</p>  <p>  As the successor to Gaslink, Gas Networks Ireland (GNI) will continue to review the towns which did not qualify for connection in 2010 as well as other towns.  The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually as a result of the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.</p>  <p>  The CER is currently consulting on a submission received by it from GNI on revisions to CER's existing connections policy, as mentioned above.</p></reply>

I understand that analysis is ongoing and will be finalised shortly.  When published, the analysis will, for the first time, provide a comprehensive overview of the entire commercial and industrial building stock in Ireland and identify additional cost effective renovation measures for every category of building in Ireland-domestic, public sector, commercial and industrial.  Accordingly, the analysis will provide the basis for the identification of a range of measures with the potential to enhance progress towards our 2020 target in a cost effective manner.

Various schemes and initiatives are in place to incentivise the use of renewable energy:</p>  <p>  - The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies, including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind;</p>  <p>  - Relatively large electricity customers, e.g. industrial users, may become autoproducers and install generation, including renewable generation, at their site to meet their needs and export any excess to the electricity grid;</p>  <p>  - Part L of the Building Regulations supports the uptake of renewable heat and the recently published Draft Bioenergy Plan recommends the introduction from 2016 of a Renewable Heat Incentive for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable biomass;</p>  <p>  - Investment in renewable energy is supported through tax relief incentives such as the Employment Investment Incentive scheme and the Accelerated Capital Allowance scheme.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) provides a range of supports to businesses covering energy management, training, and advice.  Businesses wishing to develop renewable energy projects and improve their energy efficiency can also avail of grant support for investment in renewable energy installations as a component of a coordinated energy efficiency programme under the Better Energy Communities scheme.</p></reply>

The creation of the portfolios was informed by the resource available, the technological readiness of the various generation technologies and cost required per generated unit based on connection costs, construction costs and operating and maintenance costs. The mapping for the analysis also assessed the deployment potential based on where the resource was and an overview of environmentally designated areas.</p>  <p>  It was following this study that it was decided to pursue 40% renewable electricity in Ireland by 2020. The study concluded that, based on assumptions set out in the Report, wind energy represented a cost effective source for electricity generation. </p>  <p>  In Ireland, the abundant wind resource means that each unit of installed generation capacity generates more units of electricity and hence needs a lower rate per generated unit of electricity in order to recover the overall costs of the project. </p>  <p>  Additionally, various reports and analyses have examined the effect of renewables on electricity prices.  The ESRI, the Irish Wind Energy Association (IWEA), the SEAI and EirGrid have undertaken such studies.  The ESRI and IWEA studies both looked at the 2020 position, while a joint SEAI and EirGrid study looked at the position in 2011.  The SEAI and EirGrid study found that because wind reduces the cost of wholesale electricity when wind is available on the system, the effect of the PSO was cancelled out and the cost was effectively zero.  While this is true for 2011, it is acknowledged that a significant amount of grid build and grid upgrading is required to achieve the 2020 target.  The ESRI study found that wind is a hedge against high fossil fuel prices. In that regard wind also provides security of supply benefits along with climate and sustainability benefits.</p>  <p>  An IWEA member survey in 2014 indicated that 3,400 people are employed in the sector in Ireland.  A report published in 2014 by the ESRI and Trinity College Dublin, estimated direct and indirect employment under various realistic scenarios.  The report, which estimates multiple thousands of jobs depending on the scenario, is available on the ESRI's website. </p>  <p>  Renewable electricity generation in Ireland in 2012 is estimated by the SEAI to have saved 778 ktoe of fossil fuel, with an associated CO2 emissions reduction of 1.94 million tonnes. Of this, wind generation was the largest contributor, with savings estimated at 586 ktoe of fossil-fuel and a CO2 emissions reduction of 1.51 million tonnes. The value of the fossil fuels not consumed in Ireland in 2012 as a result of wind generation was estimated at &euro;177 million, with the value of avoided CO2 emissions being a further &euro;11 million. </p>  <p>  Analysis undertaken by the Department, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), EirGrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) assessed the costs and value of choosing the path towards 40% renewable electricity generation in 2020, compared to a scenario where renewable electricity remained at 2013 levels.  This analysis highlighted the cost effectiveness of wind as a renewable energy source and informed a report which will be published shortly.</p></reply>

The team consisted of representatives seconded on a full time basis from energy suppliers, the finance community and the retrofit industry, with the objective of developing proposals on how a BEF scheme might operate.  The team met on an ongoing basis from December 2012 to November 2013.  The project was overseen by a Steering Committee which met 12 times during 2013.  Following the completion by the project team of its work, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) was tasked with drawing up a detailed implementation plan for the design, development and execution of the scheme.  In that context, meetings between the SEAI and the Department continued during 2014.</p>  <p>  This year &euro;2 million in Exchequer funding has been made available under the Better Energy Communities Scheme to pilot and evaluate innovative financing schemes in a community setting.  The Better Energy Communities Scheme is application led, with a closing date of 20 March 2015.  Applications will be evaluated and projects selected on a competitive basis. A further &euro;1 million has been made available to fund other trials and measures on BEF. These trials are being administered by the SEAI.</p>  <p>  The results of these trials will inform the final design of the BEF Scheme, as will evidence from some schemes in operation internationally.  However, it is important to note that pay-as-you-save type schemes are relatively new in the countries where they exist.  Other countries tend to have multiple financial incentives in place, predominantly grant based, to underpin residential retrofit programmes. </p>  <p>  The work carried out to date in Ireland suggests that there is an understandable reluctance for households to take on additional debt and the success of a BEF Scheme would, therefore, require a compelling consumer proposition with accompanying incentives to capture consumer interest and drive action.  It is likely that this would require a combination of some Exchequer funded grants and a consumer financing offering.</p></reply>

At that time the Commission also issued a Communication outlining the potential new opportunities and challenges stemming from shale gas extraction in Europe, as well as an Impact Assessment that examined the socio-economic and environmental impacts of various policy options. Member States were invited to inform the Commission by the end of 2014 on measures that they had put in place in response to the Recommendation and the Commission has recently published the information provided by Member States.  As expected, the information provided illustrates differing circumstances between Member States in terms of both the existence of unconventional hydrocarbon resources and where such resources exist, whether or not exploration is taking place.</p>  <p>  While the Commission has not proposed a uniform approach to regulation in this area, it has has confirmed that assessment of projects proposing the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration for and production of shale gas, is subject to a number of EU Directives, including the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and the Habitats Directive.  In addition to the Recommendation and Communication mentioned already, the Commission has published a number of research documents into the potential impacts of unconventional exploration and extraction of gas including:</p>  <p>1.  Unconventional Gas: Potential Energy Market Impacts in the EU; </p>  <p>2.  Climate Impact of Potential Shale Gas Production in the EU;</p>  <p>3.

As the Deputy will be aware, decision making in Ireland will be informed by the findings of a major programme of research that was commissioned last year by the EPA, with a report expected in 2016.

There are currently in excess of 810,000 customers with direct eligibility with an annual allocation of &euro;77 million.</p>  <p>  Approximately &euro;61.3 million is paid to the CI&Eacute; group in respect of free travel on Irish Rail, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus, &euro;11.2 million to other operators, &euro;1.5 million for the Rural Transport Programme and the remainder is allocated for the cross-border and All-Ireland travel schemes.</p>  <p>  Operators often make changes to their routes, including increasing and reducing the number and location of stops.  This requires the approval of the licensing authority, which is the National Transport Authority.  Where there are significant changes to the operation of a particular route, the funding for free travel may be reviewed by the Department.</p>  <p>  As regards routes with PSO funding, including routes previously operated by CI&Eacute;, it is my intention that private operators will be able to apply to participate in the free travel scheme.  </p>  <p>  In regard to the cap on funding imposed by the previous Government at a time of increasing free travel passenger numbers, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I established an interdepartmental working group to examine and report on the current operation and future development of the free travel scheme.  The interdepartmental group has concluded its work and I expect to see a copy of its review shortly.</p></reply>

The broad role of the group is to consider the constituent factors involved in constructing an efficient and effective universal retirement savings system and to bring a recommendation to Government in the form of a roadmap and estimated timeline for introduction. </p>  <p>  The URSG consists of senior officials from key Government departments and those public bodies with a particular responsibility and expertise in the area. Membership also includes international representatives from the UK&rsquo;s Department for Work and Pensions and the OECD who bring significant expertise in designing, delivering and assessing supplementary pension systems. </p>  <p>  In undertaking specific or specialised areas of its work programme the group will consult with, and invite submissions from, pension&rsquo;s experts external to the group. This will include establishing reference groups to utilise expertise and facilitate input from various sectorial interests such as those from the pensions industry, representatives of employers, trade unions and consumer/interest groups.  The consultation process will also include an open invitation for written submissions from any parties with an interest in this area.</p>  <p>  The first meeting of the Universal Retirement savings Group took place on 25 February 2015.

Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions is not entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment. </p>  <p>  A student undergoing a full-time course of study, instruction or training is disqualified from receiving jobseekers allowance or benefit.  This disqualification also extends to the holiday periods, including the summer holidays. In addition, a person volunteering abroad will not satisfy the criteria of being available for and genuinely seeking work and is therefore disqualified from receiving a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment. </p>  <p>  The disqualification for receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance does not apply in the case of mature students during the period between two academic years. During this period a mature student can apply for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance, subject to satisfying the standard qualifying conditions, including that of being available for full-time work.</p>  <p>  More generally the social security rights of workers and their families moving within the EU are dealt with by EU regulations on the coordination of social security systems.  These regulations deal with a wide range of issues including the jurisdiction in which people should pay social insurance, the aggregation of contributions made in other Member States, liability for payment of benefits and in the case of pensions, how those benefits are calculated.   The competent Member State for insurance and benefits is decided on the basis of a priority list starting with employment and ending with residence.   </p>  <p>  In relation to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit the regulations provide that eligibility for benefit is dependent on the person&rsquo;s most recent social insurance contributions being made in the competent Member State.  Accordingly, a person must make their last contribution here before being eligible for benefit.  They can, of course, count contributions made in other Member States towards qualification once their last contribution has been paid in this jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  Any person who is involuntarily unemployed and fails to qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit may claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance which is subject, inter alia, to a means test and the habitual residence condition. </p></reply>

These classifications are based on self-declaration by the individual respondent, rather than his/her situation in respect of welfare payments.  </p>  <p>  The Live Register, which captures those registering for unemployment benefits (including those working part-time and in casual work who draw partial unemployment payments), is an administrative record.

To qualify for the payment, a customer must be a farmer, farming land in the State, aged between 18 and 66 and satisfy a means test</p>  <p>  The means test for Farm Assist takes account of virtually every form of income but assesses it in different ways and disregards various amounts. Different rules apply to income from farming and other forms of self-employment, income from certain schemes such as the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme (REPS) and Agri-Environmental Options Scheme (AEOS), income from employment and income from property and capital. </p>  <p>  The review form does not have space to outline farm outgoings as it would typically not be feasible for customers to list the entire farm operating costs for the previous 12 month period on the form. However, a customer can supply details of outgoings with the completed review form if they so wish.</p>  <p>  An examination of farm outgoings is included in the assessment process and the Social Welfare Inspector takes a detailed account of all operating costs when interviewing the customer. This usually gives the customer a good opportunity to explain both the income generated and the operating costs associated with the farm directly with an Inspector. </p></reply>

Class B covers civil servants, registered doctors and dentists employed in the civil service and Garda&iacute;.  Class C covers commissioned officers of the Defence Forces and members of the Army Nursing Service.  Class D covers employees in the public service other than those mentioned in class B and C.</p>  <p>  Subject to having the required number of PRSI contributions, employees who pay modified contributions have access to the following payments:</p>  <p>  (a) widow's/widower's (contributory) pension and surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory) pension;</p>  <p>  (b) guardians payment (contributory) and;</p>  <p>  (c) carer's benefit.</p>  <p>  The payment of PRSI on self-employed income was introduced in 1988 when self-employed workers were brought into social insurance for the first time.  As modified rate contributors already benefit from an occupational pension which is funded by the State, they are excepted self-employed contributors in accordance with Schedule 1, Part 3, paragraph 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.   </p>  <p>  The obligation to return income, including self-employed income, at the correct PRSI rate rests with the individual.  In cases where PRSI was incorrectly paid, a refund, subject to the four year rule, may be claimed.  I do not propose to automatically refund public sector workers who incorrectly paid PRSI or to extend the period for public sector workers to claim a refund of PRSI.  The provision in relation to the four year limit on the return of PRSI contributions was introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2009 and has been in effect since 1 January 2010.  The time limit governing the refund of PRSI contributions is in line with the arrangements of the Revenue Commissioners governing the refund of tax. </p>  <p>  It may not be possible to provide all the figures sought by the Deputy.  My Department is currently compiling the figures that are available and will provide these to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

According to DSP figures on the numbers and ages of children in receipt of child benefit in 2013, there were approximately 489,500 children under 6 and 385,600 between the ages of 6 and 12. </p>  <p>  If tax relief at the standard rate of 20% was provided on the costs of childcare in respect of even half of these children, it would result in a cost to the Exchequer of in the region of &euro;340 million per annum in respect of those aged under 6 and &euro;290 million in respect of those aged between 6 and 12; a total of &euro;630 million per annum. However, it must be borne in mind that these figures are extremely tentative and the real cost could be much higher. </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that with a view to increasing childcare places available, an exemption from tax is already available on income of up to &euro;15,000 per annum for individuals who mind up to three children in their own home.  The cost of this relief in 2012, the most recent year for which figures are available, was &euro;1 million and it was availed of by 560 individuals.</p>  <p>  Any tax relief for childcare fees could be seen to unfairly discriminate against those individuals who decide to stay at home to care for their children.  While wanting to encourage participation in the workforce, equally we cannot say to individuals who stay at home to care for their own children that they are making a less valuable contribution to society. </p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief would only be of benefit to those in the tax net and it is estimated that in 2015, 38% of income earners will be exempt from income tax.  I would also have concerns that, based on experience with similar tax reliefs designed to reduce the cost of demand led goods and services in the past, any tax relief for the costs of childcare could inevitably be capitalised into the price for childcare services, resulting in a net transfer to childcare providers and no cost reduction for working parents.</p></reply>

The Bill protects borrowers by requiring the entities dealing with the borrower to be regulated. Dealing with the borrower is credit servicing and the definition of credit servicing is broad. New owners of loan books who deal directly with borrowers, that is, who are servicing their own loan books, will be regulated. Otherwise they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm.</p>  <p>  Where the purchaser of a loan book is not a regulated entity in Ireland, the purchaser may voluntarily apply the Central Bank codes when managing loan books and may have internal complaints procedures in place. In the case of homeowners whose loan is now owned by an unregulated entity, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA)  may be applied in the same way that it would be by a regulated lender. The CCMA is designed to support co-operating borrowers and provides extensive protection to customers in difficulty.  It specifies the concrete actions lenders must take in the fair treatment of their customers in order to deal with their mortgage arrears situation as part of a resolution (or MARP) process; it also specifies the series of steps which borrowers need to take in order to engage with their lender.</p>  <p>  Of course, voluntary compliance is not enforceable and borrowers do not have access to the Financial Services Ombudsman or the Central Bank about complaints. This is why the Government committed in March 2014 to ensuring that the same protections are available for all consumers whose loans have been sold.</p>  <p>  The Government's objective was broadly supported in the D&aacute;il at second stage which was taken in the D&aacute;il on 4th February. As I said during second stage any points raised during the course of the debate will be carefully considered. I also said at that time that,  as is usual, the Government is likely to have some amendments of its own at Committee Stage. Since then, Department of Finance officials have been in contact with the Central Bank and with the Office of the Attorney General to further progress the legislation.</p>  <p>  The date for Committee stage has not yet been set. </p></reply>

One of which was to develop a framework to govern the exercise of the State's ownership rights in the banks resulting from the capital injections, including to put in place relationship frameworks with the banks to protect the commercial basis for the banks' operations while under government ownership.</p>  <p>  This matter was again discussed during the fourth review under the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support, the report on which is also available on the Department of Finance website.  It was noted in this report that the recently formed banking division in the Department of Finance were "currently developing relationship frameworks with the banks, to ensure that their core businesses will be run on a commercial basis".  The fifth review, the report to which was published in March 2012 noted that "The authorities are finalizing relationship frameworks with the covered banks consistent with their commitment that their core business will operate on a commercial basis".</p>  <p>  The relationship framework's were in place with each of the banks under State ownership before the report on the sixth review under the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support was published in June 2012.  Between each of these aforementioned reviews, officials in my Department were progressing the introduction of relationship frameworks with each of the banks through ongoing discussions and negotiation.  Each of the Relationship Frameworks were prepared following significant legal and competition law input from the State's legal advisors, which included, among other advice, the inclusion of financial thresholds which would trigger consultation with the Minister for Finance.  Before the Relationship Frameworks for each of the banks were introduced, it was required that they be reviewed by the Directorate-General for Competition and the Irish Competition Authority.</p>  <p>  On 30 March 2012, Relationship Frameworks were put in place by my Department with each of the banks in which the State acquired an interest in the context of the financial crisis to govern the relationship between the State, as shareholder, and each bank.  They were designed to recognise the separation of each bank from the State, to ensure their businesses would be run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the banks as an asset to the State, and to limit the State's intervention to the extent necessary to protect the public interest.</p>  <p>  Under the Relationship Frameworks each bank was to remain a separate economic unit with independent power of decision with its board of directors and management team retaining responsibility for determining the bank's strategies and commercial policies and conducting its day-to-day operations.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, IBRC had a Relationship Framework in place from July 2009 pursuant to the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act 2009.  My officials will review the files surrounding the implementation of this original Relationship Framework for Anglo Irish Bank Corporation and will revert to the Deputy on this matter.</p>  <p>  A revised Relationship Framework with IBRC was published on March 30, 2012 in line with the introduction of similar agreements for each of the other banks.  That followed considerable interaction with the management and Board of IBRC.</p></reply>

The estimated first and full year cost to the Exchequer of decreasing the standard rate of income tax from 20% to 18% and increasing the standard rate band by &euro;1,000 is &euro;894 million and &euro;1.2 billion respectively.</p>  <p>  In relation to the questions on the cost of equalising the tax treatment of PAYE and self-employed taxpayers at certain specified income levels, I assume that the Deputy wishes to ascertain the cost of extending the equivalent of the PAYE Credit to single self-employed individuals.  The estimated cost to the Exchequer of extending the PAYE credit to such individuals on incomes of up to &euro;15,000, &euro;20,000, &euro;25,000, &euro;30,000 and &euro;34,800 is &euro;3 million, &euro;13.5 million, &euro;26.5 million, &euro;38 million and &euro;48 million respectively.  It is important to point out that these estimates assume that the Deputy's proposal specifically excludes the extension of the PAYE credit to self-assessed individuals that are married or civil partners.</p>  <p>  The estimated first and full year cost of exempting 80,000 income earners from liability to the Universal Social Charge (USC) is &euro;16 million and &euro;22 million respectively.  This is costed on the basis of removing the 80,000 cases with the lowest incomes currently paying USC from the charge.</p>  <p>  The estimated first and full year cost to the Exchequer of removing the 3% USC surcharge on self-employed income in excess of &euro;100,000 is &euro;54 million and &euro;125 million respectively.</p>  <p>  In relation to the question regarding reducing both income tax rates by 1%, increasing the standard rate band by &euro;1,000, removing a further 80,000 income earners from USC and extending the equivalent of the PAYE credit to self-employed persons with incomes up to &euro;25,000, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the first and full year cost to the Exchequer is estimated to be in the order of &euro;695 million and &euro;971 million respectively.</p>  <p>  All figures above are estimates for 2015, using the actual data for the year 2012 (the latest year for which data are available) adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.  They are provisional and may be revised.

Numbers assigned to NAMA are projected to reduce to 292 by end December 2015 and to 125 by end December 2016 subject to the achievement of NAMA disposal targets as agreed by the NAMA Board. This will be reviewed in line with progress on meeting targets in 2015 and 2016.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the significant risk to the performance of NAMA posed by the possible early departure of staff before their objectives are reached.  This has been highlighted in the Section 227 review and by the Board of NAMA to me.  I understand this has also been brought to the attention of the Oireachtas by NAMA. I am currently in discussions with the Board of NAMA on the appropriate measures to put in place to protect the financial performance of NAMA.

To this end, the Special Liquidators have published advertisements and written to those known creditors in order to finalise their claims in the liquidation. Creditors in the UK and Ireland have until 31 March 2015 to submit their claims and those creditors in the US have until 31 May 2015. Once all claims have been submitted, they will be reviewed in detail and adjudicated on by the Special Liquidators. In order to finalise this process, further information may be sought from some creditors in order to validate their claim. The Special Liquidators are unable to comment at this stage both on the level of proceeds that will ultimately be generated from the liquidation and on the level of valid creditor claims that will ultimately be received in respect of the liquidation.

Inflation in the euro area has been below levels consistent with price stability for some time and, in fact, became negative last December and remained negative in January and February. The fall in inflation, combined with the fact that inflationary expectations have begun to drift downwards, pose a risk to price stability.</p>  <p>  As a result, and with policy rates effectively at zero per cent, the ECB, on 9 March, launched an expanded asset purchase programme to include bonds issued by euro area central governments, agencies and European institutions. Under this expanded programme, the combined monthly purchases of public and private sector debt securities will amount to &euro;60 billion. These monthly purchases are intended to be carried out from March 2015 until end-September 2016 and will, in any case, be conducted until inflation moves onto a path consistent with price stability. </p>  <p>  The ECB does not have a mandate to reduce existing debts or deficits of the private or public sectors. In addition, monetary financing by the ECB of the public sector is prohibited under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. By purchasing debt in the secondary market, however, the ECB can affect the cost of financing in the economy more broadly, and this will help towards achieving price stability.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Irish economy should benefit from the monetary stimulus through a number of channels which will create employment and reduce unemployment. For example, the economy should benefit directly through improved financing conditions for households and firms. In addition, the euro area is Ireland's single largest export destination; therefore, by supporting real economic activity and raising inflation in the euro area this will underpin the growth of Irish exports. Monetary policy also works through the exchange rate channel   the depreciation of the euro will provide a further boost to Irish exports. </p>  <p>  So quantitative easing will be beneficial in terms of supporting economic recovery, thereby generating employment in Ireland and in the wider euro area. Living standards of euro area citizens will benefit accordingly.</p>  <p>  An inflation rate which is consistent with price stability, and which is supported by appropriate fiscal policies and the implementation of the necessary structural reforms by Member States across the euro area, will facilitate economic recovery and the associated repair of public and private sector balance sheets.</p></reply>

The PMI for February 2015 reported a figure of 52.0 for total activity in the construction sector. As any reading in excess of 50 indicates expansion, the index points towards a slight increase in activity compared to January 2015. However, while the index indicates that the sector is expanding, the rate of expansion has slowed compared with previous monthly surveys. </p>  <p>  The index is composed of three sub-sectors: housing; commercial; and civil engineering.  While the three sub-sector indices were weaker than the previous month, only the civil engineering sub-sector contracted in February. As the Central Bank's macro prudential mortgage rules apply only to residential mortgage lending, this suggests that the weaker PMI figure for February is not being driven by the mortgage lending rules.</p>  <p>  The PMI data should not be viewed in isolation.  The underlying trend has been one of recovery in the construction  sector. Indicators such as the most recent Quarterly National Household Survey from the Central Statistics Office show a year-on-year increase in construction sector employment of 13,000 in the final quarter of 2014.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Construction 2020 is the whole-of-government strategy to address issues that might impede the proper functioning of the property market, and aims to support increased supply in the wider housing market. The Strategy involves ensuring that any critical bottlenecks that might prevent the sector in meeting residential and non-residential demand are addressed through 75 individual time-bound actions.  For example, last week my Department organised a conference on financing options for construction and development to facilitate dialogue and mutual understanding between developers and debt and equity providers.  This will assist in the development of a sustainable financing model for the sector, thereby contributing to enhanced supply over time.</p></reply>

Ballymore Eustace was excluded from the designated map in order to ensure Ireland adhered to its overall allocated national coverage of 51.28% of population.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that all of the Country, including those areas not entitled to Regional Aid, can qualify for other forms of State support e.g. Research &amp;amp; Development Aid, SME Investment Aid, Training Aid, and Aid for Environmental protection etc. </p>  <p>  In respect of Athy, the Deputy is correct in acknowledging an improvement in the aid rate applicable for eligible projects.  This specifically relates to the aid rates for Capital Employment support under the Regional Aid Guidelines of 10%, 20% and 30% for small medium and large companies for the period 2014-2020.  All projects are subjects to assessment in terms of commercial, technical and market due diligence and should represent value for money in terms of the State&rsquo;s investment.  Five companies in the Athy region were approved payments by Enterprise Ireland. Enterprise Ireland also organised a presentation for the Athy Chamber in September 2014 with reference to the changes in the Regional Aid Map.  For reasons of confidentiality, Enterprise Ireland does not give details of individual grants approved to clients.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in the Counties covered by the Regional Aid Programme, including Kildare, are fully apprised of the Guidelines. All LEOs provide a signposting and referral service for their clients to supports available from other State Agencies and this would encompass information on the Regional Aid Schemes operated by Agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, etc.</p>  <p>  In April 2014, IDA Ireland issued a press release welcoming the publication of the new Regional Aid Map and highlighting the new areas being encompassed, including Athy.  Engagement with regional media followed, explaining how the scheme worked and its benefit as an added incentive.  There was also engagement on the subject with a number of elected representatives in regions.  It is to be expected that the change will take time to translate into direct State aid to either IDA client companies or to new companies in the new regions included.  For reasons of confidentiality, IDA does not provide details of individual grants approved to companies. Grant aid has been provided to IDA client companies in County Kildare but not to date in Athy in the period since 1 July 2014.</p></reply>

Details of negotiations which the Agency may be engaged in or details relating to any prospective client are not released until such discussions have been successfully concluded and, even then, if the company involved does not wish for publicity then there is no publicity.  Regarding the 25,000 sq. ft. building in Ballinasloe, which I mentioned in my response to Question Number 246 on 3 March.  IDA Ireland has informed me that again for reasons of client confidentiality and commercial sensitivity it is precluded from giving any further information relating to the facility other than to say that is a high quality technology building, which would be suitable to facilitate potential projects from overseas investors should they require a property of this size and/or a facility Ballinasloe. </p>  <p>  Competition for inward investment has never been as intense as it is today.  IDA Ireland and its clients are very concerned lest information relating to a prospective investment gets into the public domain in advance of the conclusion of discussions with the Agency. Such premature disclosure could jeopardise negotiations on a project and could lead to the loss of a project even at an advanced stage in discussions.  As the Deputy is aware not every investment won by IDA Ireland is publicly announced and many investments go ahead without being announced publicly.  For example during 2014 IDA Ireland won a total of 197 new investments but there were only 66 investment announcements. </p>  <p>  In the circumstances, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on this matter. </p></reply>

All the supports of the State will be made available to support the workers, as and when needed, and for the creation of jobs in the area.</p><p>I should also point out that I had engaged with senior management of the company in question and urged them to reconsider the decision, and asked if there is anything the State or its agencies could do to mitigate its effects.  However, due to a cost base which is significantly out of line with competitor countries, the company believed it had no alternative to a rationalisation at its Kerry plant.  The company has pledged to support departing workers with placement services. The company have also said that they will be working closely with workers in an effort to ensure that the impact of its decision is minimised to the greatest extent possible and to discuss investment it will be making in Ireland in order to build a stronger business here for the long term.  </p><p>In response to these developments, I have established an inter-agency group to coordinate the Government&rsquo;s response to the job losses at the company.  The group will be led by Enterprise Ireland and will seek to secure alternative employment for the areas affected.  It will also ensure that departing workers have access to supports they need from State agencies for retraining, access to social welfare supports and access to advice on employment rights.  The group will comprise representatives from Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Local Authority, Local Enterprise Office, Department of Social Protection and Solas.</p><p>In an effort to coordinate constructive cross-party action to support workers affected, I invited TDs and Senators from the areas affected, including Kerry, to a briefing in my Department on the situation last week.  </p><p>In addition to the above, Enterprise Ireland has had an ongoing intensive engagement with the company with a view to mitigating the job losses across the group in Ireland. On foot of the company&rsquo;s announcement of job losses in the company including its plant in Rathmore, Enterprise Ireland has met the management of the company and further meetings are scheduled in the coming days.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland will continue to support entrepreneurs, enterprises and job creation in Kerry.</p><p>For workers who might consider starting their own business, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the first-stop-shop for support to anyone wishing to start or expand a business, focussing on the micro-enterprise sector (10 employees or less).  The LEOs can provide information, advice and guidance on the range of State supports to enterprise and signpost customers to the appropriate contacts across the various agencies that provide them. For businesses in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sectors, the LEOs can provide direct financial support to develop or implement a business idea.  The LEOs can also provide access to loan finance through the Microfinance Ireland Scheme.  For other sectors the LEO may be able to provide non-financial supports such as specific and tailored business training or mentoring to help a business to develop.  Each LEO is also active in developing local networks and other activities and events that bring business people and entrepreneurs together as a means of supporting each other.  Further information can be found on the LEO website at .</p></reply>

The inspection was arranged for 26 April 2013. On 25 April the person named contacted the inspecting officer to inform him that they would not allow the inspection to take place. In submitting an application under the Single Payment Scheme, applicants agree to permit officials of the Department to carry out farm inspection with or without prior notice. The person named was informed that failure to co-operate with the inspection would result in a nil payment. The person named continued to refuse to allow the inspection to be undertaken and as a result a 100% penalty was recorded against the relevant payments for 2013.</p>  <p>  The persons named requested a review of this decision. The outcome of this review was to uphold the original decision and the persons named were informed of this decision on 29 May 2014.</p>  <p>  The person named appealed this decision to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office. The outcome of this appeal, which was to uphold the Department&rsquo;s original decision, was notified to the applicant on 28 November 2014. The person named was also advised that if they considered that they had been treated unfairly by that office they could raise the matter with the Office of the Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  I note from the outcome of the appeal notification that the medical evidence provided by the person named was considered as part of the appeal process. However it was determined that there were no grounds on which this evidence could be accepted as a mitigating factor in the case, as it identified that the person named was admitted and discharged from hospital some 18 days prior to the date the inspection was scheduled to take place. In addition, no further medical evidence was provided to indicate that the person named was not in a fit state to facilitate the inspection on the day it had been scheduled to take place.</p></reply>

There have been a number of meetings between my officials and representatives of the greyhound industry including the Irish Greyhound Board in connection with this issue.  These meetings and discussions have concentrated on finding mutually satisfactory solutions to the logistical difficulties that exporters are experiencing with regard to getting the necessary health certification which must accompany all dogs moving off the island for commercial purposes.</p>  <p>  My Department has endeavoured to smooth this process as much as possible by having dedicated veterinary personnel on standby at the sales venues to prepare the health certificates for dogs sold there or for dogs that are sold privately and brought to the venue.  In addition, my Department has invited the private veterinary practitioners and greyhounds transporters to be trained in processing the initial part of the certification to further streamline the process and to reduce the time taken for official certification.</p>  <p>  I am confident that, with ongoing co-operation from all interested parties, the difficulties arising from the implementation of the new EU legislation can be resolved to the satisfaction of all involved.</p></reply>

This operation is supported by regional operations, of which Operation Acer is in force throughout the Dublin area, including the North Central Division.  Operation Creeper is a further and related operation, which assists in the surveillance of Acer targets by monitoring their movements. </p><p>In so far as the overall national operation, Operation Fiacla, is concerned, as of 28 February 2015, this has led to the arrest of 12,374 persons with charges being brought against 7,010 persons nationally.  Within this total, and since Operation Acer commenced in early 2012, I am advised that there has been 5,389 arrests, 2,746 charges and 1,087 convictions for burglary in the Dublin area, up to 3 February 2015.  In so far as the North Central Division is concerned, there have been 899 arrests and 511 charges to date.</p><p>I am further advised that under Operation Creeper 167 persons were arrested in 2014.  These targets were selected from the list of Operation Acer targets as a result of high criminal activity and also as a result of patrolling in areas with high incidents of burglary.  Of those arrested, 46<b></b>were arrested in the North Central Division, of which 42 were charged with offences.  </p><p>I can also advise the Deputy that in addition to these policing responses, I am currently carrying out a broader and urgent review of the criminal justice system's response to the problem of burglaries.  In this regard I am working closely with the Garda Commissioner and other relevant criminal justice agencies to ensure that an effective, whole of system response is in place in relation to burglary.

The Deputy will appreciate, however, that the specific policing responses to the issues he has outlined are a matter for the Commissioner in the first instance.</p>  <p>  A range of operations and other measures are in place in relation to tackling crime and anti-social behaviour, including drug dealing, in the North Inner City.  These include Operation Spire, which provides for a high visibility policing presence specifically on O&rsquo;Connell Street at critical times to address anti-social behaviour, drug dealing and related crime.  The operation is designed as a preventative measure and the area is patrolled by uniform patrols supplemented as required by Crime Prevention Unit and Divisional Crime Task Force personnel.  Additional resources are deployed on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.</p>  <p>  Provisional Garda figures for 2014 show that in the North Inner City there were 16,338 searches under the Misuse of Drugs Act and that there were 871 detections for possession of drugs for personal use (an increase of 68% on 2013) and 830 detections for possession of drugs for sale and supply (an increase of 116% on 2013).  Early figures for the present year indicate continuing Garda success in detecting drugs offences.</p>  <p>  In relation to the displacement of drug related activity to other parts of the North City I am advised that local Garda management has increased the number of personnel attached to the divisional drug unit to counteract this recent trend.  I am assured that Garda&iacute; will continue to provide a pro-active response to drug dealing in residential areas.</p>  <p>  The Small Areas Policing Initiative which has been piloted initially in the North Inner City adds further to the local policing response.  The approach taken under this initiative involves assigning  responsibility to nominated Community Garda&iacute; for a specific Community Policing Area of 50 - 200 dwellings, aligned to the applicable Small Area as defined by the CSO.  The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any question of detailed Garda deployment and resource management, it is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to evaluate the scheme and consider its benefits as compared to other community policing models as well as its potential for implementation in other areas.  I expect to receive further updates in this regard on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that the Garda response to the specific issues raised by him form part of overall and ongoing implementation of the Dublin City Centre Policing Plan.  This involves a high-visibility uniformed presence on key thoroughfares, as well as the use of undercover Garda&iacute; as appropriate.  In addition a new multi-agency street outreach approach is being used to work with vulnerable and high-risk individuals and an offender management programme is being piloted to address repeat offending in the Dublin City area.  These measures, combined with the Government's initiatives to tackle homelessness, are helping to address the broader aspects of the problems referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Taoiseach has already stated that  announcements on proposals will be made in the near future.</p>  <p>  I am anxious to ensure that any steps which are to be taken now following the recent review will be ones which will directly assist those in extreme debt and mortgage difficulty and which will service the very fundamental principle that loss of ownership of a family home through repossession should be a last resort. This is basic to our consideration and evaluation of those options, legislative and otherwise and including the bankruptcy period,  which are available to us.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-12a.460.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031200059#WRO01500"><p>In the region of &euro;260 million is provided annually by my Department to support a number of childcare programmes which assist parents in accessing quality and affordable childcare.  More than 100,000 children benefit from this investment each year. These programmes are in addition to the support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit.</p>  <p>  The childcare programmes include the free pre-school year provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  In the region of 68,000 children benefit each year from the free pre-school provision.  The standard weekly capitation payment for each eligible child enrolled is &euro;62.50 with a higher capitation of &euro;73 paid for eligible children enrolled in services where staff hold higher childcare qualifications. </p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community childcare services to support disadvantaged or low income families.   In the case of full day care, parents can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge. In the region of 25,000 children benefit  each year from the CCS programme.  </p>  <p>  Further childcare support is provided under a number of labour activation measures which support parents returning to the work force or availing of education or training opportunities. These include the Childcare Education and Training Supports (CETS) programme providing &euro;145 per week for full day care where parents are availing of training and education course provided by Solas or the Education Training Board (ETB).  The After-School Child Care (ASCC) programme provides &euro;40 per week for after-school care, or &euro;80 per week where a pick up service is available, with &euro;105 per week for full day childcare during the holiday period.  A Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme has also been introduced and provides up to &euro;80 a week to support qualifying parents who are participating in Community Employment (CE) schemes.  </p>  <p>  The funding to support the childcare programmes has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary position.  I am now looking at the question of appropriate supports for child care in a wider context.  To ensure that all the benefits of our full range of childcare investments are fully realised, future public investment in childcare must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated.  It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare services and I have established an Inter-Departmental Group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children.  I have asked the Group to report to me by the Summer.</p></reply>

The urgent need to address these issues was stressed, particularly for 999/112 call-taking and ambulance dispatch, as well as overall clinical governance. </p>  <p>  Following discussions, the HSE and Dublin City Council have agreed in principle to address the identified weaknesses, through the provision of a single point of contact for all emergency calls in Dublin.  Under this agreement, all 999/112 ambulance calls for the Dublin region will be routed through the National Emergency Operations Centre in Tallaght and all ambulances, whether DFB or NAS, will be dispatched from Tallaght.  In addition, clinical governance of Dublin ambulance services will become the responsibility of the NAS medical director. </p>  <p>  The new arrangements will mean that the people of Dublin will get a better ambulance service.  Currently, where DFB do not have an ambulance available, they may or may not pass the call to the NAS.  Passing calls between call centres is not without risks. Calls may be delayed or worse, be missed.  Under the new arrangements, the dispatcher will be able to see every available ambulance in the region.  The nearest available ambulance, whether NAS or DFB, will be sent to the incident. </p>  <p>  Agreement in principle has now been reached with Dublin Fire Brigade unions on the integration of emergency ambulance call taking and dispatch.  It has also been agreed that DFB will continue to be fully involved in emergency ambulance service delivery and there will be no diminution of such services.</p>  <p>  Staff in Dublin Fire Brigade will be fully consulted before the proposed changes are implemented.  A Joint Forum within Dublin City Council, which will include Management and Union representatives, will be established to address issues regarding the control centre reconfiguration.  This is a very welcome development which will, I believe, ensure that the people of Dublin get the safer ambulance service they deserve.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy and that it explains the situation fully.</p></reply>

This analysis allows for comparison with other countries and for comparison of individual hospitals.  The analysis showed at national level in-hospital mortality following admission with a heart attack or an ischaemic stroke decreased between 2004 and 2013.  It also showed a variation for in-hospital mortalities between individual hospitals that requires further exploration and explanation to support improvements in the quality of health services.</p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office is responsible for compiling mortality rates including at county level for the conditions enquired about.</p>  <p>  For future NHQRS annual reports, the range of indicators presented will continue to evolve to reflect the breadth of health services provided in Ireland.</p></reply>

Persons with full eligibility (medical card holders) are entitled to a range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultant services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and maternity and infant care services. People with limited eligibility (non-medical card holders) are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services and out-patient pubic hospital services including consultant services.  </p>  <p>  Separate to the public health system, my Department oversees the maintenance of a competitive and sustainable private health insurance market, under the provisions of the Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2014, and monitors developments on an ongoing basis to ensure that the market is regulated appropriately. As the purchase of private health insurance is optional, I do not consider there to be any conflict of interest, particularly as choosing to purchase health insurance does not impinge on a person's eligibility for public health services. </p>  <p>  In the context of private health insurance, community-rated markets depend on a continuing entry of younger people. Younger people claim less on average and, accordingly, continuing participation of younger people keeps premiums down for everybody. Lifetime Community Rating is being introduced to encourage people to take out private health insurance at a younger age, thereby helping to spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market, helping to support affordable premiums for all.</p></reply>

Under UHI, everyone will be insured for a standard package of health services and will have their choice of health insurer from a mix of private health insurers and a publicly owned health insurer. </p><p>In paving the way for UHI, it is important that we lay a solid foundation for the future health system. Having a healthy, vibrant private health insurance market is a key building block for facilitating the transition to the system of UHI as envisaged in the White Paper. </p><p>Lifetime Community Rating is being introduced to encourage people to take out private health insurance at a younger age. Encouraging more people to join the market at younger ages helps spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market, helping to support affordable premiums for all. Lifetime Community Rating relates only to the current voluntary private health insurance market and will not apply when we move to UHI. However, it is important to note that any loading that applies when a person purchases private health insurance after 1 May 2015 will continue to apply in all subsequent years, until such time as UHI is in place. Under UHI, everyone will be charged the same premium for the same policy regardless of age or risk profile, i.e. community rating will apply. </p></reply>

In my recent visit to the West Bank, I saw at first-hand the impact of settlements, including on the daily life of Palestinians.  When I met with Foreign Minister Liberman, I raised the issue of settlements and the fact that their continued expansion is a threat to the viability of a two-State solution.</p>  <p>  On 3 July 2014, my Department published advice to Irish citizens and business on financial and economic activities in Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The advice is intended to provide advice to the general public, investors and companies on the potential legal, reputational and economic risks arising from conducting economic activity in the settlements which are illegal under international law.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently pressed the European Union to focus on settlements as a key element to be addressed. I will continue to highlight this issue in discussions with EU colleagues and others on the Middle East Peace Process.  The EU has already decided that EU funding grants may not be spent in the settlements.  </p>  <p>  I expect the April Foreign Affairs Council to discuss the Middle East Peace Process, following the Israeli election on 17 March. I welcome High Representative Mogherini&rsquo;s indications that she intends to enhance EU engagement in the Middle East Peace Process.  I will actively be contributing to our discussions on role of the EU and I will work to ensure that the question of settlements is to the forefront of EU thinking on these issues.  The question of whether it would be timely to resume work on EU guidelines for labelling of settlement products will be considered in that context. While we remain prepared to look at national guidelines, the impact would clearly be better if we were to act collectively at EU level. </p></reply>

This represents the first small increase in overall ODA in six years.  Of this, &euro;476 million is administered under Vote 27 of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which manages the Irish Aid programme.  In deciding on the allocation of the budget, some small reductions were necessary across budget lines, because of prioritisation of commitments, the scale of humanitarian crises across the world and the rise in Ireland&rsquo;s assessed contribution to the European Development Fund (EDF).  These are all areas which are funded annually under Vote 27 in line with standard budgetary procedures. </p>  <p>  European Union Member States&rsquo; contributions to the EDF are on an assessed basis.  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution key under the 11th EDF is set at 0.94% of the total funds comprising the EDF, and accordingly we will make a total contribution of &euro;32.76 million to the Fund in 2015, an increase of some &euro;9 million on our contribution in 2014.  Decisions on the allocation of EDF funds are made by an EDF Committee of representatives of all EU Member States, including Ireland.</p>  <p>  Ireland is recognised internationally for its support for the NGO sector, and consistently channels the largest proportion of our ODA through NGOs of any major donor.  Around one third of the Irish Aid budget is channelled through NGOs, for humanitarian and development programs and projects.  The Programme Grant scheme for our largest NGO partners constitutes is the main individual funding stream, which supports long term development work. The budget for the Programme Grant is &euro;61.34 million in 2015, a reduction of 2.28% on 2014.  This is in line with budgetary reductions across the Irish Aid programme, including in our key partner countries.  </p>  <p>  The past year has witnessed a serious deterioration in the global humanitarian situation, as a result of conflicts in the Middle East and Africa and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.  The needs are set to increase in 2015, with the situation becoming more complex and posing different demands.  </p>  <p>  Included in Ireland&rsquo;s overall ODA budget is a specific provision to enable Irish Aid to respond to emergencies and natural disasters when they arise.  We have increased this dedicated Emergency Humanitarian Assistance budget line from &euro;57.5 million in 2014 to &euro;58.5 million in 2015.  In addition, last year, there was an increase in the humanitarian funding made available by Irish Aid to Irish NGOs from &euro;16 million in 2013 to &euro;23 million in 2014.  We provide humanitarian funding to trusted NGO partners here in Ireland, as well as to key UN partners and the Red Cross/Red Crescent, agencies capable of delivering assistance to large numbers of beneficiaries. We will continue to work with and support these trusted partners throughout 2015.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme has benefited significantly from our NGO partners&rsquo; commitment to helping poor and vulnerable communities. The OECD Development Assistance Committee&rsquo;s positive peer review of the effectiveness of the programme last year gave strong recognition to Ireland&rsquo;s NGO partnerships. The peer review also recognised the Government&rsquo;s strategic management of the aid budget during challenging economic times.</p></reply>

The overall cost for those who register with Irish Water, net of the &euro;100 water conservation grant, is either &euro;1.15 a week for single adult households or &euro;3 a week for all others.  Water supply will not be reduced under any circumstance.   When it comes to payment, a range of easy pay options will be in place, including direct debits, electronic funds transfer, payment by cash at any retail outlet with a paypoint or payzone sign or a post office where a bill can be paid in full or part payments of a minimum of &euro;5 can be made.  Irish Water also intends participating in the Household Budget scheme.

These draft revisions proposed:</p>  <p> - The setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments,</p>  <p> - A mandatory minimum setback of 500 metres between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations, and</p>  <p> - The complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings. </p>  <p>A public consultation process was initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the Guidelines, which ran until 21 February 2014.  My Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this period.  It is intended that the revisions to the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines will be finalised as soon as possible.  In this regard, account has to be taken of the extensive response to the public consultation in framing the final guidelines.  Further work is also advancing to develop technical appendices to assist planning authorities with the practical application of the noise measurement aspects of the Wind Guidelines.</p>  <p>  The revisions to the Wind Energy Development Guidelines 2006, when finalised, will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  In the interim, the 2006 Guidelines continue to apply to existing planning applications.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions under the Planning Acts.</p></reply>

By decreasing the level of administration for groups, this would allow them to spend more time on the key aim of the scheme, which is more and better interaction with older persons.  The operational handover of the Seniors Alert Scheme between my Department and Pobal should be completed by mid-year.  In the meantime, Community and Voluntary Groups wishing to participate and draw down grant support under the Seniors Alert Scheme should continue to apply to my Department in the usual way.</p>  <p>  My Department has written to over 900 community and voluntary groups registered with the Scheme on several occasions to keep them apprised of developments.  The most recent correspondence, which issued on 6 March 2015 , advised the groups that Pobal will be holding regional meetings over the coming period to assist the groups in the transition to the new arrangements.  These sessions will give local groups an opportunity to engage with Pobal and to address any concerns they may have.</p></reply>

Specific objectives have been included under Chapter 4 of the North Lotts and Grand Canal Dock Strategic Development Zone Planning Scheme to ensure that future housing provision meets the needs of the area, and is in line with the overall Dublin City Council Housing Strategy.</p><p>I am committed to the principle of a social housing gain from private development and I believe that the Part V mechanism under the Planning and Development Acts has the potential to be a significant contributor to achieving the targets set out in the Government&rsquo;s <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020 &ndash; Support, Supply and Reform</i>in the context of a recovering housing market.</p><p>Under the existing Part V provisions of the Planning and Development Acts, developers are required to ensure that up to 20% of land zoned for residential, and other uses, shall be reserved for social or affordable housing. However, with the substantial fall off in private construction, very little social housing is currently being provided under Part V.</p><p>Informed by a recent review of the Part V provisions, which included a public consultation process, my Department has incorporated the required legislative changes into the General Scheme of the Planning and Development (No 1) Bill which was published in November 2014 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:</p><p>The General Scheme of the Bill was the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht. The Bill is currently being drafted in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to publication in the coming weeks and enactment before the summer recess.</p><p>The General Scheme provides that, in future, the focus of Part V will be on the delivery of social housing, with a requirement for up to 10% social housing in developments in excess of 9 units.  In the operation of these revised Part V arrangements, the priority will be to secure social housing units on-site; the making of cash payments in lieu of social housing is to be discontinued. </p><p>Under the revised Part V provisions, which will apply to permissions granted under SDZ planning schemes , it i s estimated that in the region of 4,000 additional social housing units will be delivered by 2020.  My Department has written to local authorities recently highlighting the importance of ensuring that Part V agreements are discharged in ways that maximise the potential for the immediate delivery of social housing units.</p></reply>

These Regulations were updated by the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2009. All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department. This funding is provided from 20% of Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) tenancy registration fee income.My Department has allocated almost &euro;29m to housing authorities since 2005 for the purpose of carrying out their functions under the Housing Acts in relation to rented accommodation. Additional funding was provided in 2010 for once-off strategically-planned programmes of inspection known as &ldquo;Intensified Inspection Projects&rdquo;.  Funding for Intensified Inspection Projects was awarded where housing authorities agreed to undertake additional, targeted inspection activity, over and above what they would conduct as part of their usual inspection programme. </p><p>A total of 20 applications were received and Dublin City Council was awarded &euro;1,099,135 for their Intensified Inspection Programme which involved a commitment to carry out in excess of 8,500 inspections over a three year period. A recent report from Dublin City Council found that the majority of dwellings selected for inspection (which were pre-1963 multi-unit buildings and more likely to be in this category of accommodation) were non-compliant with the regulations on initial inspection. This programme of inspections has been extremely successful.  According to the most recent data available, 70% of the non-compliant properties have already been brought into compliance.  Enforcement action continues on the remainder, including legal action in certain cases. Dublin City Council commenced its intensified inspection programme in February 2012 and it is due to run until end March 2015.</p><p>The allocation of funding for Private Rented Inspections is reviewed annually and the allocation for 2015 will be approved shortly.  In 2014, &euro;2.5 million was allocated to local authorities to carry out their functions under the Housing Acts in relation to private rented accommodation and arrangements are being made for the payment of this funding in the coming months. The payments are based on actual inspection performance reported for the 12 months up to 31<sup></sup>December 2014. Funding in the amount of &euro;300,000 was also allocated in 2014 to defray the cost of legal enforcement incurred by local authorities.</p><p>My Department is currently collating 2014 inspection data and will publish those online in due course.

The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage, which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (AHB-mortgage-to-rent). Both schemes are designed to assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are now unsustainable, and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. </p><p>To be eligible for the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme a household must have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, agree to the voluntary surrender of their home, be in negative equity, and be deemed eligible for social housing in accordance with section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.</p><p>In order for a property to be considered under the AHB-mortgage to rent scheme it must be purchased by an Approved Housing Body for less than &euro;<b>220</b>,<b>000</b>(per property) in the Greater Dublin Area and &euro;180,000 (per property) in the rest of the country. These limits were determined by a working group which took account of available market data and the current social housing acquisition limits. These limits are considered to be reasonable in respect of the income bracket that is targeted by the scheme.</p><p>A total of 2,748 cases had been submitted by the end of March 2015 under the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme. Of these 1, 866 were deemed ineligible or terminated during the process, of which 277 cases were not progressed because the household in question was deemed to be over or under accommodated. Agreement on the sale could not be agreed on a further 42cases.</p><p>Of the remaining 840 cases submitted, 85 have been completed, 176 are currently with the lenders and the remaining 579 are being actively progressed. My Department has issued funding approval in respect of 117 cases. </p><p>The Local Authority Mortgage to Rent scheme, which was rolled out nationally in February 2014, allows local authorities to offer the mortgage to rent scheme to local authority mortgage holders with unsustainable mortgages. To date, 81 households in distress with local authority mortgage arrears have been assisted through the scheme. My Department has invited the submission of the first tranche of 2015 LAMTR claims from local authorities by 30 April 2015.</p><p>As regards the individual case referred to, I refer to the reply to Question No 555 of 27 January 2015 in which I outlined that an application for provisional approval was received by my Department on 9 June 2014 and that this provisional approval was granted the following day. I understand from the Housing Agency that lender&rsquo;s consent has since been received and the case has now been issued to the panel of Approved Housing Bodies to seek a purchaser.</p></reply>

The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which include adopting the annual budget and authorising borrowing, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.</p>  <p>  The continued deterioration of Sligo County Council&rsquo;s financial position is of serious concern to me. While it is a matter for individual local authorities to manage their own day-to-day finances in a prudent and sustainable manner, my Department is in regular consultation with the Council in relation to its financial position, including in relation to the agreement of a long term financial plan; this process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  &euro;1m of the general purpose grant allocation to Sligo County Council for 2014 was conditional on a realistic and achievable plan which charts a path to long-term financial sustainability being agreed between my Department and the Council. Following a meeting with my Department on 27 March 2014, wherein a draft financial plan was submitted, it was decided to provide Sligo County Council with &euro;250,000 of this &euro;1m. In the absence of a detailed plan being finally agreed before the end of 2014 no further payment was made to Sligo.   </p>  <p>  A similar amount of &euro;1m has been included in the 2015 Local Property Tax allocation to Sligo County Council. Payment of this remains conditional on the plan being agreed and discussions with the Council, in this context, are ongoing.</p></reply>

The role of the National Directorate is to develop and support the provision of consistent and effective fire services in Ireland; in that context, the policy document <i>Keeping Communities</i><i>Safe</i>, (KCS) was published in February 2013.</p><p>KCS has introduced national norms and standards for fire services for the first time in Ireland. The approach set out is in line with international best practice and local authority fire service provision can now be benchmarked against these national norms and standards. As a first step, each fire service has undertaken an &lsquo;Area Risk Categorisation&rsquo; (ARC) process as recommended in KCS. This is based on analysis of relevant data-sets for each fire station area, with areas being graded across five bands from very high to very low risk categories in accordance with the evidence. Fire services are using a risk management approach, which includes fire prevention and fire protection in buildings as well as response in terms of numbers of fire appliances and fire crews in an area, to manage the identified fire risk.</p><p>An external validation of the ARC process has been undertaken by the National Directorate to ensure that it is carried out consistently by all fire services. This validation process involves a one-day review of the draft ARC prepared by each authority. The ARC process for the Dublin area has been undertaken by the management of Dublin Fire Brigade area and the process has been validated by the National Directorate. The conclusions reached through the ARC process are as determined by Dublin Fire Brigade management.</p><p>The National Directorate&rsquo;s involvement is a validation process and is not a review of Dublin Fire Brigade.  I am confident however that the process is contributing to the development of high quality and effective fire services for the people of the Dublin area.</p></reply>

The provision of mobile telephony services, is subject to a requirement to secure access to the required radio spectrum by way of licence. The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) under the Communications Regulation Act, 2002 as amended. Licences issued by ComReg apply terms and conditions on Mobile Network Operators, such as quality of service and minimum population coverage obligations.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Communications, one of my key objectives is to ensure that Ireland is best placed to avail of the emerging opportunities provided by the commercial telecommunications sector through the promotion of investment in state of the art infrastructure and the provision of a supportive legislative and regulatory environment. </p>  <p>  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband services, and are facilitating the rollout of 3G and 4G mobile services. All of the mobile operators are continuing to invest in the deployment of 4G services and the enhancement of 3G services. These enhanced mobile data sevices are now expected to extend significantly beyond the footprint of 70--85% population coverage which was envisaged by industry when the National Broadband Plan (NBP) was agreed in 2012. One operator states that it already has 90% population coverage of 4G. Investment in 5G technologies is not envisaged in the short term as this technology is still at the conceptual stage; commercial rollout is not, therefore, anticipated. </p>  <p>  Investment by the State can only occur where there are proven instances of market failure. As you will be aware, my Department is currently developing a detailed intervention strategy as part of the National Broadband Plan to ensure that every home, school and business, regardless of location has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service. This State-led intervention will focus on areas where commercial services will not be provided. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will also be delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and businesses. In terms of technologies to deliver these speeds, we must observe a policy of technology neutrality so as to comply with the European Commission's State Aid guidelines. </p></reply>

These schemes support electricity generated from a range of renewable sources, including small scale hydro, biomass and wind. Based around Power Purchase Agreements between generators and electricity suppliers, REFIT schemes assure a minimum price for each unit of electricity exported to the grid over a 15 year period. Small scale renewable generation is eligible to apply for support under the REFIT schemes.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the SEAI provides a range of supports to businesses and homeowners in relation to the deployment of renewable energy technologies including training and advice. Businesses and homeowners wishing to develop renewable energy projects can also avail of grant support for investment in renewable energy installations under the Better Energy Communities and Better Energy Homes schemes respectively.</p>  <p>  Microgeneration is the general term used by ESB Networks to refer to generation that is less than 11kW. My Department is considering the optimal fuel mix, including the role of microgeneration, for Ireland. Analysis of the potential of microgeneration technologies such as small scale wind, solar (including photovoltaic) and small scale hydro, has been carried out by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). The SEAI's findings, along with responses to the recent consultation on the Green Paper on Energy Policy in Ireland, will inform future policy on the provision of any market support for microgeneration . The views will be taken into consideration in preparation of the White Paper on Energy which will be finalised in September this year.</p>  <p>Given the emerging policy context and the requirements of the EU target market for electricity, my Department is beginning the process of developing a new support scheme for electricity, to be available from 2016 onwards. A key component of this will be consideration of the available technologies, their cost effectiveness and the level of support required. The scheme will be subject to State Aid clearance and the initial public consultation on the new scheme will commence shortly.  </p></reply>

As a State we have ambitious targets for 16% of our energy from renewable sources by 2020 through meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, with 10% renewables in transport and 12% in heat. In 2013, 7.8% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy.</p>  <p>  Policies and schemes are in place to incentivise the use of renewable energy. The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies, including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind. To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity. The total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid is 2,500 MW of which approximately 2,200 MW is wind. It is estimated that between 3,500 and 4,500 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target.</p>  <p>  Additionally, Part L of the Building Regulations support the uptake of renewable heat. The Draft Bioenergy Plan, which was published last year, recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. In terms of renewable transport, the Biofuels Obligation Scheme and grant support for the purchase of electric vehicles underpin the deployment of renewable energy in the transport sector.  </p></reply>

My Department continues to promote exploration and development opportunities to the international oil and gas industry. As at 28 February 2015 there were 3 Petroleum leases, 30 Exploration Licences and 16 Licensing Options active in the Irish Offshore. </p>  <p>  Exploration activity levels in the Irish offshore has ebbed and flowed over the past four decades. However, Ireland currently has the highest number of exploration authorisations in place since offshore exploration began in the early 1960&rsquo;s. To date, exploration has yielded four commercial gas fields but no commercial oil fields.</p>  <p>  In terms of the energy system, in 2013 peat represented 5.4% of energy use with electricity generation from peat being supported at three plants. Furthermore, in 2013 approximately 4% of our gas needs was met from Irish sources. </p>  <p>  Our natural resources, including wind, biomass, hydro, solar and geothermal play a role in increasing the renewable energy we use and, in 2013, 7.8% of Ireland's overall energy requirement was met from renewable sources. This is set to increase in the context of meeting our renewable energy target of 16% by 2020. In this regard policies are in place to incentivise the increased use of renewable energy including the REFIT schemes and the Biofuels Obligation Scheme, both of which can provide a route to market for indigenous resources. </p>  <p>  Although wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity in Ireland, there is potential to diversify our renewable electricity generation portfolio. To that end, the 2014 Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan identifies the sustainable economic opportunity for Ireland of realising the potential of our indigenous offshore wind, wave and tidal energy resources.</p>  <p>Furthermore, the recently published Draft Bioenergy Plan recommends the introduction, from 2016, of a Renewable Heat Incentive for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. The draft Bionergy Plan recognises that meeting the demand for biomass from indigenous sources could deliver significant benefits. Consequently, the draft Plan contains measures to stimulate and support the supply of Irish biomass.</p></reply>

Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, with 10% for transport and 12% for heat. In 2013, 5.7% of heat demand was met by energy from renewable sources.   There are a number of renewable heat technologies available in the domestic heat sector, including biomass boilers, electric heaters, air and ground source heat pumps and solar heating.</p>  <p>  The most significant support for domestic heating is Part L of the Building Regulations which introduce requirements regarding conservation of fuel and energy for new dwellings. Planned reviews of these regulations, for buildings other than dwellings, to achieve Nearly Zero Energy Buildings status, are also expected to result in increasing the uptake of renewable heat from a range of sources. In addition, the Better Energy Homes scheme, operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), provides supports to homeowners for energy efficiency measures including the installation of solar heating. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the European Union (Energy Efficiency) Regulations, 2014 set out a range of requirements for the promotion of energy efficiency, including a requirement for the SEAI to undertake an assessment of the potential for the application of cost beneficial district heating and Combined Heat and Power in Ireland. The development of biomass-fuelled CHP and district heating, as well as improving energy efficiency, has the potential to contribute to our renewable energy targets. The comprehensive assessment is expected to be completed this year.  </p></reply>

One of the main ways that competitiveness is addressed at a European level is through ensuring that the EU has well-functioning, liberalised energy markets. This is seen as the most effective means to deliver energy to consumers at lowest cost. This was emphasised at last week's Council of Energy Ministers at which the Energy Union Package was discussed in detail.The Irish oil sector is completely privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry to the market. It is government policy to promote competition and consumer choice.</p><p>Oil is primarily consumed in two sectors of the economy - in transport and heating. The amount of oil used in the electricity sector is negligible at less than 1%. In terms of gasoline and diesel prices at the pump and home heating prices, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (under the aegis of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation) has a role in ensuring that the market is functioning correctly and that consumers are not being disadvantaged. Previous investigations and surveys, available at <i></i>, into oil prices, including home heating oil, indicates that the price paid by consumers is largely determined by taxation levels, the internationally traded price of crude oil and the consequent price at which refined product is traded in Europe, along with the level of competition in the retail market.</p><p>The European Commission maintains a Statistics and Market Observatory, which presents consumer prices and net prices of petroleum products in EU Member States (known as the Oil Bulletin) on a weekly basis. The Oil Bulletin is designed to improve the transparency of oil prices and to strengthen the internal market. The relevant link is:</p><p><i>.</i></p></reply>

The last such reports were in respect of the period ending 31 December, 2014. These details and reports are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at . All authorisations for oil and gas exploration issued by my Department are granted subject to the carrying out of a work programme agreed with the Department. The delivery of such work programmes is monitored by the Department during the course of the authorisation. </p><p>While there have been no commercial discoveries of oil or gas within the territory of the State in the last fifteen years there has been a positive upswing in the level of petroleum exploration activity in recent years, in particular acquisition of new seismic data. We need to see this translate into an increased level of exploration drilling in the coming years, if Ireland&rsquo;s true petroleum potential is to be realised. </p><p>In a similar manner, while the number of active minerals prospecting licences indicate the buoyant state of mineral exploration in Ireland, no new commercially viable deposits of minerals have been discovered in the last fifteen years, although there have been some encouraging results, particularly in Counties Limerick and Clare. It is too early to determine however whether these results will lead to identification of commercially viable deposits. </p></reply>

I ensured that PSO funding was maintained at current levels in the last Budget, the first time this has happened since 2008. I was also able to secure an additional &euro;101 million in funding for our public transport companies in a Supplementary Estimate.</p>  <p>  Expressway services are commercial services operated in competition with private operators on main trunk routes and are licensed by the NTA. These commercial services do not receive any PSO funding from the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the concerns of many people regarding recent decisions to withdraw services to a number of intermediate locations on major routes into Dublin. Major improvements to the national roads network have provided the opportunity for commercial bus operators to offer improved journey times between Dublin and the regional cities in particular, with the consequent effect of reducing the level of service provided to a number of intermediate locations.</p>  <p>  I should make it clear that there are two routes - not hundreds, as reported in the media - that are currently at issue. These are routes 5 and 7.</p>  <p>  At a recent community meeting in Castlecomer, Bus &Eacute;ireann agreed to postpone the changes to its licensed Route 7 services until June. A working group comprising local representatives and members of the local community and with the active participation of NTA and Bus &Eacute;ireann will explore options for the continuation of public transport services in the area. The NTA is examining what might be an appropriate PSO service to put in place subject to funding.</p>  <p>  Separately, the NTA, in conjunction with Bus &Eacute;ireann, is examining options to re-configure existing PSO services in the south-east in order to maintain socially necessary services to the affected areas following the withdrawal of Route 5.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with the NTA on wider issues around transport in rural Ireland over the coming weeks.</p></reply>
