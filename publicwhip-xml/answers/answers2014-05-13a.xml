This has been considered as part of the drafting process of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.</p><p>  My Department is continuing work on the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval to publish the Heads of the Bill as soon as possible. It is  intended  to provide for greater access to adoption records and birth information, in so far as is possible and in line with legal advices received, for persons previously involved in adoptions, notwithstanding the significant legal and operational complexities which arise in giving effect to this objective. </p><p>  While I am anxious to improve the legal basis for access to adoption records,  proposals to Government have to reflect the constraints on the Legislature in providing such access if they are not to fall foul of Constitutional challenge. The Office of the Attorney General has provided comprehensive legal advice to my Department that has assisted in identifying the Constitutional parameters within which the Heads of the Bill have to be drafted. </p><p>  The legislative proposals will address the circumstances in which identifying and non-identifying information may be provided and examine what processes need to be put in place to assist those seeking information in accessing it.  In the case of future adoptions in this country I want this legislation to provide for access to information as an integral part of the adoption process including the consent arrangements which must be satisfied before an adoption takes place. In the case of historical adoptions we will examine the legislation and ensure it will go as far as is possible. </p><p>  The most difficult situations to address within the proposed legislation are those where the consent of other parties, such as natural mothers, does not exist for the release of information. Where there are barriers which can not be otherwise overcome, it may be possible, for example, to have a provision that would give access in certain circumstances, perhaps through the High Court, to the right to information. </p><p>  I intend to proceed to finalise legislative proposals and will bring proposals to the Government as soon as possible.  I would hope that the subsequent consideration by the Oireachtas Health and Children Committee will allow the issues to be carefully teased out and the views of different interested parties, including the Adoption Rights Alliance,  on these important and sensitive matters to be fully considered. </p><p>   I have no plans to establish a statutory inquiry.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-13a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051300053#WRA01100"><p>The Adoption Authority of Ireland recently hosted an information seminar for stakeholders on developments in intercountry adoption. The meeting was addressed by two international experts in the area: Laura Martinez-Mora who is head of the intercountry adoption unit at the Hague Conference on Private International Law and Nigel Cantwell who is an international consultant on child protection policy and an author of a Unicef&rsquo;s report into adoption practices.</p><p>  The seminar was a very useful way to communicate to prospective adoptive parents and other stakeholders and provide them with an understanding of the challenges and the changing landscape of intercountry adoption. The implementation of the Hague Convention internationally and the changing economic and social environments in  sending countries has led to a change in the age and needs of children eligible for adoption. It is important to note that this trend is not specific to ireland or Irish adoption procedures but rather reflects the international context.  Of particular note, Ms. Martinez-Mora confirmed and detailed the decreasing number of children available for adoption internationally and the fact that increasingly the children in need of intercountry adoption are children with special needs.</p><p>   These trends reflect the significant decline in recent years in the number of children, particularly infants, available for adoption, as child protection safeguards have improved in developing countries which previously placed large numbers of children for adoption.   In many cases these reforms in countries of origin have been given expression and impetus by their ratification of the Hague Convention.  The Convention requires members to strengthen protections for children, birth parents and prospective adoptive parents in the adoption process and to prioritise the improvement of systems for the care and adoption of children domestically.  This requirement is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, in particular Article 21. </p><p>  The issue of adoption of children with specials needs, medical or disability related, or with needs related to the transition from long term foster care, are issues that must be considered as part of the entire adoption process. The assessment of the needs of these children must be comprehensive and transparent if their needs are to be effectively served by the intercountry adoption process and fully met by the receiving country and the adoptive parents.  Prospective adopters also need guidance, advice and assistance both before and after such an adoption to ensure they can successfully meet these challenges.  My Department is working with the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the Child and Family Agency in relation to the preparation and support of prospective adoptive parents.  The enhanced provision of accurate, objective information to the community of potential or prospective adoptive parents is very important and I welcome the recently convened information seminar and other such mechanisms for informing those involved and the public generally. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-13a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051300053#WRA01400"><p>Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the importance of the services delivered by Darndale Belcamp Integrated Childcare Service Ltd. to some 260 children across the areas of Darndale, Belcamp and Moatview. In 2013 the Centre incurred expenditure of &euro;2.022 million and received funding amounting to &euro;1.960 million resulting in a deficit of &euro;62,000. The Centre employs approximately 100 staff, including Community Employment participants.  I understand that the Centre has been experiencing cash flow difficulties over recent weeks and that this has given rise to concerns regarding its future operation.  The Centre has been in discussions with the Child and Family Agency, as one of a number of state agencies which provides funding to support the provision of services at the Centre.  In order to alleviate the immediate cash flow difficulty the Agency prepaid funding due to the Centre in May and June.  I would expect that the Agency will be open to providing some further pre-payments to the Centre if this is of assistance.  </p><p>  The Chairperson of the Centre has also been in correspondence with my predecessor, Minister Fitzgerald, regarding the current difficulties.  Minister Fitzgerald advised, inter alia, that in her view the wider solution to the current difficulties would need to have regard to the overall provision of early years services in the area.  This is important as we need to ensure that all available resources to support these key services are maximised.  The Minister also expressed the view, with which I concur, that this will require some time and space.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that I am still in the process of familiarising myself with the issues involved.  In this context, I have asked my officials to meet with the Child and Family Agency and with Pobal (which administers a number of childcare schemes on behalf of my Department) to explore all possible solutions to the current difficulties having regard to the overall provision of early years services.  I can assure the Deputy that this matter is being given priority attention.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-13a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051300054#WRB00400"><p>The Adoption Authority of Ireland has advised that in 2012 there  were no  domestic infant adoptions in Ireland and in 2013 there were 3. For the purposes of this question the Authority has defined infants as children under 2 years of age.</p><p>  These relatively low figures for domestic adoption of Irish children reflect the development of social attitudes which have seen historically high rates of domestic adoption, particularly in respect of children of single mothers, diminish as greater public and social support for natural mothers has developed in recent decades.</p><p>  However, current restrictions on children who can be subject to domestic adoption are also considered to inappropriately limit access by some children in the long term care of the Child and Family Agency  to the opportunity provided by adoption. This was amongst the issues which the proposed wording of the Constitutional Amendment on Children sought to resolve. The wording sought to explicitly provide in certain circumstances for the adoption of any child either by way of voluntary placement by parents or where parents have failed in their duties for such a period of time as may be prescribed by law.</p><p>  To coincide with the holding of the Children's Referendum the Government published a draft Adoption ( Amendment) Bill 2012 so as to outline its legislative proposals in the event of the proposed Constitutional Amendment being introduced.</p><p>  The Adoption (Amendment) Bill aims to provide, in a more effective and appropriate way, for the adoption of children of marriage. The Adoption (Amendment) Bill proposes to make important changes to adoption law to provide the option of adoption for a child who has been placed in long term foster care because his or her parents are unable to provide, or resume, care for that child. The provisions of the proposed Adoption (Amendment) Bill  would amend the Adoption Act 2010 to provide for the non-voluntary adoption of a child where his or her parents have failed in their duty towards that child. </p><p>  The proposed legislation is not intended to provide that a child, who has contact with and a strong beneficial relationship with his or her birth parents and wider family, may be adopted unless that child's parents have voluntarily placed the child for adoption and have consented to the adoption order being made in respect of the child. The draft Bill will also provide for the voluntary placement for adoption of any child irrespective of the marital status of his or her parents. In the case of a child of married parents, both parents must place the child for adoption and before doing so, will be counselled and given information in accordance with the provisions of section 14 of the Adoption Act 2010. </p><p>  It is my intention to bring the Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible, following conclusion of all proceedings and processes relevant to the Children&rsquo;s Referendum.</p></reply>

The role of the National Assessment Committee, set up at that time, was to assess applications for initiatives to be funded.  The Young People's Facilities and Services Fund transferred to my Department on its establishment in 2011 and the Fund along with the Special Projects for Youth scheme, which also targets young people who are vulnerable and at risk of disadvantage, is now the subject of a comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review which is nearing completion in my Department.</p><p>  In 2014,  almost &euro;18.4m will be made available under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund to over 230 established youth projects. The National Assessment Committee last met in June 2011.  A further meeting of the Committee has not been arranged as there have been no new proposals for funding initiatives for assessment.</p><p>  Oversight and monitoring arrangements in respect of the youth services funded by my Department under the various schemes are an important priority for my Department in line with its reporting and accountability responsibilities for the provision of quality services that are publicly funded. All youth projects are required to report to my Department on their activities, use of funding, and their implementation of quality standards in their service provision. These responsibilities include the provision of a progress report with quantitative and qualitative data, details of income and expenditure and the provision, on an annual basis, of audited accounts. Youth projects are now implementing the National Quality Standards Framework in the design and delivery of their services for young people and provide an annual report to my Department.</p><p>  The statutory Education and Training Boards (ETBs) that administer funding on behalf of my Department have an important role in these processes and youth officers of the  ETBs liaise with projects at local level to support compliance and implementation of progressive quality standards in services for young people. </p><p>  The role of the National Assessment Committee will be examined in the context of the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding programmes which, it is anticipated, will be available in the mid-Summer. The findings will inform the development of a new youth strategy, which is at preliminary stage in the Department and they will shape the development of appropriate structures for the administration and monitoring of funding for youth services in the future, to ensure quality and outcomes-focused youth services provision for young people.   As soon as the review is available, my Department will convene a meeting of the National Assessment Committee to discuss the review&rsquo;s findings and the considerations it raises for the monitoring and governance of funding programmes in the future to ensure best outcomes for vulnerable young people. </p><p>  My Department is represented on the Oversight Forum for Drugs and arrangements have been made to keep the Forum updated on the progress made in finalising the Value for Money and Policy Review.</p></reply>

A delegation of Russian officials travelled to Ireland in October 2013 for further discussions on a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption between Ireland and the Russian Federation. The meeting  was very positive and detailed discussions took place between the Russian officials and officials from my Department, the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Health Service Executive.  My Department prepared revised draft wording on a number of specific points which were forwarded to the Russian Authorities in February of this year. In transmitting these revisions it was suggested that should these revisions be acceptable to the Russian Federation, it would be useful for both sides to meet again for further discussions.  </p><p>  The Ministry of Education and Science have advised the Irish Embassy in Moscow that all proposed adoption agreements are currently on hold while the Russian Government considers proposals in relation to how they deal with adoption agreements in general.  The Embassy has been informed that the Russian Government is still considering the matter, following a decision on this they will be in a position to examine the Irish proposals.  </p><p>  The Adoption Authority delegation visit to Ethiopia in April of 2012 was an initial part of the Authority's deliberations on the feasibility and suitability of entering into discussions with Ethiopia on a bilateral adoption agreement. The Authority has also sought and received advice on the legal compatibility of Irish adoption law with that of Ethiopia. The Authority's legal advisors have considered this advice and certain clarifications are being sought. The Authority is also trying to establish the position of the Ministry of Women's Affairs in Ethiopia with regard to the desire of the Ethiopian authorities to entering into talks in relation to a bilateral agreement with Ireland.  The Authority will advise me of the position when all the information is available. It is not possible to provide a timeframe for when the Authority's deliberations will be finished.</p></reply>

His Department has responsibility for the welfare of children in those centres but  I would like to assure the Deputy that I have had ongoing contact with my colleague on this topic and that senior officials within my Department have engaged with the Child and Family Agency  to ensure that children who are living in Direct Provision are afforded the same levels of welfare and protection as their peers in the wider community.</p><p>  I understand that children are protected in a number of ways in the Direct Provision system - primarily through the Reception and Integration Agency's child protection policy, its house rules and its requirements that all centre staff are Garda vetted.  I also understand that any concerns about the welfare, safety or wellbeing of a child in Direct Provision are reported to the Child and Family Agency in line with Children First.  Referrals include welfare concerns such as a parent being hospitalised, parental illness, a child being left unsupervised by an adult or mental health concerns regarding the parent, while a smaller number would relate to child protection concerns.  There is a specific unit within the Reception and Integration Agency - the Child and Family Services Unit- whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers living in the Direct Provision system.  Where necessary this Unit also links directly with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  The Children First Bill 2013 which is currently before the House further provides that managers of centres providing Direct Provision services are on the schedule of mandated reporters.  Under the Bill such centres are also required to develop and make publicly available a Child Safeguarding Statement.</p><p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question about extending the Health Information and Quality Authority's remit to inspect direct provision centres, I am advised that the current arrangements is that direct provision centres are monitored three times a year, twice by Department of Justice and Equality staff and once by an external company.  Any decision to change this would be a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

In  cases where families with children find themselves without a home, the primary need is for accommodation and responsibility for this lies with local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  </p><p>In February 2013, the Minister for Housing and Planning published the Government's Homelessness Policy Statement in which the aim to end long term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined.  The statement emphasises a housing led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.   The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing in essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long term homelessness.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has established a Homelessness Oversight Group for the purposes of reviewing the progress of the approach being advocated, identifying obstacles and proposing solutions.  An official from my Department is a member of the Interdepartmental </p><p>Group dealing with homelessness.   </p><p>However, if the concern is a child protection one the Child and Family Agency, as the statutory agency with responsibility for child protection and welfare, will intervene.  When concerns are raised about children, the Agency provides assessments and services and this includes children under 18 who may be without a home.  In the first instance, a social worker will establish the reason the young person has left home and if they can return.  The assessment will also identify any needs including whether the child needs to be taken into care.  If that happens, they will be placed in foster or residential care.  </p><p>The Deputies may be aware that my Department published a report last year on the implementation of the <i>Youth Homelessness Strategy.  </i>This strategy was published by the Department of Health and Children in 2001.  The Centre for Effective Services undertook the review at my Department&rsquo;s request.  The report called <i>Every Child a Home: A Review of the Implementation of the Youth Homelessness Strategy </i>was published in July 2013.  It found that there has been significant improvement in service responses to children presenting as homeless in the last decade.  Consequently, the number of children and young people accessing services through the homeless sector has decreased.  In the first instance, children and young people who present to the Child and Family Agency are assessed to rule out any care and protection issues and some family work may take place to facilitate a young person&rsquo;s return home.  </p><p>My Department has engaged with relevant departments including Environment, Community and Local Government; Education and Skills; Social Protection and Health as well as the Child and Family Agency seeking their views on how the recommendations of <i>Every Child a Home </i>relevant to each sector might be progressed.</p></reply>

I note that legislative proposals in France on banning pageants ran into difficulties in light of criticisms regarding the vagueness around the specifics of what types of events were addressed. Pageants can be labelled as &lsquo;talent&rsquo; contests for example.</p><p>My Department has commissioned an international review of other countries' responses to these issues in order to inform the Government's response, and future actions; and the Centre for Effective Services is to undertake this review in 2014.</p><p>This research project will build on another current research project being conducted by University College Cork; commissioned and funded by my Department through its funded research programme which is looking at the impact of commercialisation and sexualisation of children in Ireland. This important research is currently undergoing peer review and is expected to be published in the coming months.</p><p>In 2012, I extended an invitation to the Irish retail sector to respond to increasing concerns about the sexualisation of childrenswear. Retail Ireland, responded to my call and accepted my invitation to bring forward Ireland&rsquo;s first ever guidelines on the &lsquo;responsible retailing of childrenswear&rsquo;.</p><p>These guidelines are not just about restricting what retailers can sell, but instead provide a more constructive guidance on best practice on a range of issues such as styling, slogans, age-appropriateness, size, labelling and marketing.</p><p>I believe this code is now playing an important and constructive role in informing future decision-making by retailers and I am happy to report that the number of complaints regarding inappropriate childrenswear have fallen. However I would urge parents to continue to feedback any concerns or complaints, either in-store or by contacting </p><p>An Coimisium le Rinci Gaelacha, The Irish Dancing Commission, is also to be commended for their introduction of additional rules prohibiting the use of make-up including false eye lashes and artificial tanning products for the face. Dancers who are ten years of age or younger may no longer compete using any of these.</p><p>It is so encouraging and praiseworthy that each of the hotels approached by Universal Royalty, the company promoting a child beauty pageant, back in September of last year declined the opportunity to host the contest. In the interests of children, they turned down the opportunity to make money. They have to be congratulated for that, as does the Irish Hotels Federation for opposing child beauty pageants in Ireland. This is yet another demonstration of the role of public opinion and awareness in avoiding inappropriate interference with childhood..</p></reply>

The Adoption (Amendment) Act 2013 extends the period of declarations of eligibility and suitability which apply to the Russian Federation for one year to 31 October 2014 for those prospective adoptive parents who held such declarations on 31 October 2013.</p><p>  Work is also continuing  in relation to the preparation of the Heads of Bill of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill. My view is that persons affected by adoption should be provided with a statutory right to as much information as possible within permissible Constitutional boundaries. I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval to publish the Heads of Bill as soon as possible.   Subsequent consideration by the Oireachtas Health and Children Committee will provide an opportunity to tease out the relevant considerations in detail and to hear the views of interested parties.</p><p>  In addition, I am conscious that  issues have arisen in relation to the operation of the Adoption Act, 2010,  since its enactment. There are a number of general policy questions around the nature of our adoption regime and I consider it timely to consider a review of adoption.  Given the range and complexity of the issues this will require scoping and preliminary examination after which decisions will be made on the extent and time scale for the review to see if proposals for legislative change emerge from this review or the nature of such proposals.  Based upon the many domestic and international legal aspects to adoption the issue of further legislative development will certainly be considered. This review will inform future operational and legislative considerations regarding the Adoption Act, 2010. For the present, however, my legislative priority in the area of adoption is the preparation of  information and tracing legislation. </p><p>  Subject to finalisation of matters related to the Children&rsquo;s Referendum, I intend to introduce the Adoption (Amendment) Bill  to the House. This will be along the lines of the General Scheme of Adoption (Amendment) Bill which I published in order to inform consideration of the proposed Constitutional amendment on children.  </p></reply>

I wish to assure the House that this will be at the top of my agenda, as it was for my predecessor.  The transfer of responsibility for 16 year old boys has already taken place and this Programme for Government commitment will be met in full later this year when the extension of the Oberstown campus results in the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from the adult prison system to the children detention schools.  </p><p>  Following the appointment of a main contractor and a number of sub-contractors, construction on the Oberstown development project started on site on 23 September 2013.  The project will increase the number of children detention places available on the Oberstown campus to a total of 90 places and will enable the extension of the child care model of detention to all under 18 year olds ordered to be remanded or committed by the courts on criminal justice charges.  The first 3 units of residential accommodation are scheduled to be delivered in the third quarter of this year, in order to facilitate the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from the adult prison system.  A further 3 residential units, to be delivered in 2015, will replace existing detention buildings used by Oberstown Boys School which have reached the end of their useful life.  The Office of Public Works (OPW) is overseeing the delivery of the project with the contractor involved, BAM Building Ltd.  I understand some weeks delay has been encountered in the construction programme due to weather and other issues but the OPW and my Department continue to emphasise the need to make up any time possible in order to meet the agreed project timeline for delivery of the first 3 units later this year.</p><p>  While the operation of the adult prison system is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, there is of course a need for policy cooperation between our respective Departments in relation to issues affecting young offenders.  In advance of the opening of the expanded Oberstown development, in December 2013 all sentenced 17 year old boys were transferred from St Patrick's Institution to a dedicated unit in Wheatfield on an interim basis. To facilitate this transfer, Wheatfield was re - designated as a Place of Detention.  I understand that for legal reasons, all 17 year old remand prisoners continue to be detained at St Patrick's Institution.  My predecessor visited the Wheatfield facility in February 2013 and while I do of course share the view that no child should be detained in the adult prison system, I am advised that to date, the transfer to Wheatfield has operated in a satisfactory manner.   </p><p>  In October 2013 a Working Group was established comprising representatives from my Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Irish Prison Service, the Children Detentions Schools, the Child and Family Agency and the Probation Service.  The Working Group was asked to compile a report on all issues arising from the planned transfer of responsibility for detention of 17 year old males from the prison system to the Oberstown children detention school (CDS) campus.  The position of 17 year olds on remand in St. Patrick's Institution and any options that should be considered in advance of the opening of the expanded Oberstown campus is currently one of the issues under review by the group. Legal advices sought by my Department on this issue are being considered at the moment. I expect the report from the Working Group with recommendations on how to proceed with the full transition of 17 year olds to the Oberstown Campus in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This protocol aims to ensure a consistent national approach to service delivery where the delivery of two or more services is involved in the same case.</p><p>The Assessment, Consultation &amp;amp; Therapy Service<b>(</b>ACTS) is a national specialised clinical service which has been developed in order to provide multidisciplinary consultation, assessment and focused interventions to young people who have high risk behaviours associated with complex clinical needs. ACTS also supports other professionals in their ongoing work with young people and their families. </p><p>This includes:</p><p>- on-site therapeutic services to young people in secure settings in Ireland (Special Care and the Children Detention Schools)</p><p>- support when young people return to community settings to help them to re-engage with mainstream services as appropriate</p><p>- assessment, consultation and/or intervention services in the community for children at significant risk of placement in secure settings.</p><p>The ACTS model is flexible and focused on complex needs which are often based on the interplay of trauma, dysregulation, developmental and attachment issues.  One way that ACTS is different to existing services is that its flexible model allows clinicians to continue working with children when they move from special care placements and detention.  This fits with the vision for the new Child and Family Support Agency articulated in the Task Force Report published in July 2012.  ACTS also meets the often repeated recommendation in child abuse inquiries for improved interagency working.</p><p>ACTS is a multidisciplinary service where clinicians from various disciplines work together and inform collective practice. This includes psychology, social work, speech and language therapy, addiction counselling and social care. ACTS is led by a management team consisting of the national manager and three heads of discipline whose central responsibility is the implementation of systems of clinical governance. This is done through effective planning, implementation and evaluation of treatment programs and protocol driven interventions. It also involves the provision of high quality clinical supervision and monitoring of professional development needs of staff.  </p><p>ACTS provides multidisciplinary interventions based on evidence, best international practice and in accordance with relevant legislation, policy and guidelines in order to facilitate the provision of more therapeutic environments in the national special care units and children detention schools and to improve outcomes for our most vulnerable young people.</p><p>ACTS began operating as a service on the appointment of the national manager in September 2012.  Currently the service is led by a management team consisting of the national manager and two heads of discipline. In addition there are now twenty one clinicians in post, where the majority are based in Dublin with two regional teams (of four/five clinicians) in Cork and Limerick. Two further posts have been approved and referred to the national recruitment service to be filled (the principal social work post and an additional speech and language therapy post).</p></reply>

These include the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS)  programme and the new After-school Childcare programme.  These programmes represent an annual investment of approximately &euro;260 million in childcare supports and provides supports to more than 100,000 children.  </p><p>  The ECCE programme provides funding to make one free pre-school year available to all eligible children before they commence primary school.    There are approximately 4,300 childcare facilities providing the free pre-school year with 234 of these facilities using the term Na&iacute;onra in the title of the service.  While this suggests that these services are operated through the medium of Irish, only 60 services this year submitted their electronic returns using the Irish version of the electronic returns form.  </p><p>  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community not-for-profit childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to lower income and disadvantaged families.  This programme also supports childcare facilities that choose to use the medium of Irish to deliver their services and all necessary documentation is available through Irish.  In the current school year, 8 community childcare services submitted their returns through the medium of Irish.   The CCS programme is presently closed to new entrants and new community childcare services seeking to enter the programme can only do so if they are in a position to replace an existing community services that has opted out of the programme and support the parents who previously used that service. </p><p>  The Childhood Education and Training Support (CETS) programme provides funding to support parents who are returning to the workforce or are participating in Solas or Education and Training Boards education and training programmes.  This programme also supports parents participating in Community Employment programmes.</p><p>  An After-school Childcare programme was recently introduced and is targeted to support  low-income parents returning to the workforce.  The aim of this initiative is to ensure that affordable and quality childcare is available to disadvantaged families when work opportunities are offered.   The CETS and After-school programmes are provided by both community and commercial childcare services and the funding provided is used by the services to reduce the weekly fees charged to qualifying parents.  </p><p>  Capital funding totalling &euro;2.5 million is being made available in 2014 for the maintenance and upgrade of community/not-for-profit childcare services to ensure that community facilities that were established with the support of significant childcare capital funding remain fit-for-purpose and in a position to deliver quality services.  All community services that meet the qualifying criteria were eligible to apply for support under the programme.</p><p>  All of the funding provided under the childcare programmes is provided to participating childcare services that provide child care and education through the medium of Irish and/or English.</p></reply>

A delegation of Russian officials travelled to Ireland in October 2013 for further discussions on a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption between Ireland and the Russian Federation. The meeting  was very positive and detailed discussions took place between the Russian officials and officials from my Department, the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Health Service Executive.  In order to explore the potential for agreement of specific areas addressed in the discussions my Department subsequently undertook work on revised draft wording which was forwarded to the Russian Authorities in February of this year. In transmitting these revisions it was suggested that should these revisions be acceptable to the Russian Federation, it would be useful for both sides to meet again for further discussions.  </p><p>  The Ministry of Education and Science have advised the Irish Embassy in Moscow that all proposed adoption agreements are currently on hold while the Russian Government considers proposals in relation to how they deal with adoption agreements in general. It is understood that the Supreme Court recently made recommendations regarding adoption agreements and these are currently being considered by the Russian Government. It is hoped that following the Russian Government's consideration of these matters they will be in a position to examine and respond to the Irish proposals.  </p></reply>

The ECCE programme is a free and universal programme to which all children have access and there is no provision in the programme contract for the exclusion of any child.</p><p>  To make the ECCE programme more accessible to children with special needs a number of additional provisions are in place.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  Application for these exemptions are made prior to the child commencing the programme.</p><p>  I am aware that the Health Service Executive does, where possible, provide additional supports to children with special needs to enable them to avail of pre-school services in mainstream pre-school settings and my Department has been working with the Department of Health in the context of building better supports to facilitate the inclusion of special needs children in mainstream childcare services.  Also, in Budget 2013 a capital funding programme was available to allow childcare services to apply for grants under four strands, one of which was to improve the accessibility of services for children with disabilities.</p></reply>

These reports are published on the Agency's website.  The latest report published in February 2014 shows that the majority of the 6,489 children in care had an allocated social worker (92.2%) and an up to date written care plan (87.5%).  Of the children in care, 505 (7.8%) were without an allocated social worker and 811(12.5%) did not have an up to date written care plan.  It is important to note that statistics on written care plans may refer to those that have not been revised in line with specified time frames outlined in the Child Care Regulations 1995.  This means that in some cases social workers have developed written care plans in consultation with children in care and their families but they need to be updated in line with the Regulations. </p><p>  Of course, the legislative framework requires that all children in care should have an allocated social worker and written care plan and I am confident that the Child and Family Agency is working towards this goal.  The Agency has advised my Department that a number of factors impact on the Agency's ability to allocate a social worker to children in care and ensure children in care have written care plans including vacancies and staff absences due to maternity leave.  However, I am advised that a number of social worker posts  have been approved for filling and are currently being processed as a priority by the National Recruitment Service.  Also, outstanding children in care reviews and care plans have been prioritised for completion  and social work staff have been reassigned to undertake this work.</p><p>  There was an increase of 583 children in care between January 2011 and January 2014:</p><p> - In January 2011, 94% of the 5,907 children in care had an allocated social worker and 90% had an up to date written care plan.</p><p> - 371 children did not have an allocated social worker (6%) and 590 did not have a written or revised care plan (10%).</p><p> - In January 2014, 92% of the 6,490 children in care had an allocated social worker and 86.8% had an up to date written care plan. </p><p> -  518 did not have allocated social worker (8%) and 855 did not have a written or revised care plan (13%).</p></reply>

These statutory bodies have responsibility for child protection in their own sectors.  </p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that in the Children First Bill 2014, which is currently progressing through the Oireachtas, persons who are employed as managers of homeless or emergency provision facilities are specified as mandated persons. Furthermore, homeless and emergency provision facilities will be required to consider the potential for risk to children availing of their services and demonstrate awareness and good practice in a publicly available Child Safeguarding Statement. </p><p>  In general, my Department is taking a lead role in the cross-sectoral implementation of Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children [2011]. Under the Bill, the existing Children First Implementation Inter-Departmental Group will be put on a statutory basis, and it proposed that its membership will comprise representatives from all Government Departments, including the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. The purpose of the Group is to promote the importance of Children First compliance across Government and to ensure a consistent approach is adopted. </p><p>  In July 2013 the Government approved the publication of Departmental Children First Sectoral Implementation Plans on the website of each relevant Government Department, which included the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government . These Implementation Plans are high level documents setting out implementation requirements for each parent Department and for agencies under its aegis which have contact with children and young people.  The Plans set out the mechanisms in place, or to be put in place, to support the continued implementation of Children First Guidance at sectoral level. These plans were for a period of one year, and are due to be reviewed in the coming months. </p><p>  The next phase of the Interdepartmental Group&rsquo;s work will focus on quality assurance mechanisms in relation to implementation and compliance, and the necessary preparatory work which is required prior to the commencement of the Children First Bill. </p></reply>

The objective is to create an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s early years sector and a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to 6 years.  The Department of Childen and Youth Affairs is committed to ensuring high standards in early years service provision, both in terms of care and curriculum. The role of quality provision is critical in contributing to childhood development and this key objective will be reflected fully in the Early Years Strategy.</p><p>  One of the specific issues of policy which has been identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the future role and regulation of the childminding sector, which is already an important component of early childhood care and education.  At present pre-school services are subject to the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.</p><p>  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Early Years Inspectorate of the Child and Family Agency and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three pre-school children from different families in the childminder&rsquo;s home.  </p><p>  Childminders who are not subject to the requirement to notify are, however, encouraged to voluntarily notify their service to their local City or County Childcare Committee which provides a range of supports to enable them to improve the standards of their childcare service. These supports include the Childminders Tax Exemption scheme which provides for a tax exemption for those childminders who have satisfactorily participated in the Voluntary Notification process and whose annual income from childminding does not exceed &euro;15,000.</p><p>  Some &euro;10 million of funding, allied to these supports, was invested over a period of 10 years to encourage childminders to notify.  This was seen as a potential first step to bringing all non family childminders under the Regulations. This stepped approach has worked in some countries, such as Scotland.  However, only 1250 childminders voluntarily notified here and a further 2,000 to 3,000 participate in training.  It is clear that there are barriers specific to Ireland in bringing childminders under the regulatory framework.    The Early Years Strategy will include consideration of how this complex issue might be addressed in the future.  </p></reply>

Almost all of the questions are of a qualitative nature. In particular, the industry survey is largely  qualitative and its main questions refer to an assessment of recent trends in production, of the current levels of order books and stocks, as well as expectations about production, selling prices and employment. In addition, the survey provides on a quarterly basis quantitative information on two  variables that are not reported in conventional statistics, capacity utilisation and the number of months of production assured. The organisation supplying data for  Ireland to DG ECFIN for the consumer section of this suite of surveys is GfK NOP. We have twice queried with DG ECFIN the source of the industry data supplied up to Q2/2012 but they have yet to confirm who are their suppliers of the data.</p></reply>

I am also appalled by the reported abduction of a further 11 girls on 4 May.  Acts of violence of this nature against school children are completely unacceptable.  Through our development policies and programmes, Ireland is a strong supporter of the rights of women and girls, and in particular the right of girls to education.</p><p>  I have given my full support to the demands of the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon, and the High Representative of the European Union, Catherine Ashton, that the girls be released and that those responsible be brought to justice.  I welcome the offers of support to the Nigerian authorities from a number of our EU partners and from the US, to help find the missing schoolgirls.  The Nigerian authorities need to accept this support and do everything in their power to secure the safe release of the school girls.  I urge the Government of Nigeria to take all appropriate steps to protect their citizens and to ensure that the girls can return safely to their families, and to education.</p><p>  Our Embassy in Abuja is working closely with our EU partners and others on the ground and maintaining contact with the Nigerian authorities in their efforts to locate and free the missing schoolgirls.  At the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels yesterday, Ministers discussed possible further measures to strengthen Nigeria&rsquo;s efforts.  The EU is already actively supporting the Nigerian authorities to strengthen their capacity to provide security and combat terrorism.  An EU support programme to strengthen the investigation and prosecution of terrorist suspects will begin later this month.  It will include EU technical assistance to counter violent extremism and radicalisation.</p><p>  Officials from my Department have also been in contact with the Nigerian Embassy in Dublin to express concern at the ongoing situation to and to request regular updates regarding the actions taken by the Nigerian authorities to recover the abducted schoolgirls.</p><p>  At the most recent session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva during March 2014, Ireland highlighted recent attacks by Boko Haram during discussions with the UN Special Representatives for Violence against Children and Children and Armed Conflict.  Our objective was to draw attention to the ongoing trend of attacks on education around the world and to highlight the importance of ensuring that the right of children to education is upheld during and after conflict.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, many of these often small and vulnerable communities are coming under increasing pressure due to a range of factors including low birth rates, emigration and, in some cases, increased sectarian persecution and violence.  This has led to a significant reduction in their numbers in the region over recent years.  In Iraq for instance, it is estimated that more than half of the Christian community may have emigrated over the past decade.  The political turmoil which has overwhelmed many countries in the Middle East in recent years has led to increased international concerns about the safety of Christians first in Iraq and Egypt and now most pressingly in Syria.  The descent of Syria into violence and disarray has left small Christian communities very exposed and sometimes subject to direct attack.  Ireland raises the issue of the safety of Christians through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect all its citizens and minorities. In situations of general instability and insecurity, such as Iraq some years ago or Syria today, this is of course especially difficult.  Ireland also works with our partners in the EU to raise the issue in multilateral fora such as the UN Human Rights Council, as part of the EU&rsquo;s human rights policy.  The EU has taken a number of steps in recent years in support of Freedom of Religious Belief, including issuing Council Conclusions on the matter, most recently in February 2011.  On the broader international plane, Ireland has worked at UN and EU level to promote resolutions and actions on the principle of freedom of religious belief, notably during our 2013 EU Presidency, and now as a current member of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. I have raised the issue of protection of Christians in the Middle East in discussions at the Foreign Affairs Council, and supported stronger EU statements on the issue, for instance in the Council Conclusions on Egypt issued on 21 August last and the FAC Conclusions on Syria which were agreed in January and April 2014.</p><p>  Ireland attaches great importance to combating all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  Ireland was elected to the Human Rights Council in November 2012 and will serve for the 2013-2015 term.  Amongst our priorities as a member of the Council is the issue of freedom of religion or belief, and we have played a central role in the negotiation of two important resolutions on this issue in the past year.</p><p>  Officials from my Department have met frequently with local Christian leaders from the Middle East region, and discussed the issues affecting their communities.  It should be noted that many of these groups request that any efforts made on their behalf be carried out very discreetly, as any special attention from western countries might only increase their difficulties.</p><p>  While some individuals from the region have found refuge in Ireland, asylum in Ireland or in Europe cannot provide the solution to this problem, because the numbers are too great, because there are others also at risk, and because this would spell the end for ancient Christian communities who have survived in the region since the earliest days of Christianity.</p></reply>

The aftermath of a severe drought during the 2012-2013 agricultural cycle continues to have an impact on the country&rsquo;s southern provinces. It is estimated that 1.8 million people in six provinces were affected by this drought.  The effects on food supplies and drinking have had a significant impact on the population&rsquo;s nutritional health, particularly among children under five. Last month, the Government of Angola reported that over 400,000 people are being affected by drought in provinces in the west of the country. It is the fourth consecutive year of abnormal rainfall in these provinces and it is reported that river levels have dropped or even dried up completely, with a negative impact on cultivation.  In addition to the problem of drought, Angola continues to grapple with the legacy of 27 years of conflict and civil war, and in particular massive use of land mines, which has held back its agricultural development.</p><p>  Working with our EU partners, Ireland takes a strategic approach to post-conflict countries like Angola.  The EU is working to develop long term solutions to assist Angola in diversifying its economy, especially its agriculture sector.  Between 2010 and 2013 just under &euro;2.6 million was provided by Irish Aid to civil society organisations working in Angola, including Christian Aid Ireland, Tr&oacute;caire and Concern, to address inequality, access to services and land rights. Under the 10th European Development Fund, the EU allocated &euro;227.9 million to Angola, for institutional reform, human and social development as well as rural development, agriculture and food security and demining between 2008 and 2013.  EU assistance is designed to contribute to the sustainable development of the country and to support the Angolan Government&rsquo;s strategy to combat poverty and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Under current EDF funding, the EU is also supporting projects to support regional integration, biodiversity and the private sector.</p></reply>

Since the agreement of the Millennium Declaration in 2000, progress has been made on increasing investments in education, and there are now more children in school than ever before in human history. However, girls still lag behind boys in terms of primary school completion and enrolment in secondary school. This is particularly so in conflict affected states where girls are often kept at home for their own safety. It is also true in the poorest regions in the world where girls may be kept out of school to engage in domestic chores.  <font color="#212100">Ireland recognises the transformative power of girls&rsquo; education, both for girls themselves, and also for their families and communities. Every girl and woman has a right to a quality education. And ensuring that right makes sense, as educating girls leads to healthier and more productive families and communities. Evidence of this fact abounds. UNESCO estimates for example, that 2.1 million lives of children under 5 were saved during the first ten years of the MDG time frame between 1990 and 2009, because of improvements in girls&rsquo; and women&rsquo;s education.</font></p><p>A commitment to improving access to education for girls at primary and beyond primary, consistent with the second and third Millennium Development Goals, has been very strongly represented across the Irish Aid programme. Ireland&rsquo;s new policy on International Development, <i>One World, One Future,</i>affirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to education, with girls&rsquo; education, at primary and beyond primary, singled out for special focus. In 2012, Irish Aid allocated &euro;33.9 million to education programmes in developing countries. This amount represented approximately 8% of bilateral ODA.</p><p>Ireland will continue to support national governments in our partner countries in their efforts to address drop-out rates of girls and low enrolment in their education plans.  We also work with civil society partners to raise awareness at community level of gender based violence in schools, and support the Global Partnership for Education, an international funding mechanism which targets girls that have been left behind.</p><p>Ireland recognises that the enjoyment of all human rights is essential for development, and this is reflected in our engagement with the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) as a member for the term 2013-2015. Ireland has supported two separate resolutions at the HRC which recognised the right to education.  The most recent resolution in this regard, adopted by the HRC on 13 June 2013, reaffirmed the human right of everyone to education, and called upon all States to take all measures to implement the HRC resolutions on the right to education with a view to ensuring the full realisation of this right for all.  The resolution also emphasised the need to ensure that the right to education is central in the context of the post-2015 agenda.</p></reply>

None of the foregoing has been merged or abolished since 2011.  However, in September 2013 the Development Education Advisory Committee (DEAC), which was responsible for providing advice on development education, was officially disbanded.  Its abolition followed the publication of <i>One World One Future</i>, Ireland&rsquo;s Policy for International Development, which provided for a member of the DEAC to be appointed to the Irish Aid Expert Advisory Group.  This Committee was serviced from the Department&rsquo;s overall budget, and it had no whole time equivalent staff.

These include advancing reconciliation and cooperation on the island of Ireland; representing and advancing government policies with other states and in international organisations, in particular the EU and the UN; economic, trade and cultural promotion; frontline consular and passport services to Irish citizens overseas; engaging with Irish communities; and programme management, particularly in Irish Aid priority countries.  Trade promotion and economic messaging are key elements in all visits abroad undertaken by Government Ministers. Every effort is made to ensure that, as far as is practicable, appropriate opportunities are taken for a substantive economic and promotional dimension to all official visits.</p><p>Delivering an intensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions is a key commitment in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs in 2013. The number of Ministerial-led Enterprise Ireland trade missions conducted with the active support of the Embassy network has more than doubled over the past three years, up from eight in 2011 to eighteen this year.  During my recent visit to Paris - in addition to formal meetings with President Hollande, Prime Minister Ayrault and Foreign Minister Fabius and other engagements - I undertook seven trade promotion activities in conjunction with the State agencies, starting with an IDA Ireland breakfast event with 50 existing and potential investors in Ireland. I led a visit of 12 Enterprise Ireland client companies to the Beauvais plant of AGCO, the multinational owner of Massey-Ferguson and France&rsquo;s top exporter of agricultural machinery, to develop opportunities for Irish engineering companies to supply components. In November I will travel to London to speak at an Enterprise Ireland Financial Services networking event.  It is also possible that I may undertake other official travel in 2014, in which case I will of course avail of all suitable opportunities to promote trade, tourism and investment.</p><p>My colleague Joe Costello T.D, Minister of State for Trade and Development, will lead an Enterprise Ireland trade mission to Qatar and Oman from 31 May to 4 June. The mission will focus on supporting Irish companies in the construction and engineering sectors as well as exploring opportunities for Irish education institutions.  From 6 to 8  October Minister of State Costello will lead an Enterprise Ireland exploratory trade visit to Mexico to support Irish companies in exploring business opportunities there.  This will reinforce Ireland&rsquo;s interest in developing and expanding political and trade relations with Mexico and build on the visit of An tUachtar&aacute;n there in 2013.  In mid-October, Minister Costello will lead an Enterprise Ireland trade mission to West Africa which will focus on mining, oil and gas opportunities for Irish companies and in late-November he will lead another EI trade mission to Australia, focusing on the construction and engineering sectors.</p><p>My colleague, Paschal Donohoe T.D., Minister of State for European Affairs, has, since taking office almost ten months ago, undertaken sixteen bilateral visits across Europe, including visits to Albania, Bosnia, Germany and Poland this year. This is in addition to Minister Donohoe's engagements at EU level, which includes representing Ireland at the General Affairs Council, at Informal Ministerial meetings, European Parliament Plenary sessions, other high-level EU engagements as they arise and accompanying the Taoiseach to the European Council. In both his bilateral and EU engagements, the Government's priorities of promoting Ireland and creating the conditions, as well as opportunities, for stability, jobs and growth are always to the fore. It is envisaged that Minister Donohoe will continue to undertake an extensive programme of bilateral visits for the remainder of the year and planning is currently underway, including for a trip to Belgrade in June to further bilateral economic and political relations as well as to demonstrate Ireland's support for Serbia's EU accession negotiations.</p><p>Other official visits abroad will include the following: I will travel to New York in late September 2014 to participate in the General Assembly of the United Nations and to address to that body on Irish foreign policy priorities. There I will meet with Foreign Ministers and UN leaders. Such meetings will provide a crucial opportunity to discuss a range of international issues, as well as bilateral issues and Ireland&rsquo;s candidature for election to a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2020.  Naturally, given the importance of our economic relationship with the United States I will, as on previous visits, prioritise opportunities to advance our economic interests and will work closely with the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Tourism Ireland on an appropriate economic promotion programme.  My colleague, Minister of State Costello, will attend a Global Summit in London on 12 June aimed at addressing the issue of sexual violence in conflict.  He will also attend the Third Decennial Conference of Small Island Developing States in Apia, Samoa, from 1 to 4 September.  The Conference will bring together Heads of Government and their representatives from 38 small developing island UN member states. The problems which many such states face due to the effects of climate change and rising sea levels can increase state fragility and, in some cases, the risk of conflict, and therefore their issues are of particular interest to Ireland in terms of our development policy, <i>One World, One Future</i>.  He may also attend the Global Partnership on Education Replenishment meeting in Brussels on 25 and 26 June and the UN General Assembly in September. In early October, Minister of State Costello is expected to travel to Paris for the OECD Development Assistance Committee&rsquo;s review of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme.  I anticipate that I will attend EU Foreign Affairs Council meetings in Luxembourg, in June and October, and in Brussels in July, November and December. I also expect to attend the Informal Meeting of EU Foreign Ministers<b></b>meeting in Rome in August. My colleagues will be similarly engaged on EU matters and expect to attend meetings as follows:</p><p><i>Minister of State Donohoe</i>12/13  May - Brussels - European General Affairs Council</p><p>12 May - Foreign Affairs Council</p><p>29/30 <sup></sup>May - Athens - Informal General Affairs Council</p><p>24 June &ndash; Luxembourg-General Affairs Council 26/27 June &ndash;Brussels - European Council </p><p>July &ndash; Brussels-European Parliament Plenary Session August &ndash; Milan - Informal Meeting of European Affairs Ministers October &ndash;Luxembourg- General Affairs Council November &ndash; Brussels - General Affairs Council December &ndash; Brussels - General Affairs Council</p><p><i>Minister of State Costello</i>19 May- Brussels- Foreign Affairs Committee, Development 15 July - Florence- Informal Meeting of EU Development Ministers 12 December - Brussels - Foreign Affairs Committee, Development</p></reply>

The cross referencing of the two registers confirmed that the HHC was paid in respect of 1.27 million properties from a total of 1.69 million properties listed on the LPT Register (other than Local Authority/Social Housing). Revenue has, as part of its extensive communications strategy, repeatedly confirmed that the database could not be 100% accurate, the main reasons being that:</p><p><i>- The LGMA Register captured the name of the person who physically paid the HHC rather than the owner of the property, for example, where a son or daughter paid the liability on behalf of a parent.</i></p><p><i>- The legislative basis for both the HHC and LPT are different. Some properties that are liable for LPT were exempt from the HHC and, unlike LPT, property owners were not actually required to make a claim for exemption from HHC.  For that reason, Revenue could not identify every property that was exempt from HHC through the cross-referencing process.</i></p><p><i>- Certain payments made directly to Local Authorities were omitted from the LGMA Register.</i></p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that it is absolutely essential from a fairness perspective to the vast majority of house owners who have paid both the HHC and LPT that Revenue follows through on those who have not and that is why it issued the letters in question. Revenue has confirmed to me that the letters were specifically worded to achieve four separate objectives:</p><p><i>- advise the property owner that the property is on the arrears database,</i></p><p><i>- advise any property owner (on the database) who had paid the HHC or whose property was not liable for the HHC to contact Revenue to correct the information on record,</i></p><p><i>- advise correctly liable persons to pay the outstanding charge thereby preventing additional interest accruing, and</i></p><p><i>- advise correctly liable persons, of the next steps that Revenue will take to collect the charge in the event of continued non-compliance.</i></p><p>To assist people in making payment or amending inaccuracies in the information, Revenue has developed a new online service that can be accessed using the Property ID and PIN codes included on the letters in question. The system, which is an extension of the LPT online facility, is available 24 hours a day and is very intuitive and easy to use. It includes the full range of payment options that are available for LPT and allows people to record any entitlements to exemptions or waivers from the HHC. Alternatively, for property owners who prefer direct contact, Revenue has extended its LPT Helpline service at 1890 200 255 from a 9am/5pm basis to an 8am/8pm basis.</p><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioner that it is not possible at this stage of the campaign to provide data on the number of letters which were sent to people who had already paid the HHC.  However, I am also informed that to date about &euro;2m. was collected in 2013, &euro;13.8m has already been collected in 2014, of which &euro;8.2m was paid since Revenue's compliance campaign began on 17 April 2014 and the Commissioners continue to receive approximately 3,500 to 4,000 payments of HHC arrears every day which suggests a low error rate.</p><p>I am very satisfied with the approach Revenue has taken to collect the outstanding HHC liabilities including, identifying those who correctly owe the payments, clearly communicating the approach adopted and providing extended customer support through innovative IT development and additional Helpline hours.</p></reply>

This is based on the principle that the claims costs to the Exchequer in a given year would be far less than the premiums charged for commercial insurance cover. The National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000, and subsequent Delegation Orders, delegated to the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) a range of functions in relation to the management of personal injuries claims, including bullying and harassment and third party property damage claims, and their associated risks, against specified State authorities. The Agency is known as the State Claims Agency (SCA) when performing these functions.</p><p>  It has become practice that each new Order rescinds and replaces the previous Order, thus having the relevant State authorities listed together in one document.  Statutory Instrument No. 182 of 2014 is the latest of such Delegation Orders.  It delegates the management of insurance claims against a number of additional bodies to the State Claims Agency, allowing those bodies to dispense with commercial insurance for employers' and public liability and third-party damage. The SCA, which is tasked with minimising costs for the State, has a team of professional claims managers, litigation solicitors and specialists in the area of litigation risk management whose expertise will be available to the delegated bodies.</p></reply>

These surveys are undertaken for Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Services Executive by Ipsos MRBI. The analysis of the results of the  survey for 2013 are not yet fully finalised but  preliminary analysis indicates that 11% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland in 2013 were illicit and a further 5% of cigarettes were non Irish duty paid which were legally brought into the country. The comparable figures for 2012 and 2011 were 13% and 14% respectively with the legally imported non Irish duty paid cigarettes at 6% and 7%. This would suggest that the extent of the problem is being contained, as a result of the extensive action being taken against the smuggling and sale of illicit product.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the Ipsos MRBI survey is the best indicator of the extent of the market in illicit cigarettes. This is because of the methodology used and the consistent manner in which the survey has been undertaken over a number of years.  It is geographically representative and surveys population samples that are statistically robust and can be extrapolated with a reasonable degree of reliability to the population at large.  In addition this methodology, in contrast to other methodologies such as empty pack surveys, is capable of distinguishing between illicit cigarettes and legal personal imports, which is a very important consideration.  The Revenue Commissioners are not in position to levy Irish taxes on products which are already taxed in other EU member states.</p><p>  I am aware that some other surveys, including The Illicit Tobacco Trade Review 2013 by Japan Tobacco International, indicate a higher level of illicit cigarette consumption. However, I do not accept the validity of those other surveys, as they are not representative of the entire smoking population, do not take into account legal personal imports from other jurisdictions and are frequently based on empty pack surveys.  I am advised that empty pack surveys are unreliable as robust estimates of the scale of non-Irish duty paid cigarettes. With empty pack surveys, it is impossible to know if the location surveyed is in any way representative (an extreme example would be Temple Bar or international sporting event). Even if there was a representative location, publicly discarded packs are not likely to be representative of packs overall.</p><p>  In looking at higher estimates of the level of illicit consumption that come from other sources, it also needs to be borne in mind that the tobacco industry claims must be viewed in terms of their interest in minimising tax increases while imposing significant price increases of their own.</p><p>  Combating the illegal tobacco trade is a high priority for the Revenue Commissioners. Their work against this illegal activity includes a wide range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing those products and prosecuting those responsible. This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country. The commitment to acting against all stages of the supply chain for illicit products will be maintained and Revenue will continue to make every effort to ensure that those involved in the illicit trade are brought to account before the Courts for their criminal activities. A new multi-annual strategy for dealing with the problem is being drawn up, and the Revenue Commissioners are consulting key stakeholders in preparing this document.</p></reply>

In this regard, Revenue has clearly stated throughout its extensive HHC related communications programme that the list of properties indicating outstanding liabilities could not be 100% accurate for a number of reasons. For the Deputy's information, the main reasons are:</p><p><i>- The LGMA Register captured the name of the person who paid the HHC rather than the owner of the property, for example, where a son or daughter paid the HHC on behalf of a parent thereby making matching very difficult in some instances.</i></p><p><i>- The legislative basis for both the HHC and LPT are different.

Where, in the opinion of the CBI, the state of the ICF is such that financial support should be provided for it, it determines an appropriate contribution to be paid to it by each insurer calculated as a percentage, not exceeding 2% of the aggregate of the gross premiums paid to that insurer in respect of policies issued in respect of risks in the State. Funds from the levy are collected from insurers by the Revenue Commissioners and these funds are transferred on a monthly basis to the ICF. </p><p>  The ICF is mainly a consumer protection mechanism. When an insurance company gets into financial difficulties, such as in an administration or in an insolvency, the scheme provides funding which allows policyholders claims to be met, in circumstances where the terms of the scheme are met. Such compensation schemes exist in many other EU Member States to deal with insurance companies occasionally getting into financial trouble. </p><p>  An ICF levy was previously introduced on 1 January 1984 following the collapse of PMPA in October 1893. The 2% levy was paid by all non-life insurers at this rate until 31 December 1991 and a reduced levy of 1% applied for the period 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1992, when it was discontinued as sufficient moneys had been collected to successfully complete the administration of the former PMPA.</p><p>  The ICF levy should not be confused with a 3% stamp duty on non-life insurance premiums introduced in 1982, which is often referred to as an insurance levy.  This Stamp Duty forms a part of general stamp duty receipts and is paid into the Central Fund along with other tax receipts.  </p></reply>

The home regulator must then provide the host regulator with a certificate attesting that the insurer covers the EU Solvency Capital Requirement, as well as the nature of the business which the insurer intends to undertake. The insurer may start to pursue business from the date that the certificate is communicated to the host regulator, in this case the Central Bank of Ireland.  </p><p>Setanta Insurance Company Limited (&quot;Setanta&quot;) is a Maltese incorporated company which was both authorised and prudentially supervised by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). While its financial position is not supervised by the Central Bank of Ireland as the Central Bank has no role in that regard, the firm is supervised by the Central Bank for conduct of business rules, i.e. consumer protection obligations.  The Central Bank is in contact with the MFSA in relation to Setanta Insurance Company Limited, the impact on policyholders and the provision for relevant and appropriate information, particularly in relation to claims.</p><p>On 16 April, 2014, Setanta determined that the company was insolvent. This means that Setanta does not have sufficient funds to be able to honour its full obligations towards claimants, policyholders and other creditors. Setanta was formally placed into liquidation by the MFSA following a meeting of the creditors which took place on the 30 April, 2014 where a liquidator, Mr Paul Mercieca, was appointed. </p><p>Officials from my Department together with officials from the Central Bank met with the Liquidator and his representatives in Ireland on 7 May 2014. At that meeting, the Liquidator confirmed that Setanta will not be in a position to pay the full amount of claims. It is also unlikely that a pro-rata portion of premiums will be refunded upon completion of the Setanta liquidation.</p><p>On Friday the 9<sup>th</sup>of May the Liquidator placed notices in national newspapers which advised policyholders that all Setanta policies of insurance will be cancelled by way of 7 days' notice or 10 days' notice to policyholders in accordance with their policy documents. The notice further urged Setanta policyholders to make alternative motor insurance arrangements, as soon as possible, as previously advised by the Central Bank. The position on each policy is for the Liquidator to decide in due course. </p><p>The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) is a non-profit-making organisation which was established by Agreement between the Government and those companies underwriting motor insurance in Ireland. The principal role of MIBI is to compensate innocent victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles. If, for legal reasons, MIBI is not in a position to accept a claim, these third party claims will be eligible to proceed for consideration by the High Court for compensation from the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF).</p><p>Claims on personal insurance policies will be payable from the ICF.  All ICF payments are subject to the limit of 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser. Under Section 3.6 of the Insurance Amendment Act 1964 (as amended) first party claims by a body corporate or unincorporated body are not covered by the ICF. The refund of premiums for either commercial and personal insurance policies is not covered by the ICF or MIBI. </p><p>The Liquidator advised that arrangements are in hand for policyholders to obtain their &quot;no claims bonus&quot; certificates from Setanta. Insurance Ireland have informed me that these certificates will be honoured by other insurers.  </p><p>In addition, the Insurance Ireland 'Declined Cases Agreement' was available to policyholders of Setanta.  The current Declined Cases Agreement was drawn up in 1981 and is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland. I am informed that under the agreement, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance, if he/she has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.  I understand that Insurance Ireland is also making information available to those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to this matter through their service at (01) 676 1914 or by email at .</p><p>The provision of motor insurance cover remains a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting and the making of adequate provisioning to meet these risks. </p><p>Until otherwise advised those policyholders which have been affected by the collapse of Setanta should continue to contact Setanta Insurance Services Limited at 0818 255 255 (if calling from outside Ireland +353 1 897 6300or on <i><i></i></i>.</p></reply>

Its financial position is not supervised by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank has no role in that regard. The Central Bank have informed me that they have been in discussions with the MFSA in relation to Setanta since November 2013 when the Central Bank identified issues during a consumer protection themed inspection and immediately referred the matter to the MFSA for further investigation. The Central Bank have also informed me that there was regular contact in the following months which led to the announcement in January, 2014 that the firm would cease writing new business and issuing further renewals. </p><p>  The Central Bank wrote on the 16th January 2014 to advise my Department of their concerns with Setanta's solvency margin and I was subsequently informed of this.  A widely reported press release was issued by Setanta Insurance on January 27th 2014 which stated that the insurer had resolved to cease carrying on the business of insurance, including further renewals of existing business, with effect from close of business of 24 January 2014. Setanta then appointed Heritage Insurance Management (Malta) Limited to undertake the run-off process and the insurer advised the MFSA accordingly.   The details and operation of this run off process is a prudential matter overseen by the home regulator, the MFSA.   </p><p>  I am advised that contact continued between the Central Bank and the MFSA and, on 11 April 2014, the MFSA advised the Central Bank that the directors of Setanta were considering the potential liquidation of the company.  There was ongoing contact over the following days.  Setanta announced that the shareholders had recommended the appointment of a liquidator on 16 April 2014 subject to approval of the MFSA.   On April 16th I was advised that the shareholders of Setanta had resolved to wind up the company and a liquidator had been provisionally appointed. The Central Bank is in ongoing contact with the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) in relation to Setanta Insurance Company Limited. </p><p>  The Central Bank has also been engaging with the brokers who sold the policies to ensure they assist policyholders and keep them informed. The Central Bank has written to all brokers to instruct them to write to all policyholders that hold a current Setanta motor insurance policy and inform them of the urgency of making alternative motor insurance arrangements.  The Central Bank as well as the Department of Finance have also liaised with the relevant industry representative bodies.</p><p>  My Department and the Central Bank will be reviewing the circumstances relating to Setanta and will be reporting to me on what lessons can be learnt and how the framework can be strengthened. The European Commission has also indicated that it will review whether any issues raised relating to the regulatory framework require action.</p></reply>

The exemptions include certain unfinished housing estates, which are prescribed (as unfinished) by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in Statutory Instrument (SI) No. 91 of 2013. The 'prescribed list' was published in March 2013 and can be viewed at . It is important to be aware that, in line with Government policy, only properties appearing on the 'prescribed list' are entitled to exemption from LPT and Revenue has no discretion in this regard.</p><p>Revenue has confirmed to me that contacts were recently made with LPT Branch by the Deputy's office in respect of the two properties to which his Questions refer. The contacts arose from the owners receiving HHC arrears letters, which issued in both cases because the data, which Revenue received from the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), gave no indication of exemptions being in place. As a result of the Deputy's contact, the properties were subsequently confirmed as being entitled to exemptions (from HHC) and the records were amended to reflect that status.</p><p>As a general comment on exemptions, the Deputy should be aware that it does not follow that properties, which are exempt from the Household Charge (HHC) are automatically included in the 'prescribed list' for LPT, as the qualifying criteria in respect of both exemptions are not the same. For example, certain properties and estates that were listed as exempt from HHC on the basis of being 'unfinished' and which were subsequently further developed in the period up to March 2013 were excluded from the LPT 'prescribed list'. This had the effect of very significantly reducing the number of exemptions in respect of LPT in comparison to HHC. </p><p>For the Deputy's information, with effect from 1 July 2013, Section 156 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) converted HHC to LPT, increased all outstanding liabilities from &euro;100 to &euro;200 and made Revenue responsible for the collection of those outstanding amounts.  </p><p>In regard to the LPT status (as distinct from HHC) of the properties, Revenue has informed me that it has confirmed that parts of the two estates mentioned by the Deputy in his Questions are listed as exempt on SI 91, but from preliminary analysis it appears as if the actual properties in question may not be included. The inclusion or exclusion of individual properties on the 'prescribed list' are issues for the property owners and the relevant Local Authorities to agree upon and Revenue has no role in those decisions.For the reasons just outlined it is very important that before any person claims an exemption from LPT they check to ensure their actual properties are included in the 'prescribed list' regardless of whether they already had exemption from HHC or not and where there is any doubt they should contact the relevant Local Authority to confirm.

In my role as the Minister for Finance I have responsibility for the development of national policy and the legal framework governing insurance regulation. In Ireland much of the legal framework governing insurance regulation is determined by agreement at a European level.</p><p>Under EU law which governs non-life insurance, an insurer is required to inform the regulator in its home Member State (its home regulator) that it intends to pursue business in another Member State. The home regulator must then provide the host regulator with a certificate attesting that the insurer covers the EU Solvency Capital Requirement, as well as the nature of the business which the insurer intends to undertake. The insurer may start to pursue business from the date that the certificate is communicated to the host regulator, in this case the Central Bank of Ireland. </p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland is the competent authority for the prudential regulation of all insurance firms authorised in Ireland, which includes those non-life insurance companies which offer car insurance. Article 5 of the Third Non-life Insurance Directive paragraph 1 states &quot;authorisation shall be valid for the entire Community. It shall permit an undertaking to carry on business there, under either the right of establishment or the freedom to provide services&quot;. If a firm is established in another EU member state, that member state is responsible for the Prudential Regulation. In some Member States this is done by a Central Bank while in others this is done by a stand-alone Regulatory body. </p><p>A General Protocol relating to the Collaboration of the Insurance Supervisory Authorities of the Member States of the European Union is available at .  It sets out the arrangements for the sharing of information between the Insurance Supervisory Authorities of the Member States.</p><p>In the case of entities regulated on a Freedom of Services based, the data provided to the Central Bank of Ireland is: Gross Premiums Written, Gross Claims Paid and Gross Commissions Paid; and 2013 data should be received by the Central Bank on or before the 31 December 2014.</p><p>Setanta Insurance Company Limited (&quot;Setanta&quot;) is a Maltese incorporated company which was both authorised and prudentially supervised by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA).   While its financial position is not supervised by the Central Bank of Ireland, the firm is supervised by the Central Bank for conduct of business rules, i.e. consumer protection obligations.  I understand that the Central Bank has been in contact with the MFSA in relation to Setanta in recent times.</p><p>Setanta was regulated at EU regulatory level in accordance with a directive known as Solvency I which sets a minimum requirement on the amount of regulatory capital European insurance companies must hold against unforeseen events. Many Member States, including Ireland require insurers to hold higher capital than that required under Solvency I. I understand that Setanta met its EU regulatory obligations and under EU law is therefore entitled to trade across EU borders.  Following negotiations that were completed at European level in November, 2013, a new maximum harmonisation regime known as Solvency II will commence on 1 January 2016, which will further strengthen and unify the EU regulatory framework. The Solvency II EU Directive sets out new, stronger EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection.  The new regime will also ensure greater cooperation between supervisors and greatly reduce the potential for regulatory arbitrage which currently exists. </p><p>My Department and the Central Bank will be reviewing the circumstances relating to Setanta and will be reporting to me on what lessons can be learnt and how the framework can be strengthened. The European Commission has also indicated that it will review whether any issues raised relating to the regulatory framework require action.</p></reply>

Revenue has responded to this environment by encouraging taxpayers experiencing particular payment difficulties to engage proactively when such difficulties arise in order to find a mutually acceptable solution, which can quickly restore voluntary timely compliance. In this regard I am informed that Revenue currently has almost 16,000 phased payment arrangements in place to the value of approximately &euro;124m</p><p>  Where such engagement is not forthcoming then Revenue has no option but to utilise appropriate collection enforcement measures, including referral to Sheriffs, to pursue outstanding tax debts. </p><p>  Revenue has informed me that in the particular case to which the Deputy refers, the tax debt was referred to the Sheriff for collection following failure by the taxpayer to respond to demands issued to him. Once a tax debt is referred in this manner then all responsibility for negotiations and payment arrangements in regard to the liability in question transfers from Revenue to the Sheriff and the taxpayer must deal directly with that office in regard to settlement. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, Revenue has informed me that given the difficult circumstances outlined by the Deputy in this particular case it has made contact with the Sheriff and outlined the issues. The Sheriff has confirmed that he is happy to discuss the issue with the person in question and hopefully come to an arrangement that suits all parties. The person or his representative should make contact with Mr Garrett Barry in the Sheriff's Office with a view to making the necessary arrangements.

Members of the Economic and Financial Sub-Committee on EU Sovereign Debt Markets have stated that the introduction of the FTT would have a significantly negative effect on Sovereign Debt Markets and may impair the good-functioning of secondary markets for sovereign debt resulting in reduced liquidity, reduced investor demand and therefore higher financing costs for States.</p><p>  Our concerns are widely shared amongst the Member States, including some of the participating countries. These concerns have led to the issuing of a communique by the participating Member States last week, announcing that they have agreed to implement a financial transaction tax in a progressive manner, with the first step being a charge on shares and some derivatives. However, significant technical and legal discussions will continue to be required at the Council Working Party before the text of the proposed Directive can be finalised. With this in mind, the targeted implementation date for the FTT has been rescheduled to 1 January 2016.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland already has a tax on financial transactions, a Stamp Duty on transfers of shares in Irish incorporated companies, which currently stands at 1%. It now appears that this will be the form of the initial tax measure that is being considered by the participating countries. This means that in effect these countries, some of which do not apply any financial transactions tax currently, are now considering a tax along the lines of that which already applies in Ireland, the UK and certain other countries. The rate at which such transactions would be charged remains to be finalised but it was proposed in the draft Directive that transactions in shares would be subject to a charge of 0.1%, which is lower than that which currently applies in Ireland.</p><p>  Assurances were given at ECOFIN last week that all Member States will be kept fully informed in the Council Working Party that is developing the proposals.

Property owners could have avoided paying the &euro;200 had they paid the original &euro;100 when it was due, or had paid the charge plus accrued interest any time prior to 1 July 2013.  Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that Revenue offered an opportunity which was well publicised to pay the &euro;200 charge without further interest.</p><p>  As I previously informed the House in my reply to Questions 168 and 169 on 6 May, the Revenue Commissioners undertook a comprehensive data matching exercise between the Local Property Tax Register and the Household Charge Register and identified a database of some 400,000 properties for which the Household Charge (HHC) was outstanding. The Commissioners have confirmed that work on verifying this database of non-compliant HHC property owners is continuing. </p><p>  The House was also informed that it is accepted that the database may not be 100% accurate for a number of reasons, including:</p><p>  - The LGMA Register captured the name of the person who paid the HHC rather than the owner of the property, therefore, for example, where a son or daughter paid the HHC on behalf of a parent and particularly where the address of the property was a 'non-unique' rural address, Revenue may not have been able to match the HHC payment to the right property;</p><p>  - The legislative basis for both the HHC and LPT are different. Some properties that are liable for LPT were exempt from the HHC and, unlike LPT, property owners were not actually required to make a claim for exemption from HHC.  For that reason, Revenue could not identify every property that was exempt from HHC through the cross-referencing process;</p><p>  - There are some examples where the LGMA register did not fully record situations where the HHC was paid to a Local Authority directly.  In all its communications with property owners during the current compliance campaign, the Revenue Commissioners have highlighted that these inconsistencies exist and have outlined the action that owners need to take if the HHC is not due.The Commissioners have also confirmed that to date they have written to some 227,000 property owners who, according to their records, had not paid the &euro;200 arrears in respect of about 273,800 properties. The Commissioners are continuing to examine the remaining cases on their database of HHC arrears and further letters will issue in due course. The published forecasted yield for LPT in 2014 of &euro;550m took full account of the work to be done by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to HHC. This figure includes estimates for LPT payments received in 2014, which are likely in the normal course to include current tax, arrears and prepayments, and HHC arrears collected this year.</p><p>  The Commissioners advise that it is not possible at this stage to confirm how much they will collect in 2014 in relation to HHC arrears or if the forecast of &euro;550m will be achieved. This will depend on the outcome of their Household Charge compliance campaign, bearing in mind the database issues set out above.  However, while the HHC receipts will be recorded as LPT in the Revenue data, the amount of HHC paid will be identifiable, and will be capable of being reported on. </p><p>  I am also informed that, to date, about &euro;2m was collected in 2013, &euro;13.8m has already been collected in 2014, of which &euro;8.2m was paid since Revenue's compliance campaign began on 17 April 2014.  The Commissioners continue to receive approximately 3,500 to 4,000 payments of HHC arrears every day.</p><p>  I am further advised by Revenue that they will shortly begin to take appropriate enforcement action against any property owner that they have written to in connection with HHC arrears and the property owner has not responded.  Such enforcement action may include deduction at source from salaries, occupational pension and certain Government payments as well as sheriff or solicitor action.  I strongly encourage any property owner, therefore, who has not dealt with their arrears of HHC to do so as a matter of urgency.</p><p>  As regards allocation of LPT, the legislation provides that, in each financial year commencing with 2014, the Minister shall pay from the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof into the Local Government Fund (LGF) an amount equivalent to the LPT, including any interest paid thereon, paid into the Central Fund during that year. The allocation of funding from the Local Government Fund is a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

From these options, persons with outstanding liabilities can choose the payment method that best suits their individual circumstances. For the Deputy's information the options include phased payments through the approved service providers (An Post, Omnivend and Payzone), direct debit and deduction at source over the course of the year from employment or occupational pension.</p><p>  The Deputy should be aware that liable persons who opt for phased payment by service provider or direct debit may be liable to processing charges by the provider or the financial institution, which is outside of Revenue's control. However there is no charge in respect of the deduction at source option, which is administered by Revenue.</p></reply>

These figures indicate that, in general, credit unions are currently well within the limits as set down in the 1997 Act.</p><p>  Acting as the independent regulator, the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank has applied lending restrictions to some credit unions.  I have been informed that these restrictions are viewed as short term in the majority of cases and are imposed as a means of allowing a credit union to address identified concerns as quickly as possible. Where lending restrictions are imposed they tend to take the form of a restriction on individual loan size or on commercial lending activity and in some cases, a limit on the total lending permitted each month. At this time fewer than 10% of all credit unions have a restriction in place which limits the total amount of lending within the month, while close to 40% of all credit unions have a restriction on commercial lending activity. Currently, the average loan rate in the sector is just over &euro;6,000 and only about a dozen individual credit unions have lending restrictions that limit the amount loaned to less than &euro;10,000. This ensures that the vast majority of credit unions can continue to make loans significantly   greater than the average loan for the sector. The Registrar of Credit Unions has assured me that restrictions are reviewed on a regular basis.</p><p>  On foot of recommendations from the Commission on Credit Unions, section 11 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 substantially amends section 35 of the 1997 Act. Section 11 will be commenced in tandem with new Central Bank regulations on lending, which are to be introduced as part of the tiered regulatory approach recommended by the Commission.  The Central Bank has recently held the first of its consultation processes on the tiered regulatory approach and is considering the views submitted by credit unions and others.</p></reply>

They are also subject to a 1.5% contribution towards dependant benefits.</p><p>The introduction in 1995 of contributions towards personal pension benefits for new-joiner established civil servants (appointed on or after 6 April 1995) carried an entitlement to being fully-insured under the Social Welfare system (i.e. they pay full PRSI). This means their pensions are integrated with the State contributory pension (meaning in particular that the calculation of their civil service pension reflects an offset in respect of assumed entitlement to the State contributory pension). By contrast, pre-1995 civil servants who in general pay a lower modified rate of social insurance, do not qualify for most social welfare benefits and receive occupational pensions which are not integrated with the State contributory pension.</p><p>USC is charged on all occupational pensions, both public and private sector, whereas social welfare pensions are exempt. While  the State contributory pension portion of the post 1995 civil servants pensions is exempt from USC, the same rules apply to the occupational portion of their pension that apply to everybody else in receipt of an occupational pension.</p><p>As you may be aware, delivering on a commitment in the Programme for Government, the USC was reviewed by the Department of Finance in the lead up to Budget 2012. The report is available at . As a result of the review of the USC, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum. It is estimated that this removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge.</p><p>The review also examined the impact of the USC on public sector pensioners and set out a number of options to address this matter, including an option to apply USC to the State pension which it was estimated would  have yielded &euro;330 million at a time when the public finances were under severe pressure. It was also estimated that to treat non-integrated public sector pensions as exempt from USC would have cost &euro;90 million. On consideration it was decided that to implement the latter would undermine the principle of USC being applied to as wide a base as practicable and that the cost would have to be made up elsewhere at a time when other sectors of society were already being asked to accept a series of onerous expenditure cutbacks.</p></reply>

The approval by the Commission is an important external validation that the plan contains a credible strategy to return AIB to profitability and a position where it can support the Irish economy in the years ahead. This view has been further reinforced by the announcement yesterday by AIB that the bank returned to profit during the first quarter of 2014, which was earlier than expected.  </p><p>  From the State's perspective the plan lays out a path that will ensure the Irish taxpayer ultimately can see a return of its substantial investment  in the bank. It also brings to an end a period of uncertainty about what the future shape of the bank would look like which is important for all stakeholders including staff.</p><p>  The Restructuring Plan includes a set of commitments which AIB will respect during the restructuring period, i.e. until the end of 2017. Those commitments comprise, among other things, targets on cost reduction and a ban on acquisitions. Moreover, AIB will operate "market opening measures" to facilitate the market entry of competitors, comprising a "services package" and a "customer mobility package". </p><p>  The approval of the plan by the Commission has no impact on any efforts to achieve a deal on retrospective recapitalisation of AIB.</p></reply>

The restructures are often complex due to multiple debt connections.  Irish banks are advancing the process of restructuring their SME loan books.   I am informed by Bank of Ireland that the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2013 gives comprehensive additional asset quality disclosures on all of its Loan Portfolios from page 380 to 423, including details of forbearance measures on its SME loan portfolios from page 416.  In particular,   Bank of Ireland have indicated that they had reached resolution in 90% of distressed SME cases.  </p><p>  I am informed by AIB that disclosures in relation to its SME portfolio are contained in the Credit Risk disclosures on page 71   153 of the 2013 Annual Financial Report.  In particular, the AIB's results indicate a resolution level of approximately 65%.  It is also worth noting that defaulted loans for both banks have reduced year-on-year. </p><p>  The Central Bank's process of assessing financial institutions in their efforts to move distressed SME borrowers onto longer term sustainable solutions is an important element in assisting SMEs to potentially transition from a distressed to a more sustainable state and will continue in 2014. Additionally, the Government's enactment of legislation to allow small companies (as defined by the Companies Acts) to apply to the Circuit Court for examinership and the on going work of the expanded Credit Review Office are all initiatives that will assist viable SMEs in adressing their debt situation. </p></reply>

The CCMA is issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 and lenders covered by the Code are required to comply with it as a matter of law.  The Central Bank has the power to administer sanctions for a contravention of this Code.     </p><p>  On the BTL mortgage aspect, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, which falls within the remit of the Minister for Housing and Planning, provides the main regulatory framework for the private rental sector and prescribes the statutory rights and obligations of landlords and tenants.</p><p>  The Central Bank published the revised CCMA in June 2013.  As part of the financial institutions' delivery of full implementation of the revised CCMA, the boards of directors of all mortgage lenders were required by the Central Bank to sign off that all of the provisions of the revised CCMA had been fully implemented and tested and that staff training had been completed.   Compliance with the CCMA will continue to be central to the Central Bank's work programme throughout 2014 and an inspection of mortgage lenders to test compliance with the revised CCMA will be conducted later this year.  </p><p>The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers. If a borrower is not happy with the way that their lender is dealing with them or if they think the lender is not complying with the CCMA, the borrower can make a complaint to their lender.   Under the CCMA, borrowers have the right to appeal to the lender's Appeals Board if they are not happy with the alternative repayment arrangement offered or where a lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement or if they believe they have been wrongly classified as not co-operating.   If the borrower is not happy with the outcome of the appeal/complaint made to the lender they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman. </p><p>  The monthly mortgage restructures and arrears data published by my Department provide an impetus for those MART banks to increase the pace of provision of mortgage restructures.  The latest publication, which is in respect of the end of February, shows that some progress has been made in putting permanent mortgage restructures in place.  For example, the number of permanent restructures of buy-to-let mortgages more than 90 days in arrears has risen from around 5,600 in December to around 6,000 in February 2014.  The data published by my Department, and the Central Bank quarterly mortgage arrears publications, would appear to demonstrate some progress by the lenders in addressing the accounts in arrears and putting in place appropriate measures to prevent borrowers from going into arrears.</p></reply>

The Department of the Environment undertook to provide such a robust mechanism in conjunction with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI). Such a mechanism is in place since June 2011 and the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 specify the environmental standards for coal placed on the market and provide the regulatory framework in relation to the distribution and sale of coal in the State.</p><p>  In particular, the Regulations require that all bituminous coal sold and used outside smoky coal ban areas for residential use outside those areas must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%, which is lower than that in Northern Ireland and therefore bituminous coal supplied to Northern Ireland standards for sale on that market may not be sold in the State. Compliance with the Regulations is be enforced by local authorities. A verification mechanism, SWiFT 7, has been developed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) for the verification of sulphur content in coal. This provides for a robust mechanism to verify the sulphur content of coal to national standards. </p><p>  Suppliers who produce and supply solid fuels in contravention of the Regulations are subject to investigation and prosecution under the Air Pollution Act by local authorities charged with enforcing the regulations and preventing such supply.</p><p>  The application of the carbon tax to solid fuels was further postponed in 2012 given the overall tax increases in Budget 2012 including in the standard rate of VAT.</p><p>Budget 2013 commenced the application of carbon tax to solid fuels but I chose not to introduce this until after the 2012/2103 winter period and opted to introduce the tax in two phases i.e. &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 from 1 May 2013 and a further &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 from 1 May 2014 thus bringing the carbon tax on solid fuels in line with that on all other fossil fuels i.e. at &euro;20 per tonne of CO2. </p><p>  The introduction of Carbon Tax was about sending a price signal that there is a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment. It should also be noted that solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels. As a result they are considered the dirtiest fuels and given the environmental impact it is important that they are taxed.</p><p>  While tax increases are unpopular, where Member States are under fiscal pressure, it makes sense to increase taxes in areas where some benefits can arise, in this instance a carbon tax promotes energy efficiency, reduces emissions and reduces our dependence on imported fossil fuels.</p><p>  Accordingly I do not intend to reverse the Carbon Tax increase on solid fuels from 1 May 2014.</p></reply>

The purpose of the pre-notification is to facilitate the easier passage of the measure through any formal State-aid notification.  The Commission were in touch with officials from my Department recently and wish to discuss the pre-notification details.  Discussions are scheduled to take place this week.  The measure will have no tax cost until 2017 at the earliest and is tentatively estimated to have a tax cost of &euro;20 million in 2018. The measure is intended to encourage entrepreneurship and the number of jobs created will be dependent on the success or otherwise of the enterprises created with the support of the measure.</p><p>  A tax scheme for the construction or refurbishment of certain aviation services facilities, as provided for in Finance Act 2013, is subject to EU approval.  This measure was announced as part of Budget 2013. An application was made to the EU Commission on 18 June 2013. A meeting was held with officials in the Commission on 6 March 2014.  It is not possible to estimate the cost to the Exchequer due to a number of variables such as the cost to build each hangar, whether the relief is claimed by a company or an individual or how many years the relief is claimed over.</p><p>  Exemption from Stamp Duty on the transfer of shares of companies listed on the Enterprise Securities Market of the Irish Stock Exchange, is subject to EU approval. This measure was announced as part of Budget 2014.  A pre-notification of state aid was made to the EU Commission on 4 February 2014.  Further information was furnished to the Commission, at its request, on 7 March 2014. The estimated Exchequer cost is &euro;5m and the proposed measure aims to encourage entrepreneurs and growing businesses to use public equity markets as a source of funding for growth and the creation of jobs.</p></reply>

The purpose of Baggot Securities Limited was to issue debt securities to third party investors and to use the proceeds arising to purchase preference shares from the State. </p><p>  As part of the capital package to repay the State's entire holding of preference shares, Bank of Ireland issued new ordinary shares by way of a private placing to investors.  The cash raised by Bank of Ireland by way of the private placing was used to repay &euro;537m of the total nominal value of &euro;1,837m of the preference shares. Including accrued interest, this part of the transaction yielded cash proceeds of &euro;581m for the State.</p><p>  The State did not participate in the private placing and the issuance of new ordinary shares had no impact on the number of ordinary shares held by the State.  As the number of ordinary shares in issue increased following the private  placing, the State's percentage shareholding reduced from c.15% to c.14%. For the avoidance of doubt, there was no rights issue involved. </p><p>  In summary, the proceeds from the sale of preference shares to Baggot Securities Limited combined with the proceeds from the partial redemption by Bank of Ireland facilitated by the private placing generated total proceeds of &euro;2.05bn for the State.</p></reply>

It has a central role in ensuring that labour market needs for skilled workers are anticipated and met.  A new report published recently by Forf&aacute;s and the EGFSN, 'Assessing the Demand for Big Data and Analytics Skills, 2013 &ndash; 2020' notes that  big data and analytics is a relatively new area of business activity characterised by rapid growth.  Globally, there is a reported shortage of data analytics talent particularly individuals with the required 'deep analytical' skills.  At present, no one country or region stands out in the provision of data analytics services and there is a significant opportunity for Ireland to gain ground here.  The report estimates that Ireland has the potential to create between 12,750 and 21,000 job vacancies by 2020, arising through expansion and replacement demand. The full report, and its recommendations, are available on <i>www.skillsireland.ie</i>.</p><p>Since 2011 my Department has introduced two new competitive funding streams at higher education level that address the specific skills needs of industry and supports jobseekers into employment - Springboard and the ICT skills conversion programme.  All courses approved for funding under these initiatives are selected by an independent panel with industry and educational expertise having regard to guidance from Forf&aacute;s and the EGFSN on current and future skills needs of enterprise.  One of the key areas for focus for Springboard and the ICT skills conversion programme 2014 is in data analytics.The evaluation framework for Springboard and the ICT skills conversion programme provides for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of outputs.  An evaluation report published by the Higher Education Authority showed that, 30% of Springboard participants were back in work within 6 weeks of completing a Springboard course and 40% were back in work within 6 months of completion.  While an evaluation of phases 1 and 2 of the ICT skills conversion programme showed that 56% of graduates from the programmes were reported as being in employment or self-employment.  The full evaluation reports are published on the HEA's website <i>www.hea.ie.</i></p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. </p><p>Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.  Application forms for taking a section 29 appeal are available on my Departments website at the following link , or by contacting Section 29 Administration Unit, Friars Mill Road, Mullingar, Co.

Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days.</p><p>Accordingly, DES Circular 71/2011 was issued on 15 December 2011 which outlined that these 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year. </p><p>Link to DES Circular 71/2011 is as follows:.</p><p>  SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment. Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours. I should point out that this divisor was agreed with both of the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) that represent SNAs.</p><p>Furthermore, the issue of appropriate working hours for all public servants was one of the key aspects of the set of proposals for a public service agreement which were put forward by the Labour Relations Commission and which now form the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement). The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:</p><p>&quot;SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTS Hours Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant. Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited. Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions.</p><p>These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers.</p><p>This will constitute the liability on Special Needs Assistants in respect of working hours for the purposes of this extension to the Public Service Agreement.&quot;  An LRC process has now commenced in respect of the application of this provision of the Haddington Road Agreement.</p></reply>

The first phase of the budget measure took effect from September 2012. The final phase of the budget measure takes effect from September 2014 and will not be suspended.   My Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the schools that are affected by the budget measure. In this regard small schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting sustainable increased enrolments in September 2014 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.</p><p>The detailed arrangements in relation to the appeals process are set in the Department's Staffing Circular 0007/2014. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final. The allocation process for the 2014/15 school year is currently underway in the Department. </p><p>There are two schools in County Donegal impacted for the 2014/15 school year by the Budget 2012 measure. These schools have had appeals to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board provisionally upheld and will not lose their posts pending actual enrolments in September 2014.</p><p>The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities. They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape. How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small local communities does present as a particular challenge, especially in any locality where enrolment is declining to single figures. In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.</p><p>My Department and I will continue to engage with the relevant education sector stakeholders in relation to education provision for all areas.</p><p>Our current configuration of small primary schools has been examined by the Department in a value for money (VFM) review. This review took account of the ethos of schools and the locations of small schools relative to other schools of a similar type. I am currently considering this review in consultation with my Government colleagues and I intend to publish the report on completion of this consideration process.</p></reply>

In total, I have approved the spending of more than &euro;70 million on the Summer Works Scheme to allow 772 schools undertake improvement works during the summer months.</p><p>  Commensurate with the level of funding set aside for the Scheme, applications were assessed on a top down basis in accordance with the prioritisation criteria outlined in the Circular accompanying the Scheme. Unfortunately, due to the scale of demand for funding under the Scheme, it was not possible to grant aid all applications. However, in accordance with the Scheme's Circular, the school's application will be retained and will be prioritised for consideration under further rounds of the Summer Works Scheme in the future, subject to availability of funding.</p><p>  In regard to the consideration of an Emergency Works application, the school authorities must be advised that the main purpose of the Emergency Works Scheme is to ensure the availability of funding for urgent works to those schools that are most in need of resources as a result of an emergency situation.</p><p>  An emergency is a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment, which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action and in the case of a school, if not corrected, would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.</p></reply>

Since becoming Minister for Education and Skills, I have attempted to take steps to reduce the burden on families. In 2014, the Department will provide &euro;15m in book grants to first and second level schools. An addition &euro;6.7m will be targeted in 2014 and 2015 at primary schools who did not operate a book rental scheme. Some &euro;8.3m in additional grants will be divided among primary schools that currently operate book rental schemes in 2015 and 2016.</p><p>  Apart from the recognised fee-charging second level schools, recognised primary or post-primary schools are not permitted to charge school fees.</p><p>  Voluntary contributions by parents are however permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay. The manner in which contributions are sought and collected is a matter for each school management; however their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character.</p><p>  I launched new "Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools" on the 28th January 2013. These Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated. The aim of the Guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.</p><p>  A special "Guide for Parents" was also published, to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them. I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes.</p><p>  The Department will continue to provide a book grant as usual to all post primary schools. This grant, can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's existing book rental scheme.</p><p>  The current arrangements for the distribution of school book grants relies on the local knowledge of the school and school Principal in order to ensure a fair allocation of scarce funds to those most in need.</p></reply>

The principal vehicle for the delivery of pre-school education is the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which was introduced in January 2010 and provides for early learning in a formal setting to children in the year before they commence primary school.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) currently provides for care support for pupils with special needs attending a range of pre-schools.</p><p>  Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are allocated to Special Schools and to mainstream Primary and Post Primary schools to assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs. Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>  This may, in some instances, include provision for children who are enrolled to early intervention classes in recognised primary schools, or special schools, where support is provided for as part of the schools total quantum of SNA support. However, as set out in my Departments Circular 0030/2014 in relation to the SNA scheme, SNA support is not provided to pre-school services which operate outside of the primary or special school provision.</p></reply>

The school referred to by the Deputy has not applied to participate in the school based programme. </p><p>  I wish to clarify for the Deputy that my Department's position is that as each child with autism is unique, they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs and my Department's policy is to promote a child- centred approach to the education of children with special education including autism.  Applied Behavioural Analysis, or ABA, is one of the many approaches used in special classes for children with autism.  My Department does not support schools which focus exclusively on one particular approach and therefore the school to which the Deputy refers is recognised as a special school for children with autism.</p><p>  It is not proposed at this time to extend the July Provision scheme to further disability categories.  The NCSE is currently preparing policy advice on the education of children with autism which will include a review of July Provision.  I expect that the final report, which is to be delivered in the Spring of 2015, will consider the broadest possible range of views and provide recommendations which will assist the development of policy for future years.</p></reply>

In the case of each of the ASD classes currently operating throughout the country, they were opened with the direct support of the NCSE/SENO and/or the Inspectorate and/or the relevant NEPS Psychologist.  Through the proviso of this direct support, each school received the advice and guidance necessary to assist them in the development of their units.  It is not possible to say whether an individual school received documentation as part of the support and guidance provided by either NEPS or the Inspectorate when their ASD unit was opened.   </p><p>  However I also advised the Deputy previously that the model concept in question was not disregarded, rather the scenarios described by the models were simplified.  Elements of teaching frameworks, whole school training and the extended school year remain features of current provision.  I previously advised the Deputy that the discontinuation of the model concept in favour of the mainstream, special class and special school provision did not materially alter the provision being made for children with autism. </p><p>  As previously outlined the NCSE is currently developing policy advice on the education of children with autism.  I specifically requested the NCSE to consult as widely as possible in the preparation of the advice as it presents an opportunity for all interested parties to contribute to the final advice document which will assist in the development of policy in my Department for future years.  The terms of reference for the policy advice are on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie and will address many of the issues raised recently by the Deputy.</p><p>  Finally it should be noted that the decision of the court in the case to which the Deputy has referred was to the effect that, the decision as to what model of education contained within it the ability to provide an appropriate education was a responsibility of the Minister under the constitution and that the Minister had made this decision having taken advice.  This is clearly an ongoing responsibility and the changes which have taken place since this finding and which may take place as a consequence of the forthcoming NCSE policy advice are entirely consistent with the court's findings.</p></reply>

The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues.  </p><p>  As I previously outlined for the Deputy the brief of the Special Education Support service (SESS) is to enhance the quality of learning and teaching of students with special educational needs through the provision of CPD and support for teachers in mainstream schools, primary and post-primary special schools, and special classes.  The SESS also provides whole school training at the request of schools and this can include training for Special Needs Assistants. </p><p>  The model concept in question was not disregarded, rather the scenarios described by the models were simplified.  Elements of teaching frameworks, whole school training and the extended school year remain features of current provision.  I previously advised the Deputy that the discontinuation of the model concept in favour of the mainstream, special class and special school provision did not materially alter the provision being made for children with autism. </p><p>  It is a matter for schools to determine the approach or mix of approaches which they will use in each individual case.  The approach towards each child's education would be based on the individual educational needs of the child and would have regard to the child's individual education plan and supporting professional reports, etc. and would require the interaction of all school personnel involved in the provision of education to the child.  Funding is also made available through the SESS support scheme enabling teachers to identify their own CPD needs and attend appropriate and relevant courses not provided directly by the SESS.  The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.  The Circular explains that where pupils have particular care needs, that schools should ensure that SNAs who are recruited to work with such children are equipped with the skills necessary to support the particular needs of these pupils. </p><p>  As previously outlined the NCSE is currently developing policy advice on the education of children with autism.  I specifically requested the NCSE to consult as widely as possible in the preparation of the advice as it presents an opportunity for all interested parties to contribute to the final advice document which will assist in the development of policy in my Department for future years.

The aim of this pamphlet is to inform parents and guardians of supports and services available for children and young people with autism spectrum disorder and their families. </p><p>  Although an outline of my Department's policy will be a feature, the publication of the pamphlet is not intended to replace any formal statement of  the Minister's policy on the education of children with autism spectrum disorder nor is it, or the NCSE booklet of September 2011, purporting to be a legal document.  The contents of the booklet are a matter for the NCSE.  The pamphlet will be broadly similar to the NCSE pamphlet in respect of Deaf and Hard of Hearing children.

As the Deputies will be aware, the overriding objective of Education capital expenditure is to meet the demographic challenge facing the education system, whereby total pupil enrolment in both primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by around 107,000 additional pupils between 2012 and 2019 - over 70,000 at primary level and over 35,000 at post primary - and will continue to rise at post primary level to the year 2026, at least.  A priority therefore for my Department is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  My Department is not in a position to develop one school where this may negatively impact on other schools in the area. </p><p>  In the case of Sligo, it is projected that whilst overall pupil numbers across the 13 schools in the Sligo catchment area will be relatively stable up to 2019, it is anticipated that overall pupil enrolment numbers will decline thereafter.  In terms of school accommodation, there is sufficient capacity available within existing schools to cater for the demand for school places.  In that regard, an additional 8 classrooms catering for up to 224 pupils in the case of the school, in question, has the potential to have a significant impact on other schools in the same catchment area.  In light of the above, the school authority has been advised that my Department is not in a position to accede to the school's request in respect of an additional class of junior infants in September 2014. </p><p>  However to assess further the pupil enrolment trends in the Sligo area including information on school pre-enrolments for the 2014/2015 academic year, my Department will be contacting the Patron and school authorities of the 13 primary schools in the Sligo area.  When this data has been obtained and reviewed, my Department will communicate further with the Patron and school authority in question.</p></reply>

Where a school chooses not to extend their services for July, eligible children in the school will be granted home based July Provision, on application. </p><p>  As the home based provision takes place outside the usual school structure it is important that home tutors are qualified to provide an educational programme.  It is appropriate therefore that the qualification standard in the Home Based July Provision generally reflects that required in a school environment.  Home tutors should be fully qualified teachers who are registered with the Teaching Council of Ireland.  When it is not possible to recruit a fully qualified teacher then consideration will be given to the engagement of a tutor who is registered with the Teaching Council and has a primary degree (minimum level 7 FETAC) in a relevant area including e.g. psychology. </p><p>  The qualification standards for home tutors have not altered and if an SNA meets these standards they can also be considered in this context.  The requirement that all home tutors be registered with the Teaching Council was introduced in September 2013.

The proposals in relation to SOLAS, as agreed by the Government, envisage a key role for the ETBs in relation to the future delivery of further education and training in an integrated manner.  Significant developments have already taken place with the establishment of ETBs on 1 July 2013, and the establishment of SOLAS on 27 October 2013. 7 SOLAS training centres and their staff transferred to 4 ETBs on 1 January 2014.  The second phase of transfer of 12 SOLAS training centres to a further 7 ETBs will take place on 1 July 2014. SOLAS and the ETBs have established a Transfer Implementation Group to ensure that there is a smooth transfer process.</p><p>  Community Training Centres (CTCs) are independent community-based organisations, each with its own board and governance structure.  CTCs are managed locally and funded directly from SOLAS or ETBs. SOLAS has regular meetings with the employer representative body for the 38 independent community boards governing the CTCs  and has kept it informed of changes in the Further Education and Training sector.  In particular, this has included information on the transfer of all SOLAS training functions, including responsibilities for CTCs, to ETBs.  My Department has no plans at present to alter existing arrangements in relation to CTCs and their work in meeting the training and employment needs of early school leavers, primarily aged between 16 and 21, in the community will continue.

I wish to clarify that Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are allocated to primary, post-primary and special schools to assist schools in addressing additional care needs so as to facilitate inclusion of students with special educational needs.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of the children, rather than solely by reference to a pupil's disability categorisation.</p><p>  The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.  The Circular explains that schools should ensure that SNAs who work with Deaf and hard of hearing children are equipped with the skills necessary to support the particular needs of these pupils, including capacity to use Sign Language where required.  The Circular also explains that, where existing SNA staff are required to be trained to provide Sign Language or specialist training (Braille, L&aacute;mh, Sign Language, Augumentive/Alternative Interventions) to assist in the provision of support for children with a specific sensory impairment, schools should ensure that the most senior SNA staff in the school are the staff that are trained in order to avoid a situation where staff trained in specialist skills may leave the school due to a reduction in the overall level of SNA support allocated to a school in future years.</p><p>  Not all children with Down syndrome may require SNA support, or support from an SNA trained in sign language.  However for those children with Down syndrome who have a hearing impairment to the extent that they require support form an SNA trained in sign language, this can be provided for in accordance with the terms of my Departments Circular 0030/2014.</p></reply>

The Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology and Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences were merged in March 2012 to form the Irish Research Council (IRC). The IRC has been established as a sub-board of the Higher Education Authority (HEA).  The estimated saving on an annual basis is c. &euro;100,000.</p><p>  Under the provisions of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), the Higher Education Training Awards Council (HETAC) and the Further Education Training Awards Council (FETAC) were amalgamated to form a new agency, the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI).  The estimated saving on an annual basis is &euro;1 million.Under the provisions of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 the Vocational Education Committee (VEC) system was reconfigured, with the number of further education bodies being reduced from 33 to 16.  Full year savings are estimated at &euro;2.1m.  Further savings are likely to be achieved through realisation of economies of scale arising from the mergers and the wider Education and Training Sector Reform Programme.</p><p>  Under the provisions of the Further Education and Training Act 2013 F&Aacute;S was dissolved in October 2013, with a new training authority, An tSeirbh&iacute;s Oideachais Lean&uacute;naigh agus Scileanna (SOLAS) being created with responsibility for funding, planning and co-ordinating training and further education programmes.  Following the enactment of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012, the necessary steps have been taken to dissolve the Education Finance Board in March 2013 and establish the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board (Cara Nua).  This body will be funded from the contributions of the religious congregations offered in response to the request for additional contributions, following the publication of the Ryan Report.</p></reply>

Firstly, as part of the measures which were introduced to restore order to the public finances, salary scales for all recruitment grades in the public service (including teachers) were reduced by 10% for new entrants. This applies to new entrant teachers appointed between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012.  Secondly, a revised salary scale applies to new entrant teachers appointed from 1 February 2012 onwards whose qualifications allowances were removed following the public service-wide review of allowances.</p><p>  According to Department payroll records, the number of new entrant whole time teacher equivalents currently employed as permanent, temporary, regular part-time or on contracts of indefinite duration who were appointed between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012 is 681 (excluding teachers employed in Education and Training Boards).  It is estimated that ETBs employ a further 90 such teachers.  Information in respect of new entrant teachers appointed on or after 1 February 2012 is not currently available but will be furnished to the Deputy in due course.</p><p>  The Haddington Road Agreement provides that revised salary scales shall be prepared for same grade entrants to the public service (including for example teachers and SNAs) to incorporate the revision of salary scales introduced in 2011, in order to address the imbalance between those who entered the Public Service since 2011 and those who entered before that date.  Implementation of these revised salary scales is in progress.</p></reply>

Two further steps are necessary for the operation of the legislation prior to its commencement.  The first; a comprehensive code of practice for the conduct of adjudication, has been the subject of consultation with key stakeholders.  The final draft of the code of practice was circulated to stakeholders in March.  The second element requires the establishment of a panel of adjudicators and a chair of that panel to be appointed.  The chair of the panel will appoint an adjudicator where parties to a payment dispute (that has been referred to adjudication under the Act) fail to agree on an adjudicator between them.</p><p>  Officials in my department are working on the details of the structure for the panel, its set up and operation and this will shortly be circulated to stakeholders for consultation.  Once this process is concluded, applications for the panel will be advertised and when the appointment process to the panel is complete the Act will be commenced.</p></reply>

The bulk of the savings are derived from a reduction in the number of public servants working in the merged entities and from other administrative efficiencies.</p></reply>

The delivery of water services under a public utility model is expected to bring benefits in terms of access to new sources of revenue to fund greater investment in water services infrastructure and provide more efficient and better quality of service for customers.  To date the majority of the costs of water service provision have been met by the Exchequer and Local Authorities from their own resources and general purpose grants from the Local Government Fund, with some income from the commercial sector.  According to the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government,  the Irish Water funding model is expected to yield savings to the State sector of the order of &euro;250m from 2014 to the end of 2016 by comparison with the previous funding model, but with a substantially higher level of capital investment including core water services infrastructure, domestic metering and asset management systems.</p><p>  Under  the Water Services Acts setting up the company, I as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform  have a  number of consent functions, including Consent to the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association of Irish Water, borrowing by Irish Water,  the form of accounts, auditors fees, pension schemes etc.  My Department and I have been consulted, as appropriate, in this regard.  Of course, as  part of the normal process of consideration by Government of Memorandums  on sectoral policy issues I would also have been  consulted on memorandums relating to  Irish Water.</p></reply>

The OPW allocated funding to Kerry County Council of &euro;180,000 under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme in 2012 for works to embankments at Cromane and Incherea. This funding has been drawn down by the Council and the works in question have been undertaken.</p><p>The Government decided on 11 February, 2014 to make available funding of up to &euro;69.5 million for a programme of repair and remediation works to roads, coastal protection and flood defence and other public infrastructure damaged in the storms from 13 December, 2013 to 6 January, 2014 based on estimates provided by the local authorities concerned. Of the total amount being made available, up to &euro;19.6 million is available via the Office of Public Works (OPW) for the repair of damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure. The allocation of funding to local authorities under the Government Decision was to specifically address the repair of existing damaged infrastructure as a matter of priority.</p><p>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (DoECLG) wrote to Kerry County Council indicating, based on the estimate submitted by the Council to that Department, that up to &euro;1,226,920 is being made available to the Council via the OPW to undertake the necessary repair works to damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure. The estimates submitted by Kerry County Council to the DoECLG included strengthening works at Incherea and Glenbeigh and both repair and strengthening works at Cromane Lower. Strengthening works fall outside of the scope of the Government Decision, and the Council will need to address this separately and outside of the current process aimed at repairs and emergency works. </p><p>The Council must submit overall programmes of works to the DoECLG detailing how it proposes to spend the total allocation that is being made available.

In that context, exchanges between staff in the organisations involved do not arise.  </p><p>  Transfers between grades in the civil service can be arranged on an informal, head-to-head, basis.  Such transfers are arranged between the officers seeking to move and the relevant Personnel Units and require the agreement of both Personnel Officers.</p><p>  Staff exchange arrangements for the other Public Service sectors are a matter for the relevant parent Department in each case.</p></reply>

As is standard in such cases, the CRO was requested to supply a Letter of &quot;no objection&quot; to the restoration and it issued such a letter in April 2007 stating it would have no objection to the restoration provided the company delivered in advance to the CRO all of its outstanding Annual Returns and Accounts for the period 1991-2007 in this case. </p><p>The requested Annual Returns and Accounts were delivered to the CRO and as they appeared in order on their face and were duly signed by officers of the company, as notified to the CRO they were accepted by the CRO in April 2007 and are available as registered documents on the public register of companies.</p><p>I am further advised by the CRO that two B10 Forms (&quot;Notification of appointment/resignation of director/secretary or change in details of director/secretary&quot;  ) were submitted to the Office on 14 February 2007.  As these Forms appeared on their face to be in order and duly signed, they were subsequently registered by the CRO.  The CRO was the recipient of further statutory filings and non-statutory correspondence from the company between its restoration in 2007 and 2010. The CRO is satisfied that the register now reflects accurately the position of appointment of directors and secretaries as notified to the registrar by the company. The onus rests with companies and their officers to ensure that accurate information is filed with the CRO.</p><p>It would appear that there is a dispute between a number of parties attached to the company. One of the parties has alleged that the B10 filings of February 2007 were &ldquo;fraudulent&rdquo; and the CRO advised the complainant to refer the complaint to the appropriate authorities for investigation. </p><p>I should stress that the CRO does not have an adjudication role in relation to the determination of who was, or who was not, a director or secretary of a company at a particular point in time. The role of the CRO is to register the various statutory forms submitted by companies that on their face comply with the statutory requirements. It would be a matter for the Courts to determine a dispute as to who, in fact, the directors of a particular company were on various dates.  The CRO would immediately comply with any direction issued by the Court in that regard.</p></reply>

There is no direct correlation between the number of jobs announced in any one year and the actual number of jobs created in that same year.  Depending on the individual company&rsquo;s business plan jobs come on stream typically in a 3 to 5 year period following the securing of an investment win, though in some cases the time frame can be shorter.</p><p>  It is important to note that the number of jobs created in IDA Ireland client companies in any one year typically exceeds the number of jobs announced.  The potential job creation figure from the 58 IDA Ireland announcements in 2013 amounted to 5,600 whereas the actual number of jobs created in IDA Ireland client companies in 2013 was in fact 13,367, as shown in the Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey, which tracks the numbers of jobs created and lost in IDA Ireland client companies.</p></reply>

Independent legal advice should be sought in relation to any concerns an individual may have about their situation.</p><p>  In Irish legislation, the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 lay down criteria by which the fairness or otherwise of dismissals are adjudicated upon.  In section 6(4) the Acts provide for potentially fair reasons for dismissal, including the conduct of an employee.  The Acts state that, in determining whether the dismissal of an employee was an unfair dismissal or not, it shall be for the employer to show that the dismissal resulted wholly or mainly from one or more of the matters specified in Section 6(4) or that there were other substantial grounds justifying the dismissal.  The Acts further provide that in determining if a dismissal is an unfair dismissal, regard may be had, if the Rights Commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Circuit Court, as the case may be, consider it appropriate to do so to, amongst other things, the reasonableness of the conduct of the employer in relation to the dismissal.  Each case is adjudicated upon on its merits and the facts of the case.</p><p>  An employee who has been dismissed may take a case under the Acts within 6 months of the date of dismissal (this can be extended to 12 months in exceptional circumstances).  To qualify to take a case under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, an employee is normally expected to have at least one year&rsquo;s continuous service with the employer, with some exceptions.  Where a dismissal is found to be unfair, redress may take the form of either financial compensation, re-engagement or re-instatement, depending on which form of redress the adjudicatory body considers appropriate, having regard to all the circumstances of a case.</p><p>  A claim under the Acts may be submitted initially to either a Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  An application to either of these bodies may be made using the &ldquo;Single Complaint Form&rdquo; which is available at website www.workplacerelations.ie.</p></reply>

This investment is critical to support Ireland&rsquo;s Innovation ecosystem, to ensure we are an attractive location for investment and to develop high value human capital for our economy. In addition to these benefits the commercialisation of research represents one of the most direct ways a return from this investment can be seen and this return is most recognisably evidenced by the number of commercially valuable technologies transferred from the higher education sector to industry and the number of spinout companies created that are based on academic research. Enterprise Ireland is the State agency with responsibility for the commercialisation of all research funded in the State. Enterprise Ireland employs two main approaches in commercialising Irish research; it funds the commercialisation &amp;amp; technology transfer infrastructure in the State and it operates a commercialisation funding programme.</p><p>The aim of the technology transfer infrastructural support is to increase the level and quality of Intellectual Property (IP) from research, and to help create effective systems to transfer this valuable knowledge into companies in Ireland. This transfer of technology to companies results in the creation of new products, processes and services which can be scaled-up for export. Enterprise Ireland supports technology transfer through its Technology Transfer Strengthening Programme (TTSI), which supports the Technology Transfer Offices in the third levels sector in bringing fresh ideas from the research environment to the attention of existing industry in a useable format. A review of the initial TTSI programme is due to be completed early this year. Results to date show that this programme has performed well.  In 2005, before Enterprise Ireland technology transfer support existed, 12 technologies were licensed to industry. This figure has increased significantly since then, with 119 licenses to industry in 2013. The second phase of the Technology Transfer Strengthening Programme (TTSI 2) was launched in 2012. TSSI 2 is a &euro;22 million initiative (&euro;5.5 million per annum from 2013-2016), which will significantly boost interaction between industry and higher education institutions. This work represents a key part of the process of unlocking the creative potential of researchers to support innovation in industry, leading to jobs and economic growth. Building on the investment to date, the overall objectives of phase 2 of the Technology Transfer Strengthening Initiative are to develop the Irish technology transfer system such that it will respond quickly and flexibly to industry, deliver direct economic benefits, and radically enhancing the culture of commercialisation among researchers in the Irish HEI sector. The table below outlines the outputs of the TTSI Programme since its establishment.<table><tr><th>-</th><th>-</th><th><div>Technology Transfer Strengthening Initiative Programme in place</div></th><th><div>Technology Transfer Strengthening Initiative Programme in place</div></th><th><div>Technology Transfer Strengthening Initiative Programme in place</div></th><th><div>Technology Transfer Strengthening Initiative Programme in place</div></th><th><div>Technology Transfer Strengthening Initiative Programme in place</div></th><th>-</th><th><div>-</div></th></tr><tr><td>Metrics</td><td>2006</td><td>2007</td><td>2008</td><td>2009</td><td>2010</td><td>2011</td><td>2012</td><td>2013 </td></tr><tr><td>Licence/ Option Assignment</td><td>28</td><td>56</td><td>67</td><td>100</td><td>93</td><td>118</td><td>87</td><td>119</td></tr><tr><td>Spin Outs</td><td>3</td><td>13</td><td>7</td><td>35</td><td>31</td><td>31</td><td>15</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Invention Disclosures</td><td>193</td><td>271</td><td>407</td><td>457</td><td>431</td><td>402</td><td>373</td><td>435</td></tr><tr><td>Patents Applications</td><td>107</td><td>124</td><td>202</td><td>148</td><td>101</td><td>141</td><td>113</td><td>119</td></tr></table></p><p>A further initiative to support commercialisation and technology transfer is the establishment of Knowledge Transfer Ireland (KTI) - the new name for the central Technology Transfer Office. The KTI is headed by Dr Alison Campbell, who was appointed as Director in September 2013.  The formal launch of the KTI and web portal is planned for later this month. The KTI will make it easier for companies to access and use ideas developed through publicly-funded research and to develop new products and services and ultimately create jobs and exports. The KTI will also ensure that the IP Protocol launched in 2012 is delivering to the needs of business and stakeholders. The remit of the KTI will include promoting, enabling and monitoring HEI/business engagement across a wide range of intellectual assets. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Commercialisation Fund Programme aims to improve the competitiveness of the Irish economy through the creation of technology based start-up companies and the transfer of innovations developed in Higher Education Institutes and Research Performing Organisations to industry in Ireland. The programme funds the development of innovations at all stages of the commercial pipeline to the point where they can be commercialised.</p><p>The following number of projects received support from the Commercialisation Fund in each of the last three years:</p><p>- 2011: 65 projects</p><p>- 2012: 105 projects</p><p>- 2013: 64 projects</p><p>The number of academic-industry research collaborations is also a relevant indicator of commercialisation performance in the system. In 2013, Ireland was ranked 13th out of 132 countries in the 2012/13 Global Competitiveness Report. This improvement is driven by Government policy and by ongoing Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation programmes aimed at driving collaboration. In 2013, EI supported 839 collaborative innovations between industry and third level. This figure is comprised of the redeemed Innovation Voucher figure, the Technology Gateway projects, Innovation Partnerships and supported FP7 collaborative projects. When this is added to the circa 300 companies in Technology Centres, this gives a figure of over 1,100 companies were engaged in collaborative research projects in 2013 via Enterprise Ireland schemes. In 2013, SFI researchers were involved in over 1,000 linkages with industry working directly with over 700 companies. This represents a significant increase over the 2010 figure of 534 and the 2009 figure of 389.</p><p>Ireland is scoring top of the class in Europe in terms of knowledge transfer. In the European Commission Knowledge Transfer Study 2010-2012 (published June 2013) Ireland is ranked first (out of 23 countries) in terms of knowledge transfer performance of public research organisations in individual countries. Ireland has also been ranked third in the EU according to the new &quot;Indicator of Innovation Output&quot; which measures the extent to which ideas from innovative sectors are able to reach the market, providing better jobs and making Europe more competitive. This provides strong evidence that our research investment is delivering on economic growth and the jobs agenda.</p></reply>

An Executive style Board has also been put in place in Forf&aacute;s to oversee the transfer of the agency&rsquo;s functions and responsibilities.<br /><br /><br />A number of decisions that did not require legislation have already been implemented including:<br /><br />-the reduction of the Board of Forf&aacute;s from 13 members to 6 to oversee the orderly hand-over of Forf&aacute;s&rsquo; functions;<br /><br />-the transfer of the facilities, property management and reception/switchboard services from Forf&aacute;s to IDA Ireland in July 2013.</td><td>If Forfas had a full complement (13) of Board members as provided for under the legislation, the anticipated Board Fees in a full year would be &euro;98,000 (approx). As a consequence of the reduction in Board numbers in 2012, the expenditure on Board fees in 2013 was &euro;21,000, indicating a saving of &euro;77,000 in 2013.  As Forfas is likely to be dissolved mid year 2014, the Forfas Board will no longer exist and the anticipated saving in 2014 would be approximately &euro;88,000.</td></tr><tr><td>Transfer relevant enterprise functions from Shannon Development to IDA, EI and Bord F&aacute;ilte and merge Shannon Development with Shannon Airport</td><td>Shannon Development&rsquo;s functions and the associated staff in relation to indigenous enterprises and foreign direct investment have been transferred to Enterprise Ireland and IDA respectively.  Shannon Development&rsquo;s functions in relation to tourism including the Regional Tourism Offices have been transferred to F&aacute;ilte Ireland. These changes have been accompanied by the redeployment of staff to other public bodies and the implementation of a voluntary redundancy scheme.  The restructuring of Shannon Development has been completed.  The Government recently approved legislation &quot;State Airports (Shannon Group) Bill 2014&quot; to establish the Shannon Group as part of a drive to establish an International Aviation Services Centre in the mid-west with the aim of delivering new routes and new jobs for the region.</td><td>This is a restructuring and merger of Shannon Development and Shannon Airport.  As Shannon Development is self-financing there will be no cost saving in 2014. There will, however, be an elimination of duplication of roles between Shannon Development, Enterprise Agencies and F&aacute;ilte Ireland in the region.</td></tr><tr><td>Reform of the State&rsquo;s Workplace Relations Services to deliver a simplified two-tier structure comprising a single body of first instance, the Workplace Relations Commission, and a single body of appeal, in effect an enhanced Labour Court</td><td>The process of establishing a new two-tier workplace relations structure is continuing.  A considerable amount of work has been completed on the preparation of the Workplace Relations Bill, which will give statutory effect to the reform proposals.<br /><br /><br />Significant progress has been achieved to date in relation to the technological, structural, administrative and staffing changes required to underpin the Workplace Relations Reform Programme.  Pending the enactment of legislation, my Department has put in place a Single Contact Portal, e-complaint facility, Staffing and Structures Plan, Workplace Relations website and early resolution service, together with enhanced technologies and processes in advance of the enabling legislation.<br /><br /><br />Legislation to give effect to the Workplace Relations Bill is currently on the A list of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme. Drafting of the Bill is at an advanced stage.<br /><br /><br />I propose to publish the Bill before the end of the Spring/Summer D&aacute;il session 2014, with a view to having the proposed new Workplace Relations structures in place during 2014.<br /><br /></td><td>The annual cost of the Workplace Relations Services amounted to just over &euro;20 million in 2010.  It is expected that significant savings, in terms of both reductions in staff numbers and increased efficiency and productivity, will be generated by this Reform Programme.<br /><br /><br />Annual savings of &euro;2 million per annum will be generated. As part of the ongoing service delivery improvements within the Reform Programme the Equality Tribunal is now an intrinsic part of the Workplace Relations grouping within my Department having transferred from the Department of Justice and Equality with effect from 1st January 2013.</td></tr><tr><td>Discover Science and Engineering (DSE) Programme</td><td>In March 2012, responsibility for the DSE Programme transferred from Forf&aacute;s to Science Foundation Ireland (SFI).  The programme is now named SFI Discover</td><td>The transfer of DSE to SFI resulted from synergies between the DSE programme and SFI&rsquo;s outreach programmes, and this transfer of responsibility was not by itself expected to generate cost savings. The integration of these programmes has achieved economies of scale, minimised duplication of effort, and contributed to operational efficiencies.</td></tr><tr><td>Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser (CSA) to the Government</td><td>The Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser was included in the bodies due for critical review under the Public Sector Reform initiative. Following a Government decision in October 2012 to abolish the separate Office of the CSA, the Director General of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) took responsibility for the role of Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government in addition to his existing role and co-terminous with his tenure as Director General of SFI. </td><td>There is an annual savings of &euro;120,000 arising from this efficiency. </td></tr></table></p><p>In addition, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that, following enactment of the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act 2012, Microfinance Ireland was established as a private limited company in August 2012, as a subsidiary of the Social Finance Foundation and has charitable status. Microfinance Ireland has been funded by the Government to provide loans to newly established and growing microenterprises across all industry sectors that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.</p></reply>

The Minister for Finance also announced that a separate levy of 0.15% will apply to all pension fund assets to continue to help fund the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>, including the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate in the hospitality sector <i>and</i>to make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties.</p><p>Any requirement relating to a State liability arising in relation to pension provision will only apply to defined benefit pension schemes in a situations where both the employer and the pension scheme is insolvent (double insolvency).

I see the provisions in the recent legislation as providing a form of insurance and it is not expected that there will be a significant draw on contingency funds available. Rather, the regulatory measures in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act (No.2) 2013 are intended to move underfunded schemes towards an appropriate funding position and further minimise risk requirements to utilise funds raised through the pension levy. In relation to any costs arising before the enactment of the recent legislation, this matter will be considered and determined by the High Court.</p></reply>

However, I can advise that the provision in the trust deed/scheme rules will determine the pension rights of scheme members. Where a pension scheme operates across EU Member States, the employees who are employed in a different Member State (i.e., the host Member State) may be subject to certain provisions (i.e., the social and labour law relevant to the field of occupational pensions) in that Member State which may provide for a different level of protection of pension rights. You will be aware that I have introduced a range of measures in recent years to assist employers and trustees of pension schemes to ensure that pension provision is sustainable and that the rights of scheme members are secure into the future. These concerns have underpinned the recent amendments provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013. In developing this legislation, serious consideration was given to imposing an obligation on employers to secure a minimum level of scheme funding. It was decided not to proceed with such a measure given the current economic circumstances, uncertainties as to the overall impact of such a measure and the potential for unintended consequences. I should advise that the recent changes to the Pension Act are underpinned by additional measures which are being put in place by the Pensions Authority to assist pension schemes achieve a sustainable funding position.</p><p>  The Funding Standard requirements as set out in the Pensions Act require the trustees of a pension scheme to have sufficient resources in the scheme to meet its liabilities in the event of it being wound up. In addition, from 2016 all defined benefit schemes will be required to maintain additional resources in the form of a risk reserve in order to protect the rights of scheme members against future volatility in financial markets.</p></reply>

This meant that all Euro electronic payments due to be processed on Thursday 1 May would not be credited to accounts until Friday 2<sup></sup>May. IPSO encouraged business and consumers to make payments one day earlier on Wednesday 30<sup></sup>April.</p><p>Accordingly, the Department of Social Protection brought all social welfare payments due to be paid via electronic funds transfers to its customers which were due on Thursday 1 May forward to Wednesday 30 April.  All customers due an EFT payment to an account in financial institution on Thursday 1 May received payment on Wednesday 30 of April.  </p><p>I want to emphasise that IPSO did not advise my department to bring forward payments due on Friday 2 May to Wednesday 30 April.  IPSO did advise my department that there would be a &quot;slight delay&quot; to payments on Friday 2 May as a result of the closure of the settlement system a day earlier.  IPSO also advised my department that payments would begin arriving in accounts from early morning.  This department placed notices for customers and staff to this effect on its website.  </p><p>It is very disappointing that despite advices from IPSO that there would be a &quot;slight delay&quot; with EFT payments on Friday 2 May, many of my department's customers and staff experienced substantial delays in receiving their social welfare payments and salary payments on Friday 2 May.  </p><p>I want to emphasise that my department transferred the necessary payment files to its banking provider well in advance of the required timeline to ensure prompt payments to its customers and staff on that date. </p><p>As part of putting in place measures to ensure my department&rsquo;s customers and staff will not experience any other delays in our payments around future bank holidays my department require an understanding as to what exactly happened in the inter-bank payment system on Friday 2 May which gave rise to the significant payment delays that occurred on that day.  The department has written to the Chief Executive Officer of IPSO seeking a clear outline of the reasons for the delays across the payment services of financial institutions on 2 May last.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 77,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. </p><p>The Department continues to monitor trends in the private rental market to determine the impact on rent supplement recipients.  Following the most recent review of the private rental market revised maximum rent limits were introduced from Monday 17 June 2013 until 31 December 2014.  Despite the overall pressures on the social protection budget, there were increases in the rent limits in Dublin, Galway, North Kildare and Bray areas.  </p><p>Any further changes to the rent limits would have to be considered in a budgetary context.  A full rent limit review will be commenced shortly and will be completed in time to feed into the budgetary process.  </p><p>All prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, are now finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties.  The market shows no sign of reaching its equilibrium and increasing the maximum rent limits for rent supplement will not resolve the current difficulties due to the reduced level of supply, and would result in further increases in rental costs for all persons renting including those on reduced incomes and students.  </p><p>The Community Welfare Services, including through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit and the Asylum Seekers &amp;amp; New Communities Unit, works closely with local authorities and other stakeholders to facilitate homeless persons to access private rented accommodation.  This ensures that where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports.  Department officials have discretionary powers to award a supplement where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant and is of an exceptional nature.</p><p>In addition and in view of the current supply difficulties,<b></b>the Dublin local authorities are currently engaging with the Department in finalising a further interagency intervention system to identify vulnerable families who are in receipt of rent supplement and at risk of becoming homeless due to the imminent loss of their tenancy to ensure that the necessary supports can be put in place.  These cases will be assessed on an individual basis having regard to the individual circumstances and families requiring additional support will receive the necessary assistance, financial or otherwise. </p><p>The Department is represented on the Homelessness Implementation Team, chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which will ensure greater integration between the key agencies involved in the area of homelessness as recommended by the First Report of the Homelessness Oversight Group. </p><p>The Department's strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short term income support.  In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities.  Officials in the Department are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in piloting HAP in Limerick City and County Council with further roll out to a further six selected local authorities during the year. </p></reply>

Once the child reaches 16 years of age and entitlement to domiciliary care allowance ceases, a review of the continuing entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance is undertaken as medical eligibility is no longer automatically satisfied and must be confirmed.  This resulted in a review in this case.  Following that review carer&rsquo;s allowance was stopped on 20th November 2013 in respect of the care recipient in question as it was decided that the medical criteria were no longer satisfied. </p><p>  The person in question submitted additional medical evidence in support of their application.  This evidence was reviewed but the decision remained unchanged.  The person in question was notified of this decision on the 23rd January 2014 the reason for it and of her right of appeal.  The person concerned has appealed the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  An appeals submission will be prepared and the file and papers will be referred to the Social Welfare Appeals Office for determination as soon as possible. </p></reply>

The allowance is subject to a means test and is paid only to those who live alone or with certain exempted people. </p><p>  The electricity or gas allowance of &euro;35 per month is also paid to 410,000 customers at an estimated cost of &euro;230 million in 2014.  This allowance is subject to a means test for those aged under 70 and is also paid only to those who live alone or with certain exempted people.</p><p>  In addition, a person living alone and in receipt of a pension, a widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s payment or a disability payment from the Department may be entitled to the living alone allowance of &euro;7.70 per week.  </p><p>  Older people approaching pension age in receipt of long-term jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (15 months or more in payment) may be entitled to fuel allowance.  If they are in receipt of a widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s payment or a disability payment they may be eligible for fuel allowance and household benefits subject to meeting the qualifying criteria for these schemes.  I am not in a position to extend the criteria for these schemes or the current value of the allowances.</p><p>  There is a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of our environment and solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels.  Given the environmental impact, it is important that they be taxed accordingly so as to encourage people to use other cleaner fuels.</p><p>  It is recognised in the Government&rsquo;s Energy Affordability Strategy that the best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme, administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty.  Measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation, and are free of charge to the customer.</p></reply>

The programme is funded by the Department with day-to-day management of contracts undertaken by Pobal.  Contract holders must deliver tangible services that are capable of generating non-public revenues from their operations by way of charging fees, sales and/or fundraising and other public funds.  The programme is not intended to represent full-funding for any operation. Some &euro;45 million has been provided for the programme in 2014.</p><p>  Each contract holder is responsible for their own budgets, income, financial and other liabilities.  Contracts are generally offered on a three-year cycle based on a business plan or similar submitted by the company.  Continued funding is subject to satisfactory compliance with the programme&rsquo;s operational requirements, financial position of the company, continued eligibility of the company and service, progress on delivery of the stated objectives in the business plan, and an assessment of a business plan for the following three year contact cycle.  A regular review process is undertaken to ensure compliance with contract obligations, audit issues, continuing capacity of the organisation to manage public funds, the need for and quality of service delivery, sustainability, and value for money.</p><p>  This company mentioned by the Deputy is involved in the provision of a range of services for older people in Mullingar.  The company receives a funding contribution to employ a full time manager post and three and a half full-time equivalent posts valued at &euro;98,616 pa.  The operations were reviewed as part of a re-contracting process undertaken by Pobal in respect of proposed activities for the period 2014-16.  The process involved the submission of business plans by the company and an evaluation of performance by Pobal before recommendations were made to the Department.  The business plan submitted by the company was considered weak and did not articulate the need for the service or the value to be gained from the expenditure of public funds.  Contrary to the requirements of the programme, the company&rsquo;s business plan was predicated on near full reliant on CSP to fund its activities.  The company is unable to generate sufficient income to fund overhead and activity costs</p><p>  In the circumstances, the Department considered that the expenditure of public funds could no longer be justified.  The company was advised of the outcome of the evaluation of the business plan.  Pobal staff met with this company on the 5th of March to give feedback on why the decision was made.  While the company was also given the opportunity to lodge a review of the decision, they have not done so to date. The contract with the programme is due to conclude at the end of June 2014.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 77,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. </p><p>  For all counties, major urban population centres were tested to ensure access to housing while also ensuring value for money for the State. The Department used information from tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) to analyse actual costs in each county. The purpose of the rent limit review is to ensure availability and not to provide access to housing in all areas. Despite pressures on the social protection budget, there were increases in the rent limits in some areas, including Dublin and Galway, and reductions or no change in others. The limits for Roscommon reflected the respective prevailing rental markets and analysis shows that there are properties available within these limits.  I have no plans to introduce revised limits for South Roscommon. </p><p>  Any further changes to the rent limits would have to be considered in a budgetary context. A full rent limit review will be commenced shortly and will be completed in time to feed into the budgetary process.  </p><p>  The Department continues to monitor trends in the private rental market and officials have considerable experience in dealing with customers of the scheme and continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.</p></reply>

The board of the Pensions Authority will consist of a Chairperson and two officials from the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Finance.  The change from the 17 person Pensions Board to the Pensions Authority has realised savings of approx. &euro;100,000.</p><p>  - Under the strengthened arrangements, the Pensions Board was renamed the Pensions Authority to better reflect its key role of safeguarding the pensions of occupational pension scheme members and also the provision of information on occupational pensions. </p><p>  - A separate unpaid Pensions Council will be established to advise the Department on matters of pension&rsquo;s policy which will strengthen governance of occupational pensions and give consumers greater input into pensions policy.</p><p>  In relation to the Pensions Ombudsman, the Report recommended that this office be merged with the Financial Service Ombudsman and arrangements in relation to the implementation of this recommendation are under consideration.</p></reply>

In recent years, the Government has been represented at war memorial ceremonies in Dublin, Belfast and other centres marking the Battle of the Somme in July and the Armistice in November.The government has also been represented at the annual commemorations taking place on the Somme &ndash; participating at the international commemoration at Thiepval and the special commemorations of the 16th (Ulster) Division at the Ulster Tower and the 10th (Irish) Division at Guillemont.   As the Deputy will be aware, annual commemorations of national losses in the World War are organised by embassies and communities in Ireland, notably Australia, New Zealand and Germany.  I believe that special arrangements for official representation at such events would be appropriate in the centenary years of the World War and I attended at the ANZAC commemoration on 25 April.</p><p>Arrangements are being made to mark the anniversary of the start of the war in early August with a special service of prayer.  A memorial &quot;Cross of Sacrifice&quot; at Glasnevin cemetery will be dedicated to the memory of all Irish soldiers lost in the war and particularly those laid to rest there.  This cross is a welcome addition to the comprehensive and inclusive representation of Irish history on the site and is brought forward in partnership between Glasnevin Trust and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.</p><p>The National Museum of Ireland hosted a conference at Collins Barracks on 1 February on &lsquo;<i>Remembering World War One in Europe, 1914-2014</i>&rsquo; and the National Gallery of Ireland arranged an extensive programme of events commencing on 1 March with a <i>Study Day on War Artists</i>, followed on 2 March by a consideration of <i>War Poetry and Images of the First World War</i>.  In addition, the Hugh Lane Gallery is planning an exhibition for later this year.</p><p>I welcome also the contributions to the commemorative programme from colleges where conferences are being organised to present research and stimulate consideration of the centenary of the war.  One example, the programme prepared by the School of History at University College Cork earlier this year addressed themes such as media, culture, religion, conscription, politics, society and legacy. As Minister, I participated at the conference and was delighted that the programme included a keynote address from the British Minister, Dr Andrew Murrison MP, who addressed important issues of purpose, direction and tone in official commemoration of the war.</p></reply>

This initiative provides advice and guidance on the management of a range of invasive species, which can negatively impact on the environment and on property on the island of Ireland. Information and general guidance is provided in respect of species such as Rhododendron. This project is expected to be renewed in partnership with NIEA this year.  In 2008, my Department produced, as part of the series of Irish Wildlife Manuals, a comprehensive guide to the management of Rhododendron on nature conservation sites. This publication is available on .

Regulation 50 of the Regulations, which include provisions relating to the banning for sale of invasive species listed in the Schedule to the Regulations, is not yet in effect.  This is due to the necessity for risk assessments to be carried out on invasive species which are subject to trade before this element of the Regulations can be brought into force. Such risk assessments are presently ongoing and, indeed, draft assessments for many of the species, including Rhododendron, are now available to view on the project site: It should also be noted that three public consultation meetings have been scheduled for the week beginning 19 May and further details in this regard are available on the website. I expect to be in a position to bring the relevant provisions of the Regulations into force during the summer.</p></reply>

In 2014 the Heritage Council, which my Department funds, re-instated its community grants scheme. It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to allocate its funding appropriately given competing priorities within the heritage sector.  I understand that the application deadline for funding under the Heritage Council&rsquo;s community grants scheme has passed for 2014.  However, the organisation in question should contact the Heritage Council directly to ascertain their eligibility for funding under any of the Council&rsquo;s programmes now, or in the future.  In addition, I understand that in certain circumstances some local authorities may also offer funding in this regard.   As with the Heritage Council, it is a matter for the local authorities in question to allocate their funding appropriately.  I suggest that the organisation contact Dublin City Council directly to ascertain their eligibility for funding from that source.</p><p>My Department also funds targeted initiatives for music which are channelled through Music Network. These include a national music day and a national music instrument scheme. Love: Live Music Day, the national music day, is an annual celebration of all forms of music in Ireland. It aims to promote access to live music for all, regardless of location through free nationwide music events. The musical instrument scheme operated by Music Network assists individuals and groups to purchase musical instruments. Further details are available at.</p></reply>

Some of those measures related to a certain number of the bodies funded from my Department's Vote Group. In this regard, my Department conducted a critical examination of the structure and operation of the institutions included in the Public Service Reform Plan and developed a comprehensive and practical approach to the implementation of the various Government Decisions in this area. This was endorsed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  An overall total of &euro;20 million in savings was targeted in the Public Service Reform Plan from enhanced service efficiencies and value-for-money.  It is expected that approximately &euro;1 million of this will be achieved initially across the institutions involved in the reform programme which are funded from my Department's Vote Group, with further savings to be identified as the various cost saving measures are implemented.</p><p>In the immediate term, savings are being made primarily in three ways:</p><p>-  Through the ending of payments to Chairpersons and members of boards or advisory councils;</p><p>-  Through a programme of shared services between institutions, including, for example, in retail, security, marketing, procurement and storage; and</p><p>-  Through the provision of services by my Department to some institutions, including human resources services and financial services, thus relieving those institutions of the need to incur a cost in accessing these services.</p><p>In that regard, the functions of Culture Ireland were merged fully into my Department during 2013 and the Board was replaced with an Expert Committee whose members provide their time on a pro bono basis.  In addition, the term of office of the Placenames Commission expired in October 2012 and was replaced by an Expert Committee which also operates on a <i>pro bono</i>basis.</p><p>Furthermore, a formal Framework for Co-operation and Improved Services between the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Crawford Art Gallery was developed and endorsed by Government.  Arising from that, the three Galleries signed a formal Service Level Agreement outlining a number of specific measures to share a number of services across the three Institutions.  Legislation has been prepared to give effect to these changes and to reduce the number on boards, enshrine pro bono service and also gender equality on each board.</p><p>In December 2013, a new Human Resources Shared Services Unit was established in my Department to provide HR support to the National Museum of Ireland. Work is continuing between the National Museum of Ireland, the National Library of Ireland and the National Archives of Ireland to improve co-operation between these institutions and to progress shared services.  Legislation to formally enact these changes and changes to board structure is being progressed.  I am satisfied that this programme of change has made a significant contribution to achieving the savings targets set out in the Public Service Reform Plan, while at the same time enhancing the operations of the bodies concerned.</p></reply>

The budget allocated each year to this programme by IFI subsidises these fisheries for the benefit of the communities in which they reside.  The closure of Lough Caum, while unfortunate from a tourism and local angling viewpoint, was necessary due to reduced funding for the &lsquo;Managed Community Rainbow Trout fisheries&rsquo; programme for 2014. As all lakes are stocked from the rearing-on facility at Inchigeela on a weekly basis, the cost of continuing to stock Lough Caum, which is the furthest lake away from this facility, is prohibitive.</p></reply>

Under the 2011 Act, An Post is statutorily required, as the designated universal service provider, to provide a universal postal service.

The companies referred to by the Deputy are not designated universal service providers and do not accordingly come under the same provisions of the 2011 Act as An Post.</p><p>  The Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011 requires that any person who is providing or intending to provide a postal service shall, before doing so, make a notification to the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).

ComReg has concluded that &ldquo;Document Exchange&rdquo; and &ldquo;Express and Courier services&rdquo; and the delivery of unaddressed advertising material lack certain constituent features by which to be deemed &ldquo;postal services&rdquo;.

The findings of the Department's field tests are the subject of formal response by &ldquo;3&rdquo; and remedial measures are taken, where necessary, to ensure that all NBS customers enjoy the quality of broadband service foreseen in the NBS contract.

My officials operate a dedicated NBS mailbox, which NBS customers can contact by email at , with any comments or complaints they may have about their NBS service.

This will be achieved by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>During the preparation of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce report, which concluded its deliberations in 2012, service providers noted the importance of planning and consent processes in facilitating the roll out of infrastructure to support the provision of telecommunications services. I would point out that the Local Authority has a strong role to play in facilitating the roll-out of the necessary infrastructure to help enable service availability throughout the Country. In the case of County Kerry, I note that the County Development Plan recommends against siting a mast within 1km of dwellings. I understand that this is contributing to difficulties in providing good quality broadband and telecommunications services generally in the county.</p><p>The Government's National Broadband Plan which I subsequently published, commits to addressing barriers to deployment in order to maximise investment by the commercial sector and assist in enhancing the quality of services. Local Authorities have an important role to play in this regard, particularly in facilitating the provision of infrastructure that supports wireless and fixed line services.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. For example:</p><p>-  Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps. Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4m addresses by 2016.</p><p>-  UPC has invested over &euro;500m in upgrading its cable network. Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps. Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps.</p><p>-  ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure. It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage. The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks.</p><p>-  Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction. There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements.</p><p>-  Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband.</p><p>-  The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.</p><p>Of the estimated 2.3 million premises in Ireland, approximately 1.4m are expected to be served by these commercial next generation broadband services over the coming years.</p><p>This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas.</p><p>On 25 April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.</p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. Currently I envisage that a total of 59 areas in County Kerry will be included in the proposed fibre build-out. The list is available on my Departments website .</p><p>In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre roll out may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive.  Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention. A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised. It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015 with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in the areas that require intervention as quickly as possible.</p><p>The EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on state aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude member states from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard it is noted that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 33 fibre-based broadband networks in County Kerry, which includes rolling out those services in Beaufort by July 2016.  I fully share the concerns of local representatives about the quality of broadband in rural areas. I intend to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component. In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21st century.</p></reply>

The market has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.

Medium term savings are likely to be achievable in the areas of common back office functions such as HR, conventional (non-specialised) IT systems, Financial Management and Corporate Services. There may also be potential savings in the areas of accommodation and software licences. In the longer term, greater efficiencies/synergies in delivery of the merged organisation&rsquo;s services may lead to further savings in operational areas.

The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 assigns responsibility for the independent economic regulation of Irish Water to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). In performing this role, the CER must ensure, inter alia, that Irish Water provides water services in an economical and efficient manner, that it operates in a commercially viable manner and that it can meet all reasonable demands for water, both current and foreseeable. </p><p>As part of their role, the CER will approve a water charges plan submitted by Irish Water. The CER has commenced the process leading to the submission of the first water charges plan of Irish Water, with public consultation underway on the approach to tariff structures and design. They plan to engage in public consultation on Irish Water&rsquo;s proposed water charges plan and the underlying operational and capital costs in June 2014. As part of this process, the detailed costs and revenue proposals for Irish Water for the first regulatory period to end 2016 will be outlined. Details of the public consultation plans of the CER are set out on their website ().   </p><p>As the free allowance and the level of funding to be provided by the Government to Irish Water will have a strong bearing on the net charges to be met by households, recent Government decisions on these matters provide greater visibility on the expected level of charges in advance of the final determination of all aspects of the water charges plan by the CER. The Government have decided to provide the following funding to Irish Water in 2015 and 2016:</p><p>-  An average subvention of &euro;537m in each of the two years, conditional on the annual average domestic water charges to end 2016 for households with both supply of water and treatment of waste water not exceeding &euro;240; and</p><p>-  Provision of just over &euro;400m in 2015 and 2016 to support increased investment in public water services, including the provision of a &ldquo;first fix scheme&rdquo; by Irish Water.   </p><p>The Government decisions on levels of funding and the approach to free allowance were informed a high level financial model prepared by NewERA, which was based on inputs provided by my Department and Irish Water. This model envisages that the total amount to be billed to domestic customers in 2015 will be approximately &euro;300 million, which factors in properties with only one service and holiday homes. The high level funding model is based on average operational costs, excluding interest costs and depreciation, over the period 2014 to 2016, estimated to be in the range of &euro;775m to &euro;800m per annum. The proposed operational costs by Irish Water will be the subject of careful scrutiny by the CER to ensure that only efficient costs are incurred. Similarly, they will review the proposed capital plans of Irish Water, which entail almost &euro;1.8 billion in proposed capital projects over the 3 year period, as well as the metering programme and establishment costs. Irish Water are considering the appropriate financing package to fund these costs, taking into account the capital funding which will amount to just over &euro;640m over the period 2014-2016, in addition to the operational subvention. The detailed plans in this regard will form part of the water charges plan, which will be published by the CER for public consultation in June 2014.   </p><p>Irish Water&rsquo;s Water Charges Plan as approved by the CER will take account of these Government Decisions and nisterial policy directions. This plan will provide the detailed position on costs and proposed revenues from different sources, and will have to be developed on the understanding that the average annual tariff for domestic customers with both supply of water and treatment of waste water will not exceed &euro;240. The CER will announce its decision on the approved water charges plan in August 2014. </p><p>It is proposed that from its inception, Irish Water should be classified as a Market Corporation under Eurostat rules and, as a result, will not, other than in relation to Government operating subvention, be included in the calculation of the General Government Balance. This is determined through the application of the Market Corporation Test which requires that income from customers (ex VAT where applicable) be greater than 50% of production costs (including consumption of fixed capital and including interest). The operational subvention agreed by Government for 2015 and 2016 is set in this context and represents just under 50% of the anticipated production costs of Irish Water. </p><p>This funding package for 2015 and 2014 builds on the funding being provided to Irish Water in 2014, which includes a proposed &euro;240 million equity investment from the Central Fund which subject to Eurostat confirmation would not impact the General Government Deficit as this amount would be treated as an acquisition of equity rather than a capital transfer. The investment will be used to primarily fund the core capital expenditure programme of Irish Water.     </p><p>In addition, Irish Water will receive a subvention of &euro;486.5 million from the Local Government Fund in 2014 which will fund water related expenditures incurred heretofore by local authorities and met by local authorities from their own resources, non-domestic water charge revenues and general purpose grants from the Fund. It is anticipated that Irish Water will finance other costs from non-domestic water charge revenues of some &euro;190m and from borrowing, which will be the subject of appropriate nisterial consents in due course. As subvention and equity provision is based on funding provided to Irish Water, a breakdown by county of proposed expenditure is not available. </p><p>The first regulatory cycle is viewed as an interim regulatory cycle, with a full six year regulatory cycle to commence from 2017.  The CER will engage in full and detailed public consultation on the proposed water charges plan, and associated costs and revenues of Irish Water well in advance of that cycle commencing. As it is anticipated that Government subvention to Irish Water will continue beyond 2016, decisions will have to be made in a budgetary context on the level of Government support to Irish Water beyond 2016.   </p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.    </p><p>Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulation, 20 14 , a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied is wholesome and clean. Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health, and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with these regulations.      </p><p>In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in these Regulations, the water supplier will investigate the cause and, in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health may exist, the Health Service Executive, ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken. </p><p>The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 requires the CER to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of the customers of Irish Water. This is similar to the CER&rsquo;s statutory role in respect of the gas and electricity sectors. I fully expect that the CER will consider compliance with statutory standards by Irish Water in the discharge of its functions.   </p><p>The Government has decided, following consideration of proposals in relation to the funding model for Irish Water and taking account of the work of the Inter-Departmental Working Group, which was established to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing affordability issues which may arise with the introduction of domestic water charges , to provide a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply. The Government has also decided to provide for an additional free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as child benefit, such that water charges will in effect only apply to adults in such households. The normal consumption is estimated at 38,000 litres annually per child of water supplied and waste water treated and so the allowance being provided will be up to 38,000 litres per annum. This level of consumption will be verified over time through actual data from metering. There are no plans to provide additional allowances, other than those announced in the Government decision.   </p><p>I intend to use my powers under the Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 to issue a policy direction to the CER in relation to a number of matters relating to domestic water charges, including to ensure the water charges plan makes provision for circumstances where the quality of water services provided by Irish Water to customers is impaired or where services are reduced or restricted (e.g. customers with boil water notices). I also intend to provide   in the policy direction that for social and environmental reasons, there will be no standing charge for domestic customers . Owners of holiday homes who are customers of Irish Water will be required to pay water charges when they ar e introduced in October 2014 ; while there will be no standing charge, a minimum charge may apply to properties such as holiday homes which are not permanently occupied . Currently, if holiday homes are used commercially, they are already subject to non-domestic water charges.   </p><p>The approach to charging will be outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan to be submitted by it to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. The CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plan which will set the approaches to charging domestic and non-domestic customers . Irish Water funding will be conditional on the average charge for households being &euro;240 per year   . </p><p>In making its decision on the approval or otherwise of the first water charges plan, the CER will take into account the decisions made by Government on th e funding model for Irish Water and the policy direction issued under the Water Services (No.2) Act . The tariffs for 2015 and 2016 will be announced by the CER in August 2014.  It is estimated that Irish Water will have some 1.35 million domestic customers and the projected bills for different customers will depend on the volumetric charges and assessed charges set by the CER within the parameters of the Government decisions. </p><p>The CER has already undertaken public consultations on the development of the economic regulatory framework for water services . It   is also carrying out a number of public consultations on the water charges plan.   Currently, consultation is taking place on the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs for both metered and unmetered properties and the draft Irish Water customer handbook . Further consultations are planned for June in relation to other aspects of the water charges plan to be submitted to the CER by Irish Water. Full details of the CER&rsquo;s public consultation plans are available on its website ().</p></reply>

The rates of duty currently applicable to the quarterly and half-yearly payments are 28.25% and 55.5% of the annual rate, respectively. These relativities have remained generally constant since the 1960s.   </p><p>Tax rates for n on-annual transactions take account of the extra workload for the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF) and motor tax offices, and the resultant higher administrative and printing costs.

Details regarding the review are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following web link:</p><p>www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/Housing/PublicConsultations/ </p><p> I expect to be in a position to finalise future policy approaches and actions in relation to affordable housing in the near future. Under the shared ownership scheme, a house is acquired by a local authority and leased to a shared owner, who purchases at least 40% of the value of the house and rents the remaining equity from the local authority. The local authority finances the transaction by borrowing from the Housing Finance Agency. The shared owner must purchase full ownership within 25 years. The Pre 2003 Index Linked Loan was introduced in 1991.  The loan is split between annuity and rental portions.  The annuity loan is repaid on the prevailing variable interest and capital basis.  Rent is charged at 4.3% on the rental equity balance.  The rental equity balance is adjusted in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) each year.</p><p>  In January 2003, the Shared Ownership scheme was changed for all loans taken out from that date.  The loan continues to be split between annuity and rental portions.  Again, the annuity loan is repaid on the prevailing variable interest and capital basis.  Post 2003, rent was charged as follows: </p><p>  - Rental Equity is treated as a capital loan </p><p>  - The Rental Equity reduces or increases according to the amount of rent paid over the amount payable on the going interest rate.  </p><p>  - Initially rent is charged at 4.3% on the rental equity balance   and is increased by 4.5% on 1 July each year thereafter. </p><p> The rent is used to repay the cost of the local authority equity to the Housing Finance Agency and, depending on the level of mortgage interest rates obtaining, may also increase or decrease the capital outstanding on the local authority share at the end of each year. These arrangements represent a significant improvement on the previous terms of the scheme for the shared owner.  The main differences in the schemes are in the treatment of the rental equity. In the Pre 2003 scheme, the   rental equity balance is index linked to the CPI. In the Post 2003 scheme, the rental equity balance is treated as a capital loan and can be paid down over time if the rent repayments exceed the interest amount due.</p></reply>

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake t he metering programme.

The 2013 Act also provides that, for the purposes of the domestic metering programme, Irish Water is exempt from the requirement to obtain the consent of the relevant local authority. </p><p>Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that the meters it has procured comply with all relevant European and international standards designed to protect the health and safety of customers and the public.  Irish Water has also confirmed to my Department that it has a Quality Management System in place designed in accordance with the ISO 9001 standard. Additionally the regional contractors working for and on behalf of Irish Water on the metering programme all have Quality Management Systems designed in accordance with the ISO 9001 standard.</p><p>In designing the technical specification for the Metering Capital Programme, Irish Water has drawn both from international standards and from extensive local experience of the installation of both Grade B and Grade C meter box covers over the last 12 years.   Irish Water monitors the installations by its contractors and can require the installation of a Grade B meter box if it is deemed necessary. Irish Water regularly undertakes technical reviews of the metering programme with the aim of making improvements. </p><p>With effect from 1 January 2014, Irish Water is responsible for public water services. The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  Section 71 of the Water Services Act 2007 provides that Irish Water may require any consumer of water to take such supply through a water meter. Section 21 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall not disconnect the supply of water to a household. However, Irish Water may reduce the supply of water to a property, where charges remain unpaid.</p><p>The 2013 Act also requires that Irish Water will prepare codes of practice, on a range of matters, including standards in relation to the performance by Irish Water of its functions and billing by Irish Water of persons in respect of water services provided. Irish Water will also be required to prepare a code of practice on any matter considered necessary by the CER. Consultation is currently being undertaken by the CER on the requirements for Irish Water in relation to the codes of practice, customer charters and terms and conditions. Full details of the CER&rsquo;s public consultation plans are available on its website <i>(</i><i>).</i></p></reply>

Since the late 1980s, close to 25,000 units of accommodation have been provided under capital funding schemes underpinned by 20 and 30 year mortgages. More recently, a scheme was introduced that provides an up-front capital payment of up to 30% of the property value to facilitate AHBs in raising private finance to acquire or build new social housing units. The capital advanced is repayable at the end of a payment and availability agreement, usually after 30 years. </p><p>Under the terms of these various funding schemes, AHBs are the <i>de facto</i>owners of the properties and are required to make them available for social renting for the duration of the mortgage or, as the case may be, the availability agreement.  My Department cannot unilaterally make provision for their sale to tenants. Any such decision would have to involve the AHB concerned and have regard to the mortgage on the property. On expiry of the mortgage period and subject to compliance with the terms of the funding agreement, the AHB becomes the owner of the property. </p><p><i>Building for the Future, a Voluntary Regulation Code</i>was introduced in July 2013 as a precursor to a statutory regulatory framework to support the long-term growth of the AHB sector. Regulation is an important element in providing the conditions necessary for the growth and development of the sector. Financing that growth is equally important and the question of how best to utilise the existing asset base, including the option of selling existing stock to tenants, is a factor to be considered. </p></reply>

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households that are connected to public water supplies.  International evidence has shown that where meters have been installed, significant reductions have been achieved in the level of consumption and this is also borne out by the water savings achieved with metering in the group water sector.  I understand that a comprehensive water conservation programme will be undertaken by Irish Water and will cover the full spectrum of measures including customer awareness and education campaigns about water conservation.     </p><p>I am fully supportive of technologies which contribute to the conservation of water.  Rainwater harvesting has the potential to benefit the environment and contribute to reducing the cost of water services for certain uses.  However, the introduction of a grants scheme for any purpose must be managed within current budgetary constraints and, in so far as the funds administered by my Department are concerned, there are currently no plans to introduce a scheme for the installation of rainwater harvesting systems.     </p></reply>

That means that holdings must (a) meet an average stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare for seven consecutive months and (b) maintain an annual average of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare calculated over the 12 months of the Scheme year. A variety of livestock are eligible for inclusion in the stocking density calculation, including cattle, sheep, horses, goats and deer, in addition to donkeys. Among changes introduced in 2012 to the Terms and Conditions governing the Scheme was the requirement that, where any equines were being included in the stocking calculation, the holdings in question were required to be appropriately registered with my Department as equine premises. However, with the advent of the new Rural Development Programme, due to be adopted later this year, the time may be opportune to examine a number of elements of the Scheme. Any such changes will come into effect from the following Scheme-year, 2015.</p></reply>

These inspections are mandatory and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually.</p><p>  The rate of inspections for cross-compliance is 1% of applicants to whom the Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) and Good Agricultural Environmental Condition (GAEC) apply. However, 3% of farmers must be inspected under the bovine identification and registration requirements while 3% of sheep/goat farmers must be inspected covering 5% of the flock.  </p><p>  EU regulations governing the Cross Compliance regime prescribe a range of penalties to be applied where a non-compliance with the relevant legislative provisions has been identified. Where the non-compliance is due to negligence the penalty is 3%, which can be reduced to 1% or increased to 5% depending on the extent, severity and permanence of the non-compliance. Where the non-compliance is determined as intentional, the standard reduction is 20%, but this can be reduced to 15% or increased to 100% depending on the extent, severity and permanence. </p><p>  While a red or yellow card procedure is not provided for, a tolerance system has been developed and implemented. Where a non-compliance is deemed to be minor in nature, tolerance may be applied resulting in no financial sanction and the applicant is advised to remedy the problem. However, where the minor non-compliance is not remedied within a certain period a penalty of at least 1% is applied. </p><p>  A comprehensive appeal mechanism is also in place in order to protect the interests of farmers who have difficulties with the inspection findings or who consider that the inspection has not been conducted in accordance with legislative requirements. This appeal system incorporates the option for a farmer to initially seek to have the inspection outcome reviewed internally by an officer more senior than the inspecting officer. Where the farmer remains dissatisfied, the decision can be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office and ultimately to the Office of the Ombudsman.   </p></reply>

It broadly describes a range of non-violent crimes that people in positions of responsibility and trust commit for their own personal gain. It can cover fraud, embezzlement, insider trading on the stock market, bribery, corruption and regulatory offences in specialist fields such as financial activity, occupational health and safety, environmental protection, and food safety.  My Department has responsibility for legislation addressing some aspects of white collar crime including fraud and corruption.  Other aspects, such as insider trading, Companies Acts offences and environmental offences fall within the responsibility of other Government Departments.</p><p>There is extensive legislation on the statute book addressing white collar and corporate crime and amendments to this legislation are also considered in the light of the experience of law enforcement agencies such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in operating the legislation and in light of relevant court rulings.  Where there is an identified requirement for additional legislative provisions to further enhance existing provisions in the law, I will not hesitate in bringing forward proposals.  </p><p>I would draw the Deputy's particular attention to the Criminal Justice Act 2011, as a recent example of such developments in white collar crime legislation, and one which represents an important step in delivering on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackle white collar crime.  Its main purpose is to facilitate the more effective investigation of white collar crime and to reduce associated delays.  The Act provides for new procedures to facilitate Garda access to essential information and documentation to assist in current and future investigations of white collar crime.  The Act is targeted at specified serious and complex offences (&ldquo;relevant offences&rdquo;) attracting a penalty of at least 5 years imprisonment, including offences in the areas of banking and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud and corruption. The Act will provide vital assistance to the Garda&iacute; in the completion of current investigations as well as providing assistance to them in investigations undertaken in the future.</p><p>Another recent provision of relevance to white collar crime is Part 5 of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013.  It makes provision for the selection of up to 15 jurors to serve in a criminal trial which is likely to last more than 2 months, with 12 jurors to be selected to consider the verdict.  These provisions, which give effect to a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recent Report on Jury Service, are of relevance to lengthy trials involving fraud or other complex financial matters where there is a risk of jurors becoming unavailable during the course of a protracted trial.</p><p>While the breadth and diversity of the issues faced in addressing serious, organised and white collar crime are such that no one piece of legislation could effectively address it in all its facets, the overall body of legislation in place is comprehensive and, as I have outlined, is continuously under review and development in light of operational experience and other relevant considerations.   <b></b></p><p>In terms of forthcoming legislation, the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2010 will be replaced by the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill which will be published in the coming months.  The Bill will:</p><p>- replace and update the offences of giving and receiving bribes contained in the old legislation</p><p>- address the bribery of foreign public officials</p><p>- provide for the liability of corporate bodies for the corrupt actions of their directors, employees and agents</p><p>- include discrete offences outlawing trading in influence</p><p>- take account of the Mahon Tribunal recommendations to criminalise the making of payments knowingly or recklessly to athird party who intends to use them as bribes</p><p>The Bill is also intended to enhance the ability of the DPP to bring prosecutions by providing presumptions of corrupt gifts or payments such as:</p><p>- where an interested party makes a payment to a public official;</p><p>- where a public official has a lifestyle or property out of proportion to their official income and declared interests; and</p><p>- where an official accepts a gift in breach of ethical or disciplinary codes.</p><p>Penalties of up to 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment and unlimited fines are envisaged for persons convicted on indictment.  It is also intended to allow a judge to order a public official convicted of an offence to forfeit their office and exclude them from seeking public office for a period of years.  These forfeiture provisions will apply to all elected and senior office holders as well as a wide range of civil and public servants.</p></reply>

The GBFI also works closely with other bodies with relevant enforcement functions, but whose legislative and regulatory functions not under my Ministerial remit, including the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Central Bank and the Competition Authority.  </p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that since my recent appointment as Minister I have been reviewing a wide range of issues relevant to serious offending in all its forms, including white collar crime, and I can assure him that I intend to continue to engage regularly with the Garda Commissioner and Ministerial colleagues with a view to ensuring that the necessary resources and measures to respond effectively are in place.  </p></reply>

The manner in which the Bureau operates has come to be viewed, both domestically and internationally, as a very successful model for targeting persons who seek to derive personal gain from criminal activities.  The Deputy will appreciate that the operation of the Bureau itself requires a high degree of specialist staff for its functioning, while the Bureau's operational success across the jurisdiction is linked to the information made available to it from local level.  To support work at local level the Bureau in 2004 established the Divisional Criminal Assets Profiler Programme and has since then utilised the services of trained Criminal Asset Profilers throughout the country.</p><p>  There are currently a total of 172 Garda Divisional Criminal Asset Profilers located across the jurisdiction, together with 19 trained officers of the Revenue Commissioners and 3 trained Department of Social Protection officers.  The role of the Criminal Asset Profilers is to liaise with, and assist the Bureau, in targeting criminal assets located in their local area.  Given the successes of the Bureau and its well developed links with each Garda Division through the operation of the Divisional Criminal Asset Profilers Programme, I can inform the Deputy that there are no proposals to replicate the Bureau structures throughout the jurisdiction.</p></reply>

My Department consulted on the matter with the Law Reform Commission, which had been involved in drafting the 2009 Act, and the Commission took the view that unreasonable interference caused by high trees or hedges was a matter in any particular case for tort law or more generally for planning or environmental law.</p><p>  In England and Wales, for example, the relevant legislation makes provision for local authorities to determine complaints by the owners or occupiers of domestic property who are adversely affected by evergreen hedges over 2 metres high.  Broadly similar legislation involving the local authorities, i.e. the High Hedges Act (Northern Ireland) 2011, came into operation in Northern Ireland on 31 March 2012.  The introduction of such legislation in this jurisdiction would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his Department.</p><p>  The manner in which problems associated with high hedges and trees are resolved in both England and Wales and Northern Ireland demonstrates a clear preference for the resolution of such disputes at local level, with recourse to the courts only as a last resort.  The intention is to reduce the risk of prolonged and costly litigation, and the risk that court proceedings could leave a legacy of bitterness between neighbours and ill-feeling in the local community.</p><p>  It is my intention to bring forward a Mediation Bill to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings, thereby reducing legal costs and speeding up the resolution of disputes.  The legislation, which is currently being drafted, will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence court proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving a dispute before embarking on such proceedings.  It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of proceedings, on its own initiative invite parties to consider mediation and suspend the proceedings to facilitate the mediation process.</p></reply>

Likewise the total number of committals to prison has also risen sharply during the same period, from 11,934 in 2007 to 17,026 in 2012 &ndash; an increase of over 43%.  2013 saw the first significant decrease in prison numbers since 2007.  There were 15,735 committals to prison in 2013 which was a decrease of 7.6% on the 2012 figure.  However given the current number of prisoners in custody - 4,013 on 12 May 2014 - the Irish Prison Service is not in a position to provide single cell accommodation to all prisoners.  Single cell occupancy across the system would result in a bed capacity of approximately 3,200 and would not be possible to achieve without releasing sizeable numbers of prisoners considered to represent a threat to public safety.  However, I can advise the Deputy that on 1st April 2014 almost 50% of all prisoners in custody on that day (4,103) were accommodated in single cell accommodation.  In addition, 1,528 or 37% were accommodated in double occupancy cells with the remainder, (531) accommodated in cells with 3 or more persons.  Of this 56 were accommodated in dormitory style accommodation in Shelton Abbey.  The majority of those housed in double cells are housed in our newer prisons where the cells are larger and conform to the standards for double occupancy as set out by the Inspector of Prisons.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware the Irish Prison Service is in the process of redeveloping all wings in Mountjoy Prison with refurbishment work on the A, B and C Wings now complete.  Following the refurbishment of each wing, all cells are being returned to single occupancy status.  In this regard, the Deputy will note from the figures set out in the table below that on 1 April 2014, 543 prisoners, or 92% of those in custody in Mountjoy prison, were in single cells.  It should be borne in mind that in certain cases prisoners are housed together for reasons other than lack of capacity.  Family members and friends often elect or are assigned a shared cell.  Shared cell accommodation can be very beneficial from a management point of view particularly for those who are vulnerable and at risk of self-harm.  There will always be a need for certain prisoners to be accommodated together.</p><p>As outlined in the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan, it is intended to align the capacity of our prisons with the guidelines laid down by the Inspector of Prisons by 2014, in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.  Details of cell occupancy for all prisons, as requested by the Deputy, is set out in the following table and is reflective of the information available on 1 April 2014.<table><tr><th><div>Prison</div></th><th><div>Number in Custody 01 Apr 2014</div></th><th><div>No of prisoners in single cell</div></th><th><div>No of prisoners in double cell</div></th><th><div>No of prisoners in triple cell</div></th><th><div>No of prisoners in 4+ cells</div></th></tr><tr><td>Arbour Hill</td><td><div>144</div></td><td><div>92</div></td><td><div>40</div></td><td><div>12</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cloverhill</td><td><div>443</div></td><td><div>52</div></td><td><div>58</div></td><td><div>309</div></td><td><div>24</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td><div>234</div></td><td><div>58</div></td><td><div>176</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Castlerea</td><td><div>357</div></td><td><div>127</div></td><td><div>182</div></td><td><div>48</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td><div>264</div></td><td><div>89</div></td><td><div>172</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Loughan</td><td><div>129</div></td><td><div>81</div></td><td><div>48</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td><div>850</div></td><td><div>343</div></td><td><div>472</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>32</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy (M)</td><td><div>587</div></td><td><div>543</div></td><td><div>26</div></td><td><div>18</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy (F)</td><td><div>134</div></td><td><div>59</div></td><td><div>64</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td><div>251</div></td><td><div>180</div></td><td><div>62</div></td><td><div>9</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>St Patrick's</td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Shelton Abbey</td><td><div>110</div></td><td><div>36</div></td><td><div>12</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>56</div></td></tr><tr><td>Training Unit</td><td><div>93</div></td><td><div>93</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wheatfield</td><td><div>501</div></td><td><div>285</div></td><td><div>216</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>4103</div></td><td><div>2044</div></td><td><div>1528</div></td><td><div>414</div></td><td><div>117</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

I can advise the Deputy that the number of prisoners slopping out in the prison system has reduced from 1,003 at the end of 2010 to the current level of 334 (on 1 April 2014), a reduction of 67%.  Of the 334 currently slopping out, 226 prisoners are accommodated in Cork Prison with 46 and 59 prisoners accommodated in Limerick and Portlaoise Prisons respectively.</p><p>In April 2012, the Irish Prison Service published a 3-Year Strategic Plan which included a 40 month capital plan to provide in-cell sanitation in all cells and radically improve prison conditions in the older parts of the prison estate.  The construction of a new prison in Cork, to replace the existing outdated facility, commenced in late January 2014, and is expected to be completed by July of 2015.  Allowing for fit-out, systems commissioning and training of staff, it is expected that the new prison will be ready for operational use by December 2015.  This project marks the largest single investment ever in the prison estate and in these times of continuing financial difficulty it represents a very important commitment on the part of Government to the modernisation of the prison estate and in particular to the elimination of slopping out.</p><p>In addition to the substantial commitment to Cork prison, the modernisation of Mountjoy prison continues with the  refurbishment of the A, B and C wings now complete.  The D wing has been closed to facilitate the final stage of refurbishment and as a result the practice of slopping out is consigned to history in Mountjoy prison.  Every prisoner in Mountjoy now has access to in-cell sanitation.  A contract for the refurbishment work on the D wing will be signed shortly and the works will be completed by March 2015.  Similarly, a Development Plan for Limerick Prison is at an advanced stage and is due for completion by the end of July with a view to the commencement of the development works there on a phased basis starting in late 2015.

The restriction of a prisoner's regime can occur due to a number of factors including, the protection of vulnerable prisoners.  This is provided for under Rule 63 of the Prison Rules 2007 which states that a prisoner may, either at his/her own request or when the Governor considers it necessary, in so far as is practicable and subject to the maintenance and good order and safe and secure custody, be kept separate from other prisoners who are reasonably likely to cause significant harm to him/her.</p><p>The fact that prisoners seeking protection are immediately separated from the general population or from specific prisoners identified as presenting a threat, clearly demonstrates the commitment of the Irish Prison Service to ensure their safety and security.  The status of each prisoner on restricted regime within the prison system is regularly reviewed.  If possible, prisoners can be transferred to other institutions where a restricted regime would not be necessary.</p><p>In addition, the Governor may decide, for the maintenance of good order in the prison, to remove a prisoner from general association or structured activity to reduce the negative effect that a prisoner or prisoners may have on the general population.  This is provided for under Rule 62 of the Prison Rules 2007.  There may also be a smaller number of prisoners who would be restricted for medical (Rule 64) or discipline reasons (Rule 67).  In July last year, the Director General of the Irish Prison Service established a high level group to look at measures which can be introduced to reduce the number of prisoners currently held on restricted regimes with a view to ensuring that all receive, as a minimum standard, out of cell time of 3 hours per day, to engage in exercise or activity.</p><p>Since July 2013, the number of prisoners on a restricted regime has reduced from 339 to 261, a reduction of 23%.  Of the 261 currently on a restricted regime, 228 were for protection reasons (of which 226 were there at their own request).  26 prisoners had there regime restricted on grounds of order (Rule 62).

Pending the development of new facilities in Oberstown in mid 2014, for which the Minister for Children &amp;amp; Youth Affairs has responsibility, this involved the transfer of all 17 year olds serving a sentence in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution to a dedicated Unit in Wheatfield Place of Detention and the transfer of the 18 to 20 year old population to Wheatfield Place of Detention also.  Prisoners continue to be committed for a period of detention to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  They are accommodated in a dedicated committal and assessment unit for up to 24 hours (B Wing).

The Irish Prison Service is continuing to review its priorities for spending in the education budget and is targeting areas of greatest need and best potential outcomes.  We have commenced a process of closer engagement with the Department of Education and the Education and Training Boards in order to bring a more coordinated approach to prison education including reviewing the curriculum being provided to prisoners.</p><p>Educational services are available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies including notably the Education and Training Boards and Public Library Services.  Each Education Centre now has the services of an Art teacher in addition to the 'Artists in Prison Scheme'.  Preparations are currently underway for a prisoner art exhibition which will be held in the Hunt Museum Limerick in late 2014.  This event is held every 2 years and prisoners from throughout the prison estate submit their work in ceramic and paint for display to the general public.  The Irish Prison Service is currently compiling an anthology of prisoner's writing - including prose and poetry - which it is hoped will be published in late 2014.</p><p>The importance of arts and crafts classes for prisoners is fully acknowledged by the Irish Prison Service as these classes are often the initial passage for prisoners to get involved in the education process.  Many prisoners have very negative experiences of education in the community and it is only by attracting them into education units in prisons through these classes that other needs can be identified and addressed.  Last year, the Irish Prison Service received funding from the Arts Council and matched this amount, for the promotion of art in prisons.  The average cost of the programme from 2005 to 2010 was &euro;60,000 annually and <font color="#004080">r</font>egrettably it is not possible in the current economic climate to recommence.</p></reply>

The objective of this scheme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  I understand that certain flexibilities are built into the scheme in an effort to accommodate children with special needs, such as an overage exemption, or waiver, for children with special needs who do not meet the age criteria and the option to avail of the free pre-school year over two years.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year.  However, it works at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some cases, at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible.</p><p>  The HSE&rsquo;s role in supporting children with disabilities involves it working in close co-operation with the disability service providers that it funds, with the education sector, with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and with the parents and families of the children in question.  However, there is a need to strengthen these arrangements.  A dedicated Cross-Sectoral Team, comprising representatives of my Department, the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs plays a key role in fostering greater collaboration on children&rsquo;s disability issues and to build on the cross-sectoral working arrangements that are already in place.  A sub group of this Cross-Sectoral Team has been set up to examine the issues around the integration of children with disabilities into mainstream pre-school settings, building on previous analysis in this area.  Representatives of the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, the Health Service Executive and of the City and County Childcare Committees are members of this group and it is chaired by the Department of Health.  The issue of supports for children with disabilities in mainstream pre-school settings is being looked by this sub-group.  As the particular issues raised the Deputy relate to an individual case, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for directly reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

In 2011 a review by the European Union Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk (SCHER) concluded that there are no known negative health implications from fluoridating water at levels used in the EU.  The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, i.e. the adjustment of the natural concentration of fluoride in drinking water to the optimal recommended level for the prevention of dental caries, does not cause any ill effects and protects the oral health of the population.</p><p>  There are no plans to cease fluoridation.  Nevertheless, the Department of Health keeps this policy under constant review.  As part of this ongoing work, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population and on the environment is being conducted by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department.  The Department is also collaborating in a University College Cork-led research project, "Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth" (FACCT).  The study will consider the impact of changes on the oral health of children, following policy decisions relating to toothpaste use by infants and young children made in 2002 and the reduction in the level of fluoridation in drinking water introduced in 2007.  In addition, the pilot phase of a study on general and oral health findings in adults linked to the duration of exposure to fluoridated water as part of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA) is underway.</p></reply>

Many nurses go abroad for a period of time and return to Ireland at a later stage.  Notwithstanding the need to reduce public service numbers the HSE has the capacity to recruit where it is necessary to do so in order to ensure patient safety and quality care and to support service delivery.  Nursing posts continue to be filled on this basis.  In addition, the Haddington Road Agreement provided for the recruitment of up to 1,000 Nurse Graduates on a 2 year programme.  Nearly 500 nurses and midwives have commenced employment in recent months on the graduate scheme, with over 200 others currently going through the recruitment process.</p><p>  Fourth year undergraduate student nurses undertake a 36 week rostered placement as a key part of their degree programme.  When doing so, they are not qualified nurses and require supervision.  Student undergraduate nurses participating in the 4th year rostered clinical placement are paid in accordance with the rates specified in the minimum wage legislation, &euro;6.49 for the first 12 weeks, &euro;6.92 for the second 12 weeks and &euro;7.79 for the third 12 weeks, with mental health student nurses 2.3% higher.  Nurses participating in the Nurse Graduate Initiative earn 85% of the starting pay of a Staff Nurse in the first year and 90% in the second year.  In addition these nurses would also be in receipt of allowances and other premium payments.  Under the Agreement  any subsequent appointment following completion of the Initiative will be to the third point of the staff nurse scale.  For the first time nationally in Ireland this programme offers graduates a unique opportunity to consolidate undergraduate learning experience in a structured and supportive environment while building on their competencies and providing the foundation for lifelong learning for the next stage of their career.  This initiative will open doors for future education and their career development giving graduate staff nurses and midwives a significant advantage over graduates worldwide.</p></reply>

In response to the Deputy's question on whether there has been a policy change in residential care for children, the HSE has advised that the provision of a residential placement would follow a detailed assessment to establish any other means of addressing needs rather than admission to residential care.</p><p>There would generally be considerable communication between the HSE, the family/guardian of a service user and the voluntary service provider<b></b>and the person themselves. The number of children and adults benefiting from residential services in 2013 was 8,880.The target for 2014 is 8,884. </p><p>Traditional disability service provision is moving towards a community based and inclusive model rather than being institutional and segregated. The key learnings from the <i>New Direction</i>Report on Adult Day Services and <i>Time to Move on from Congregated Settings &ndash; A Strategy for Community Inclusion</i>- alongside the Value for Money and Policy Review are helping us to achieve a more effective, person centered disability service provision, in line with international best practice. </p><p>The radical change involves, a collaborative responsibility shared between the person, their families and carers, a multiplicity of agencies, Government and society as a whole.</p></reply>

I have consistently raised the issue of managing costs with the private health insurers and I have strongly urged them to reduce their overall costs, including professional fees.</p><p>  The vast majority of private health insurance policies provide cover for in-patient hospital treatment, with limited out-patient and GP cover.  While there has already been some reduction in associated professional fees I will continue to urge all health insurers to achieve further fee and cost reductions in the interests of consumers.</p><p>  Additionally, many consumers can make savings on their health insurance premiums by reviewing their level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  There are numerous lower cost plans available from all four health insurers and it is quite possible for consumers to find a similar level of cover in the market for a cheaper price.  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA plays an important role for customers, both in ensuring that they have accurate information, and in enforcing the implementation of the law protecting consumers in relation to health insurance. The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.</p></reply>

This advantageous arrangement for persons aged over 70 years has facilitated a much greater share of this cohort qualifying for a medical card compared to the general population as a whole.</p><p>  There are no proposals to change this assessment process.</p><p>  However, persons aged 70 or older who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds may also have their eligibility assessed under the means tested medical card scheme where they face particularly high expenses. This assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses and the qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over -70s gross income thresholds.</p><p>  Furthermore, persons aged over 70 years may still be eligible for a medical card on a discretionary basis where they face undue hardship in arranging medical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.</p></reply>

I understand that the vast majority of the business cases were rejected. The HSE advised the non-compliant agencies that a period of up to three months to 1st July 2014 had been set to allow time for them to make the necessary arrangements to cease the payment of all unapproved remuneration.  The agencies have been requested to report back to the HSE setting out their planned course of action to give effect to the Review Panel decisions by 16th May 2014.  I will not be in a position to comment accurately on when full compliance will be achieved, until the agencies have reported back.</p><p>  Staff in organisations funded under Section 39 are not classified as public servants, not counted in public service numbers, don&rsquo;t have public service pensions and not bound by the Department of Health Consolidated Salary Scales. The HSE funds more than 2,600 agencies through 4,100 individual service level arrangements under Section 39 of the Health Act 2004.  At  the Minister for Health&rsquo;s request, the HSE wrote to the CEOs of all Section 39 agencies outlining health sector pay policy and requesting each to have due regard to public pay policy, in particular in respect of senior management. In accordance with service level arrangements, since 2013, the HSE requires all funded agencies to disclose senior manager remuneration. The HSE is close to completing a verification and validation exercise in respect of senior managers&rsquo;remuneration in the larger Section 39 Agencies who receive in excess of &euro;5million in funding annually from the HSE. A report will be finalised in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The National Rehabilitation Hospital actively manages the waiting time for admission to the high intensity rehabilitation beds.</p><p>  The Government has committed to part funding a new 120 Bed Rehabilitation Hospital with Integrated Therapy spaces to replace the existing National Rehabilitation Hospital, at an estimated cost of &euro;54 million.</p><p>  In the past couple of years, four new Consultants in Rehabilitation Medicine were appointed to the National Rehabilitation Hospital, in addition to the existing seven Consultants at the hospital.</p><p>  The White Paper on Universal Health Insurance (UHI), published by Government on 2nd April 2014, indicates that under UHI, citizens will have access to a package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  Decisions on the composition of the future health basket will be informed by the Expert Commission which the Government will establish shortly.  The Commission is tasked with providing a series of costed options to the Government on a wide range of services to be included in the UHI standard package services.  It will provide details on the nature and type of the service, including any conditions and targeting that should apply in relation to the coverage of services.  It will also advise on the services to be provided within the overall health basket.  The inclusion of neuro-rehabilitation care services in the standard package of UHI will be considered as part of the process.  It is the Government's intention that UHI will be introduced by 2019.</p><p>  The Government recognises that neurological illness or injury has significant implications for the individual and their family, which impacts on their social, educational, vocational and recreational participation.  Waiting times, access, treatment and quality of care are priorities for reform for this Government, despite budgetary constraints.</p></reply>

Under its provisions, persons residing in Ireland who are attached to the social security system of another member state are entitled to receive health care services in Ireland at the cost of that member state, provided they are not subject to Irish social security legislation.  Persons in this category are entitled to full eligibility and a medical card on the basis of EU Regulations as evidence of their entitlement.  However, like all medical card holders, they will be subject to the prescription charge of &euro;2.50 for each item that is dispensed under the medical card scheme, up to a maximum of &euro;25 per month per person or family.</p><p>  Ireland operates a bilateral health care reimbursement agreement with the United Kingdom, in respect of health services provided under EU Regulations, covering such persons as temporary visitors between the two countries, pensioners of one country and their dependants residing in the other country, and the dependant families of persons employed in the other country.  Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis. The payment made in any one year is based on an estimate of the number of persons falling within categories eligible for reimbursement and for whom each country is liable and an estimate of the average cost of providing health care treatment.  An amount of &euro;220 million was received from the United Kingdom in 2013.  The payments are received by the Health Service Executive as Appropriations-in-Aid and are offset against the gross funding requirements of the Executive at national level thus reducing the net liability to the Exchequer. </p></reply>

The Directive seeks to ensure a clear and transparent framework for the provision of cross-border healthcare within the EU, for those occasions where the care patients seek is provided in another Member State rather than in their home country.  However, it should be emphasised that the vast majority of EU patients receive healthcare in their own country and prefer to do so. </p><p>  The Department of Health has prepared the necessary statutory provisions to implement the Directive and will have them in place shortly.  </p></reply>

The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.

Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment of interchangeability of medicines.</p><p>  In deciding whether to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the IMB  must be satisfied that each medicinal product which falls within the group:</p><p>  (a) has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in each of its active substances as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group; </p><p>  (b) is in the same pharmaceutical form as, or in a pharmaceutical form that is appropriate for substitution for, each of the other products in the group; and</p><p>  (c) has the same route of administration as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group. </p><p>  In addition, the Act provides that the IMB is not permitted to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products where:</p><p>  - there is a difference in bioavailability between the medicinal products and the interchangeable medicinal products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable medicinal products which may lead to a clinically significant difference in efficacy between them, and</p><p>  - any of the medicinal  products cannot be safely substituted for any one or more of the other medicinal products in the group. </p><p>I would like to emphasise that in making a decision to add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable medicinal products or a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the IMB is obliged to have regard to the criteria as set out in the Act.     </p><p>  To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, Section 13 of the Act allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.</p><p>  It is also important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine. All of the generic medicines on the Irish market are required to be properly licensed and meet the requirements of the IMB.</p><p>  A key objective of the Act is to enable patients to opt for lower cost interchangeable medicines. In general terms, when a pharmacist is presented with a prescription for an interchangeable medicine, which is not the subject of a clinical exemption, the pharmacist is obliged to offer the patient the opportunity to agree to substituting the prescribed product with an interchangeable medicine which is in stock in the pharmacy and is of lower cost to the patient or the HSE, as the case may be. The patient may either accept the interchangeable medicine offered by the pharmacist or opt to receive the branded interchangeable medicine where prescribed. Alternatively, the patient may opt to go to a different pharmacy to receive a less expensive interchangeable medicine. </p><p>  The Act also allows the HSE to set a reference price for groups of interchangeable medicines. Eligible persons under the community drug schemes, including the Drug Payment Scheme, will only face an additional charge where a reference price has been set for a group of interchangeable medicines and the medicine dispensed is priced higher than the reference price and is not the subject of a clinical exemption.</p></reply>

However, this is not as a result of a change in policy or a deliberate targeting of discretionary cards. Rather, it is attributable, in the main, to the fact that many people, who previously were marginally over the qualifying means thresholds, have subsequently been granted medical cards because they fall under those means thresholds.  Of the discretionary cards in circulation in 2011, less than one-tenth have subsequently been found to be ineligible for a medical card on review.</p><p>  At the request of Minister Reilly, the HSE is currently examining how individuals, who are not entitled to a medical card, could still receive services that meet their needs. This issue is being addressed in a manner that includes all of the services and supports provided by the HSE with as much flexibility as is available and at a local level. It is intended that improved published information and local information points will be established at major health centres around the country, where members of the public can obtain comprehensive information and support in accessing their full range of supports and entitlements from the Health Services. The objective is to maximise the supports available for patients and families. </p><p>  My clear intention is to maximise the supports that can be provided in each case and to ensure that entitlements are maximised to the fullest extent possible. The HSE is seeking to find the best way to achieve this in order to ensure families will receive the support they need. </p></reply>

The Committee carried out a number of hearings on the matter and published detailed recommendations on the issues that should be included. In March 2013, the Government approved the drafting of a Regulation of Vehicle Immobilisation Bill. The Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and, contingent on Government approval to publish the Bill,  I hope to introduce it in the Oireachtas in the coming months.    In relation to the use of clamping in tourist towns, the choice of parking control measures is at the discretion of the relevant local authority and it would be inappropriate to legislate for the manner in which such discretion might be exercised.</p></reply>

The School Completion Programme aims to retain young people in the formal education system to completion of senior cycle and to generally improve the school attendance, participation and retention of its target cohort. </p><p>  The school based projects within SCP provide a range of supports and interventions designed to support individual children identified by the Local Management Committee as being at risk of early school leaving within those school communities. This project model approach gives local communities the autonomy to devise creative and innovative approaches to address the needs of local young people most at risk of early school leaving. </p><p>In 2014 an allocation of &euro;24.756m has been provided to the Child and Family Agency to deliver this programme. This supports 124 projects and related initiatives which operate across the country, including the St Finian's Project, to which the Deputy refers. I am advised that this project has a budget of &euro;185,000 for the 2013 / 2014 school year to provide targeted supports to   students in one post-primary school and five primary schools. </p><p>The Agency is responsible for the strategic and operational direction of the School Completion Programme. Within this remit the Agency manages the SCP budget and the allocation of funds to projects within the programme.   I am advised that proposals have yet to be formulated by the Child and Family Agency in relation to funding for the 2014/2015 academic year. As an initial step, the Agency has recently invited all SCP Projects to commence planning for the next cycle of the programme within the available funding parameters. Within the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure the SCP is required to achieve cumulative savings of &euro;5.5m over the period 2012 to 2014, of which &euro;1.7m in savings is to be found in 2014. </p><p>  A briefing on the 14/15 planning template was provided to Local Coordinators at recent Network meetings. Local Management Committees have been advised to examine all elements of expenditure and to prioritise the most effective interventions to support children&rsquo;s educational outcomes. In addition, projects have been requested to examine means of maximising the capacity of the totality of schools&rsquo; DEIS resources, and linkages with area-based supports available through other relevant providers, to realise SCP objectives in the most efficient and economical way possible. The Agency will continue to work closely with management committees, schools and local SCP co-ordinators to assist projects through this process. </p><p>  The Deputy will wish to note that a planned programme review of SCP has commenced. The objectives of the review are to identify best practice, to clarify roles and responsibilities and to build upon the valuable learning and experience to date across the programme. It is anticipated that the review will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing for the future and ensure that available funds are targeted to those services which provide the greatest contribution to educational outcomes for pupils at risk of educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

Information in this regard is published on the ISPCC web page entitled 'Missing Children's Hotline.' It is important to appreciate that the Hotline is a support service rather than an emergency service.  Where callers require assistance outside the scope of the services provided by the Hotline, they are referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or whichever branch of the emergency services is appropriate. Staff of the Missing Children's Hotline will also pass on information to the emergency services when it is appropriate to do so. </p><p>  The 116 000 Hotline was set up to provide advice and emotional support to parents/guardians whose child is missing. This advice and support may also be accessed by the extended family of a child who is missing or, indeed, by the child themselves. A key component of the service is an awareness programme. It is vital that those who could benefit from the service know that it exists and that users are aware of the scope of the service.  </p><p>  During the initial set up phase of the service, the ISPCC focused on community based promotion of the service.  This included presentations to local community groups.  Subsequently, posters, flyers and business cards have been distributed to all Garda stations from Garda Headquarters, and promotional material has been distributed to a variety of community based projects in various locations throughout the country.  Further, the ISPCC makes extensive use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter to advertise this service on an ongoing basis.</p><p>  The 116 000 Missing Children Hotline website (www.missingchildrenhotline.ie) also serves to promote the service.  In the first three months of 2014 the number of hits to this website (16,468) was 182% greater than the total number of hits (6059) during the entirety of 2013.  This is a clear indication of the growing public awareness of the service.</p></reply>

This service discontinued operation in 2011.</p><p>  In my capacity as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I am responsible, under Part 10 of the Children Act 2001, for the 3 Children Detention Schools at Oberstown, Lusk, Co. Dublin which provide detention places to the Courts for girls up to the age of 18 years and boys up to the age of 17 years ordered to be remanded or committed on criminal charges. </p><p>  Children may be sentenced to detention by the courts for a range of offences on foot of criminal proceedings under the Children Act 2001. In a small number of cases, these sentences are for sex offences. I wish to confirm that the services of the Granada Institute have not been availed of for children detained in the Children Detention Schools in Oberstown.  For any such child in custody a comprehensive care and rehabilitation plan is devised based on the individual needs of each child by qualified child care managers. For children in custody for sex offences, I understand that therapeutic and treatment plans are available based on identified need, either on the Oberstown campus or in the community.  It has not been necessary to arrange treatment abroad for any child detained in the Children Detention Schools.  </p><p>  Apart from children serving a sentence on the Oberstown campus, there are other children who may be the subject of social worker involvement who may display challenging behaviour in terms of a possible likelihood to commit child sexual offences.  In addition, there may be children found guilty of such offences by the courts but who may have received a community sanction under the Children Act 2001.  I am referring the Deputy's question to the Child and Family Agency and the Probation Service for any further information they may have to hand which would be relevant and will be in further contact when a response has been received.</p></reply>

It aims to make best safeguarding practice the cultural norm for anyone working with children. The Children First Bill provides for a number of key child protection measures, as follows:</p><p> - a requirement on mandated persons to report child protection concerns to the Child and Family Agency;</p><p> - a requirement on mandated persons to assist the Child and Family Agency in the assessment of a child protection risk, if requested to do so by the Agency;</p><p> - a requirement on organisations providing services to children to comply with best practice in child protection as set out in the Children First Guidelines and to produce an organisational-specific Child Safeguarding Statement; and</p><p> - statutory arrangements to promote cross-sectoral implementation and compliance with Children First.</p><p>  The Deputy specifically raised the issue of reporting and how reports will be followed up. Certain individuals who are mandated persons under the Bill will be required to report child welfare and protection concerns in accordance with the legislation to the Agency. Mandated persons will also be required to report to the Agency any disclosures of harm made to them by a child.  </p><p>  The decision to focus the requirement for mandated reporting on a small, qualified cadre of persons who by virtue of their training, qualifications and professional experience are well equipped to recognise harm, is likely to have a positive effect on the process of assessments of risk by the Agency. It is anticipated that reports from these persons are likely to be of a high standard, which will assist the Agency in carrying out assessments of risk in an effective and efficient manner.</p><p>  As regards following up on reports, the Bill provides that a mandated person may be requested to assist the Child and Family Agency and to give such information and assistance to the Agency as is reasonably required. It is envisaged that only information which is relevant and necessary to assess the child&rsquo;s need for care and protection should be sought.</p><p>  The Children First Bill 2014 provides a clear statutory basis for the reporting of harm to children to the Child and Family Agency and sets out clearly the obligations on providers of services to children to protect children.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2014, funding of &euro;49.78m is being provided to my Department for these schemes.</p><p>Continuous improvement in the provision of safe, effective child and youth centred services is an important priority for my Department and there are a number of recent and current initiatives, including legislative initiatives, which will be of interest to the Deputy in this regard. </p><p>The National Quality Standards Framework for youth work (NQSF<b>) </b>was<b></b>introduced in January 2011. on a phased basis. By the end of 2014<font color="#0082BF">,</font>all youth services and youth organisations funded by the Department will be implementing the NQSF.   The purpose of the NQSF for youth work is to provide a support and development tool to organisations and projects and to establish standards in the practice and provision of youth work. These standards are helping to ensure an improvement in good practice, that these services and projects are outcomes focussed and that the young people involved are deriving the maximum benefit from being involved in youth work activities.  The Quality Standard Guidelines for local volunteer led youth groups, launched in March 2013, are an important resource for local groups throughout the country in delivering quality programmes, which meet the needs of their young members.</p><p>The Child Protection Unit and Programme based at the National Youth Council of Ireland and which is funded by my Department, supports the implementation of The Code of Good Practice: Child Protection for the Youth Work Sector. A Child Protection Training Programme has been developed for the sector and awareness of child protection procedures and responsibilities have been enhanced at all levels within youth work organisations. In 2013, the Child Protection Programme developed a new website and training programmes for youth workers on internet safety for young people - .  This resource aims to equip  youth work practitioners to engage with young people's online life and experiences and to promote their online safety.</p><p>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020, published in April 2014, sets out an framework to coordinate across government, all policies that have an effect on children&rsquo;s and young people&rsquo;s lives. In line with the National Policy Framework, my Department is developing a new youth strategy for later this year. The new youth strategy will aim to enhance the role of youth services in contributing to the achievements of the five national outcomes for children and young people i.e that they are active and healthy, achieving, learning and developing, safe and protected from harm, economically secure, and connected, respected and contributing to society.   The strategy will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years. </p><p>The Children First Bill was published by my Department in April, 2014. The purpose of the Bill is to make further and better provision for the care and protection of children including raising awareness of child abuse and neglect, providing for reporting and management of child protection concerns and improving child protection arrangements in organisations providing services to children.</p><p>The youth services are working closely with my Department in preparation for the enactment of the new legislation and to ensure that models of best practice in the care and protection of young people  are continuously improved and updated.</p></reply>

The framework gives appropriate priority to the importance of physical and mental well-being with a single national outcome focussed on &quot;Active and Healthy&quot;. The key Departmental Sponsor for this Outcome area is the Department of Health. Under this outcome, 15 key commitments are listed, each with a lead Department responsible for implementation. These commitments aim to reduce the risk factors and improve the resilience factors associated with the health and well-being of children and young people. My Department works closely with the Department of Health, the HSE other relevant departments and agencies to progress these issues. My Department has both sponsored studies in this area and collated relevant evidence from other studies to learn more about the issues most likely to impact on the health and well-being of children.</p><p>The responsibility for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) lies with the HSE and policy for these is outlined in the Department of Health&rsquo;s, &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy.</p><p>The Child and Family Agency has a key role in supporting some of the most vulnerable children and young people in State care. My Department has introduced reforms aimed at enhancing management and service provision for therapeutic services for children in detention and residential care. These include the establishment of the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service, a new integrated clinical team known as the ACTS team, that will liaise closely with CAMHS and other relevant services.</p><p>One of the main challenges in the area of physical well being is childhood obesity. In the latter part of 2013 the Minister of Health and my predecessor, Minister Fitzgerald, jointly launched a three year media and social media campaign aimed at giving practical tips to parents on managing their children&rsquo;s weight.   <font color="#2F2F2F"> </font></p><p>As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I have responsibility for Play and Recreation Policy which have been  set out in the policy documents, &lsquo;<font color="#2F2F2F">READY, STEADY, PLAY! A National Play Policy&rsquo; and  the &lsquo;National Recreation Policy for Young People&rsquo;. The Local Authority Play and Recreation Network (LAPRN)</font><font color="#2F2F2F"> was established to introduce a more coordinated and interagency approach to achieving the main goals of the play and recreation policies at both national and local level. Targeted grants are provided to Local Authorities by my Department to encourage participation across the Local Authority network. Other initiatives being developed at local community level are designed to encourage awareness of the importance of play and recreation throughout the whole of life from early childhood to adulthood and through to later life. </font></p><p>Much work has been done with respect to the development of alcohol and drug policies in youth settings through funding provided by my Department through  the Youth Service Grant Scheme and the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund and through the work of a range of youth work organisations. The National Youth Health Programme is a partnership operated by the National Youth Council of Ireland with the Youth Affairs Unit of my Department and the Health Promotion Unit of the HSE respectively. The Programme aims to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion/education support and training service including making healthy choices in relation to alcohol, to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in the non-formal education setting.</p></reply>

The principles underlying this responsibility are outlined in Child Care Act, 1991 as amended.  My Department's role is oversight of effective use of resources vis-a-vis statutory responsibilities. The Department is not involved in the day to day running of services</p><p>  The Agency publishes a range of reports on performance indicators on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Among these indicators is information relating to referral and assessment processes, and numbers of substantiated cases which have led to a child's name being placed on the Child Protection Notification System and having a Child Protection Plan. The Agency also provides an annual Review of Adequacy Report under Section 8 of the Child Care Act 1991. The annual service planning process provides an opportunity to set out service priorities in the context of available resources.  In addition, information is provided to me by the Agency on specific issues as required or to inform me of policy or legislative issues arising in the services.</p><p>  This oversight function is exercised through a range of interactions with officials in the Agency.  Among the more formal engagements are regular meetings between myself and the Chief Executive Officer of the Agency along with our respective senior management teams. Officials from my Department also meet formally on a quarterly basis with their counterparts in the Agency to discuss Performance Indicators and to seek in general to maintain and where possible improve the service provided by the Agency to the wider public.  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) inspect Agency services for children in care and at risk, and publish reports of their findings.  There are regular and ongoing meetings between my Department and HIQA where HIQA report on their monitoring of services for children at risk.</p></reply>

The context within which our child welfare and protection services operate today is very challenging.  The number of child welfare and protection referrals to social work departments increased by nearly one third to over 40,000 in 2012.  My Department has a range of systems in place to ensure it  is informed of risk to children and the measures in place to minimise these risks.  Monthly, quarterly and annual reports are received from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, in respect of all its functions, including detailed reporting of key performance indicators and protocols are in place to inform my Department of specific issues where risk is identified and to a management response is required.  </p><p>Inspection reports are also received on an ongoing basis and meetings with HIQA managers and inspectors are held on a regular basis to review key inspection findings  in relation to children in detention schools, children in care in residential care including special care, foster care and children in receipt of child welfare and protection services in the community.  Reports from the Ombudsman for Children, and the National Review Panel where risk to children is noted, are reviewed to identify issues that require input and progress in the area of  policy and operations.  I am satisfied that in establishing Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, we now have in place the necessary structure to ensure the provision of a more responsive and integrated service to children and young people at risk.</p><p>With regard to bullying, we know from data from the Growing Up in Ireland Longitudinal Study that 40% of nine-year-olds reported being victims of bullying in the past year with boys and girls experiencing similar rates of victimisation.  I the case of children who reported victimisation in the previous year, only 39% of their mothers appeared to have been aware that their child had been the victim of bullying. This emphasises the importance of parents talking to their children about bullying and schools having policies on bullying which are disseminated to parents.  The Action Plan On Bullying published by the Minister for Education and Skills in January 2013 clearly recognised the need to tackle bullying, including cyber-bullying, in a holistic way through schools but within a much wider social context. Amongst the actions which are being taken are the development of a single national anti-bullying website to provide information for parents, young people, youth workers, sporting and cultural associations and school staff on types and methods of bullying and how to deal with bullying behaviour.</p><p>Under my own Department, the Child and Family Agency has a statutory function to ensure that &lsquo;<i>each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education</i>&rsquo; which it delivers through its Educational Welfare Services.  Schools are obliged to record and monitor daily attendance and to report absences to the Agency in specific circumstances; such as where a child is absent for 20 days or more, where a child is expelled or suspended for six days or more cumulatively, or where the principal of a school has concerns about the educational welfare of a child.  Much of the Agency's work in relation to school attendance involves early prevention and targeted intervention with children and families, in collaboration with schools and other support services.</p></reply>

However, recent examples include the co-hosting with the Children's Rights Alliance of a consultative forum to allow the State to complete the Third and Fourth Consolidated Report to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child. My Department is currently providing funding to the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance to assist that body in coordinating the &quot;shadow&quot; NGO Report to the United Nations. In preparing the Children First legislation, my Department consulted with key bodies including EPIC (Empowering People in Care), Barnardos and the ISPCC, whose contributions were very valuable in developing this complex Bill. A number of contributions were also considered in the context of the legislation establishing the Child and Family Agency.</p><p>  There are a number of committees and advisory groups currently operating under the aegis of my Department.  These include the National Children's Advisory Council, which acts in an independent advisory role to me as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and includes representatives of statutory agencies, the voluntary sector and parents.  Its overarching role is to contribute to the development of a strong collaborative interface between statutory and non-statutory providers of children&rsquo;s services.  The Council assisted my Department in developing 'Better Outcomes: Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014 -2020', which was recently published. </p><p>  I also wish to acknowledge the work of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee, which includes representatives from both the voluntary and statutory sectors with an interest and involvement in the administration and provision of youth work programmes and services.  Its main role is to advise on and assist in the coordination of youth work policies, programmes and services, and to provide a forum to address and progress specific issues.</p><p>  My Department will continue to emphasise the importance of regular contact and discussion with key stakeholders in relation to policy and services for children and young people.  This includes ensuring that, where appropriate, representative bodies and organisations working with children and young people play a role in the formation of policy.</p></reply>

Dublin.  </p><p>  As prescribed under Section 158 of the Children Act 2001, as amended, the principal object of the children detention schools is to provide appropriate education, training and other programmes and facilities for children referred to them by the courts.  The delivery of children detention services is focused on education and rehabilitation of those young people detained in order to address offending behaviour and support their early re-integration into the community.  The development project which is currently underway on the Oberstown campus to increase capacity and enable the extension of the child care model of detention to all children under the age of 18 ordered to be detained by the courts also includes the provision of new education and recreation facilities as well as dedicated visiting facilities and a medical facility.  Along with the existing services already being provided these new facilities will ensure sufficient age and ability appropriate facilities to support the delivery, by the Dublin and Dun Laoghaire Education and Training Board (DDLETB), of the necessary and vital education services to young people in detention.  </p><p>  An individual management plan is put in place for each child on admission to the children detention schools which includes an assessment using a mental health screening tool to determine the need for more specialist assessment or intervention from specialists within the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS).  This is a national service provided by the Child and Family Agency that provides clinical services to children in detention and in special care, as well as short term interventions when the child returns to the community.  </p><p>  The Deputy should note that earlier community based interventions to divert young people from offending behaviour, such as the Garda Youth Diversion Projects and the Garda Diversion Programme, which aim to engage young people in a process of learning and development that enables them to make positive lifestyle choices are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

The Framework sets out a whole-of-Government approach to policies for children and young people, and is a clear vision of what we want for children and young people in Ireland. </p><p>  My Department is taking the lead in implementing the Area-Based Childhood Programme.  The programme is being co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million. The programme is being introduced on foot of the Programme for Government commitment to adopt an area-based approach to child poverty, drawing on best international practice and existing services to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched, and improve the outcomes for children and young people.  The programme will build on and continue much of the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme, for which my Department had responsibility and which was also co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies.</p><p>  In relation to youth-specific services, my Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country, including those from disadvantaged communities.  Targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at-risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund (Rounds 1 and 2), Local Drugs Task Force Projects and certain other programmes such as the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres.  In addition, some 31 national and major regional youth work organisations are supported under my Department's Youth Service Grant Scheme. The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects, and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country. In 2014, current funding of &euro;49.78 million has been provided to my Department for these schemes.</p><p>  My Department is developing a new youth strategy for later this year. This new strategy will aim to enhance the role of youth services in contributing to the achievement of the five national outcomes for children and young people set out in &ldquo;Better Outcomes - Brighter Futures&rdquo;  i.e. that they are active and healthy, achieving, learning and developing, safe and protected from harm, economically secure, and connected, respected and contributing to society.  The strategy will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between Government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.</p></reply>

These include the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme and the new After-school Childcare programme.  </p><p>  The Early Childhood Care and Education programme provides a free preschool year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.   Children qualify for the free preschool year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September in the relevant year.   </p><p>  The Community Childcare Subvention programme provides funding to community-based child care services to enable them to provide child care at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments or on low or relatively modest incomes. The Childhood Education and Training Support programme provides funding to support parents who are returning to the workforce or are participating in Solas or Education and Training Boards education and training programmes.  This programme also supports parents participating in Community Employment programmes.  An After-school Childcare programme was recently introduced and is targeted to support  low-income parents returning to the workforce.  </p><p>  In the region of &euro;260 million is provided annually by my Department to provide for these child care support programmes which assist parents in accessing quality and affordable child care.  More than 100,000 children benefit from these programmes each year.

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Child and Family Agency and the Ombudsman for Children's Office. </p><p>Up to 31 December, 2013, my Department also funded the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.   The new Child and Family Agency which was established on 1 January 2014 now has responsibility for the provision of these services along with children and family services previously delivered by the HSE. </p><p>  The coming together under one Agency of services previously delivered across three separate organisations provides a platform for the delivery of a more efficient and effective service to vulnerable children and families.  The range of responsibilities under the remit of the Agency will contribute to achievement of the overall vision for the Agency which is seeking to bring about greater integration of services with a focus on early intervention and community engagement.</p><p>In July 2011, the Government decided that the Family Mediation Service should transfer from the Family Support Agency to the Legal Aid Board. This is in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to facilitate the use of mediation in family disputes in order to speed up the legal process, reduce costs and ameliorate the stress of contested court proceedings. On 26 October 2011, the Minister for Justice and Equality signed the commencement order for Part 16 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 which gave effect to the transfer from 1 November 2011. </p><p>  At this stage it is not possible to quantify the actual savings to date as a direct result of these developments.  </p><p>  It should be noted that following enactment of the Child Care Amendment Act 2011 the Children's Act Advisory Board was subsequently dissolved by means of the commencement by the Minister of Health of Part 6 of the Child Amendment Act 2011.</p></reply>
