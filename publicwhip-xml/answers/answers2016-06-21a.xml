Such staff were exempted from the 10% reduction in pay encompassed by the National Recovery Plan. </p><p>Accordingly, no additional costs would arise to ensure that employees in such instances were paid the pre-2011 rate.</p><p>Pay scales were further impacted by the merging of pre- and post- 2011 pay scales from 1 November 2013. The resultant level of mitigation would vary depending on the date of entry of the employee, the point on the pay scale the employee had entered at and whether they had subsequently been promoted and placed on a pre-2011 pay scale. </p><p>The complexity of calculating these costs is further compounded by the fact that pay costs impact on individual employees differently, depending on the pay band into which they fall. </p><p>Accordingly, it is not possible to accurately capture the notional costs referred to by the Deputy, given the above complexities. </p><p>I can however, assure the Deputy that the provisions of the Lansdowne Road Agreement, which takes cognisance of the State&rsquo;s improved finances and which now commences the process of income restoration, will further mitigate any disparity which would have arisen initially under the National Recovery Plan between pre and post 2011 salaries, and the current implementation of the Haddington Road Agreement. </p></reply>

My Department has invested considerably in facilities and infrastructure at Gormanston Camp.  Since 2010, just over &euro;673,000 has been spent on a range of capital and non-capital developments and improvements whilst a further &euro;50,000 is to be spent this year.  This is in addition to routine ongoing investment in repair and maintenance of the facility. </p>  <p>  In addition, in implementing the White Paper on Defence 2015, a number of projects have been identified that will address infrastructure requirements across the Defence Forces.  In this regard, a rolling five year infrastructure development plan will be produced based on an assessment of needs for all individual barracks.  In addition, a review will be carried out of training facilities, which includes Gormanston Camp, in order to ensure that they are developed in accordance with the needs of the Defence Forces.  At present, the Camp is currently used for RDF training and is the only site in the Defence property portfolio that is used for Air Defence training and Air Corps firing.    </p></reply>

It is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area.  Anti-malarial medications, including Lariam, remain in the formulary of medications prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease.   </p>  <p>  There are three anti-malarial drugs in use by the Defence Forces, namely Lariam (mefloquine), Malarone and Doxycycline.  The choice of medication for overseas deployment, including the use of Lariam, is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Irish Defence Forces.  </p>  <p>  Information in relation to illnesses contracted by Defence Forces Personnel including instances of malaria is maintained on each individual&rsquo;s medical file.  While there is no way of providing the exact information sought by the Deputy without examining every medical record of each member who served overseas in sub-Saharan Africa, I am advised by the Medical Corps that the number of incidences of malaria among Defence Forces Personnel is low.  The Deputy might also note that since deployment of Defence Forces Personnel to sub-Saharan Africa, not a single member has died from the malaria disease. </p></reply>

Personnel are posted on the basis of operational needs across the organisation both at home and abroad.  As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force targeted recruitment takes place so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels.    </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the operational capacity of the Defence Forces is being maintained.

The other members of the Battlegroup are Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces contribution to the German Battlegroup will involve an ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target, Acquisition and Reconnaissance) Company together with staff posts at both the Operational and Force headquarters.  The total number of Irish Defence Force personnel that will be involved in the German Battlegroup, should it deploy will be about 175. </p>  <p>  In July 2015, the Government approved Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the UK Battlegroup, which will also be on standby for the second six months of 2016.  The total number of Irish Defence Force personnel involved in the UK Battlegroup will be five and they will be deployed in the Operational and Force headquarters.  Apart from Ireland, the other members of the Battlegroup are UK, Sweden, Finland, Latvia and Lithuania. </p>  <p>  For the most part, Battlegroup training takes place in the contributing member States.  For example, Irish troops are mainly trained in Ireland, Swedish troops in Sweden etc. </p>  <p>  The pre-standby period for a Battlegroup involves a range of intensive planning exercises, training, and desktop and actual exercises for the different components of the Battlegroup and for the Battlegroup as a whole.  This is essential so as to prepare Battlegroup personnel for the eventualities they may face if called upon to deploy on operations.  As the Deputy will appreciate, from a force protection perspective, you would not want to have a situation where the first time a Battlegroup rapid response contingent actually meet and commence operations is on an operational deployment into a conflict zone.  Exercises are designed to simulate the situations that may arise at the strategic, operational and tactical level so as the Battlegroup can operate as an effective and coherent military response.  In Ireland's case participation in that response will be on the basis of supporting or reinforcing a mission a UN Mandated mission or a humanitarian operation.   </p>  <p>  Joint exercises in relation to both the German and UK led Battlegroups only commenced in January 2016.  There were no exercises conducted in 2015. </p>  <p>  In respect of the German led EU Battlegroup, ten Defence Force personnel, who will be deployed to the Force Headquarters, took part in a Command and Staff Certification exercise in Strasbourg, France in early 2016.  A further Force Headquarters certification exercise took place in May, 2016, which included staff from the Defence Forces ISTAR component.

The current recruitment competition started in September 2015.

Therefore, in the event of any accident at the incinerator, road access to and from Haulbowline is threatened.  This could in some instances hinder the operation of the Naval Base or in the event of a major incident necessitating local area evacuation, the evacuation of Haulbowline would be denied .    </p></reply>

It was clear from the review that the three brigade structure was no longer viable, particularly when compared to international norms. </p><p>  Accordingly, a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces, encompassing the consolidation of the three under-strength brigades into two full strength brigades, took place.  The decision to move to a two brigade structure involved full consultation with the Defence Forces, and final proposals approved by the then Minister for Defence were agreed between the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General. </p><p>  Key aspects of this re-organisation, which was introduced in 2012, included the consolidation of under-strength units into a smaller number of full strength units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and the associated re-deployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational units.</p><p>The revised two brigade structure has optimised the capacity of the Defence Forces to deliver the required operational outputs, within available resources, and to continue to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.  A return to a three brigade structure would cause a range of unnecessary inefficiencies, such as an increased administrative burden arising from the need to re-introduce a layer of non-operational middle management, and a return to under-strength units. </p><p>The White Paper on Defence 2015 resulted from a wide ranging consultation process and a comprehensive examination of Defence requirements over the next decade.  It provides for retention of the Army&rsquo;s two existing infantry Brigades and the Defence Forces Training Centre, and for measures to further enhance the capabilities of the Army Ranger Wing.  Furthermore, the recently agreed Programme for a Partnership Government specifically provides for implementation of the White Paper.  In all of these circumstances, I have no plans to make changes to the existing two brigade structure.</p></reply>

The Irish Government is committed to investing in infrastructure to support North-South cooperation and unlock the full potential of the economies of both jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  As co-chair of the North South Ministerial Council, I ensure that the focus of Ministers is on the priorities for additional North South co-operation which they have identified in their respective areas of responsibility, particularly as regards assisting economic recovery, job creation, the best use of public funds and the most effective delivery of services for citizens across the island.</p>  <p>  As indicated in the recent Programme for a Partnership Government, I look forward to the further development of mutual North South benefit, particularly through the ongoing work of the NSMC.</p>  <p>  Narrow Water Bridge:</p>  <p>  Under "A Fresh Start - Stormont House Agreement" the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government have agreed to undertake a review of the Narrow Water Bridge project with a view to identifying options for its future development, for consideration by the North South Ministerial Council next month.  Discussions at official level have taken place between Northern Ireland Executive and Irish Government officials and a report has been prepared for consideration at the next NSMC.</p>  <p>  British-Irish Council</p>  <p>  I attended the 26th Summit of the British-Irish Council on 17 June hosted by the Scottish Government in Glasgow.  The heads of delegation were welcomed by First Minister Sturgeon on behalf of the Scottish Government.</p>  <p>  First Minister Sturgeon commenced the meeting with a minute's silence to mark the shocking death of Jo Cox MP.  The Council reflected on priorities for Member Administrations and discussed how the Council could continue to promote cooperation on issues of common concern.  The Council also noted that there might be scope for new areas of cooperation based on emerging Government and Member Administration priorities across these islands, many of which have had elections in recent times.  In the context of current issues, the forthcoming UK EU Referendum was discussed.  I clearly set out the Irish Government position and our programme of outreach to Irish citizens in Britain who have a vote.</p>  <p>  Minister of State, Helen McEntee met with counterparts with particular responsibility for unpaid carers in advance of the Summit to consider a detailed paper prepared by the Council&rsquo;s Social Inclusion work sector.  The discussion was then taken forward by Heads of Administration, where the Council agreed that carers are an integral part of society, caring for family, friends and neighbours affected by physical or mental illness, disability, frailty or substance misuse. It was agreed that further sharing of research and good practice in this important area will be pursued by Member Administrations.</p>  <p>  The Scottish Government updated the Council on the work done in advance of the Summit to take forward work being undertaken to review the operation of the Council.  It also noted the Secretariat&rsquo;s end of year report and agreed a new Council Communications Plan for the period 2016-18.  The Council also approved publication of the BIC Annual Report 2015.</p>  <p>  The next British Irish Council Summit is scheduled for Wales in November 2016.</p></reply>

Our recent bilateral discussions have centred on the importance of the UK remaining a member of the EU.</p>  <p>  When I met the Prime Minister on January 25th in Downing Street, the focus then was on the European Council on 18 February 2016 and the constructive role that Ireland could play in the negotiations.  A package of reforms was subsequently agreed by Heads of State and Government which provides a strong basis for the Prime Minister's campaign for the UK to stay in a reformed EU.</p>  <p>  This is clearly of particular importance to Ireland, given that our relationship with the UK is closer than with any other EU Member State.  The Prime Minister fully recognises our mutual interest in matters relating to Northern Ireland, the importance of a reformed, more effective European Union, the Common Travel Area and our strong economic ties.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government has been very active in our engagement with the UK Government, and with our EU partners, in outlining our concerns and our interests in this matter.  Our Government&rsquo;s position on the EU-UK question is clear: We want the UK, as our friend, closest neighbour and partner, to remain a member of a reformed EU.</p>  <p>  We believe Ireland has a unique perspective and interest in the outcome of the referendum: as a neighbour sharing a land border; as a partner with the UK in transforming British-Irish relations in recent years; and as a facilitator and co-guarantor, with the UK, of successive agreements aimed at securing peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is for all these reasons that the Irish Government is working hard to ensure that Irish Communities in the UK are aware of our particular perspective on the outcome of the upcoming referendum.</p>  <p>  Irish citizens living in the UK will have a vote in the upcoming referendum.  It is important that they are aware that they are entitled to vote and that they are fully informed on the issues.</p>  <p>  I and other members of the Government have completed a targeted programme of outreach in Britain and Northern Ireland to Irish and Irish-connected citizens in the UK who have a vote.  Last week I had engagements in Belfast and a programme of events in Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow where I engaged with the Irish community.  I also attended a Summit meeting of the British Irish Council in Glasgow.  However, my programme in Britain coincided with the shocking death of Jo Cox MP in West Yorkshire.  Out of respect for her and her family, and in light of the suspension of the two official campaigns, I refrained from issuing any public statements about the referendum.</p>  <p>  I travelled in a personal capacity to attend the Mayo v London game recently in Ruislip, London.  Irish4Europe were launching their voter registration campaign and I met with some of the members informally in the margins of the match.</p>  <p>  Naturally, the Government is alive to the risks associated with a possible overall leave result in the referendum.</p>  <p>  One of the most beneficial effects of the peace process and our common membership of the EU has been the virtual elimination of the border.  The re-establishment of customs checks on the border, or indeed of any customs arrangements, would be a regrettable and backward step for North-South trade and cooperation.  The situation would depend on the future arrangements to be put in place between the UK and the remaining 27 EU member states, including Ireland, following a UK departure.  We would certainly do our utmost to preserve the Common Travel Area.  But it is difficult to imagine a situation where there would be no controls or checks on the movement of goods if the UK left the EU.</p>  <p>  All EU partners share the view - for a variety of economic, political and social reasons - that continued UK membership of the Union is in all of our interests.  Discussions on the EU-UK issue at the European Council to date were focussed on securing a constructive deal with the UK that would enable Prime Minister Cameron to recommend and campaign for a remain vote in the UK referendum, and that was also acceptable to all EU partners.  Next week's European Council meeting was rescheduled to 28/29 June to allow EU leaders have a first exchange on the referendum result, to reflect on its implications and to begin to chart a way forward: Ireland is ready for these discussions.

As part of this process, the Chief Whip's Office will work closely with a new Parliamentary Liaison Unit and the Programme for Government Office which will track progress across all policy and legislative commitments.</p><p>Minister of State Murphy's portfolio has been expanded to include the EU Digital Single Market, in addition to responsibility for EU Affairs and Data Protection.</p><p>My Department no longer has responsibility at Ministerial level for International Financial Services.

While these surveys include breakdowns by sector and by occupation, the figures do not include a separate breakdown in relation to childcare workers.  Accurate results at this level of detail cannot be provided from sample surveys.</p><p>In the EU NACE Rev 2 economic activity classification system, <i>Child day-care activities</i>are classified as a sub-group of NACE code 88, <i>Social work activities without accommodation</i>.  Figures are available for the latter sector from the quarterly EHECS survey, showing average earnings per week of &euro;465.12 in quarter four of 2015.  This is the average earnings for all occupations working in the <i>Social work activities without accommodation</i>sector.</p><p>Some comparative EU statistics are available for the <i>Social work activities</i>sector from the 2012 EU-Labour Costs Survey.  Average earnings in the <i>Social work activities</i>sector in Ireland were &euro;32,896 in 2012, the fourth highest average earnings in the EU.  The United Kingdom had a comparative figure of &euro;28,583, while the European Union average was &euro;25,468.  <i>See Table 1.</i></p><p>Average hourly earnings for the <i>Social work activities</i>sector are also available from the 2012 EU-Labour Cost Survey and show that Ireland earned the fourth highest average hourly earnings in the European Union, with mean hourly earnings of &euro;20.21.  This compares to mean hourly earnings of &euro;15.87 in the UK and &euro;15.76 as an EU average.  Denmark recorded the highest average hourly earnings in this sector with a figure of &euro;26.70.  <i>See Table 1.</i></p><p>There are no comparative statistics available on childcare workers for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries.</p><p>The CSO is currently preparing updated results on the structure of earnings for the years 2011 to 2014, based primarily on administrative rather than survey data.  Broad sectoral and occupational statistics from this source will be published before the end of July and more detailed breakdowns will subsequently be available upon request, subject to CSO confidentiality rules.  While this will enable more detailed structural tables than before, the CSO does not expect that it will be possible to provide tables on earnings on specific detailed occupation codes of child care workers.  To identify the earnings of childcare workers, individual occupations would need to be coded at the 4 digit level of the International Standard Classification of Occupations.</p><p><b>Table 1: Mean annual and hourly earnings in </b><b><i>Social work activities</i></b><b>sector (NACE code 88) - 2008 and 2012</b><table><tr><th></th><th>Average Annual Earnings</th><th>Average Annual Earnings</th><th>Average Hourly Earnings</th><th>Average Hourly Earnings</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>2008</td><td>2012</td><td>2008</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;</td><td>&euro;</td><td>&euro;</td><td>&euro;</td></tr><tr><td>European Union (28 countries)</td><td>23,901 </td><td>25,468 </td><td>14.93</td><td>15.76</td></tr><tr><td>European Union (15 countries)</td><td>24,972 </td><td>27,166 </td><td>15.67</td><td>16.93</td></tr><tr><td>Euro area (19 countries)</td><td>23,118 </td><td>25,111 </td><td>14.83</td><td>16.32</td></tr><tr><td>Belgium</td><td>21,785 </td><td>26,250 </td><td>16.20</td><td>18.94</td></tr><tr><td>Bulgaria</td><td>2,253 </td><td>2,692 </td><td>1.32</td><td>1.58</td></tr><tr><td>Czech Republic</td><td>7,800 </td><td>8,643 </td><td>4.51</td><td>4.99</td></tr><tr><td>Denmark</td><td>35,630 </td><td>38,686 </td><td>24.22</td><td>26.70</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>25,602 </td><td>28,843 </td><td>15.35</td><td>17.47</td></tr><tr><td>Estonia</td><td>7,203 </td><td>7,084 </td><td>4.14</td><td>4.02</td></tr><tr><td>Ireland</td><td>33,575 </td><td>32,896 </td><td>20.03</td><td>20.21</td></tr><tr><td>Greece</td><td>13,462 </td><td>15,692 </td><td>7.15</td><td>8.60</td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td>18,851 </td><td>18,721 </td><td>11.61</td><td>11.55</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>22,085 </td><td>22,109 </td><td>14.61</td><td>15.32</td></tr><tr><td>Croatia</td><td>13,750 </td><td>10,423 </td><td>7.62</td><td>6.51</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>17,283 </td><td>19,015 </td><td>10.51</td><td>12.13</td></tr><tr><td>Cyprus</td><td>22,511 </td><td>18,700 </td><td>14.99</td><td>11.42</td></tr><tr><td>Latvia</td><td>7,076 </td><td>6,419 </td><td>3.88</td><td>3.50</td></tr><tr><td>Lithuania</td><td>5,725 </td><td>5,457 </td><td>3.27</td><td>3.01</td></tr><tr><td>Luxembourg</td><td>34,809 </td><td>40,342 </td><td>21.12</td><td>23.78</td></tr><tr><td>Hungary</td><td>7,053 </td><td>3,892 </td><td>4.08</td><td>2.18</td></tr><tr><td>Malta</td><td>13,022 </td><td>17,983 </td><td>6.64</td><td>8.25</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>28,494 </td><td>31,685 </td><td>19.82</td><td>21.03</td></tr><tr><td>Austria</td><td>24,903 </td><td>29,187 </td><td>14.84</td><td>17.27</td></tr><tr><td>Poland</td><td>9,183 </td><td>9,152 </td><td>5.60</td><td>5.50</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td>10,391 </td><td>11,571 </td><td>6.40</td><td>7.11</td></tr><tr><td>Romania</td><td>2,982 </td><td>2,761 </td><td>1.58</td><td>1.48</td></tr><tr><td>Slovenia</td><td>20,514 </td><td>19,961 </td><td>12.48</td><td>12.41</td></tr><tr><td>Slovakia</td><td>6,422 </td><td>7,438 </td><td>3.76</td><td>4.73</td></tr><tr><td>Finland</td><td>24,085 </td><td>27,370 </td><td>15.27</td><td>17.79</td></tr><tr><td>Sweden</td><td>26,325 </td><td>33,466 </td><td>15.26</td><td>19.01</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>28,972 </td><td>28,583 </td><td>16.48</td><td>15.87</td></tr></table>Reference period: 2008 &amp;amp; 2012.</p><p>Source: Labour Cost Survey, Eurostat.</p></reply>

The QNHS is based on a national sample of 26,000 households each quarter.  This sample of households is designed to be representative of the population at both regional (NUTS 3) and national levels and the sample selection process takes account of the distribution of the population across the country.</p>  <p>  The labour market estimates produced by the QNHS are designed to meet strict quality criteria set down by Eurostat, which specify the level of statistical accuracy that these estimates must achieve at national level.  The CSO also produces regional labour market estimates from the QNHS (NUTS 3 level) although this level of detail is not required by Eurostat.</p>  <p>  In order to produce labour market estimates at county level (NUTS 4) that would meet the same statistical standards as currently achieved for national and regional labour market statistics, it is estimated that the QNHS sample size would need to be increased by a factor of four in some counties.  Potentially this could mean an increase in the QNHS sample size nationally from 26,000 households to 104,000 households.</p>  <p>  In order to interview a sample of this size the CSO would need to increase the number of permanent field staff posts from 100 to 400 and increase the number of temporary or backup posts from 40 to 160.  The current cost of the QNHS fieldwork is approximately &euro;4m per annum, which includes fieldstaff pay, travel costs and computer hardware costs.  It is estimated that with a potential increase in the sample outlined above the cost of the QNHS could similarly increase the fieldwork costs to &euro;16m per annum.</p>  <p>  The actual level of increase required in the household sample size in each county would require a more detailed statistical examination.</p></reply>

It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Act.

A necessary first step in preparation for these commencements is the appointment of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority after which the Authority will appoint its own Chief Executive. Nominations to the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority have been received from the relevant nominating bodies as set out in the Legal Services Regulation Act. The appointment by Government of the relevant nominees under the various criteria set out in the Act will then be subject to approval by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Government will appoint one of the lay members of the Authority to be Chairperson. At the same time, preparations are also being made in support of the public recruitment, by the new Regulatory Authority, of its Chief Executive whose terms and functions are similarly set out in the 2015 Act. A start-up support team is being established and a suitable premises is being identified from which the new Authority can commence its operations. </p>  <p>  These are the initial steps that will enable the members and Chief Executive of the new Regulatory Authority to spear-head the coming into operation of the new legal services regulatory regime. This stage will also include the phased commencement of the Parts of the Act such as those dealing with legal costs, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, the Roll of Practising Barristers and Pre-Action Protocols. </p>  <p>  Following establishment of the Authority and appointment of a Chief Executive the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced. The managed commencement of these functions is planned for the Autumn in order to allow adequate time and preparation to ensure their effectiveness and success as crucial components of the new regulatory framework. It should be noted that, under the relevant transitional provisions contained in the 2015 Act, complaints already made to the Law Society under the Solicitors Acts will be brought to completion under that framework and existing law. </p>  <p>  In support of the planned and managed commencement of the relevant Parts of the 2015 Act proposed, as I have outlined, between now and the end of this year, an allocation of &euro;1 million has been made under the Justice Vote for 2016 as set-up support for the new Regulatory Authority. Any funding advanced from this allocation will be provided on a recoupable basis.  As an independent corporate body under statute the new Authority will have the power to manage the conduct of its affairs and its finances. Once in operation, the new regulatory regime will be self-funding by means of a levy on the regulated legal professions. The levy will be applied under the terms set out for that specific purpose in Part 7 of the 2015 Act. </p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review taking into account crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources. </p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner the number of Garda&iacute; and Community Garda&iacute; in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West on the 31 December 2012 to 2015 and on the 30 April 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was as set out in the following table. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers. Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 700 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 450 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year. So far 463 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 76 will attest on the 7 July with 150 more to attest in November.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; and that 41 newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the DMR West Garda Division to date.</p><p>In relation to the number of Community Garda&iacute;, it is of course, the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises. In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a point highlighted by the Garda Inspectorate in their third report entitled &quot;Policing in Ireland&mdash;Looking Forward&quot; in which they stated that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that community policing is the embodiment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, providing a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  It commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme <font color="#2F2F2F">to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000 as well as doubling the Garda Reserve and increasing the number of civilian staff so as to free-up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing.</p><p>The Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, published on 9 June 2016, places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  I welcome in particular, the proposal to establish local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to work with the community to prevent and detect crime.  The CPTs will take proactive measures to prevent crime from happening in the area. This will entail a combination of crime prevention advice, targeting and disrupting criminals through operations and patrols, and where possible diverting people from committing crime.  I also welcome the proposal to establish Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders.  The implementation of these initiatives has started and will be rolled out nationwide. </p><p>DMR West Garda Division.<table><tr><th>Date</th><th>Garda</th><th>Community</th></tr><tr><td>31/12/2012</td><td>744</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>31/12/2013</td><td>717</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>31/12/2014</td><td>699</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>31/12/2015</td><td>688</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td>30/04/2016</td><td>684</td><td>63</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Appended to this document were the Irish Prison Service's strategy for the management of older prisoners, the strategy for the management of young offenders and women offenders, the strategy for reducing re-offending by sex offenders, and the strategy for the management of prisoners requiring protection.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the actions contained in the individual strategies is ongoing at prison level. </p>  <p>  I can further advice the Deputy that in regard to younger persons, since December 2013 all boys aged 17 years sentenced to detention in St. Patrick&rsquo;s have been transferred to dedicated units in Wheatfield Place of Detention. The Irish Prison Service continues to engage extensively with the Irish Youth Justice Service regarding the transfer of responsibility for 17 year olds to Oberstown Campus in line with the Government decision to close St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. The Prisons Act 2015 was passed by the Oireachtas in December 2015 and is a significant step toward the closing of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. </p>  <p>  In relation to older persons, having cognisance of the particular needs of older people in custody all prisoners over 55 years of age now have an active nursing care plan, in which their specific needs have been identified.  This care planning process assists healthcare staff in identifying patient specific issues and arranging effective through-care on release. A survey of older prisoners has been completed and the results are currently under consideration. A Policy on the management of Older Prisoners is also currently in development.  </p>  <p>  A joint Irish Prison Psychology Service/Probation Service National Programme of Excellence is in operation between the Midlands and Arbour Hill prisons, targeting treatment efforts at moderate to high risk offenders convicted of sexual violence.  This is managed by a multi-disciplinary oversight group between both prisons, chaired by the Director of Care and Rehabilitation.</p>  <p>  Regular meetings of the Solitary Confinement Group, chaired by the Director General are held to bring about a reduction in the of prisoners on 23 hour lock up and to introduce measures to reduce the number of prisoners held on restricted regime.  Since the introduction of the Irish Prison Service Solitary Confinement Group the number of prisoners on 22/23 hour lock up has decreased by 126 or from 211 to 85 in April 2015.  An internal committee has been established to examine the area of protection in a wider context, aiming to reduce the number of prisoners seeking protection and to increase access to regimes.</p></reply>

The Women&rsquo;s Strategy sets out how the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service work together, as well as with other statutory, community and voluntary sector partners, to provide women-focused interventions to help reduce offending, improve opportunities for reintegration and to improve outcomes more generally. </p>  <p>  As part of the Joint Strategy, the Irish Prison Service made a commitment to explore the development of an open centre/open conditions for women assessed as low risk of re-offending. This commitment was acknowledged in the Report on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy who also recommended that a greater focus on step down facilities, supported accommodation, use of more community based open conditions for female offenders and the provision of an open centre for women.  </p>  <p>  A joint Irish Prison Service/Probation Service working group considered an open centre for women and decided to recommend, rather than developing an open centre for women, that a more practical and cost effective way to address the deficit is to pursue step down facilities for women. In this regard, I have given approval to the Heads of the Irish Prison Service and Probation Service to proceed to scope the possibilities for the development of step down units for female offenders and female ex-offenders.</p>  <p>  Alternatives to custody continue to be pursued and legislation has already been passed. This includes the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 which requires the sentencing judge to consider the imposition of community service where a custodial sentence of 12 months or less is being considered.  </p>  <p>  Also the Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014 provides that the Court imposing a fine shall take into account a person's financial circumstances. It further provides, inter alia, that where a person fails to pay a fine by the due date, the Court may make an attachment order to earnings as a means of recovering the unpaid fine. As a result of this legislation, it is expected that we will see a reduction in the number of committals to prisons on short sentences. </p>  <p>  To address the female accommodation within the prison estate, planning is well under way for the modernisation and expansion of facilities in Limerick Prison. Part of this redevelopment includes the provision of high quality prison accommodation for female prisoners with a capacity of approximately 50 individual cells and 8 transition units which will more than double its current capacity. </p></reply>

Harassment is deemed to occur where a person seriously interferes with the other's peace and privacy or causes alarm, distress or harm to the other.

Registration of the judgment mortgage by the PRA operates to charge the debtor's estate or interest in the land and entitles the judgment mortgagee (i.e. creditor) to apply to court for an order under section 117 of the Act, or section 31 in the case of co-owned property. A judgment mortgage remains valid until discharged and there is no need to re-register it in order to maintain its validity or enforceability.</p>  <p>  In the case of an application under section 117, the court may make such order for enforcement of the judgment mortgage as the court thinks appropriate, including an order for sale of the land and distribution of the proceeds of sale. In the case of co-owned property, section 30 of the 2009 Act provides that the registration of a judgment mortgage against the property of a joint tenant no longer severs the joint tenancy and if the joint tenancy remains unsevered, the judgment mortgage is extinguished on the death of the judgment debtor, i.e. a surviving joint tenant has no liability for debts of the deceased joint tenant against whose interest in the property the judgment mortgage was registered.</p>  <p>  A judgment mortgagee (i.e. creditor) may apply to court for an order under section 31 to enforce a judgment mortgage in the case of co-owned land. In dealing with such an application, the court may dismiss the application or, in light of the rights of all co-owners, make such order relating to the land as appears to the court to be just and equitable in the circumstances of the particular case. The wider discretion available to the court in the case of co-owned land is intended to ensure that the interests of all co-owners are taken into account in a fair and equitable manner. It should also be noted that subsection 5 of Section 31 makes it clear that this section does not affect the court's jurisdiction under the Family Home Protection Act 1976.</p>  <p>  As regards interest rates applicable in the case of judgment mortgages, I will communicate directly with the Deputy on receipt of this information.</p></reply>

The term euthanasia generally implies the intentional termination of a life by another at the request of a person wishing to die and could, therefore, be considered a form of assisted suicide.  The 1993 Act provides for a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment on conviction on indictment for assisted suicide.  The purpose of this legislation is to protect people who are nearing the end of their lives and might be vulnerable or at risk of abuse.  Prosecutions under section 2(2) are at the discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>  <p>  The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of section 2(2) in its judgment in Fleming v Ireland and Others on 29 April 2013.

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that personnel assignments throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed and are determined by a number of factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Division and Unit.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of the 30 April 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 290 Garda&iacute;, 8 Garda Reserves and 30 civilian staff assigned to the Clare Garda Division.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers. Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 700 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 450 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year. So far 463 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 76 will attest on the 7 July with 150 more to attest in November.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; and that 13 newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the Clare Garda Division to date.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme for Government, &quot;<font color="#2F2F2F">A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000, as well as doubling the Garda Reserve and increasing the number of civilian staff so as to free-up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, the current rate of recruitment will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year. We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years<b><font color="#000080">.  </font></b>My officials are<font color="#FF0000"> </font>also engaging with Garda management as a matter of priority in relation to the preparation of a recruitment plan for the next five years that will deliver increased numbers of Garda without compromising the quality of the training and supervision of new recruits.</p><p>In relation to civilian staff there is no moratorium per se on recruitment. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is subject to an employment control framework which sets out the maximum number of civilian staff it may have. It is, however, open to the Commissioner where a need is identified, to seek sanction for the recruitment of additional civilians and I understand that Garda management is currently engaged in a workforce planning exercise to identify critical gaps in its organisation with a view to seeking such sanction. In addition, as mentioned above, the Programme for Government includes a commitment to further increase the number of civilians in order to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to front-line policing duties. My officials are also engaged with Garda management in relation to the development of a plan to deliver this commitment over the life time of the Government.</p></reply>

I can confirm that this recommendation, together with the Committee's other recommendations, will be considered by the Government in the context of the formulation of an action plan to implement the Programme for Government commitments in relation to mortgage arrears.</p>  <p>  I wish also to take this opportunity to draw the Deputy's attention to the reform that I introduced in the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015 in order to further assist insolvent homeowners in mortgage arrears. The Act has introduced a new &lsquo;court review&rsquo; process applicable in cases where creditors such as a mortgage lender refuse a proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement drawn up to resolve the borrower's debts, including the mortgage on their home. Previously, the creditors&rsquo; rejection was final; under the new provision, the borrower can seek review by the court of the creditors&rsquo; refusal. The court will then consider the borrower&rsquo;s proposal using the criteria set out in the amending legislation and may, if those criteria are satisfied, impose the Personal Insolvency Arrangement proposed by the borrower. The review provision came into effect on 20 November 2015 [SI No. 514/2015].  To coincide with its introduction, the Insolvency Service of Ireland  (ISI) held a number of training sessions around the country with Personal Insolvency Practitioners (PIPs).</p>  <p>  All applications for review under the amending legislation are notified to the ISI. It has advised that 51 review applications have been notified to it as of 17 June, 4 of which have been approved and 2 of which have been rejected. A further 5 applications have been withdrawn and 5 struck out by consent, arising, it seems, from settlement negotiations between the parties. In a further 27 cases an initial hearing has been held but new affidavits or additional material has been requested and the cases have been adjourned to allow for filing of this material in advance of a full hearing.  My officials will, of course, be carefully monitoring the operation of this important reform.</p>  <p>  The Court review process is being complemented by a new scheme which provides access to independent legal and financial aid and advice for those in home mortgage arrears which I announced earlier this year. Intensive work on implementing this Aid and Advice Scheme has been under way across Government Departments and other relevant bodies. This work has been led by my Department and by the Department of Social Protection, with the participation of the ISI, the Legal Aid Board, the Citizens&rsquo; Information Board and the Money and Budgeting Service (MABS). The Scheme builds on a network of Dedicated Mortgage Arrears Advisers established in MABS offices across the country which was announced in December 2015.</p>  <p>  MABS will act as a single gateway to the new Scheme for those who are deep in debt and at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears. MABS advisers will advise these borrowers on options for returning to solvency and remaining in their homes as far as possible. This may involve obtaining financial advice from a PIP or accountant and legal aid and advice from a solicitor. The Scheme will also provide for support for insolvent borrowers in repossession proceedings under a new &lsquo;duty solicitor&rsquo; service operated by the Legal Aid Board. Work on implementation is almost complete and I expect the Scheme to become operational in the near future.</p></reply>

The programme is the outcome of a comprehensive review of foundation training for entrants to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and exemplifies best practice.</p>  <p>  Phase 1, which lasts 32 weeks, is based in the Garda College and places a strong emphasis on problem-based learning where students learn in small groups through engagement with realistic policing scenarios. This methodology emphasises the development of &lsquo;learning to learn&rsquo; skills, the development of reflective practice and supports the transition into learning in an operational policing environment.  At  the end of Phase1  successful Garda trainees are attested (i.e. become members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with full police powers) and are dispersed to Garda stations throughout the country, where they are assigned to mainstream policing duties.</p>  <p>  Phase 2, which lasts for 65 weeks, is primarily based in Garda stations with appropriate training and development structures in place that include access to a trained tutor Garda and a permanently appointed supervisory sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme. During the course of their placement, trainees move through three development stages from assisting  his or her Garda tutor to taking the lead role and being assisted by the tutor, to finally the autonomous stage where they are deployed in regular policing activity and work independently within the operational unit. Over the course of the placement they also return to the Garda College for a number to weeks to further enhance their skills in specialist areas including sexual assault, intelligence &ndash;led policing, file preparation and court presentation and so on.</p>  <p>  Phase 3 consists of seven weeks of preparation for final exams and assessments and I  look forward to the first batch of new recruits graduating from the programme this year. It is, of course, too early to conduct a formal evaluation of the new programme but I understand from those leading the programme that the feedback from managers and colleagues on the ground is positive.</p>  <p>  Participants  are required to sit mandatory academic examinations and professional assessments and  are required to pass all examinations and assessments in order to progress to the conclusion of the programme.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.</p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as of the 30 April 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 282 members assigned to the Waterford Garda Division.  Of these, there were 44 dedicated Community Garda&iacute;, 13 in Dungarvan District, 12 in Tramore District and 19 in Waterford Districts.  Of course, it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises. In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a point highlighted by the Garda Inspectorate in their third report entitled &quot;Policing in Ireland - Looking Forward&quot; in which they stated that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that community policing is the embodiment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, providing a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  It commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme <font color="#2F2F2F">to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000 as well as doubling the Garda Reserve and increasing the number of civilian staff so as to free-up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing.</p><p>The Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, published on 9 June 2016, places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  I welcome in particular the proposal to establish local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and  made up of Garda&iacute;  from across a range of areas to work with the community to prevent and detect crime.  The CPTs will take proactive measures to prevent crime from happening in the area. This will entail a combination of crime prevention advice, targeting and disrupting criminals through operations and patrols, and where possible diverting people from committing crime.  I also welcome the proposal to establish Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders.  The implementation of these initiatives has started  and will be rolled out nationwide.</p></reply>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to tackle public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities to reduce this type of behaviour and enhance community safety. The Garda approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.  The Deputy will appreciate that I do not have a role in relation to Garda policing strategies in any particular local area but have brought Deputy's specific concerns to the attention of the Garda authorities.</p>  <p>  Anyone affected by the matters referred to should, of course, contact their local Garda station. Alternatively, information can be provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by way of the Garda confidential line, 1800 666 111, which is a monitored freephone line that allows members of the public to contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with information of a confidential nature.</p>  <p>  I might add that there is a range of strong legislative provisions available to an An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and Part 13 of the Act which provide for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities as part of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will appreciate that the specific allocation of personnel and other resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, but I am assured that the Garda National Model of Community Policing continues to play a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  This commitment is also very evident in the new Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme, which was recently launched by the Commissioner, and as part of which new Community Policing Teams are to be introduced in each Garda District.</p>  <p>  Local policing measures to address the type of issues referred to by the Deputy will undoubtedly benefit from the resources now coming on stream through the Garda recruitment programme, and in particular the Government's commitment to increase Garda numbers to 15,000.  We are working on measures to accelerate this programme so as to ensure that the Commissioner has the capacity to address the needs of communities throughout the country and into the future.</p></reply>

Also any possible implication for the operation of the Common Travel Area would also have to be very carefully considered.</p>  <p>  At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments "to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons".  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.  It is open to persons in an undocumented situation to present their case on its merits, to have it considered and to abide by the decision.</p>  <p>  We are entitled to expect that people coming here will obey our laws, including those that relate to immigration.   It is open to any foreign national who finds him or herself in an undocumented situation to apply to the authorities for permission to remain.  Cases are carefully considered before a decision is made and it is reasonable for the State to expect that people will respect that decision.  It should also be remembered that most people become undocumented through their own conscious actions or omissions.  Recognising that in a minority of instances that may not be the case, the Department has operated a scheme - for those who already held an employment permit - to address the situation of those who became undocumented through no fault of their own.  All cases are dealt with on an individual basis and if the Deputy has a particular case in mind he should contact the officials in my Department with the details.</p>  <p>  Ireland has shown itself to be a country that is open to migration.  In that regard, it should be noted that over the past 5 years nearly 100,000 persons have been naturalised.</p></reply>

Details of its activities are to be found on its website www.integration.ie.</p>  <p>  OPMI chairs a Cross-Departmental Group which is tasked with preparing a Draft Migrant Integration Strategy, having engaged in a public consultation process which involved key stakeholders including relevant NGOs. This work is very advanced and I expect the strategy to be published in the Autumn.</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland is one of 27 States that participate in a refugee resettlement programme led by the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHR).  OPMI is the Irish Government Office which manages this process.  In recent years, the focus of the work of this Office has been on the resettlement of persons displaced by the Syrian conflict who are living in one of the hosting countries in the region, for example those living in Lebanon, Jordan or Turkey.  In 2015, the Office resettled 176 refugees from Jordan and Lebanon.  To date in 2016, 110 refugees have been resettled from Lebanon.  A further 247 refugees were selected during a selection mission to Lebanon in January 2016.  These cases have now been security screened and are in the process of being health screened at present.  They are expected to arrive in Ireland between July and September 2016.  Staff of OPMI have participated in selection missions to Lebanon in March and July 2015 and again in January 2016 to facilitate this process.</p>  <p>  OPMI also oversees national and European funding for the promotion of integration.  In 2014, 2015 and from January to May 2016, around &euro;3.1 million in grants has been paid, including grants for resettlement and an European Social Fund measure to improve the employment prospects of immigrants.  Preparations have been made for a call for applications under this measure which will take place in early September and for a call in respect of the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund which will take place at the same time.</p>  <p>  OPMI also participates in EU and international fora relevant to its responsibilities including the EU National Contact points on Integration (now called the European Migration Forum) and the Forum on Resettlement and Relocation.</p></reply>

However, Insurance Ireland has further stated that if the individual can produce confirmation that they were continually insured and are claims free in their own name while they were away, this would be taken into consideration. </p>  <p>  My Department has embarked on a review of policy in the insurance sector which is being undertaken in consultation with the Central Bank and other Departments and Agencies.  The objective of the Review is to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector.  </p>  <p>  The first phase of the Review is focussed on the motor insurance compensation framework and this work is nearing completion.  The next phase of the Review involves examining the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance and identifying what short-term measures can be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  Work on the Review of Policy in the Insurance sector will continue over the coming months and it will include an examination of the issues affecting persons returning from abroad when they attempt to obtain motor insurance.</p>  <p>  I would also add that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance. In the event that a person is unable to obtain a quotation for motor insurance or feels that the premium proposed or the terms are so excessive that it amounts to a refusal to give them motor insurance, they should contact Insurance Ireland, 5 Harbourmaster Place, IFSC, Dublin 1, Telephone +353 1 6761820 quoting the Declined Cases Agreement.  </p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, there is a commitment in the PPG  to ask the Oireachtas to continue to phase out the USC as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan that keeps the tax base broad, reduces excessive tax rates for middle income earners, and limits the benefit for high earners.  Reductions will be introduced on a fair basis with an emphasis on low and middle income earners. </p><p>The PPG states that reductions in personal tax rates - such as the phasing out of the USC needed to reward work and support enterprise and employment will be funded largely through:</p><p>-  Extra revenues from not indexing personal tax credits and bands</p><p>-  The removal of PAYE tax credit for high earners and other measures to ensure the tax system remains fair and progressive</p><p>-  Higher excise duties on cigarettes and increased enforcement and sanctions on the illegal importation and sale of cigarettes</p><p>-  Increased enforcement and sanctions on fuel laundering</p><p>-  A new tax on sugar sweetened drinks</p><p>-  Improving tax compliance</p><p>Work on development of the medium-term income tax reform plan is ongoing and as such the expected cost is not yet finalised.  It is due to be published for consultation with the Oireachtas Committee on Finance in July, and for approval by the Oireachtas in October.</p><p>The revenue to be raised by planned offsetting tax changes, such as a sugar-sweetened drinks tax for example, will depend on, among other things, the rate at which the tax is set and the scope of its application.  These issues are budgetary matters which will be determined through the budgetary process.</p><p>The income tax reform plan will aim to support job creation and reward work which is a key driver of growth and prosperity in the economy.  In developing the plan, available resources will be a key consideration along with safeguarding the economic stability of the public finances and the wider economy.</p></reply>

The scope and direction of the work of the URSG is a matter, in the first instance, for the new Minister for Social Protection, Mr. Leo Varadkar TD, who has indicated that the development of a universal retirement savings system will be a priority for his Department.</p>  <p>  The development of a system, as referred to above, would be a long-term project which, in order to be successful, would have to involve appropriate decisions being taken by Government over time on detailed key design, operational and administrative structures.  Among the many issues that would have to be decided, in this context, is the extent and nature of any State support for pension savers in such a system.  While I see no reason, at this point, to change from the marginal rate relief incentive on pension contributions which applies for current pension savers, arguments have been put forward in the past, for example, for a system of direct subvention or matching contributions to pension savings to be made by the State as opposed to the provision of tax relief.  I would be open to examining and considering, without prejudice, any case that might be made in this regard and this is what the reference to "other State incentive" in the briefing document is getting at.</p>  <p>  As regards the sustainability of current pension tax reliefs, I would point out that the estimated annual cost of tax reliefs on pension contributions, based on the statistical data published by the Revenue Commissioners and available on the Revenue website, has fallen considerably in the period since 2008.  Among the reasons for this, is the range of measures taken over the years to restrict the reliefs on pension contributions, particularly for higher earners.</p></reply>

However, it would appear to refer primarily to a proposal to allow tax relief on the capital repayment element of a loan for new social housing.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I introduced a new tax relief in Finance Act 2015 which allows a full 100% mortgage interest deduction where a landlord undertakes, for a period of at least three years, to provide accommodation to tenants in receipt of social housing supports.  This is in place of the 75% cap on mortgage interest relief deductibility which normally applies in respect of rented residential properties.  The relief is designed to incentivise landlords to commit to letting their property to tenants in receipt of social housing supports over the longer term, thereby improving the stability of supply of property to such tenants. </p>  <p>  This relief was one element of an overall package of measures designed by the Government aimed at stabilising rent and boosting supply in the housing market which, in my view, is the most appropriate and effective route to addressing rental price increases driven by supply constraints.  To extend this relief further to allow for a deduction for the capital repayment element of a mortgage, as proposed in the Deputy's question, would in effect see the State fully subsidise the purchase by a private individual of a residential rental investment property.  I do not believe that this would be an appropriate use of State resources at this time.</p>  <p>  In relation to social housing, the Deputy will be aware that there are a number of non-tax commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government, including a commitment to significantly increase and expedite the delivery of social housing units.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p>  <p> -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p> -  be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p> -  be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p> -  be without one or both legs;</p>  <p> -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p> -  have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p>  <p>  The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Scheme.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;50.3 million to the Exchequer in 2015, an increase from &euro;48.6 million in 2014.  These figures do not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I am aware that the Ombudsman has made comments regarding the eligibility criteria of the Disabled Driver and Disabled Passengers Scheme.  The Ombudsman stated that, in his opinion, the criteria were narrowly focused and prescriptive.  The Scheme and qualifying criteria were designed specifically for those with severe physical disabilities and are, therefore, necessarily precise.</p>  <p>  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities.  I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria.  While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

Since October 2015, investigations in three other Member States have concluded.  In each of these cases the Commission found that the Member States granted an illegal State Aid to the companies in question.</p>  <p>  While the Commission has opened a formal investigation in relation to one particular case involving Ireland, it has not made a final determination in the matter.  While there is no formal timeline for a when the final decision will be made in our case, I am aware of speculation about a possible decision in July.</p>  <p>  This a priority matter and Ireland has co-operated fully with the process to date and will continue to do so.  My Department has engaged closely with the Commission throughout this process.  Detailed and comprehensive responses have been provided to the Commission demonstrating that the appropriate amount of Irish tax was charged in accordance with the relevant legislation, that no selective advantage was given and that there was no State Aid.</p>  <p>  I remain of the view that there was no breach of State Aid rules in this case and that the legislative provisions were correctly applied.  In the event that the Commission forms the view that there was state aid, Ireland is entitled to challenge this decision in the European Courts.  As the Government has already indicated, we will take that course of action, if necessary, to continue to vigorously defend the Irish position.</p></reply>

Principal among them is the prospect of the UK voting to leave the European Union. </p>  <p>  An assessment of the potential economic impact of such an outcome is set out below.</p>  <p>  Recently published work by both the UK Treasury and the UK's National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) using model based analysis suggest that a vote to leave the EU could reduce UK GDP by between 2.3 and 6.0 per cent, relative to baseline, under a range of scenarios. </p>  <p>  In relation to the impact for Ireland, estimates made using the ESRI HERMES model suggest that a 1 per cent reduction in UK GDP would reduce Irish GDP by approximately 0.2 per cent, relative to baseline, over two years.  This implies a possible fall in Irish GDP relative to baseline in the range of 0.5 to 1.2 per cent based on Treasury and NIESR estimates. </p>  <p>  A shock to UK GDP would also be expected to impact on our other trading partners.  Estimates from the ESRI HERMES model suggest that if euro area GDP were to also fall by 1 per cent, a level estimated in the Treasury's "severe scenario", Irish GDP would fall by a further 0.4 per cent relative to baseline. </p>  <p>  Separately, both UK reports predict a depreciation of sterling in the event of a vote to leave.  An assessment of the impact of a 5 per cent sterling depreciation, was  presented in the 2016 Stability Programme Update published in April, and indicated a loss in Irish GDP of 1 per cent after 2 years.  This result also incorporates the impact on Ireland of wider spillover effects on the global economic environment from a sterling depreciation.</p>  <p>  In addition to the macroeconomic assessments set out above, it must also be recognised that a UK decision to leave the EU will increase short term uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets potentially leading to negative outcomes internationally and in Ireland beyond those set out above.</p></reply>

Nominal GDP, in turn, is determined by both real economic activity and the GDP deflator - which measures price changes in the economy as whole. All else being equal, a lower than expected pace of inflation will lower the GDP deflator which, for any given level of debt, will mechanically increase the debt-to-GDP ratio relative to baseline i.e. compared to what it would have been otherwise.</p>  <p>  My Department's macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts, as published in the Stability Programme Update (SPU) in April of this year, show overall nominal GDP growth of 7.6 per cent this year and 4 &frac34; per cent over the medium term, with the GDP deflator increasing by 2.6 per cent and 1&frac14; per cent, respectively, over the same period.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the yield from this charge in 2015 was &euro;424.13 million.</p>  <p>  The Financial Institutions Levy I announced as part of Budget 2014 is a revenue raising measure which provides for a contribution from the banking sector to Ireland's economic recovery.  The levy is in place for the years 2014 to 2016 inclusive with an anticipated annual yield of &euro;150 million.  As the levy is a percentage of an institution's DIRT liability in 2011, liability to the levy relates to the size of an institution's Irish operation.  The entire banking system has been underpinned by the strong Government support provided both here and abroad and I believe it is appropriate therefore that the banking sector should make a contribution to the State's economic recovery.  Accordingly, I announced in my Budget 2016 statement that I propose to extend the levy out to 2021, subject to a review taking place of the methodology used to calculate the levy.  This will bring in an additional &euro;750 million over the period, which is a very significant additional contribution to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  In relation to discussions at EU level, the Government's position is that a Financial Transactions Tax  would be best applied on a wide international basis to include the major financial centres to prevent the danger of activities gravitating to jurisdictions where taxes are not levied on financial transactions.  Notwithstanding this, the Government is not prepared to stand in the way of EU Member States that wish to work together to implement a Financial Transactions Tax and in this regard adoption of a decision formally authorising enhanced cooperation took place during the Irish Presidency of the EU in January 2013.</p>  <p>  The proposal for a Directive from the European Commission in the area of financial transaction tax was published in February 2013.  Ireland had many concerns about the proposal as drafted, not least of which were the potential impacts on, and the trading of, Irish Sovereign debt in the secondary market and in total, the potential negative impact on the liquidity of the financial sector as a whole.  Members of the Economic and Financial Sub-Committee on EU Sovereign Debt Markets have stated that the introduction of the FTT would have a significantly negative effect on Sovereign Debt Markets and may impair the good-functioning of secondary markets for sovereign debt resulting in reduced liquidity, reduced investor demand and therefore higher financing costs for States.</p>  <p>  Our concerns are widely shared amongst the Member States, including some of the participating countries.  These concerns have led to the issuing of a communique by the participating Member States, announcing that they have agreed to implement a financial transaction tax in a progressive manner, with the first step being a charge on shares and some derivatives. </p>  <p>  More recently on 17th June 2016 the ECOFIN Council discussed the current state of play with regard to the proposal of a number of Member States to introduce a financial transaction tax.  In the context of this discussion, ten of the original eleven Member States (Estonia has indicated that it no longer supports the proposal), issued a statement setting out their agreement on the core design principles of an FTT.  The statement indicates that further reassurances were needed on two issues in particular, for which two task forces will be immediately set up.  First, taxation of derivatives should not have a negative impact on public borrowing costs.  Second, tax collection should be cost-effective.  The outcome of these two task forces will be discussed in September. </p>  <p>  There is still uncertainty therefore as to the form the FTT might take and more detail would be needed on the final shape of the tax before a definitive conclusion could be reached about its impact on Irish taxation revenue.</p></reply>

It has made positive progress on arrears reductions, with great than 90 day arrears in Homeloans c. 46% below peak levels in 2013.   PTSB returned to underlying profitability in 2015 for the first time since 2007 and it announced that it was profitable and capital generative in Q1, 2016 (&euro;39m Profit Before Tax).  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the positive progress made PTSB in many areas it's share price has fallen c 57% to date in 2016.  The share price has been under pressure for a myriad of reasons including, but not limited to, the lower interest rate environment, the delayed disposal of CHL due to the UK referendum, increasing regulatory costs, the Central Bank tracker mortgage review, extension of the Bank Levy and higher provisions and lower growth in new lending than the market anticipated.  I have also been informed that some investors are concerned about the policy that might be pursued by the new Government in relation to banking and the attitude of the Oireachtas to issues around mortgage interest rates.  Equity research analysts covering PTSB have written about this topic in detail recently.</p>  <p>  I am of the view that the best way to protect the value of the  State's shareholding is to ensure PTSB continues the progress it has made with a view to reaching sustainable operating profitability and an adequate Return on Equity (ROE) as soon as possible while striving to meet the terms of the European Commission restructuring plan. </p>  <p>  While I am strongly supportive of Permanent TSB in the delivery of their strategy I cannot discount the possibility that a strategic transaction could arise opportunistically at any time involving PTSB which could be in the best interests of the State.  As part of their day-to-day role officials in the Shareholding Management Unit will consider all credible proposals and develop strategic options relating to our banking investments and will also consider from time to time whether the sale of shares by way of placing would be beneficial for the State.  Having said that I have no current plans to sell shares in PTSB, notwithstanding the flexibility to do so within the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  As I have stated previously I would like to see more competition in the domestic banking system to provide the lending required for our growing economy and this could be achieved through new entrants or the continued growth of our domestic banks.</p></reply>

Given that financial consumer protection law is contained within national and European legislation, its consolidation would be an extremely large and complex piece of work and is not something that is currently planned. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that there is already a large and heavy agenda in the area of consumer protection legislation.  </p>  <p>  By way of example, as you know the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was enacted on 8 July 2015.  It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated entity. </p>  <p>  In the area of residential mortgages, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (SI 142/16) have transposed the Mortgage Credit Directive into Irish law.  This Directive provides that certain minimum consumer information and protection measures such as the provision of standardised pre-contractual information, common requirements for the calculation of the APRC, the requirement on a lender to conduct a credit worthiness assessment prior to offering mortgage credit are to apply across the EU.  The Deputy may wish note that Directive also places an onus on the EU Commission to undertake a review of the effectiveness and appropriateness of the Directive's provisions on consumers and the internal market by 2019.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, there are a number of projects being progressed by my Department at present.  By way of illustration, the Payment Accounts Directive must be transposed by 18 September 2016.  The main elements of the Payment Accounts Directive focus on transparency and comparability of payment account fees, payment account switching, and access to payment accounts with basic features for all EU consumers.  The Directive also allows Member States to take additional measures to ensure access to basic payment accounts for unbanked, vulnerable consumers. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) aims to further develop the aims of the first Payment Services Directive (PSD1) by regulating new market players, enhancing consumer protection, ensuring competition within the industry whilst maintaining a level playing field, and harmonising the regulations across Europe.

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit servicing firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which comes into operation on 1 July 2016.</p>  <p>  Our continued commitment on this issue is underlined by the Programme for a Partnership Government which provides that "we will ask the Central Bank and the Oireachtas Committee on Housing to examine the legislation introduced last year that ensured that borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale.  We will provide greater protection for mortgage holders and tenants and SMEs whose loans have been transferred to non-regulated entities ('vulture funds')."   This is a Year 1 Action in the Programme.  The nature of any proposed changes will be decided after further consideration of the issues.</p></reply>

IAS 39 provided that assets must be valued at a point in time and it did not allow for the provision of potential future losses which was highlighted by the financial crisis, as noted by the Banking Inquiry.  I understand that IAS 39 is being replaced by IFRS 9.  The package of improvements introduced by IFRS 9 includes a logical model for classification and measurement, a single, forward-looking 'expected loss' impairment model and a substantially-reformed approach to hedge accounting.  IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Central Bank has issued regulations aimed at protecting SMEs when dealing with regulated and unregulated firms as set out below. </p>  <p>  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was enacted on 8 July 2015.  It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland. </p>  <p>  Also, following a review in 2015, the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises, has been strengthened in certain areas resulting in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which comes into operation on 1 July 2016.  </p>  <p>  It is widely recognised that the financial crisis of the previous decade uncovered significant deficiencies in the financial regulatory and supervisory framework and its operation.  These have been the subject of extensive and objective analysis.  The reports from Professor Patrick Honohan, Regling and Watson, and the Nyberg commission point out the problems to be addressed.  A significant amount of legislation has been enacted at national and EU level to deal with these issues.</p>  <p>  The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) transfers key supervisory tasks for significant banks in the euro area to the European Central Bank, which means additional oversight beyond national Central Banks.  </p>  <p>  At a national level, there has been a substantial increase in the Central Bank's staff resources, particularly in the area of regulation and the revised Central Bank Acts have enhanced peer review and independent oversight arrangements for the Central Bank's operations.</p></reply>

Pending the outcome of this consultation, the exact timing of the making of the final regulations remains to be finalised.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that following the making of the regulations the take on of data will be implemented on a phased basis, with Phase 1 focusing on lending to consumers and Phase 2 focusing on lending to businesses.  It is expected that data submissions by lenders will commence six months after the finalisation of regulations but the final deadline for data submission will be influenced by the scale of the technical and operational changes to be implemented by over 500 lenders.  Enquiries by lenders against CCR data are expected to commence around twelve months after the finalisation of regulations and once data quality has been assured. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank will own the CCR data and it will act as data controller under the Data Protection Acts.  Following a public procurement process in 2014, the Central Bank appointed CRIF Ireland Limited as its agent to build and operate the CCR on its behalf.  The Bank and CRIF continue to work closely together on the project implementation and on-going operations of the CCR.</p></reply>

Section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003 provides for 'agricultural relief'.  The relief takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable market value of the gifted or inherited agricultural property.</p>  <p>  The person taking the gift or inheritance (the 'beneficiary') of the agricultural property must qualify as a 'farmer' for the purpose of section 89 CATCA 2003.  This means that a beneficiary's agricultural property must comprise at least 80% by gross market value of the beneficiary's total property at a particular date.  The Revenue Commissioners take the view that land on which solar panels are installed is not agricultural property for the purpose of establishing whether or not a beneficiary satisfies this '80%' test.  Thus, depending on the amount of an individual's land that is actually occupied by solar panels (and not merely subject to an option over the land), the use of agricultural land for a solar farm may result in a beneficiary's failure to satisfy the '80%' test and to qualify for agricultural relief. </p>  <p>  A condition for agricultural relief that applies in relation to gifts and inheritances taken on or after 1 January 2015 is that a beneficiary, or a lessee where the beneficiary leases the agricultural land, must actually farm the land for a period of at least 6 years after taking the gift or inheritance.  It is unlikely that the ability to farm the land would be affected by the granting of an option over the land to a solar farm developer or the registration of a burden over the land with the Land Registry.  However, the ability to farm the land would be affected where the option is exercised by the solar farm developer and solar panels are actually installed.  As it would not generally be possible to farm any part of the land occupied by a solar farm, the change in the use of land from farming to the generation of solar energy within the required 6-year period would result in a withdrawal of some, or all, of any agricultural relief that had been granted, depending on how much of the land is diverted to this alternative use.</p></reply>

The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks.    </p>  <p>  The question of the cost of insurance is a complex one involving a number of Government Departments, State Bodies and private sector organisations and while the provision and the pricing of insurance policies is a commercial matter for insurance companies, this does not preclude the Government from introducing measures that may, in the longer term, lead to a better claims environment that could facilitate a reduction in claims costs.</p>  <p>  My Department has embarked on a review of policy in the insurance sector which is being undertaken in consultation with the Central Bank and other Departments and Agencies.  The objective of the Review is to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector.  </p>  <p>  The first phase of the Review is focussed on the motor insurance compensation framework and this work is nearing completion.  The next phase of the Review involves examining the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance and aims to identify what short-term measures can be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  Work on the Review of Policy in the Insurance sector will continue over the coming months.</p>  <p>  I would also add that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  In the event that a person is unable to obtain a quotation for motor insurance or feels that the premium proposed or the terms are so excessive that it amounts to a refusal to give them motor insurance, they should contact Insurance Ireland, 5 Harbourmaster Place, IFSC, Dublin 1, Telephone +353 1 6761820 quoting the Declined Cases Agreement.  </p></reply>

In the early years the payments are higher than the cost of the policy holder's benefits.  The extra money paid goes into the plan fund.  Protection benefits get more expensive as policy holders get older; usually as the plan progresses the payments begin to equal the cost of the chosen benefits.  In the later years of reviewable protection plans, the cost of the benefits increases significantly.

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Under the 2015 Act, therefore, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.  Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract. </p>  <p>  Also, following a review in 2015, the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises, has been strengthened in certain areas resulting in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which comes into operation on 1 July 2016.  </p></reply>

The Tax Briefing also lists a number of activities which are not considered to be a profession. </p></reply>

The NCSE makes such allocations in accordance with my Departments criteria for the scheme.</p><p>Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website <i>www.education.ie</i>, sets out my Department's policy in relation to the Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme.  The Circular explains that SNA support is not provided to pre-school services which operate outside of the primary or special school provision, other than in early intervention classes in recognised primary schools, or special schools, where support is provided for as part of the schools total quantum of SNA support. </p><p>The vast majority of supports for childcare, including pre-school education, are provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The principal vehicle for the delivery of pre-school education is the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which was introduced in January 2010 and provides for early learning in a formal setting to children in the year before they commence primary school.</p><p>Children with disabilities will now have better access to pre-school services under a new Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) programme of supports, which was recently announced, on 15th June 2016, by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, depending on the needs of the child and the pre-school.  The supports include: A new Inclusion Charter for the Early Years sector, alongside updated and strengthened Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Guidelines for Early Childhood Care and Education.  A new higher education programme for early years practitioners (LINC) which will commence from September 2016.  A new national specialist service which is based in the Better Start National Early Years Quality Development Service will provide expert advice, mentoring and support to pre-school providers from a team of 50 specialists in early years care and education for children with disabilities.  A new national scheme will provide specialised equipment, appliances and minor alterations which are necessary to support a child's participation in the ECCE programme.  A new national scheme will also provide additional capitation to pre-school providers where this is critical to fund extra support in the classroom and enable a child's participation in pre-school.  It is estimated that only 1 to 1.5% of children in pre-school will require, and therefore be eligible for, this scheme of additional capitation.  Details of the supports which will be available under AIM can be found at <i>www.preschoolaccess.ie</i>which contains comprehensive information on the access and inclusion model and on how to apply for the new schemes and supports.</p><p>Questions relating to provision of such services in pre school settings should be addressed my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p></reply>

This Government has also committed to increase the number of HSE speech and language therapists by some 25%, bringing the number up to 1,102.</p>  <p>  Officials of my Department will meet counterparts in the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs and the HSE in the coming weeks to consider the proposals and to commence the development of an implementation plan to give effect to the commitment.</p>  <p>  Schools are currently encouraged to use Individual Education Plans (IEP) through policy guidance, support, training and inspection. The DES Inspectorate's advice is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education planning for children with special needs. </p>  <p>  DES Circular 30/2014 in relation to the SNA scheme also requires schools to provide personalised pupil plans for new pupils for whom SNA support is being applied for.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware each special class for autism at primary level has a 6:1 pupil teacher ratio and also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 SNAs for a class of 6 children. </p>  <p>  Scoil Cara has 10 classes with 60 students enrolled  for 2016/2017 school year supported by an Administrative Principal, class teachers and SNAs.  The NCSE has also allocated additional SNAs to this school to meet the complex needs of the students enrolled.  This level of educational support significantly exceeds the resource allocation provision currently available to any mainstream school in the State and is fully consistent with the resource levels provided for other special schools in the State.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the proposed development of in-school provision, supported by the proposed additional resources and the re-configuration of HSE multi-disciplinary geographically based teams in all regions across the country, will ensure that services for children with disabilities will be significantly improved.</p></reply>

The new placement process is based on the development of a partnership approach between Higher Education Institutions and schools. Much progress has been made towards the development of that partnership approach. Based on engagement with the Higher Education Authority, the Teaching Council has identified the need for a forum that includes all HEIs providing programmes of ITE in Ireland, and a clear, time bound commitment to agreeing practical measures, including a national IT-based system, that will enhance the school placement experience for all parties to the process, and facilitate access by students to opportunities for same.

My Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide. The system uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and information from my own Department's databases. With this information, nationwide demographic exercises are carried out to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary levels.</p>  <p>  When it is decided that a new school is required to meet demographic needs in an area, the Department runs a separate patronage process to decide who will operate the school. It is open to all patrons and prospective patrons to apply for patronage of the school under this process and the level of parental preference for each patron is key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process. </p>  <p>  With regard to the decision on the patronage of the new school which will open this September to serve the Drumcondra/Marino/Dublin 1 area, my Department assessed the applications received from the prospective patrons, including examining the parental preferences received in the applications to ensure they represented children living within the school planning area which will be served by this school.  My Department prepared an assessment report for the consideration of the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG) which then submitted a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision. The patronage assessment report which is published on my Department's website, while indicating substantial support for an Irish medium school, reflects nearly twice as many valid preferences for an Educate Together school in this area as for a Gaelscoil under the patronage of An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta.  I accepted the recommendation of the NSEG and the patronage of the new school remains as announced. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, there are currently three Gaelscoileanna operating within the school planning area.</p>  <p>  The NSEG, in their report to me, noted the strong level of demand from parents for Irish medium education in the area and recommended that this should be kept under review in the context of future demographic exercises.  My Department continues to keep the demographic data for the area under ongoing review to take into account updated child benefit data and enrolment data and the impact of ongoing and planned capacity increases in this and adjacent school planning areas.  </p></reply>

In this regard, prospective patrons must collect and demonstrate evidence of the level of parental demand for their preferred model of provision and medium of instruction, English or Irish, as part of their application under this process.</p>  <p>  In this context, I recently announced the patronage of the three new primary schools which will open in September of this year.  The outcome of the patronage process is that, Educate Together, a multi-denominational provider, is patron of the two new schools to serve the Cabra/Phibsborough/Dublin 7 area and the Drumcondra/Marino/Dublin 1 area and An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta is the patron of the new school to serve the Goatstown/Stillorgan school planning area, providing education through the medium of Irish.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently carrying out an analysis of the applications received for the patronage of the nine new post-primary schools which will open in coming years -  six in September 2017 and three in September 2018.  In line with the arrangements referred to above, prospective patrons were required to submit with their application a parental preference template in which parents have been requested to state their preference for their child(ren) to be educated through the medium of English or Irish.  On completion of this assessment, my Department will draft a report for the consideration of the New Schools Establishment Group who will submit a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.</p></reply>

The specific YEI funding allocation for Ireland of &euro;68m is matched by equal amounts from our ESF allocation and from the Exchequer, giving an overall allocation of &euro;204m. The rules governing the ESF provide for initial pre-financing of EU support at 1% (or 1.5% for Member States under financial assistance) of the full programme support, payable for each year from 2014 to 2016.  However, in order to mobilise faster YEI actions on the ground, the initial pre-financing of the YEI EU support was exceptionally increased to 30% in 2015.  Accordingly Ireland received additional YEI pre-financing of &euro;19.8m.  The Regulations providing for this exceptional increase also specified that where a Member State did not submit an interim payment application by 23 May 2016 for at least 50% of the additional pre-financing amount, that the Member State must reimburse the Commission the total YEI pre-financing contribution.  As work on the designation of the relevant ESF authorities, including the provision of a national computerised accounting and information system for EU funds to meet the 2014-2020 functionality requirements is continuing, Ireland did not comply with the requirement to submit an interim claim by the due date.  In accordance with the relevant Regulations, the &euro;19.8m additional pre-financing received and currently held in a Suspense Account, is to be reimbursed to the Commission.  My Department is liaising with the Commission in this regard.  However, it should be noted that the reimbursement of this pre-financing will not result in any loss of EU monies to the Exchequer, as the full YEI allocation of &euro;68m to Ireland will still be available for drawdown before year-end 2018, and it is expected that this funding will be fully drawn down.  Furthermore, as the activities concerned are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer there is no resulting reduction in the funding available to those activities.<table><tr><th>Youth Employment Initiative</th><th>Funding (&euro;m)</th></tr><tr><td>Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) Scheme</td><td>4.648</td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus Incentive Scheme</td><td>7.992</td></tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s</td><td>35.347</td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme</td><td>57.240</td></tr><tr><td>Youthreach</td><td>79.876</td></tr><tr><td>Momentum</td><td>13.333</td></tr><tr><td>Social Inclusion and Activation Programme (SICAP)</td><td>6.000</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>204.436</td></tr></table></p></reply>

With regard to the institute of technology sector, the Strategy recommended significant reforms to position the sector to meet national strategic objectives.  In particular, the Strategy recommended consolidation within the sector and a pathway of evolution for those consolidated institutes of technology, to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against robust performance criteria and to apply to become technological universities.</p><p>  Mission of Technological Universities: The intention has always been that a Technological University would be distinctly different from traditional universities and institutes of technology by virtue of their mission relating to graduate formation, applied research and scholarship, dissemination of knowledge to meet the needs of society and enterprise with a very strong regional focus.  However, the mission of a university in Ireland as set out in the 1997 Universities Act is broad and comprehensive and as such it is not surprising that there may be some evidence of some elements of overlap between a University and an Institute of Technology or Technological University.</p><p>  This differentiated mission for a Technological University includes a systematic focus on the preparation of graduates for complex professional roles in a changing technological world, the advancement of knowledge through applied research and scholarship and the dissemination of this knowledge to meet the needs of society and enterprise, and the particular contribution the university will make to the needs of the region in which it is located.</p><p>  There is no point in making the TU project a simple renaming exercise and falling into traps seen in similar processes in other countries. The institutions concerned are required to achieve high standards across a range of areas before being designated as technological universities. These include standards relating to the qualifications of staff, the quality of research output, the proportion of students engaged in lifelong learning, and other relevant issues.</p><p>  The following is a list of some of the key features expected of a Technological University: the range of teaching provision (levels 6-10), with the associated scope for progression via appropriate pathways; the strength of provision for work based, and lifelong, learning; the weight of postgraduate research activity relative to that in Institutes of Technology; the key role of experienced practitioners in teaching and research; very close employer links with involvement in curriculum design, teaching and supervision; a strong vocational/professional orientation; a strong regional as well as a wider focus; highly developed responsiveness and flexibility in delivery, with demand (via feedback from employers) as a key driver; and an approach to research that entails building strength in focused areas in close partnership with users.</p><p>  The mission and vision for each of the individual proposed technological universities is developed by the consortia, in consultation with stakeholders including staff and students, and is contained in the implementation plans subsequently developed. </p><p>  Regional Focus: There will also be a specific focus on the particular contribution the university will make to the needs of the region in which it is located.  The development of technological universities has the potential to deliver greater opportunity to students in these regions, to staff working in the institutions, and to the broader local economy and society.  </p><p>Position of Technological Universities Bill: The first Government Legislative Programme of this new Partnership Government was published on 8 June 2016, and the Technological Universities Bill has been restored to the D&aacute;il Order Paper at Committee Stage.</p><p>  I recognise that there were a significant number of matters raised in respect of the Bill at both Committee and Report Stage.  It is my intention to now consult with all of the relevant stakeholders in relation to both the matters raised during the legislative process and the commitments contained in the Programme for Government.</p><p>  Following the finalisation of this consultation process I will then advance the legislation having determined a position in relation to any matters raised as part of this consultation process.</p></reply>

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.  </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.  </p>  <p>  I would advise if there are concerns in relation to the educational development of any student that these should be raised, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he/she is attending, with a view to the Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist.  In this regard where it is agreed that an assessment is appropriate it is conducted within an average of six weeks.</p></reply>

The NCSE will consider these applications and make further allocations to schools in respect of valid applications which have been received to September. </p><p>  As the Deputy's question relates to the number of invalid applications received, additional to the allocations made, for resource hours and SNA support, I have referred this question to the NCSE for their consideration and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, neither I nor my Department has any direct role in monitoring or supervising the delivery of water services or any pollution incidents arising therefrom.  Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels for public water services, including the delivery of water services capital infrastructure, encompassing the management of urban waste water collection and treatment infrastructure. All discharges to the aquatic environment from sewerage systems owned, managed and operated by Irish Water require a waste water discharge licence or certificate of authorisation from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the authorisation process provides for the EPA to place stringent conditions on the operation of such discharges to ensure that potential effects on the receiving water bodies are strictly limited and controlled.</p><p>The EPA is a key statutory body for investigating complaints of pollution and for the enforcement , both directly and through oversight of local authorities, of environmental legislation in Ireland, including compliance in relation to licensed urban waste water discharges. Details of all prosecutions taken by the EPA for pollution incidents and details of its enforcement activities are published on the EPA&rsquo;s website ().</p><p>The EPA&rsquo;s Bathing Water Quality Report for 2015 identifies several bathing waters adjacent to urban areas as being prone to episodic pollution events and being of less than &lsquo;good&rsquo; water quality status. These pollution events are generally associated with overflows from pumping stations or storm outfalls as a result of sewer network blockages or following heavy rainfall. The EPA report highlights that significant infrastructural investment will be required to reduce the likelihood of recurrence of pollution events in these urban areas.</p><p>The imposition of bathing prohibitions by local authorities in the event of discharges or following intense localised rainfall is done with regard to public health on a precautionary principle. All such incidents are reported to the EPA&rsquo;s wastewater enforcement system and are publicised on the SPLASH website at , which is the national bathing water information website for identified bathing waters around Ireland.</p></reply>

Those allocations and associated targets for each local authority, including Kerry which has an allocation for this purpose of some &euro;62 million, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p><i></i>.</p><p>Following this notification of targets, announcements for substantial new social housing projects were made in May 2015, in July 2015 and in January 2016, on the basis of project proposals made the local authorities, including Kerry County Council. Between these three announcements, almost &euro;680 million has been allocated for over 3,900 social housing new builds, turnkey developments and acquisitions. Details of these project approvals, including those for Kerry, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links: <ul><li><a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/Housing/News/MainBody,41340,en.htm">http://www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/Housing/News/MainBody,41340,en.htm</a></li><li><a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/Housing/News/MainBody,42225,en.htm">http://www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/Housing/News/MainBody,42225,en.htm</a></li><li><a href="http://www.environ.ie/housing/social-housing/ministers-kelly-coffey-announce-further-1000-social-housing-units">http://www.environ.ie/housing/social-housing/ministers-kelly-coffey-announce-further-1000-social-housing-units</a></li></ul></p><p>I am keen that all local authorities, including KerryCounty Council, advance these projects as soon as possible and I have assured them that funding is available to fully support their efforts in this regard. Across the range of schemes under the social housing programme, my Department provided over &euro;11.9 million to Kerry County Council in 2015. I expect funding drawdown to increase as the construction projects are advanced by the local authorities and approved housing bodies. While social housing construction projects are being advanced, acquisitions of new and second-hand houses and apartments remain an effective means of meeting immediate social housing need. In 2015, Kerry County Councilsecured the purchase of 29<font color="#FF0000"> </font>housing units. In addition, under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme, approved housing bodies can purchase, lease or construct housing units and make them available for social housing; 51 new units became operational for Kerry under this programme in 2015. </p><p>The funding provided also includes allocations to local authorities under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS). The Scheme provides social housing support for persons who are in receipt of long-term rent supplement and information on the amounts paid to local authorities, including Kerry Council, can be found at the following link on my Department&rsquo;s website: <i></i><font color="#1F497D">.</font></p><p><font color="#1F497D">  </font></p><p><font color="#FF0000"> </font></p></reply>

The Guidelines require planning authorities to frame their local planning policies in a balanced and measured way that ensures that the housing requirements arising from rural communities are met on the one hand , while avoiding excessive urban generated housing and ribbon development on the other hand. The Guidelines also aim at ensuring that sites developed for rural housing purposes are suitable with regard to access, wastewater disposal, landscape and design perspectives.</p><p>The Guidelines further elaborate on the physical development policies for rural areas as set out in the National Spatial Strategy (2002) which, <i>inter alia</i>, promotes sustainable rural settlement as a key component of delivering more balanced regional development.</p><p>It is therefore a matter for individual planning authorities to prepare their development plans and the policies contained within such plans , taking account of local and varying geographical and landscape circumstances as well as the approaches set out under the Guidelines.  Furthermore, it is a matter for individual planning authorities as well as An Bord Plean&aacute;la to implement the Guidelines and local planning policies within the assessment of individual planning applications and appeals under the development management process.</p><p>Given the need for local authorities to respond to local circumstance s in the implementation of the Guidelines, I consider that the Guidelines strike a reasonable balance between setting out overall national policies and the application of those policies locally.

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme. To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum.</p><p>The new scheme is a national scheme and the terms and conditions are set down in Part 3 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 and prescribed in the Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 and the associated Ministerial Income Directions. The consideration of individual applications and the determination of eligibility under the scheme is a matter for the local authority concerned in accordance with the relevant legislative provisions and the guidance underpinning the scheme. </p><p>The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  In order to participate in the scheme, the tenant must, in the first instance, meet the eligibility criteria as set out in the relevant legislation, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum. If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination of, own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan. </p><p>The terms and conditions governing the operation of standard annuity mortgages provided by local authorities to qualifying first time buyers are set out most recently in the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012. A copy of the Regulations is available at the following link: .</p><p>Article 5(b) and (c) of the regulations provide that loans shall not be available in the case of a single borrower, where the annual gross income is more than &euro;50,000 nor in the case of a joint application, where the combined gross income of the borrowers is more than &euro;75,000. The Regulations do not prescribe a minimum gross income for loan applicants. </p><p>However, all loans must be issued in accordance with the statutory Credit Policy issued in 2009 in accordance with the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009, in order to ensure lending prudence and to assist local authorities across the sector to engage consistently in responsible mortgage lending, in the best interest of borrowers and local authorities alike. This Credit Policy determines that all decisions in relation to loans are made based on a borrowers&rsquo; capacity to repay the loan, credit history and savings record. The final decision on loan approval is a matter for each local authority and its credit committee on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>The new Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is in the early stages of implementation and my Department is monitoring the operation of the scheme in consultation with housing authorities. In line with the commitment in the new <i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>to make the scheme more attractive for social housing tenants and to raise new funds for housing development, I intend to undertake a review of the scheme following the first 12 months of operation. I will bring forward any changes to the terms and conditions of the scheme which are considered necessary based on the evidence gathered at that stage. </p></reply>

A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the amount of waste generated in the State and to increase the segregation of waste which cannot be prevented in line with Government policy.  The introduction of pay-by-weight charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure.</p><p>In response to the pricing plans proposed earlier this month by the waste industry in relation to the nationwide roll-out of pay-by-weight charging, both I and my Ministerial colleagues have highlighted significant concerns regarding the reported escalation of waste bills for some customers from July, particularly in relation to some proposed increases in service charges.</p><p>Following intense engagement and meetings with representatives of the waste industry over the last few days, the Government has agreed a way forward that results in customers paying no more than they are currently paying for waste over the next 12 months, by means of a price freeze.  This transition period should give households time to adapt to the new system and learn how to more effectively manage their waste.</p><p>During this transition period, customers will be able to see<b></b>details in their bills of the amount of waste they are disposing, their costs under their current price plan and details of the comparative pay-by-weight charge.  Where households become more efficient in segregating waste and reduce their waste bills, they will have the opportunity, from 1 January 2017 at latest, to choose to transition to pay-by-weight charging or, if they prefer, they can opt to remain on their current price plan.</p><p>Over the coming months, the Government, in partnership with the waste industry, will drive an intensive public awareness, information and promotion campaign to support customers in understanding the new system, how they can change their waste management behaviour and manage better their waste costs under the pay-by-weight system.</p><p>At the end of this 12-month transition period, the Government will review the operation of pay-by-weight, including the effectiveness of the transition process, and make decisions regarding its further roll-out, regulation and oversight.</p><p>In relation to the issue of waiver for certain households, during the period in which local authorities were directly involved in the collection of household waste, a minority of individual Councils offered different levels of discount to selected households, based on different qualification criteria. As local authorities exited the waste collection market, some required the private operators which took on the Councils&rsquo; customers to provide a level of discount for existing waiver customers only, and even then for a limited time. </p><p>The vast majority of such contractual commitments for private operators to provide a waiver have now expired.  In that context, the number of households in receipt of waiver discounts is likely to decline further over time, especially as some householders were able to take advantage of special reduced offers elsewhere which actually undercut the waiver price.  However, selected private operators still offer some level of discount to former waiver customers on a voluntary basis.</p><p>In addition, a very limited number of local authorities make financial contributions toward the cost of the collection of waste from certain households.  Again, the qualification criteria and level of support differ from area to area. </p><p>With the exception of one or two municipal districts, local authorities no longer collect waste and the market is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged are primarily a matter between service provider and customer and the services offered vary across the country. </p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons, including emergency accommodation, rests with housing authorities.  My Department does not fund any homeless accommodation or service directly but provides funding to lead housing authorities on a regional basis. Housing authorities also contribute to the funding costs for their areas from their own resources.</p>  <p>  The various Management Groups (comprising representatives of the housing authorities within each region) of the regional Joint Homelessness Consultative Fora, are responsible for the preparation of regional statutory Homelessness Action Plans which specify the measures to be undertaken to address homelessness in their region.  Section 37 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides that such plans be informed by available data, the costs of measures and likely financial resources, as well as Government policies and objectives. It is a requirement of the 2009 Act that these Action Plans be submitted to each of the relevant housing authorities for adoption by the elected representatives of the Council.  Issues around service provision, including access to emergency accommodation within the Region, are integral to the Action Plans.  Therefore, the provision of emergency accommodation in D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown, and funding for same, are a matter for the Council and the Dublin Region Homelessness Management Group. </p></reply>

Security of tenure under the Act is based on rolling four-year tenancy cycles.  Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period.  This is referred to in the Act as a &lsquo;Part 4&rsquo; tenancy.</p><p>A landlord may not terminate a Part 4 tenancy except on clearly defined grounds which are set out in the Table to section 34 of the Act.  These grounds include that the landlord intends to sell the dwelling, that the landlord wishes to change the use of the dwelling, and that the landlord requires the dwelling for a family member. </p><p>Amendments introduced in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 strengthen the protections around tenancy terminations by providing for measures that will guard against, for example, landlords falsely declaring that the property is needed for a family member, or that it is going to be sold.  In addition, the Act provides for graduated increases in the notice periods that must be given to tenants of the termination of a tenancy so that a landlord must now give a tenant up to a maximum of 224 days&rsquo; notice for tenancies of 8 years or more.</p><p>Housing is an absolute priority for this Government and, accordingly, a key priority of the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>is the preparation and publication of an &lsquo;Action Plan for Housing&rsquo; within the Government&rsquo;s first 100 days.  The Action Plan will be drafted with input from a number of key Departments, and will draw on the Report of the Special Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness, which published its final report on the 17 June 2016.  This plan will map out a vision for the evolution of the entire housing sector over the coming years, including the rental sector where over one-fifth of our population now resides.</p><p>For the rental sector specifically, the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>contains a specific commitment to review the regulatory regime for the rented sector to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck between the rights, interests and responsibilities of both tenants and landlords.  The Action Plan for Housing will also contain a commitment to publish a strategy for the rental sector this Autumn.  This strategy will chart a path for the future of the rental sector.  It will also list the wide ranging actions this Government will take to achieve a mature and stable rented sector which will appropriately balance the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants, protect the rights of vulnerable tenants, reflect our changing patterns of housing demand and support continued recovery for our modern economy. </p></reply>

The which came into effect on 1 March 2014, introduced requirements for the appointment of design certifiers and assigned certifiers.  The role of the assigned certifier is to draw up and execute an appropriate inspection plan, in conjunction with the builder and the project team, and to jointly certify with the builder that the building is in compliance with the Building Regulations when complete.</p><p>Whereas heretofore local authorities, who frequently employed clerks of works on local authority construction projects, were exempt from building control requirements, this general exemption was removed under the with effect from 1 September 2015 following a review of the 2014 Regulations after 12 months in operation.</p><p>In response to this change , my Department has written to all local authorities outlining the revised funding arrangements that will apply typically in respect of social housing projects funded by the Department.  The revised funding arrangements make provision for the additional costs associated with the new design certifier and assigned certifier roles now required under Building Control Regulations.  These inspection and certification roles are a statutory obligation unlike the non-statutory system of inspections previously undertaken by the clerks of works.</p><p>The design and assigned certifier roles must be undertaken by registered construction professionals (i.e. an architect, a building surveyor or a chartered engineer), who may be directly employed by the local authority or whose services may be procured by way of public tender.  It is unlikely that persons who previously undertook the role of clerk of work will be in a position to undertake the design or assigned certifier role although some clerks of works may be qualified to do so.</p><p>Staffing and resourcing issues are in the first instance a matter for the Chief Executive of each local authority.  Standard funding arrangements communicated by my Department to local authorities are necessarily based around the general arrangements that typically apply to construction projects.  If, in relation to specific projects, circumstances exist which require alternative approaches, these can be considered on a case by case basis by the Department in consultation with the local authority concerned.  Reasonable and appropriate proposals that represent good value for money having regard to the public funds invested will always receive due consideration.</p></reply>

My Department currently supports a programme of large-scale regeneration projects in Dublin, Cork and Limerick and smaller projects in Tralee, Sligo and Dundalk.  The 2016 allocation for existing commitments on regeneration projects is &euro;50 million.</p>  <p>  The regeneration project at Limerick has been in operation for over seven years, with a cumulative investment to date of some &euro;245 million.  It is expected that 2016 will see significant building works, which will include the major part of a contract for 83 new social housing units.  The regeneration project at Cork City is continuing with 23 new social houses delivered during 2015 and work on a further 23 units commenced in 2016.  Regeneration works consisting of major refurbishment and renewal in Dundalk and Sligo are ongoing, while Tralee regeneration is largely complete.  In the Dublin City area, two new large regeneration projects, Dolphin House and St. Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens, are expected to move to construction in 2016.</p>  <p>  I am confident that in the context of the priority on urban regeneration set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government, I will be in a position to provide increased funding in 2017 and subsequent years for a range of measures that address deep-rooted disadvantage, while developing an approach to urban regeneration that empowers people to work together to improve their communities, to reduce poverty, disadvantage and inequality.</p></reply>

In this regard, it is intended that the new measures will complement the existing regeneration programme under the Social Housing Capital Programme, as well as other social regeneration initiatives already under way.  The Group meetings will be chaired by my colleague, Minister of State Damien English, TD, who has responsibility for urban renewal policy.</p><p>The series of specific actions set out in the <i>Programme for Partnership Government</i>are examples of the Government&rsquo;s commitment and approach to regenerating our urban centres, many of which were adversely impacted by our recent economic difficulties.  In this context, the Government will seek to introduce a new Town and Village Renewal Scheme to support the revitalisation of our towns and villages and improve the living and working environment of communities.  Using the &euro;30 million available to local authorities for town and village regeneration from this year, it is envisaged that the scheme will, among other things, particularly seek to increase the attractiveness and sustainability of our towns and villages as places to live and work.</p><p>In addition to this new Scheme, it is also intended under the new <i>Programme for Partnership Government</i>to examine a series of further initiatives, including: </p><p>- the introduction of a similar scheme to the &lsquo;Living City Initiative&rsquo; to regenerate urban centres and villages throughout Ireland (Year 1 action), </p><p>- the establishment of a national register of derelict sites, in addition to the new vacant site levy, to bring vacant and underutilised sites into beneficial use for housing and urban regeneration purposes (Year 2 action), </p><p>- the mandating of local authorities with better land management powers (Year 2 action),</p><p>- reclassifying and incentivising the use of underutilised or vacant areas over ground floor premises in urban areas, for both residential and commercial use (Year 1 action), and</p><p>- examining the scope to reform the Derelict Sites Act to tackle the under-use and hoarding of derelict land by the State, semi-State and private sectors (Year 1 action).</p><p>In terms of existing measures already in place, my Department&rsquo;s current Regeneration Programme targets the country&rsquo;s most disadvantaged communities, i.e. those defined by the most extreme social exclusion, unemployment and anti-social behaviour.  My Department currently supports an ambitious programme of large-scale regeneration projects in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, encompassing social housing improvements as well as social/community and economic renewal, as well as a number of smaller-scale projects in Tralee, Sligo and Dundalk.  As outlined, the aim of the programme is to seek to address the causes of disadvantage in these communities through a holistic programme of physical, social and economic regeneration.</p><p>Under the current Programme, the 2016 allocation for existing commitments on regeneration projects is &euro;50 million.  In the Dublin City area, two new large regeneration projects (Dolphin House and St. Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens) are expected to move to construction under the Programme in 2016, with a number of further regeneration projects in the pipeline.</p><p>In the context of the priority being attached to urban regeneration by the current Government, I will be aiming to provide increased funding in 2017 and beyond for a range of measures that will address deep-rooted disadvantage, while simultaneously developing an approach to urban regeneration that empowers people to work together to improve their communities, to reduce poverty, disadvantage and inequality.  It is intended that these new measures will also include strengthening the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) as well as reactivating funding to areas covered by the RAPID (Revitalising Areas through Planning, Investment and Development) Programme through the local authorities.</p></reply>

This practice was abolished in 1973 when Ireland joined the EEC.  As employees in the public service generally paid a reduced rate of PRSI, which provided no cover for the State pension (contributory), the marriage bar would not generally have impacted on State pension entitlement, as they would not have qualified for that payment had they remained in public sector employment.  </p>  <p>  Instead, by impacting upon their continuing public service employment, the marriage bar&rsquo;s pension implications, where they exist, more generally relate to a person&rsquo;s eventual entitlement to a Public Service pension.  Any questions regarding this issue are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  To qualify for a state pension (contributory) a person must have at least 520 paid contributions and satisfy a yearly average condition (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is required for a full rate State pension (contributory), and reduced rates of  payment may be payable for pensioners with lower averages). Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. </p>  <p>  For those who have insufficient contributions to qualify for a full State pension (contributory), there are supports available in the overall State pension system which assists qualification for a contributory payment, based on factors such as the contributions made by their spouse, and/or other factors likely to impact upon their needs.  These include &ndash;</p>  <p>  - The Homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, which was introduced to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.</p>  <p>  - Increases for Qualified Adults.</p>  <p>- Credits for periods of unemployment and illness  .</p>  <p>  - For those who do not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for a means-tested non-contributory pension of up to 95% of the full contributory pension.  </p>  <p>  The most recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors. It further confirms that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women, have and will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund due to the distributive nature of the Fund. </p>  <p>  It is expected that a total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the yearly average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person, while dealing with anomalies inherent in the yearly average approach.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes.  It is important that the changes be announced well in advance of introduction, to enable those affected to include the new factors into their retirement planning.</p></reply>

If a young jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.</p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that all young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed. There is now monthly engagement with all young jobseekers. Youth unemployment rose rapidly in the recession to over 30% in 2012. According to the Quarterly National Household Survey for Quarter 1 2016, youth unemployment continues to fall in line with the overall recovery and now stands at 16.9%. </p>  <p>  The review of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rates for young persons under 26 years of age will examine the effectiveness of the reduced rates in encouraging young jobseekers to avail of education, training, employment programmes and opportunities. Some preliminary analysis has commenced and I hope that this review will be completed later this year, subject to the necessary data being available and the required level of analysis involved being completed. </p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring my Department identifies effective measures to incentivise and support young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs. The best way to do this is through engagement processes and by incentivising them to avail of educational and training opportunities, thereby enhancing their employment prospects.  </p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability. </p><p>Child Benefit is currently paid to around 624,000 families in respect of some 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure in the order of over &euro;2 billion in 2016.  Child Benefit is an important source of income for all families and in Budget 2016 the Government increased Child Benefit by &euro;5 per month, at a cost of &euro;72 million.</p><p>Budget 2009 reduced the age for eligibility for Child Benefit from 19 years to less than 18 years.  A value for money review of child income supports, published by the Department of Social Protection in 2010, found that the participation pattern of children in education supports the current age limit for Child Benefit. </p><p>Families on low incomes can avail of a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including: </p><p>- qualified child increases (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments; </p><p>- family income supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children; </p><p>- the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families (paid at the full-time second level education rate). </p><p>These schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked with household income and thereby supports low-income families with older children participating in full-time education. </p><p>Extending Child Benefit to students who are in full-time secondary education who are over 18 years of age can be examined between now and the budget with the caveat that there are potentially other areas of need that also have to be accounted for.</p><p>Any changes to the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit, therefore, would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age. This will increase to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.

This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.    </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no general retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.</p>  <p>  In terms of financial supports, social welfare benefits will continue to be available to the age of 66 for those who are required to leave employment. Jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66. Where a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claim spans two benefit years, a new Governing Contribution Year requirement is not applied to the second benefit year of a claimant aged 65 (effectively this means that they may receive payment in both years based upon eligibility in the first year). </p></reply>

My Department would not have access to these projections and therefore cannot provide these costings.</p>  <p>  However, the Deputy should note that the current supports provided, outlined below, ensure that lone parents can complete a course of education with support from my Department regardless of the age of their youngest child.</p>  <p>  Former one-parent family payment (OFP) recipients who transitioned from the scheme on 2 July 2015 and who were in the middle of a course of education were allowed to complete their course on OFP and then transition to an appropriate payment.  </p>  <p>  From 2 July 2015 onwards lone parents who transition to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment (JST) have a youngest child of 7 years of age.  These customers then have two options if they wish to complete a course of education while on JST.  Where the course can be completed within the 7 years that they have access to JST (i.e. until their youngest child is 14 years of age), these customers can avail of the SUSI grant and a JST payment subject to the conditions of both schemes (eligibility for a SUSI grant is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills). </p>  <p>  Where the course cannot be completed within the potentially 7 years available on JST, for example if the course is over 3 years and the youngest child is now 12, the customer can instead avail of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) when s/he commences the course.  This allowance will continue to be paid, subject to the conditions of the BTEA scheme, until the course is completed even when the customer&rsquo;s youngest child reaches 14 years of age.  </p>  <p>  All lone parents on a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or JST payment have access to activation supports from my Department. </p>  <p>  JST recipients receive for the first time a one to one meeting with a case officer from my Department who will assist them to produce a personal development plan and guide them towards appropriate education, training and employment opportunities.  While the customer is on the JST payment this support is available and is not limited to the 12 month engagement that applies for other jobseekers from their one to one meeting.  </p>  <p>  Through the JST payment, lone parents with children aged between 7 and 13 years are provided with a very long transition period of seven years within which to engage with the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service.  The aim of this broader support is to improve the individual&rsquo;s education and employment prospects. </p>  <p>  With regard to rent supplement, in general, persons engaged in full-time education are excluded from receiving rent supplement.  However, those participating in approved courses under the back-to-education allowance (BTEA) or the vocational training opportunities scheme (VTOS) may retain entitlement to rent supplement, subject to meeting all other conditions of the scheme.</p></reply>

The overall CES is being coordinated by the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform (DJELR).</p>  <p>   The aim of the strategy is to increase the proportion of people with disabilities in a job.  The measures contained in the strategy seek to address the barriers to employment and improve pathways to work, with the impact on employment building up over time. </p>  <p>  The specific DSP commitments in the CES include: enhanced engagement with people with disabilities (drawing on profiling analysis etc.); provision of employment support services (Wage Subsidy Scheme, EmployAbility service etc.); engagement with employers to highlight benefits of employing people with disabilities; early intervention strategies to address drift into ill-health; the establishment of an interdepartmental group, to be led by DSP, under an independent chair, to review and make recommendations on 'making work pay' for people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department is making progress in delivering on its commitments under the CES, for example, my Department is progressively rolling out its full Intreo service to people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service on a voluntary basis. People with disabilities who present at  INTREO Centres offices will be offered an interview by a case officer who will agree suitable personal progression  plan with the individual and record the action plan for the person on the case management system.  In addition, relevant officers in INTREO Centres have received training, to enable them to interact effectively with people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  This service is being provided across 58 Intreo Centres. Training of over 60 Employment Support officers and other INTREO support staff was completed in March 2016. Training included inputs from the National Disability Authority and Epilepsy Ireland.</p>  <p>  Other actions completed include, the review, by Indecon, of the EmployAbility and DACT services.  A survey, conducted by  my Department, of a random sample 12,000 people in receipt of disability allowance. The survey is to inform the design of supports and interventions which will assist people with disabilities in receipt of Disability Allowance to participate in the labour force according to their capacity.</p>  <p>  In addition my Department has established an interdepartmental expert group, with an independent chair to examine the complex interaction between the benefits system, including the medical card, and the net income gains in employment. The interdepartmental group will also identify any significant disincentives for people with disabilities in taking up or returning to work. The interdepartmental group will report to Government by the end 2016.</p>  <p>  Finally, my Department promotes workplace supports for people with disabilities and engages with employers on an ongoing basis. The Employer Information Pack contains information on supports available to people with disabilities and employers and the range of supports and services available to employers are highlighted at DSP employer road shows and Job fairs.</p>  <p>  I hope this gives the Deputy an indication of the progress being made by my Department in meeting its CES commitments.</p></reply>

One of these actions is a proposal for the Departments of Health and Social Protection to work together to pursue a &ldquo;Fit for Work Programme&rdquo; to support more people with an illness or disability to get back to work through early intervention.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Fit for Work&rdquo; proposal is based on the findings of a pan European study, which examined the impact of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) on an individual&rsquo;s ability to work.  The Irish module of this study was progressed by a coalition of key stakeholders and was led by Arthritis Ireland.  The Irish College of General Practitioners, ICTU, IBEC and the Health &amp;amp; Safety Authority also contributed to the study.</p>  <p>  Early interventions and developing return to work practices in the case of people with musculoskeletal incapacities is consistent with my Department&rsquo;s approach to illness/disability income support, which aims to reduce the number of people progressing to chronic disability and long-term social welfare dependency.  To this end, my Department has in 2015, issued a set of certification guidelines for GPs, which sets out defined periods of recovery for common medical conditions, including MSDs. </p>  <p>  The certification guidelines build on the &ldquo;Renaissance project&rdquo;, which is an initiative of my Department since 2003.  This has shown that early intervention reduced the incidence of progression from the acute simple low back pain to chronic disability in 64% of claimants.</p>  <p>  While specific proposals around the design and operation of a &ldquo;Fit for Work Programme&rdquo; require further development and scoping out so at this time it is not possible to answer all your question, I would like to assure the Deputy that any such proposals will be in line with the wealth of evidence which shows that generally employment is good for one&rsquo;s mental and physical health and wellbeing and, conversely, that unemployment is damaging.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The transition is still in its early phases, and there are many challenges facing the new Government in its efforts to bring peace and reconciliation, democratic reforms, and development and economic growth to all its people.  I welcome the positive steps that the new Government has taken to date which have signalled their intention to address these issues.  One of the most critical and sensitive of these challenges involves the need to comprehensively address the situation of the Rohingya people.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to follow the situation of the Rohingya minority closely, including those that have been displaced from their homes, many of whom remain within the country.  The underlying root causes of this displacement, which include the ethnic tensions in Rakhine State, must be addressed as part of a long term solution led by the Government of Myanmar.  The need to guarantee respect for human rights and the rule of law for all people in Myanmar remains central to achieving this. Ireland has also called for more investment in early recovery and support for livelihood opportunities for both the Rohingya and Buddhist communities in Rakhine State.</p>  <p>  Ireland regularly highlights the situation of the Rohingya people at a bilateral level and in the context of our membership of the EU.  Yesterday, I attended the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels, at which conclusions were adopted on the EU&rsquo;s strategy on Myanmar.  In addition to addressing the wider human rights concerns, the Conclusions made particular reference to the situation of the Rohingya, taking note of the efforts of the Government of Myanmar to begin work towards addressing the challenges of Rakhine State.  The conclusions furthermore highlighted the need for inclusive development in all areas and a political process, including solving citizenship for stateless persons in a non-discriminatory manner through a transparent, voluntary and accessible procedure and ending displacement.  The Council committed to engage in dialogue with the Union and State governments as well as all local actors to help build trust with the ultimate aim of promoting human rights and prosperity for all.</p>  <p>  Ireland also supported the EU-led resolution on the situation of human rights in Myanmar at the 31st session of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in March 2016, which emphasised the HRC&rsquo;s serious concerns over human rights violations, including the situation in Rakhine State and particularly with respect to persons belonging to religious and ethnic minorities, including the Rohingya minority. Ireland also raised this issue during the review of Myanmar&rsquo;s human rights record at the HRC&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review in November 2015.  We have read with interest the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, on the human rights situation of Rohingya Muslims and other minorities in Myanmar, which was published yesterday and will be presented at the current session of the HRC in Geneva on 29 June.</p>  <p>  In addition to these efforts, Ireland has provided development assistance and humanitarian aid to address the needs of people in Rakhine State, including the Rohingya community.   Since October 2012 outbreaks of inter-communal violence in Rakhine State have left 140,000 people internally displaced (IDPs) and 70,000 extremely vulnerable people in need of humanitarian assistance. In this context of continued conflict and hardship, it is essential that access to basic education and essential psycho-social support to nearly 15,000 children in IDP camps continues.  To this end, since 2014, through our Embassy in Hanoi, Ireland has provided &euro;234,500 to Plan International for their interventions in Rakhine State. Ireland&rsquo;s contribution specifically supports the much needed provision of water, sanitation and hygiene education in the schools and safe spaces for children which complements and strengthens Plan&rsquo;s broader education programme. In addition, 2015, Plan International Ireland received &euro;50,000 under the Emergency Response Fund Scheme (ERFS) for its support to communities in Rakhine State that were affected by the floods of July 2015. As part of this project 20 villages of Minbya Township were selected in collaboration with the Township authorities.  Across the 20 targeted villages, a total of 4,407 households have increased access to safe drinking water. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue, through relevant bilateral and multilateral channels, to highlight the situation of the Rohingya people and to urge the authorities in Myanmar to address the underlying causes as part of their continuing transition.</p></reply>

During these meetings we emphasised the plight of the undocumented Irish in the US and encouraged both Houses of Congress to work on a bipartisan basis towards a comprehensive package of immigration reform measures.</p>  <p>  In his speech at the Speaker&rsquo;s lunch at Capitol Hill, the Taoiseach addressed the issues of immigration reform and urged Republicans and Democrats to work together to address the concerns of the undocumented Irish in the US.  The Taoiseach also spoke of the need for improved legal migration channels for those Irish people who wish to live, work and develop their skills in the US for a time and emphasised the exceptional contribution made by Irish people to American society over the course of centuries of shared history.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Washington continues to closely monitor the progress of the judicial case on President Obama&rsquo;s Executive Actions on immigration reform.  This case, which was brought by a coalition of US States seeking an injunction against the Executive Action, has now reached the US Supreme Court, and it is expected that the Court will soon declare its decision.  If the appeal succeeds and the measure is implemented, the Executive Action could benefit a significant number of our citizens by lifting the threat of deportation and allowing those undocumented immigrants who have been in the US for more than five years and who have children who are US citizens or legal permanent residents to work and travel more freely within the United States.</p>  <p>  The new Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our Embassy in Washington, will continue to actively pursue all opportunities to advance immigration reform that would be of benefit to our citizens, with the US Administration, both sides of the aisle in Congress and the US Embassy in Ireland.</p></reply>

The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks.  </p>  <p>  Where flood defences are constructed to provide protection to areas which have previously been subject to flooding, the insurance industry has made clear its position that the defences should be designed and constructed to protect against a flood event with an Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) of 1% (commonly referred to as a 100-year flood event).  Currently all OPW flood defence schemes are designed and constructed to provide at least this level of protection.</p>  <p>  It is open to any person seeking property insurance to supply insurers or insurance brokers with any relevant information on flood defences which might influence a decision on the provision of cover.

However, the latest guidance issued by Eurostat in March 2016 has now fundamentally changed the position insofar as rewards are concerned, such that "any part of the profit" accruing to the government unit now appears to be sufficient to result in a PPP being classified as on-balance sheet.</p>  <p>  The latest guidance also appears to have changed the ground rules in relation to existing approved projects.  Until now, any such existing approved projects only required to be reviewed in the event of a "substantial" change to the contract.  However, under the latest guidance, only contract changes which are "not negligible" are permitted without requiring the contract to be reviewed under the new guidance in force at that time, but it is unclear what type of change would meet this "not negligible" test and therefore potentially trigger a requirement for a review of the entire contract under the new rules.</p>  <p>  The changes introduced in the latest guidance may also require a trade-off between value for money and achieving off-balance sheet status for new PPPs, insofar as changes may have to be made to the manner in which future rewards, for example arising from windfall gains that may accrue to a project in the future, can be shared between the public and private sectors.  </p>  <p>  This changing position of Eurostat has therefore created considerable confusion and uncertainty in relation how PPPs are to be classified in future, which poses a significant threat to the ability of European Governments to continue to pursue PPPs as a means of complementing direct Exchequer investment in much needed infrastructural projects.  To this extent, it appears manifestly at odds with the primary objective behind the Juncker Plan, which is to facilitate, and indeed stimulate, increased investment in infrastructure projects across the Union.</p>  <p>  A meeting between Member States and Eurostat representatives, under the auspices of the European PPP Expertise Centre (EPEC), is scheduled for 6th July to discuss the matter.  That meeting will review the latest changes to PPP statistical rules in the Eurostat Manual on Government Deficit and Debt, issued in March, and will also enable Member States to receive an update on the work that is currently underway between EPEC and Eurostat to produce a guidance paper, to be issued jointly by the two organisations, with a view to providing clarity on the statistical classification issue, in view of the confusion that was created by the latest guidance note issued in March.</p></reply>

On that basis these restoration measures are effective in removing PSPR entirely, that is to say restoring full payment rates, in the cases of those lower value pensions previously affected by PSPR.</p><p>At 2015 year-end, all public service pensions with annual values up to &euro;12,000 were exempt from PSPR.  In 2016, all pensions up to &euro;18,700 are exempt from PSPR.  From 1 January 2017, all pensions below &euro;26,000 will be exempt from PSPR, and from 1 January 2018 all pensions up to &euro;34,132 per year will be exempt from PSPR.  The increases in exemption thresholds also provide a boost to public service pensions above the applicable thresholds, in most cases delivering a cumulative pension restoration of &euro;400 per year in 2016, &euro;500 per year in 2017 and &euro;780 per year in 2018.</p><p>Based on available data and making assumptions for future retirements and mortality rates, the estimated reduction in public service pension costs delivered by PSPR is as follows: &euro;100 million in 2011, &euro;100 million in 2012, &euro;120 million in 2013, &euro;140 million in 2014, &euro;135 million in 2015, &euro;105 million in 2016, &euro;75 million in 2017 and &euro;45 million in 2018.

This fund, which has an allocation of over &euro;900,000 in 2016, is administered through the local authorities and seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.

This scheme will operate in 2016, via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014.  It is expected to support a significant number of projects across the country and to create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  The scheme for this year is now fully allocated.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.

Both schemes remain closed.</p><p>However the Government also decided that monthly payments will continue to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time the scheme closed, on the basis that this would prevent hardship and, on an interim basis, alleviate stress, anxiety and uncertainty among a vulnerable group in society.</p><p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Department is seeking a solution which would best meet the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income to contribute towards the cost of their mobility needs, while remaining within the available budget and satisfying all legal and equality concerns.</p><p>Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme.  The proposals seek to ensure that:</p><p>-  There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;</p><p>-  There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;</p><p>-  Resources are targeted at those with the greatest needs; and</p><p>-  The Scheme is capable of being costed and it is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputies that the Programme for Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme.</p></reply>

The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State.  Pricing contracts are purely a matter for agreement between the NTPF and the nursing home in question.  The Department of Health has no role in such individual negotiations.</p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;</p><p>- Bed and board;</p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of everyday living; and</p><p>- Laundry service.</p><p>Additional charges may not be levied in respect of the above components of care.  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home.  This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged.  Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in this contract.  The Department of Health are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.</p><p>Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes.  The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.</p></reply>

Since 2009 all nursing homes - public, voluntary and private have been registered and inspected by HIQA.  </p>  <p>  The functions of the Minister for Health in relation to HIQA, and the Chief Inspector of Social Services are prescribed in the Act, and in this respect the Chief Inspector is independent in the exercise of these functions. </p>  <p>  It would not be possible to comment on any individual case without knowing the full circumstances of that case. </p>  <p>  However, the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013, as amended, include provisions governing the contract for provision of services, including a requirement that a discharge shall be discussed, planned for and agreed with a resident and, where appropriate, with their family or carer, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract. </p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes.  The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through  the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.</p></reply>

I am informed by the HSE that this is a work in progress and has not been delayed.  The aim of the National Clinical Programme for Ophthalmology is to ensure equitable and high quality care for ophthalmic patients and to minimise the incidence of needless blindness.  The Programme has devised a high level strategy for the delivery of eye care and is of the view that a community based model is most appropriate.  This is supportive of the aims of  the Primary Care Eye Services Review Group, which was established by the  HSE&rsquo;s Primary Care Division.  This Review Group is currently preparing an implementation plan to support its Review.  The overall aim of the Review Group is to shift the management of many eye conditions from acute care services to primary care and community services, as appropriate.  The Government is committed to updating the national eye care plan, including evaluation of the Sligo model for cataract surgery.

It is intended that the first phase of building works will commence in the coming weeks. </p><p>The Government decision that the new children's hospital should be co-located with St James's on its campus in Dublin 8 was clinically led.  In 2006, the McKinsey report, Children&rsquo;s Health First, recommended that the population of Ireland and projected demand could support only one world-class tertiary paediatric centre, that this should be in Dublin and that it should ideally be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital, to ensure relevant sub-specialty and academic linkages.  The McKinsey report recognised the importance for quality of healthcare of having a critical mass of sub-specialist skills in a tertiary centre and stated this could be achieved firstly, by serving a large enough population to support a full complement of sub-specialists and secondly, by co-locating with an adult teaching hospital thus enabling access to specialties that encompass both adult and paediatric patients, facilitating clinical and academic &ldquo;cross fertilisation&rdquo;, and attracting the top staff.</p><p>Reviews since 2006 have reaffirmed the importance of co-location with a major adult academic teaching hospital.  In 2011, Minister Reilly established an Independent Review Group to examine the project at the Mater.  The clinical aspect of this review was carried out by a team of four Chief Executive Officers drawn from the National Association of Children&rsquo;s Hospitals (NACHRI) and the Children&rsquo;s Hospitals International Executive Forum (CHIEF). Their report stated that <i>&ldquo;co-locating with tertiary adult and maternity hospitals is essential to the development of an excellent paediatric service. This has become best practice internationally and was recognised in the McKinsey report.&rdquo;</i></p><p>In 2012, following the refusal of planning permission for the project at the Mater campus, Minister Reilly established the Dolphin Review Group to advise on next steps.  Their report stated that <i>&ldquo;Having reviewed the reports already prepared and considered their analysis and opinions, and having also consulted with a wide range of professionals in the field, we are also of the view that co-location is essential and tri-location optimal. We recommend that the Minister remains on this path.&quot;  </i>It identified St James&rsquo;s as the most suitable adult partner for the new children&rsquo;s hospital, from a clinical and research perspective.</p><p>The Government decision to co-locate the hospital with St James's was announced on 6 November 2012.  In identifying the location, the Government carefully considered the report of the Dolphin Group, established earlier that year to advise on next steps following refusal of planning permission for the hospital at its previous location.  The Government also considered detailed supplementary information on cost, time and planning which was subsequently sought from those members of the Group with the relevant technical expertise.  The decision was clinically led, and was made in the best interests of children, with clinical considerations paramount in the decision.  As announced in June 2015, the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital will relocate to the campus in time, achieving tri-location of adult, paediatric and maternity services.  Tri-location has benefits for children, adolescents, newborns and mothers.  In all cases, the benefits of tri-location are maximised where the adult hospital provides the broadest possible range of clinical sub-specialties and expertise, which are readily accessible for paediatric and maternity patients on the shared campus.  Also, tri-location that delivers the most significant breadth and depth of clinical and academic research on site will enhance the potential of research to drive best clinical outcomes.  St James&rsquo;s Hospital has the broadest range of national specialties of all acute hospitals, as well as strong and well established research and education infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to be the adult co-location partner.</p></reply>

The availability of these services helps ensure the delivery of an optimum, safe service, particularly for high risk mothers and babies.  </p>  <p>  Planning permission was obtained in April this year for the new children's hospital co-located with St. James's Hospital on its campus at Dublin 8.  In line with Government policy, the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital will also relocate to the campus in time, achieving tri-location of adult, paediatric and maternity services on the one campus.  Accordingly, in submitting its planning application for the children's hospital, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, as a matter of good planning practice, provided information on all known future developments for the St James's Hospital campus, including the future maternity hospital.  The design for the children's hospital provides for consideration of future maternity hospital requirements in certain shared service areas. </p>  <p>  The decision to relocate the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital to the St James's Hospital campus was announced on 30th June last year.  This project is, as yet, in the very early stages of development, and significant work, including the preparation of a design brief and design development, will be required before any planning application can be made.</p></reply>

Satellite centres of the hospital, providing urgent and outpatient care, are to be built on the campuses of Connolly and Tallaght Hospitals.  The decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la on April 28 last to grant planning permission for the hospital, satellite centres and related buildings is a huge and very welcome milestone for the project, and means that construction can now commence on all three sites in the coming weeks and months. </p>  <p>  At every stage of this project over the years, through the various reports and the design process, there has been extensive consultation with numerous stakeholders and interested parties. </p>  <p>  In 2012, following the refusal by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of planning permission for the hospital at the Mater campus, Minister Reilly established the Dolphin Group to advise on next steps.  The Group met with a range of stakeholder groups and interested parties, including advocacy groups such as the Jack and Jill foundation, Children in Hospital Ireland and the Youth Advisory Council, CEOs, clinicians, nurses and health and social care professionals from th existing hospitals, and representatives of children's research organisations. </p>  <p>  Previous reports and reviews on the location also involved stakeholder consultation.  The 2006 Joint HSE/Department of Health Task Force met with advocacy groups including Heart Children Ireland, Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, the Irish Patients Association and the New Crumlin Hospital Action Group, as well as with the existing hospitals and maternity hospitals.  In 2011, an Independent Review Group established by Minister Reilly to review the project at the Mater campus also included stakeholder consultation as part of its work, consulting with parents and care givers as well as the hospitals themselves and the Faculty of Paediatrics. </p>  <p>  During the design process for the hospital, there have also been extensive consultations with families, young people and children who are former or current users of the service, with staff of the existing hospitals, with clinical leads and with local residents.  This process has led to the development of a world-class building which has been designed to enable staff to deliver the best possible clinical care for children and young people, while also seeking to provide a pleasant environment for staff and families.</p></reply>

The health service is addressing the prevention of eye disease and blindness across the broad range of health services including acute, primary and community based services.  </p>  <p>  The aim of the National Clinical Programme for Ophthalmology is to ensure equitable and high quality care for ophthalmic patients and to minimise the incidence of needless blindness.  The Programme has devised a high level strategy for the delivery of eye care and is of the view that a community based model is most appropriate.  This is supportive of the aims of the Primary Care Eye Services Review Group, which was established by the Health Service Executive's Primary Care Division.  This Review Group is currently preparing an implementation plan to support its Review.  The overall aim of the Review Group is to shift the management of many eye conditions from acute care services to primary care and community services, as appropriate.  The Programme for Partnership Government is committed to updating the national eye care plan, including evaluation of the Sligo model for cataract surgery.  </p>  <p>  People with disabilities, including blind and visually-impaired people, can access specialist disability services, which are provided in a variety of community and residential settings.  These may be provided directly by the HSE or in partnership with voluntary service providers such as the National Council for the Blind and the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind.</p>  <p>  I have received correspondence from Fighting Blindness in relation to these matters, which I intend to consider in the context of the implementation of the Health commitments in the Programme for Partnership Government and having regard to the funding available to facilitate such measures.</p></reply>

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  In 2009, NIAC recommended HPV vaccination for all 12 year old girls, and in September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in the first year of second level schools.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults. It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school and over 200,000 girls have received the vaccine since its introduction. </p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland and is the appropriate authority to which possible adverse reactions to medicinal products should be reported.  In November 2015, the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  The outcome of the review which was carried out by the EMA Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.  The European Medicines Agency has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using the vaccines in accordance with the current product information.  On 12 January 2016, the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states. </p>  <p>  However, I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of symptoms experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter's condition.  I want to provide assurances that, as well as being eligible to seek medical attention and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms, the HSE will be in a position to facilitate access to specialist services as required due to the individual nature of the needs of some children.</p></reply>

The process for this is described in the &lsquo;Guide to the Notification System for Exempt Medicinal Products&rsquo; which is available on the website of the HPRA, which administers the scheme.  For this notification scheme, there are a number of specialist wholesalers which deal with the importation of &lsquo;exempt medicines&rsquo; into Ireland, via pharmacies and subject to a prescription.</p>  <p>  The HPRA is aware that Epidiolex has been prescribed and imported into Ireland under the exempt medicinal product route in response to a bona fide order from a registered medical practitioner.</p></reply>

The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders. </p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  Currently, 2725 people live in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under <i>&lsquo;Transforming Lives&rsquo;,</i>the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions.  I welcome the fact that the needs of people moving from congregated settings will be fully taken into account during this process as the model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan. </p><p>In terms of housing, the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government are working in collaboration to support the transition of people with a disability from institutions to social housing in the community under the Government's<i>National Housing Strategy for People with Disability 2011 to 2016.</i></p><p>The HSE's 2016 National Service Plan has set a target of 165 people to move from institutions in 2016 into suitable accommodation.  This is being supported by &euro;20 million in capital funding from the Department of Health in respect of acquiring and renovating properties in priority institutions identified by the HSE. </p><p>In addition, I am pleased to note that the Department of the Environment will provide &euro;10 million under the Capital Assistance Scheme to provide suitable accommodation for people transitioning from institutions in 2016.  The HSE estimate that a further 100 people could benefit from this initiative.  &euro;1 million in ring-fenced leasing funding is also being made available by the Department of the Environment in 2016 to support people moving from institutions into suitable social housing in the community.  This demonstrates the joined up commitment of both Departments to support the de-congregation programme.  </p><p>The HSE has developed a three strand approach to accelerate transitions from institutions in the period 2016-2021, with a target of 900 people to move to more suitable accommodation in this period.</p><p>-  Strand 1- is focussed on large institutional settings at high risk of not meeting HIQA Standards;</p><p>-  Strand 2- is focussed on moving people into suitable social housing in the community through the Department of Environment schemes; and </p><p>-  Strand 3- is focussed on remaining service users in congregated settings who could move to suitable accommodation.</p><p>Furthermore, underlining this Government's commitment to the disability sector, I recently announced the provision of additional funding of &euro;3m in 2016 for new initiatives, including an additional provision for services to meet the need of school leavers with disabilities and the anticipated cost of a number of emergency residential placements arising this year.</p><p>These emergency residential placements are intended to support individuals and families in crisis situations where their existing accommodation is no longer suitable.</p><p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, he can contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with the HSE.</p></reply>

Supporting infrastructure, procured through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of  multi-disciplinary primary health care.  The mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care infrastructure is dependent on a number of factors.  The additional primary care facilities across the country will be provided through a combination of direct build, through Public Private Partnership (PPP) and by way of operational leasing.</p>  <p>  Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care infrastructure is  subject to  suitable locations being offered/provided/available, to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff.  In addition the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to adequate financing.  Delivery of primary care infrastructure is a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementation.</p>  <p>  In addition to other locations being developed, in November 2014 the HSE advertised an additional 73 locations for delivery of Primary Care Centres by operational lease.  The HSE has been reviewing all Expressions of Interest to determine which are suitable for more detailed consideration and progression to the next stage of the process. </p>  <p>  Assessment/evaluation criteria employed by the HSE in respect of proposed locations for primary care centres fall under three principal headings: 1. Accommodation needs; 2. Service priority; and 3. deprivation level.</p>  <p>  I intend to consider future infrastructure in the context of the implementation of the Health commitments in the Programme for Government and having regard to the funding available to facilitate such measures.</p></reply>

On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.</p>  <p>  However, this does not get away from the fact that these young women are unwell. I want to provide assurances that, as well as being eligible to seek medical attention and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms, the HSE will be in a position to facilitate access to specialist services as required due to the individual nature of the needs of some children..</p>  <p>  As Minister I consider meeting any organisation that requests to do so.  However due to busy parliamentary and other business it is not always possible to meet all representative groups.  I have been informed that the HSE has met with members of REGRET concerning this issue and I will ask them for an update.</p></reply>

It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper.  Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p>  <p>  The implementation process for any strategy is vital for its success. I chair the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC), with high level representatives from all the relevant Departments and State agencies.  The committee reviews progress on detailed actions on a quarterly basis, in order to identify and solve problems quickly.  Stakeholders regularly present to the committee meetings on their priorities for particular sectors or themes and by the end of this year, the HLIC will have reviewed in detail progress on the five cross-cutting themes and the twelve individual sectors outlined in Food Wise 2025.  So it is very much a live and continuously updated process.</p>  <p>  I will be publishing a first year progress report on Food Wise 2025 next month.</p></reply>

An eligible hectare is land that is used for an agricultural activity.</p><p>Section 1.5 of the Terms and Conditions further makes reference to The Birds and Habitats Directives and provides that land that no longer complies with the definition of eligible hectare as a result of the implementation of Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds or Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora is eligible for payment where the following conditions are met:</p><p>(i)The land must have been claimed under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme;</p><p>(ii)The land must have been eligible for payment under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme;</p><p>(iii)  Any increase in the ineligible area should be directly linked to the  management requirements for the habitat.</p><p>Where an applicant is claiming on land that is otherwise considered ineligible, for example scrub, such land will be deemed eligible for payment where the applicant satisfies the requirements as set out above. </p></reply>

Ireland has supported these measures provided they are voluntary, temporary and financed only at individual Member State level. I do not believe that there is demand from the co-operative sector in Ireland for a supply control measure.</p>  <p>  The EU targeted aid package referred to by the Deputy was matched by Exchequer funding, giving a total amount of &euro;27.4m. Some &euro;27m has been paid to date, with a small number of outstanding cases still being examined. In total some 17,600 dairy farmers received a payment of &euro;1,395, with c. 1,500 of these getting an additional &euro;1,000 under a Young Farmer top up. Just under 300 pig producers have also received c.&euro;3,300 each and my Department is considering allocating some funding under this package to the Irish Pig Society to further their work in representing smaller scale producers. Payments must be made by 30th  June 2016.</p>  <p>  A number of other market support measures have been put in place at EU level, including an increase in the ceiling for SMP intervention to 350,000 tonnes, which was sought by Ireland.  In terms of input costs at farm level, I have called on the Commission to consider looking at temporary suspension of EU import tariffs on fertilisers to reduce input costs for Irish and EU farmers. I have also called for a further targeted aid package for farmers and for a facility to advance 75% of the Basic Payment Scheme to farmers in 2016 to assist with cash flow.</p>  <p>  At a National level, there have been a number of imaginative initiatives at co-op level, including fixed price and margin contracts, and flexible financing instruments. I would like to see more of this from industry. Developing new and existing markets is also part of the solution. In this regard I intend to lead a trade mission to the Far East in the early Autumn, and dairy will be a significant feature.  Work is also continuing through Teagasc, ICBF and AHI to increase farm efficiency, reduce the costs of production and increase margins.   Making farmers more resilient to price volatility is key.</p>  <p>  I have also been talking to the main banks to exercise forbearance with farmers temporarily under financial pressure, and a number of other options to improve the availability of liquidity are being explored. At today&rsquo;s dairy forum I launched a new cash flow tool which will assist farmers in managing their finances and   help them in engaging with banks.</p>  <p>  I am acutely conscious of the pressure farmers are under at present, and I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to exploring all of the appropriate options for providing assistance to the farm sector through this temporary price trough. I met with the dairy forum today and discussed these issues with the key stakeholders.   </p></reply>

In general terms for both BPS and Greening and other area based schemes an eligible hectare is one that is used for an agricultural activity or, where the area is also used for a non-agricultural activity, is predominantly used for such activities.  An area is predominantly used for agricultural activity if that activity can be exercised without being significantly hampered by the intensity, nature, duration and timing of the non-agricultural activity.  While cases involving solar panels will be examined on an individual basis, the area covered by the solar panels will be deemed ineligible for the purposes of claiming BPS, in line with advice from EU Commission.  Furthermore, in line with the Department&rsquo;s current approach on land eligibility, where the area of a parcel covered by solar panels is 70% or greater of the overall parcel, that parcel will be wholly ineligible.  If less than 70% is covered by solar panels and the agricultural activity is not hampered by the presence of the solar panels, the area not covered by solar panels may be eligible. </p>  <p>  Finally it is important to note that all agricultural land used to claim BPS must be owned/leased, used and managed by the applicant.  If the applicant is not the owner of the land, they must have a lease or rental agreement in place with the owner of the land.  There must be independent and suitable access for animals and/or machinery for the farming enterprise being conducted.  Independent access means access by public or private roadway or by a defined right of way.  Access over adjoining landowners land, or over land which is subject to a lease or rental agreement to another person, is not acceptable.</p></reply>

Priority access must be given to applicants who meet the definition of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; or &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo;.  A young farmer is defined as a farmer aged no more than 40 years of age in the year when s/he first submits an application under the Basic Payment Scheme and who commenced their farming activity no more than five years prior to submitting that application.  A new entrant is defined as a farmer who commenced their agricultural activity since 1 January 2013.  The Regulations also set down that an eligible applicant must have submitted an application under the Basic Payment Scheme in the year of application to the National Reserve.  Records held by my Department show the person named did not apply to the Basic Payment Scheme for 2015.  On this basis the person named does not meet the eligibility criteria under the National Reserve.  Records held by my Department also indicate that the person named did not submit an application to the National Reserve in 2015.</p>  <p>  As all of the National Reserve Funding was utilised in 2015, there is no funding available to cover the operation of a 2016 National Reserve.  From 2017 onwards the National Reserve will be replenished from unused entitlements, as EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that entitlements that are unused for 2 consecutive years are surrendered to the National Reserve.  Decisions in relation to the Reserve for 2017 will be considered once the position on potential funding arising from unused entitlements and clawback from the sale of entitlements without land has been established.</p></reply>

In that role, IFI provides management advice to my Department regarding the most up-to-date status of species within its brief.  IFI manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis as each of Ireland&rsquo;s 143 salmon rivers has its own genetically unique stock of salmon.  IFI is supported in its management of salmon stocks by a statutorily independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) comprising scientists from IFI, Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM), the Loughs Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI - Northern Ireland), and other State bodies and third level institutions.  The SSC's assessment of each individual stock is carried out every year.</p>  <p>  The offshore and inshore salmon and sea trout commercial fisheries were closed by a Government decision from 2007 in order to comply with the EU Habitats Directive.  A Hardship Scheme totalling &euro;30m was established for fishermen and fishing communities.  The scheme was administered by BIM and I am advised that the average payment under the scheme was almost &euro;23,000, with the highest payment at over &euro;195,000.  Conditions of the scheme included that nets had to be verifiably decommissioned and those availing of the Scheme would not be entitled to a licence in the future.</p>  <p>  Commercial harvest fisheries are currently permitted on individual river stocks which are shown to be meeting their conservation limit.  Fisheries in estuaries may also be permitted where the stocks from individual rivers entering the estuaries are each meeting their individual conservation limits.  The current management approach allows Ireland to meet its international and national obligations in terms of salmon conservation and operate sustainable harvest fisheries (commercial and recreational) where this is feasible.</p>  <p>  I am advised by IFI that where there is a mix of individual river stocks at sea, from both Irish rivers and the rivers of other countries, it is not possible to disaggregate fish in a mixed stock area and the conservation imperative is to protect vulnerable individual stocks from indiscriminate fishing and avoid exploitation of those stocks within the mix that are below their conservation limit.</p></reply>

The PSO levy consists of a set of support schemes designed to facilitate the Government's electricity policy objectives for renewables, indigenous fuels and security of supply. It also supports employment in the renewables industry and in the peat industry.  The PSO has supported the connection of over 2,000 MW of renewable energy to the electricity grid and will continue to support further renewable energy connection so that the 40% target for renewable electricity penetration by 2020 is met.</p>  <p>  Recent international studies have shown that Ireland has had one of the lowest per unit supports for renewable energy in the European Union.</p>  <p>  The calculation of the level of the PSO is a matter for the Commission on Energy Regulation (CER).  The CER has published a consultation on a proposed levy of &euro;441 million for 2016-2017, equating to less than &euro;7 per month for domestic consumers and representing an annual increase for domestic consumers of &euro;19.32 on last year.  The biggest drivers for the proposed levy increase are the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price and increased deployment of renewables.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the impacts of energy costs on industry and households alike.  As the wholesale electricity price is falling, this should be passed onto domestic electricity customers and more than outweigh the proposed levy increase in the current period.  In this regard I am pleased to see that some electricity suppliers have recently reduced their prices.  Customers can also avail of discounts available, either by contacting their supplier directly or by using the price comparison websites accredited by CER to switch to discounted tariffs.  A customer consuming the average amount of electricity could save over &euro;150 by switching suppliers.</p></reply>

The scheme is one of a number of measures outlined in the Strategy which aims to alleviate energy poverty among our most vulnerable citizens.  Its objective is to better understand how we can improve health and wellbeing  by making homes warmer and more energy efficient.  The scheme has been developed by my Department in close cooperation with the Department of Health and is being operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and the HSE.   &euro;20m has been ear-marked by my Department for the scheme in the period 2016 to 2018, of which &euro;4m will be spent this year.  As it is a pilot scheme, eligibility is necessarily limited. In 2016, the scheme is targeting people over 55, living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, in the Dublin 12 and Dublin 24 areas, living in either an owner-occupied, local authority or approved housing association house and who are in receipt of or eligible for the Fuel Allowance.  The geographical area and clinical criteria for the scheme were identified in close cooperation with the HSE.  Once the HSE has approved an application, a range of measures will be carried out by SEAI including, wall and attic insulation, heating system upgrades, installation of heating controls and other measures deemed appropriate to bring the house to a high level of energy efficiency.  The number of participants will depend on the condition of the homes of those participating and the resulting cost per home.</p>  <p>  While the focus this year is on alleviating the chronic conditions in older people, the aim is to expand the scope of the scheme in 2017 to children with asthma who are also at risk of energy poverty to establish how energy efficiency can also be used to help prevent these conditions developing in the first place.  For the longer term, to determine the scheme's effectiveness, an important part of the scheme is a research and evaluation project which will gather the evidence necessary to inform decisions on a future national roll-out.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Deputy's engagement on this important initiative and his understanding of the need to support those at risk of energy poverty in his constituency.  On-going engagement with stakeholders beyond the immediate reach of this particular pilot scheme will be a very important part of the process to develop the case for wider action, and I look forward to keeping Deputies informed of progress.  While the Warmth &amp;amp; Wellbeing project is limited in scope at present, free energy efficiency upgrades are available to those at risk of energy poverty under the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme, which is also run by SEAI.</p></reply>

As detailed in the Government Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure, the Government does not seek to direct EirGrid in the development of energy infrastructure to particular sites or routes or technologies.  The Grid Link project was originally proposed as a new 400kV overhead line from Knockraha (near Cork City) to Great Island (near Waterford City) and on to Dunstown (near Naas).  The March 2015 EirGrid strategy &quot;<i>Your Grid, Your Views, Your Tomorrow</i>&rdquo;, confirmed the need for the Grid Link project, but due to changing demand forecasts, upgrades to existing lines and advances in technology made new options possible.  </p><p>EirGrid examined various technical solutions and in October 2015 announced that it intended to move forward with the Grid Link project using the Regional Option.  The Regional Option uses series compensation which is an advanced, smart grid technology that will enable more power to flow through existing lines. </p><p>This means there is now no requirement to proceed with the previously proposed Grid Link 400 kV overhead line. </p><p>To complete the Grid Link project using the Regional Solution, an underwater cable across the Shannon estuary is required in addition to some upgrade works to existing transmission lines.  </p></reply>

This Programme also supports the other three regional airports in Counties Donegal, Mayo and Kerry with funding but only in relation to the implementation of necessary safety and security related projects and activities.  The extra &euro;10 million in capital funding that is provided in the Programme for Government will enhance my Department's ability to further support the four airports, including Waterford.</p><p>Development projects at the airports which are designed to expand capacity are a commercial matter for the airports themselves.  In the case of the proposed runway extension at Waterford, I understand that the airport authorities are pursuing local interests for funding in relation to that project.</p><p>Over the past five years, Waterford Airport has received &euro;9.6 million in operational and investment support from my Department.  In April of this year, a further &euro;157,500 in grant aid was approved for a number of security related projects, including new X-ray equipment, at the airport.</p><p>The current Regional Airports Programme covers the period 2015 to 2019 and this Programme was approved in August last year by the EU Commission as being in conformity with the Commission's 2014<i>Guidelines on State aid to airports and airlines</i>.

These discussions are aimed at progressing various technical elements of the SES and are delivering positive results.</p>  <p>  Insofar as obstacles to the creation of a Single European Sky are concerned, I do not believe that there is a particular obstacle per se.  The SES is a highly complex project that will take time to fully deliver.  It is important to emphasise that considerable progress has already been achieved over the past decade or so, particularly in relation to the establishment of Functional Airspace Blocks and also the agreement reached between all Member States on the development  of a performance scheme.  This multi-annual scheme  requires the achievement of demanding performance targets in relation to safety, capacity, environment and cost efficiency, which are delivering improvements.  While further steps clearly need to be taken to overcome the inefficiencies associated with fragmented European airspace, I believe that with persistence and commitment by all parties the key goals of the Single European Sky will be progressively achieved over the coming years.</p></reply>

The purpose of this is to avoid court time being taken up unnecessarily due to cases where there is no disputing the guilt of the individual in question.  This frees up the courts to deal with more serious matters, as well as reducing the administrative and time burden on members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in prosecuting such cases.

Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment (written or verbal), on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees, including entitlement to the national minimum wage.</p>  <p>  All employers, including those in private homes, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment law.  Where the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), which is responsible for securing compliance with employment legislation, receives a complaint involving somebody described as an au pair, the WRC will investigate with a view to establishing whether a person has statutory entitlements under employment law.  Complaints involving au pairs are considered on a case-by-case basis, in the light of the facts of each case.</p>  <p>  The recent WRC decision regarding an individual working as an Au Pair does not constitute any change to existing employment law and any persons working under a contract of employment must continue to have the full protection of employment law.  I have no plans to review the status of au pairs with a view to deeming persons determined to be employees to be outside the scope of employment law.  My Department&rsquo;s remit in this area is primarily concerned with ensuring that those people found to be employees can enforce their rights, as provided for under employment rights legislation.</p></reply>

I. No. 312 of 2016) on 15 June 2016 and they took effect on 17 June 2016.  This Statutory Instrument gives effect to Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the EU audit reform package, comprising Directive (2014/56/EU) which amends Directive 2006/43/EC and a Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.  Accordingly, the EU transposition deadline has been met.</p>  <p>  The Directive applies to all statutory audits while the Regulation adds more stringent rules for the audits of entities such as financial and credit institutions, insurers, funds and listed companies, known as &lsquo;public interest entities&rsquo;.  Both the Directive and the Regulation contain options for Member States to consider.</p>  <p>  Had Ireland not transposed the EU reforms on time, there could have followed a number of negative consequences.  Those include the fact that the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA) would not have been designated as the competent authority and would not have had the appropriate powers to implement and enforce the new enhanced oversight regime for audit.  New rules on ethics and audit reporting for auditors would not have the necessary legislative underpinning.  Auditors and other stakeholders would not have clarity as to how Ireland intended to exercise the options in the EU Directive and Regulation.  National law also gives clarity on how to comply with some of the provisions in the EU Regulation, which is directly applicable in Ireland.  Furthermore, Ireland could have faced infringement proceedings by the European Commission and fines.</p>  <p>  There were some options in the EU Directive and Regulation that were not essential to transposition and could not be accommodated in the Statutory Instrument.  As some of these are considered to be beneficial, it is my intention to introduce a Statutory Audits Bill in the Oireachtas in due course to avail of those options.</p></reply>

Donegal has performed strongly as well in terms of IDA Ireland-supported inward investment since 2011.  I include a table setting out IDA Ireland-sponsored site visits to Donegal since 2009.</p><p>The concrete evidence of winning further investment for the county can be seen in the Agency&rsquo;s results.  In the past five years, employment in IDA Ireland client companies there has grown to 2,530 from a base of 1,877 &ndash; an increase of 35%.  In addition, there are now 3,567 people directly employed in Enterprise Ireland client companies in Donegal.</p><p>This all shows that significant strides have already been made when it comes to securing new employment and investment projects for Donegal and the region.  The Government remains focused, however, on uncovering new opportunities for the Inishowen peninsula, the county and the wider area in the time ahead.</p><p>The North East/North West Action Plan for Jobs, launched last November, aims to deliver 28,000 extra jobs in the counties of Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Louth, Monaghan, and Cavan by 2020.  Key targets in service of this overall goal are to achieve an increase of at least 25% in the number of start-ups in the region; a 25% improvement in the survival rate of new businesses; an increase in the number of IDA investments in the region by 30-40% up to 2019; and an increase of 300 to 500 in the numbers of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta-supported jobs in the North West.</p><p>My Department works closely with its counterpart in Northern Ireland on enterprise development issues which are mutually beneficial.  We also strongly support the work of InterTrade Ireland, the North-South Body, which operates a range of business development activities and is co-funded by both administrations.  In addition, our two Departments co-fund a strand of the EU&rsquo;s INTERREG Programme, which supports a range of research and innovation initiatives.

The purpose of the Directive was to implement the Framework Agreement on part-time work concluded by the European cross-industry organisations UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Framework Agreement, which was annexed to the Directive, was to eliminate discrimination against part-time employees and to improve the quality of part-time work.  It also aimed to facilitate the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis and to contribute to the flexible organisation of working time in a manner which takes into account the needs of employers and employees.  Accordingly, the 2001 Act provides a wide degree of protection for part-time employees, including the general protection that a part-time employee shall not be treated in a less favourable manner in respect of his/her conditions of employment than a full time employee.</p>  <p>  In addition, Section 13(5) of the 2001 Act contained provisions in relation to the preparation and publishing of a Code of Practice by the Labour Relations Commission in relation to the steps that could be taken by employers for the purposes of Clause 5.3 of the Framework Agreement.  Clause 5.3 of the Framework Agreement provided that, as far as possible, an employer should give consideration to a request by workers to transfer from full-time work to part-time and vice-versa.  The Labour Relations Commission prepared this Code of Practice, based on the provisions in Section 13 of the 2001 Act, following consultation with the social partners.  It was deemed to be a Code of Practice and implemented, in 2006, by the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Access to Part-Time Working) (Declaration) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 8 of 2006).  Under Section 42(4) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990, the Code is admissible in evidence in any proceedings before a Court, the Labour Court or an Adjudication Officer of the Workplace Relations Commission.  Since 1st October 2015, the Workplace Relations Commission has taken over the role and functions of the Labour Relations Commission (including the Rights Commissioners&rsquo; Service of the Labour Relations Commission) as well as the functions of the Equality Tribunal and the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) and the first-instance (complaints and referrals) functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p>  <p>  I understand that IBEC and ICTU were involved in the process of drafting the Directive&rsquo;s Framework Agreement at European level through the European social partner organisations.  At national level, a tripartite group involving this Department, ICTU, IBEC and other relevant Government Departments was established to consider the measures necessary for implementing the Directive in Ireland prior to publication of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill 2000.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Ireland has met its responsibilities in transposing EU Council Directive 97/81/EC into national law.  This position is confirmed by a 2003 report on the implementation of the Directive undertaken by the European Commission.</p></reply>

This includes the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2014, National Minimum Wage Act 2000, the Payment of Wages Act 1991, the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2001, the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001, the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 and the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012.</p>  <p>  I understand the dispute at issue relates to the proposed redundancy of a number of staff members due to restructuring of the organisation.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery continues to be available to assist in the resolution of this dispute and I would urge the parties to engage with them in order to resolve their differences in this instance.  Even what often appears to be the most intractable of disputes is capable of resolution where both sides engage constructively and in good faith in this voluntary process.  The principle of good faith implies that both sides in a dispute make every effort to reach an agreement and endeavour, through genuine and constructive negotiations, to arrive at a conclusion that is satisfactory to all concerned.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, whether in redundancy or other collective disputes, rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement mechanisms to support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences.</p></reply>

It must be emphasised that the 40 year age difference between a foster carer, or relative foster carer, and foster child is only a guideline, not a policy, and does not determine a decision regarding suitability.  It is more important that the relative carer has the ability to meet the needs of the particular child or sibling group.  The potential carer's age is just one of many factors that is taken into account, including health, level of co-operation and communication with social service and the ability to meet all the needs, including any specialised need, of the child.</p>  <p>  Placement endings are made following careful consideration of the best interest of the child and, where appropriate, oversight by the courts.  The Child and Family Agency, Tusla does not collect data at a national level on the ages of relative foster carers and the children placed with them.  At the end of April 2016, 28% of all children in care were in a foster care placement with relatives, many of whom are grandparents.</p>  <p>  Tusla is currently in the process of planning a review of the criteria used by foster care committees in decision making.</p></reply>

These are the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, the Community Childcare Subvention Private (CCSP) Programme and the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes.  These programmes primarily provide support for childcare and early years education in formal settings such as preschools and creches, some of which are run by community/not-for profit organisations, and some by private providers.</p>  <p>  With a budget of  &euro;233m for 2016, the largest scheme  is the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which from September 2016, will make free pre-school available for 15 hours per week for 38 weeks per annum to all children from the time they turn three, until they go to school, entering at three points in the year: September, January and April.  On average, from September 2016, children will benefit from 61 weeks, up from the current provision of 38 weeks.  Access to the average 61 weeks of ECCE can reduce the cost of childcare by &euro;4000 per child.  The current ECCE programme is accommodating 67,000 children; this figure will increase to 127,000 next year.</p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare, including after-school care, at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.  Parents qualify as disadvantaged or low income on the basis of means-tested entitlements.  With a budget of &euro;45m it is anticipated that over 25,000 children will benefit from this programme this year in over 900 community (not for profit) childcare services.  In the case of full day care, parents qualifying for the higher rate of subvention under the CCS programme  can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge for childcare in the participating childcare facility.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2016, the Department announced an expansion of the CCS programme to allow private services to offer the programme. This expansion provided for a further 3,200 (full-time equivalent) childcare places on the programme, or approximately 8,000 children based on average uptake.  The expansion also saw the inclusion of private childcare providers in the CCS Programme for the first time.  The Community Childcare Subvention Private (CCSP) Programme launched in March 2016.  The  2016 budget for CCSP programme is &euro;16m.</p>  <p>  The following three programmes ASCC, CEC and CETS are known collectively as the Training and Employment Childcare ('TEC') programmes.</p>  <p>  My Department administers two programmes, ASCC and CEC,  on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  ASCC provides subsidised childcare to support low-income and unemployed people who have primary school children in returning to work or to increase their days of employment.  CEC supports people engaged in Community Employment Schemes who have preschool children and/or primary school children.  Eligibility for these programmes is the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  - The After-School Childcare (ASCC) programme has a budget of &euro;1.3m and has capacity to provide 300 whole-time equivalent after-school places annually.   Each eligible parent is given a maximum allowance of 52 weeks of ASCC which does not have to be used consecutively, but when it is exhausted, the parent's eligibility ceases.  ASCC childcare places are subject to availability and are allocated on a first-come first served basis.  The programme pays childcare services &euro;40 per week for an after-school place or &euro;80 per week in situations where the childcare service provides a pick-up service that collects or brings the child to and from school.  The programme also provides a full day care rate of &euro;105 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  In all cases, the maximum fee payable by parents is &euro;15 per week per child.</p>  <p>  - The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme, with a budget of &euro;6.7m, has capacity to provide 1,200 preschool places and 800 afterschool places.  It is targeted specifically at participants in the Community Employment (CE) schemes.  Each eligible parent can avail of a maximum of 50 weeks childcare per academic year.  Eligible parents must reapply for childcare each September.  CEC childcare places are subject to availability and are allocated on a first-come first served basis.  Under this programme, childcare services are paid &euro;80 per week for pre-school places for children up to the age of 5 and &euro;40 per week for after-school places for primary school children up to the age of 13, with a set charge of &euro;15 per week to the parent in either case. The programme also provides a part time day care rate of &euro;80 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  </p>  <p>  My Department administers the Childcare Education and Training Support programme on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  With a budget of &euro;17m, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme provides 2,500 childcare places, including part-time and after-school places, to qualifying Solas or Education and Training Boards (ETB) trainees or students for the duration of their courses.  Eligibility for the CETS programme is determined by the Department of Education and Skills. </p>  <p>  In late 2017 my Department plans to replace ASCC, CEC, CETS and CCS/CCSP; with a single and simplified programme that will be available through community (not for profit) and private childcare providers.  This programme, when developed, will provide an infrastructure through which any further investment in the subsidisation of childcare can be delivered. </p></reply>

The capabilities being researched and developed by the Defence Forces in cooperation with research companies and institutions are wide ranging.  They cover capabilities such as Maritime Surveillance; Energy Conservation; Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) research including CBRN Protection, and Improvised Explosives Devices (IED) detection and destruction.  The Defence Forces are a military force. Given the nature of their role on robust overseas operations, they need access to the latest communications and surveillance technologies and weapons systems in order to carry out their duties safely and effectively.  This means having weapons guidance systems, simulators, surveillance systems, communications, robots and drones along with all the other elements of force protection.</p>  <p>  While there is not an armaments industry in Ireland and it is not the intention of this Government to establish one, there are however opportunities to develop new technologies and to further develop and enhance existing systems and capabilities which will have dual military and civil application.  This can be achieved through continuous engagement between Irish enterprise and research centres and the Defence Forces.  The aim is to maximise synergies across both the civil and military domains and to develop leading edge technology and systems here in Ireland.  Successful exploitation of current research and the knowledge which the Defence Forces can provide in this area also has the potential to contribute to the creation and retention of jobs in innovation and research in Irish Enterprises and third level institutes.   </p>  <p>  Projects proposed by institutes and companies, where they are seeking to partner with or involve Defence Forces participation, are submitted to the Defence Enterprise Committee for consideration.  The Defence Enterprise Committee consists of personnel from the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and Enterprise Ireland. All capabilities to be researched are vetted and agreed at the highest level in the Defence Organisation to ensure compatibility with the roles assigned to the Defence Forces by the Government.</p></reply>

Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the following tabular statement. </p><p>The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 199 personnel, the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in Syria with 136 personnel and the Naval Service humanitarian mission in the Mediterranean with 57 personnel. </p><p>Irish soldiers deployed to UNIFIL serve alongside Finnish Armed Forces as part of a joint Battalion which is currently under Finnish command. Ireland takes over command of the Battalion from Finland in November 2016 at which time an additional Company of some 150 personnel will be deployed to UNIFIL bringing Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to this mission to 340 personnel approximately.  In addition, Major General Michael Beary, will take over the prestigious role of Force Commander and Head of Misssion in UNIFIL shortly.  A headquarters team and close protection support team amounting in total to approximately 20 personnel will deploy with him.  Apart from these additional deployments to UNIFIL, no new missions are envisaged at this time. </p><p>The Department of Defence constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas.  With regard to any future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis.  When considering any particular request, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved are amongst the factors considered. </p><p>Defence Forces personnel serving on all overseas missions are equipped with the most modern and effective equipment. This equipment enables troops to carry out the mission assigned, as well as providing the required protection specific to the mission.  Ongoing threat assessments are carried out in mission areas and we continually review both equipment and force assets, to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately equipped to fulfill their roles.  I am satisfied that all appropriate security measures are in place to ensure the safety of all Defence Forces personnel serving overseas.</p><p>The current contribution of some 474 Defence Forces personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.</p><p><i>Members of the Permanent Defence Force Serving Overseas</i></p><p><i>As of 1</i><i><sup>st</sup></i><i>June 2016</i></p><p>1. <i>UN MISSIONS</i></p><p>(i) UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) HQ 9 </p><p>UNIFIL 53<sup>rd</sup>Infantry Group 186 </p><p>UNIFIL Sector West HQ 4</p><p>(ii) UNTSO(United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation) Israel &amp;amp; Syria 10 </p><p>(iii) MINURSO(United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara) 3 </p><p>(iv) MONUSCO(United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic 4 </p><p>Republic of the Congo</p><p>(v) UNOCI (United Nations Mission in Ivory Coast) 2 </p><p>(vi) UNDOF (United Nations Disengagement Observer Force) HQ, 7 </p><p>Golan Heights, Syria</p><p>UNDOF 52<sup>nd</sup>Infantry Group 129 </p><p>TOTAL 354</p><p><i>UN MANDATED MISSIONS</i></p><p>(vii) EUFOR (EU-led Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina) 7 </p><p>(viii) EUTM Mali (EU-Led Training Mission) 13 </p><p>(ix)KFOR(International Security Presence in Kosovo ) HQ 12 </p><p>2. <i>OTHER DEPLOYMENTS</i></p><p>Naval Service Humanitarian Mission in Mediterranean L.&Eacute;.

The health and welfare of the men and women of the Irish Defence Forces is a priority for me.  The choice of medication for overseas deployment, including the use of Lariam, is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Irish Defence Forces.   </p>  <p>  A Malaria Chemoprophylaxis working group was re-convened in August 2015.  The purpose of the group is to review inter alia issues arising in relation to the use of Lariam, particularly in the context of the current and potential litigation; to review the Defence Forces approach in relation to the use of malaria chemoprophylaxis in the Defence Forces; and to ensure that the procedures in relation thereto continue to be appropriate and in accordance with best medical practice as promulgated by the relevant medical authorities.  In addition, the Group was tasked with reviewing the use of the drug Primaquine as part of the overall medical treatment process for those deployed to malarious areas. </p>  <p>  Malaria is a serious disease that killed approximately 438,000 people in 2015 as reported by the World Health Organisation, with 90% of deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.  It is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area.  Anti-malarial medications, including Lariam, remain in the formulary of medications prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease. </p></reply>

The current Irish contingent, the 52nd Infantry Group, comprising 129 personnel, is based in UNDOF Headquarters in Camp Ziouani.  It operates in the role of a Quick Reaction Force, which is on standby to assist with on-going operations within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility.  Seven (7) other Defence Forces personnel are also deployed in UNDOF Headquarters.   </p>  <p>  The Department of Defence constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas and these missions are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  On the margins of an informal meeting of Defence Ministers in Luxembourg on the 3rd September 2015, the then Minister for Defence, Mr. Simon Coveney, had discussions regarding the Defence Forces participation in UN peacekeeping operations including the UNDOF mission, with the UN Under Secretary-General, Mr Herv&eacute; Ladsous.  He confirmed Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to UN operations, and in relation to UNDOF, he pointed out that if Ireland was not required in UNDOF in the future, then consideration would be given to other options for deployments on behalf of the UN.  At this point in time, however, the presence of the UNDOF mission remains an important element in ensuring stability on the Golan Heights and in the Middle East region and, today, the Government approved continued participation by the Defence Forces in UNDOF for a further twelve months.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s recent review of foreign policy and the Defence White Paper confirmed that Ireland will continue to maintain its  traditional policy of military neutrality which means non-membership of military alliances and non-participation in common or mutual defence arrangements.  </p><p>  Ireland's policy of military neutrality was formed in an era when inter-State conflict was the key issue of national security for most States.  The State&rsquo;s policy of remaining outside of military alliances has remained in place ever since.  Thankfully, the threat of inter-State war in Europe is much diminished, but there will continue to be new and emerging threats in the defence and security environment. </p><p>  The reality remains that the world continues to evolve to such an extent that no one country alone can respond adequately to the threats in the defence and security environment and inevitably there will be threats and challenges that have not yet been anticipated. Such security challenges will require an enhanced collective and comprehensive approach, and there will be an increasing emphasis on security co-operation. </p><p>  The issue of overflights by foreign military aircraft and the use of Shannon by foreign military aircraft are the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  However, the Deputy will be aware that successive Governments have made overflight and landing facilities available at Shannon Airport to the United States for well over 50 years.  These arrangements do not amount to any form of military alliance with the US and are governed by strict conditions, applied to ensure compatibility with our traditional policy of military neutrality.  </p><p>  Finally, it goes without saying that all our policy responses must realistically reflect current and future security challenges and should be able to accommodate the necessary responses, both national and collective without prejudice to our policy of military neutrality. </p></reply>

The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services, the establishment of the Permanent Defence Force and available resources.  As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force targeted recruitment takes place so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels as set out above in accordance with available training capacity.  A General Service recruitment campaign that was launched on 13 April 2016, and the 2016 Cadet Competition launched on 16 March 2016, are both now closed and applications are being processed.  It is envisaged that there will be an intake of 600 general services recruits in 2016 and a further 850 in 2017.  This recruitment will be phased over the 2016 and 2017 period in a manner designed to increase personnel numbers towards the established strength and plans are being put in place to this end.  Most of the new recruits this year will be drawn from the existing General Service panel. A new panel will be established from the current competition.  Recruitment from this new panel is expected to commence towards the end of 2016 and will continue through 2017 and into 2018. It is too early at this stage to predict whether and when a 2017 competition may be required, as it will depend on the numbers who are successful in the current competition and are placed on the panel and the level of turnover in the Defence Forces. </p></reply>

This commitment was also reflected in the White Paper on Defence, published in August 2015, which sets out the policy framework for the Defence Organisation for the next ten years and beyond.   </p>  <p>  The objective of this Scheme is to help develop a path to economic independence for participants, aged between 18 and 24 years, who are at a serious disadvantage owing to their current socio-economic situation.  The Scheme is designed with the specific aim of equipping participants with life and other marketable and certifiable skills which will assist them both in their capacity to participate fully in society as well as their ability to enter the workforce and or to pursue further education for this purpose. </p>  <p>  The scheme and the programme content have been developed through detailed consultation involving the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces, the Department of Social Protection and the Dublin and Dun-Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  A work group which includes representatives from each of the aforementioned organisations has developed the detail of the initiative with key stakeholders.  Prior to the commencement of the scheme, a meeting was held with both Defence Forces Representative Associations, RACO and PDFORRA, where a detailed presentation and briefing was provided on the proposal and the content of the scheme and, at which, any questions raised were addressed   </p>  <p>  The pilot scheme commenced on Monday 20th June 2016 for 28 participants in Gormanston Camp for 10 weeks.  The total estimated cost of running the pilot programme is &euro;240,000. Following review of the pilot programme, it will be possible to calculate the actual costs incurred and therefore accurately estimate the cost of the Scheme on an ongoing basis.  The success of the pilot scheme will inform the progress of rolling out the scheme.  However, it is important to state, that based on current resource constraints, it is anticipated that a maximum of 2 programmes could be run per annum. </p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection identified suitable participants for participation in the pilot scheme. The basic selection criteria applied were that the person must:</p>  <p>  - be aged between 18 and 24,</p>  <p>  - be unemployed,</p>  <p>  - want to take part in the programme, and</p>  <p>  - be healthy and physically able to take part in outdoor activities. </p>  <p>  Potential candidates were then interviewed by a member of the Defence Forces and an official from Department of Social Protection.  Candidates who were successful at interview were then required to pass security vetting and be medically certified as fit to undergo the programme of training by their own civilian GP, prior to the commencement date of the pilot scheme. </p></reply>

Subject to the operational demands and requirements of the mission, it is intended that there will be two rotations (i.e. 3 Naval Service vessels deployed) with each deployment lasting approximately 12 weeks. </p>  <p>  L.&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n was deployed to the Mediterranean on 1 May 2016 and commenced patrolling in the area of operations on 12 May 2016. To date, L.&Eacute;. R&oacute;is&iacute;n has rescued 893 people bringing the overall total rescued by the Naval Service during 2015 and 2016 to 9,485.   </p>  <p>  The role of the Irish Naval vessel is to provide a search and rescue capability and to undertake humanitarian search and rescue operations at sea in the Mediterranean.  Assistance to persons in distress at sea will be provided in accordance with the applicable provisions of international conventions governing search and rescue situations. Co-ordination of search and rescue efforts and the provision of humanitarian assistance is being achieved through close co-operation with the relevant Italian authorities. </p>  <p>  The despatch of Irish naval vessels represents a tangible and valuable Irish national contribution to assisting with the continuing migration crisis in the Mediterranean.   </p>  <p>  At EU level, the EU naval operation against human smugglers and traffickers in the Mediterranean, Operation Sophia, was launched at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting on 22 June 2015. Its mission is to identify, capture and dispose of vessels and enabling assets used or suspected of being used by migrant smugglers or traffickers.  The objectives are not only to disrupt the activities of smugglers and traffickers; but also to prevent further loss of life at sea and to reduce the suffering and exploitation of migrants caused by criminal organisations.   </p>  <p>  While Ireland is fully supportive of the EU approach to this crisis, there are no plans to deploy naval personnel or vessels to the EU Mission at this time.  Any consideration of future participation by the Irish Defence Forces in Operation Sophia will be subject to the applicable National statutory requirements being met.</p></reply>

In addition to these bilateral contacts, two official meetings of EU Defence Ministers are held during each six month EU Presidency.  The most recent meeting of Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers took place in Luxembourg on 18 April 2016.  Discussions at the meeting covered a wide range of European Defence and Security issues and associated challenges.  I am also kept fully appraised of issues arising from meetings which officials from my Department attend in the area of European Defence and Security.  As with the formulation of any policy, best practice and lessons learnt in other jurisdictions will always inform EU policy formulation to ensure that it is robust, coherent and meets the needs of Member States. </p><p>  In relation to International Terrorism issues at EU level, this is primarily a matter for Justice and Interior ministers under the Justice and Home Affairs umbrella.  Within this State, primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In that regard, among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  There is ongoing and close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters, including ATCP deployments and a wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies.  Regular coordination and liaison meetings also take place between the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues.  It is my priority as Minister for Defence to ensure that the operational capacity of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible.  As the Deputy will be aware, the previous Minister for Defence attended the meeting of Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers, which took place in Brussels on 17 November 2015 at which my French colleague, Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drein, invoked Article 42.7 of the Treaty on European Union, following the tragic events in Paris on 13 November last. </p><p>  Following that invocation there was liaison between officials from my Department and French authorities at which various options for how Ireland could be of assistance were explored.  One option explored was examining what support Ireland would be able to offer to UN mandated missions which suffered gaps as a result of France or other nations withdrawing forces to undertake alternative operations.  The outcome to the French request for support was the enhancement of our current deployment to the EU Training Mission in Mali, to which 10 members of the Permanent Defence Force were previously deployed.  This figure will now be increased to 18.  The issue of also providing support to the UN peacekeeping mission MINUSMA is being kept under review.</p></reply>

The UK led EU Battlegroup Memorandum of Understanding is an agreement between the participants, namely Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, and the UK, which sets out principles in relation to the operation, deployment and management of the UK led EU Battlegroup.

They define the UK as the Framework Nation and broadly outline the purpose of the MoU. </p><p>Sections 5 to 8 deal with the consultation process, exercise, training, certification and the operation of the Battlegroup. Most Battlegroup training will take place in the contributing Member States - i.e. Irish troops will mainly be trained in Ireland. </p><p>Sections 9 to 13 outline the arrangements in terms of financing, logistics, classified information, the status of forces and the issue of claims and liabilities.</p><p>Sections 14 to 16 deal with the process of participation of additional States in the Battlegroup, the timelines for coming into effect and termination of the Memorandum of Understanding and the process for dispute resolution.</p><p>For the most part, Battlegroup training takes place in the contributing member States i.e. Irish troops are mainly trained in Ireland, Swedish troops in Sweden etc.  Training and military exercises which have already taken place over the six months in preparation for the Battlegroup standing up on 01 July 2016 are set out in the table below. </p><p>In respect of deployment, it is the case that no Battlegroup has ever deployed to date.  Each Battlegroup participant retains the right to deploy or not to deploy its forces, irrespective of an EU decision to launch a Battlegroup operation. Equally, each Battlegroup participant retains the sovereign right to withdraw its contingent at any time.  The command of each contingent remains under national control, with operational control delegated to the operational commander.  Any deployment of the Irish contribution as part of the UK Battlegroup will be subject to a UN mandate and Government approval.

However, the choice of malaria chemoprophylaxis for use by other armed forces is an internal matter for those forces.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on other States&rsquo; policy in this regard.  The health and welfare of the men and women of the Irish Defence Forces is a priority for me.  The choice of medication for overseas deployment, including the use of Lariam, is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Irish Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The aim of the Defence Forces policy on malaria chemoprophylaxis is to minimise risk to all deployed personnel.  Significant precautions are taken by Irish Defence Forces Medical Officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of our Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications.  It is the policy of the Irish Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability.  The objective is to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by malaria.   </p>  <p>  Malaria is a serious disease which killed approximately 438,000 people in 2015, with 90% of deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa as reported by the World Health Organisation.  It is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area.  Anti-malarial medications, including Lariam, remain in the formulary of medications prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990 the Defence Forces Representative Associations are prohibited from being associated with, or affiliated to any trade unions, or any other body without the consent of the Minister.  Accordingly, the Representative Association PDFORRA cannot be affiliated to ICTU at present.  The basis for the prohibition is that it would be inappropriate to apply the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 to members of the Defence Forces.  The taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.  The Defence Forces may be called on to contribute to maintaining vital services in times of industrial action.  The potential for serious difficulties and conflicts could arise in these circumstances if the Defence Forces Representative Associations were associated with, or affiliated to ICTU, given ICTU rules in relation to such matters.  A number of mechanisms have been put in place through the Defence Forces Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme to compensate for the prohibition on affiliation to ICTU.  These provide the Representative Associations with structures and processes, which enable them to make representations and negotiate on behalf of their members.</p>  <p>  In addition, a framework exists which facilitates the Associations engaging with the official side in talks parallel to those taking place between ICTU and the official side at National level.  This parallel process was successfully operated in respect of discussions, facilitated by the Workplace Relations Commission, on an extension to the &lsquo;Public Service Agreement 2010 &ndash; 2018&rsquo; leading to the Lansdowne Road Agreement.</p>  <p>  Following on from a case brought to the European Committee on Social Rights by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (AGSI), a complaint has now been made by EUROMIL (a European umbrella body for military associations), on behalf of the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA), alleging a breach of Article 5 (the right to organise) and Article 6 (the right to bargain collectively) of the European Social Charter.   </p>  <p>  Submissions have been lodged to the European Committee on Social Rights setting out Ireland&rsquo;s position in the matter and a further Response to Submissions was lodged by Ireland on 26th February 2016.</p>  <p>  I remain satisfied with the present arrangements in place and have no plans to make any changes.</p></reply>

Leadership training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensures that personnel are prepared for exercising command authority across the full range of military functions both at home and overseas in international operations.  Skills training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensures that its personnel have the requisite individual, specialist, and crew skills.  Career training and education provides the organisation with the necessary pool of leaders and commanders at all levels.  Collective Training allows military personnel to use their individual, crew, specialist and career training together, to develop integrated and coherent combat forces. Emphasis is placed on joint and combined exercises.</p>  <p>  The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve, is underpinned by an analysis of training needed to meet operational output requirements and capability development needs.  A long term strategy is adopted with current planning horizons out to 2021.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces seek to constantly benchmark training across all three arms against best military and academic practice.  Military best practice is ensured by implementing a policy of standardisation that is in line with EU and Partnership for Peace partners.  Academic best practice is ensured by benchmarking courses through accreditation under the National Framework of Qualifications which is validated by Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  The Defence Forces delivers military programmes and modules meeting national and international standards. The Defence Forces also engages with external educational institutions in order to facilitate organisational learning.  This engagement with national and international educational institutions, military and civilian, aims to ensure that the Defence Forces retains currency with regards to best international practice.</p></reply>

In addition, it is intended that the two CASA 235s Maritime Patrol Aircraft will also be replaced. The existing Pilatus PC9 aircraft are not due for replacement until 2025. The current EC 135 and AW 139 helicopter fleet in the Air Corps will continue to deliver the required Defence Forces support and other support capabilities over the lifetime of the White Paper. </p>  <p>  The current Naval Service ship replacement programme will have replaced three Naval Service vessels by July 2016.  Last week, agreement was reached with Babcock International for the provision of an additional ship for the Naval Service to be built in their facility in Appledore, Devon.  This ship will be the same class as the three newest vessels, L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett, L&Eacute; James Joyce and L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats.  The agreed contract value for the further ship is &euro;54.3 million (&euro;66.78 million inclusive of VAT) and delivery is expected within two years, which ties in with the project planning process in place under the White Paper on Defence which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements. </p>  <p>  The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the current flagship, L&Eacute; Eithne, by a multi-roled vessel (MRV). L&Eacute; Eithne was built in 1984.  In addition, the two existing Coastal Patrol Vessels, L&Eacute; Ciara and L&Eacute; Orla are due for replacement in the coming years (also built in 1984).  It is outlined in the White Paper that these ships will be replaced with similar type vessels with countermine and counter IED capabilities.</p>  <p>  In addition, the White Paper recognises the requirement to maintain and upgrade vessels having regard to emerging operational requirements and changes in technology.</p>  <p>  The Army will continue to retain all-arms conventional military capabilities, and the principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas.  There will be a focus on the essential force protection provided by armoured vehicles and the most cost effective option of upgrading or replacing the current fleet will be identified.  A small number of armoured logistical vehicles will be procured for force protection overseas.</p>  <p>  There will be continued investment in the development of suitable network enabled communications in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex operational environment.  This is also a priority area for investment if additional funding, beyond that required to maintain existing capabilities, is made available.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current provisions, together with the courses of action in the White Paper, will ensure that the Defence Forces are fully equipped and trained to meet the roles placed on them.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-21a.1673.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062100087#WRCC04800"><p>There is no specific recruitment campaign aimed at young unemployed persons.  Applications to join the Defence Forces are open to all persons who fulfil certain criteria.  The criteria that apply to all applicants for General Service Recruitment Competitions require that they must undergo psychometric tests, a fitness test, a competency based interview, a medical examination and undergo Security Clearance.  Applicants must be at least 18 years of age and under 25 years of age on the closing date of applications for the Army, and must be at least 18 years of age and under 27 years of age on the closing date of applications for the Naval Service.  No formal education qualifications are required to join the Defence Forces as a recruit.  However, applicants must satisfy the Interview Board and the Recruiting Officer that they possess a sufficient standard of education for service in the Permanent Defence Force.  I am advised that educational standards for those who do not sit exams in the State are governed by the National University of Ireland set equivalent.  A General Service recruitment campaign that was launched on 13 April 2016, and the 2016 Cadet Competition launched on 16 March 2016, are both now closed and applications are being processed.</p>  <p>  However, in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a strengthened approach across the economy to social responsibility, the Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to introduce a pilot employment support scheme with the direct involvement of the Defence Forces.  This commitment was also reflected in the White Paper on Defence, published in August 2015, which sets out the policy framework for the Defence Organisation for the next ten years and beyond.   </p>  <p>  The objective of this Scheme is to help develop a path to economic independence for participants, aged between 18 and 24 years, who are at a serious disadvantage owing to their current socio-economic situation.  The Scheme is designed with the specific aim of equipping participants with life and other marketable and certifiable skills which will assist them both in their capacity to participate fully in society as well as their ability to enter the workforce and or to pursue further education for this purpose. </p>  <p>  The scheme and the programme content have been developed through detailed consultation involving the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces, the Department of Social Protection and the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  A work group which includes representatives from each of the aforementioned organisations has developed the detail of the initiative with key stakeholders. </p></reply>
