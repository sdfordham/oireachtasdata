    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-01-14a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016011400053#WRA00600"><p>I am aware of the difficulties that the absence of flood insurance cover can cause to householders and businesses. However, the provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks. In my role as Minister for Finance, I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals. </p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems, with a view to addressing the increased availability of flood insurance. To achieve this aim, there is a focus on prioritising spending on flood relief measures, development and implementation of plans by the Office of Public Works (OPW) to implement flood relief schemes. This strategy is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland which provides for the transfer by the OPW of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes to the insurance industry, which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed.  </p>  <p>  The current flooding crisis has raised issues in relation to insurance and flooding. The Taoiseach and some other of my colleagues in Government met the insurance industry on Tuesday to discuss the industry role in providing flood insurance and to obtain industry views on flood insurance issues such as those outlined in the Deputy's question. The Taoiseach has asked the insurance industry to revert back within two weeks following further consideration of their approach to the provision of insurance in areas where demountable defences are in place, along with details on the availability of insurance in areas with flood defences. I  would also note that my own officials are undertaking detailed research on alternative options with the potential to ensure greater availability of flood insurance. This will be in the form of a comparative analysis of the different approaches to flood insurance in other countries.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-01-14a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016011400053#WRA00900"><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the combined Income Tax and Universal Social Charge paid by the lowest 10% of income earners, approximately 240,000, results in an average effective income tax rate of approximately 0.12%.  The average effective income tax rate for the highest 10% of income earners on the same basis is approximately 31%. It is important to note that due to Ireland's highly progressive income tax system the effective income tax rate payable increases in line with an individual's income level, such that those on the highest incomes are liable to effective income tax rates of over 40%.</p>  <p>  These estimates are provided by the Revenue Commissioners, based on estimates for 2016, using the actual data for the year 2013 (the latest year for which data are available) adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim. They are provisional and may be revised.</p>  <p>  I believe the Deputy may be referring in his question to other forms of taxation paid by individuals, including indirect taxes such as VAT and excise duties, and to research on indirect taxes relative to a person's current income.  In this context, it is worth noting that the cohort of people with lowest incomes includes those with other sources of support which can supplement their spending. As such, a measure of their indirect taxes paid as a proportion of their current income would not be appropriate, and a measure as a percentage of spending is more representative.</p>  <p>  When taken as a proportion of spending, research indicates that indirect taxes are flat at 15% across the bottom six income deciles.  Taken together, a highly progressive income tax and effectively flat indirect taxes point towards an overall progressive tax system.</p>  <p>  Deputies will also be aware that the VAT system in Ireland operates a number of reduced VAT rates to assist those less well off.  For example, there is a zero VAT rate on food, children's clothes and oral medicines.  In addition, many services are exempt from VAT such as transport, education, schools and hospitals.</p></reply>

This can be achieved by keeping expenditure growth below the trend growth rate of the economy. </p>  <p>   Budgetary forecasts for the next five years were set out in Budget 2016. The Deputy will be aware that these provided for an increase in expenditure of over &euro;700 million in 2016, while tax reductions worth approximately &euro;700 million were also announced. </p>  <p>  The 2016 Expenditure Report published separately by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on Budget day, outlines Ministerial expenditure ceilings for the period to 2018. These amounts are reflected in the medium term budgetary forecasts prepared by my Department which also provide for demographic costs, public sector pay agreement, the public capital programme and also provide for the indexation of the income tax system. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the forecast level of net fiscal space available for each year over the forecast horizon, was set out in Table A9 of the Budget and is based upon these and a number of other baseline assumptions, which are also set out in the accompanying Budget tables. </p>  <p>  The overarching objective of recent fiscal policy in recent years has been to return the public finances to a sustainable basis while promoting economic growth. Ireland will exit the excessive procedure because the general government deficit will be substantially below 3% of GDP in 2015. Indeed, the strong end-year Exchequer figures indicate that, all things being equal, the deficit for 2015 will be closer to 1&frac12;% of GDP, down from the budget day forecast of 2.1% of GDP. In terms of economic growth, Budget 2016 contained forecasts of 6.2% and 4.3% for 2015 and 2016 respectively. </p>  <p>  Figures up to the end of last year show that the recovery is gathering pace with the OECD expecting Ireland to be the fastest growing economy in the OECD in both 2015 and 2016. Encouragingly consumer spending is continuing to grow, a component of GDP that is both tax and jobs rich. The level of economic activity is already above pre-crisis levels, but importantly it is now more balanced than was the case at the height of the bubble, when it was driven largely by construction. Indeed, employment in 12 of the 14 economic sectors, highlighted in the recent Quarterly National Household Survey, has increased. On the domestic side, consumption and investment are contributing very positively, with very strong data also recorded on the external side. Overall the data available are consistent with an economy that is performing very strongly.</p>  <p>  Having said that, it is clear that global prospects are increasingly uncertain, with difficulties in emerging market economies and elsewhere. Accordingly, it is imperative that we remain competitive and continue to take the correct policy choices to underpin the sustainability of the public finances.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-01-14a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016011400053#WRA01800"><p>I am informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that, as part on-going supervision, the Bank, working in conjunction with the ECB as part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, continues to challenge the banks on their strategies, management, measurement and reporting of the resolution and restructuring of all non-performing loans including SME NPLs. Relevant actions taken by the Central Bank in recent years have been extensive and include inter alia capital assessment reviews, stress tests, distressed credit operation reviews, balance sheet assessment exercises, SME loan resolution bank specific targets, on-site inspections and on-going, intensive supervisory engagement with the banks regarding distressed debt. </p>  <p>  In 2013 non-public institution specific SME distressed loan resolution targets were set for a number of banks. The targets required the banks to develop strategies, at borrower level, to resolve their non-performing loans. The targets ended in Q1 2015 with lenders reporting that they satisfied the requirements set out. Progress has been made by the relevant institutions in resolving SME NPLs in recent years and NPL trends continue to move in a positive trajectory. Bank of Ireland have indicated that they have reached resolution in 90% of distressed SME cases and more than 9 out of 10 restructured business banking borrowers continue to meet their agreed arrangements. AIB has also made significant progress in reducing distressed loan balances with the process of restructuring the group's SME book reaching its latter stages with the majority of offered SME restructures either complete or at the final stages of completion. </p>  <p>  Recognising these developments, alongside changes in the supervision of the banks following the introduction of the SSM, the Central Bank's approach to commercial NPL resolution utilises a bank specific approach taking into consideration a number of factors including inter alia the institution's NPL resolution strategy and operational capability. The sustainable resolution of distressed SME loans remains a significant priority for the Central Bank and will therefore continue to be central to their supervisory focus throughout 2016 and beyond. Supervision will continue to be intrusive, supplemented by targeted inspections and enhanced monitoring of performance of the banks in delivery of supervisory objectives.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-01-14a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016011400053#WRA02100"><p>The creation of employment opportunities is a key commitment of this Government. Annual Action Plans for Jobs have been developed since 2012 with the overall goal of sustaining existing jobs and creating one hundred thousand additional jobs by 2016. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the lifeblood of the Irish Economy. They make up the vast majority of businesses in Ireland and account for approximately seven in every ten jobs.  Supporting the finance needs of these businesses is therefore a priority for this Government. </p>  <p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) was incorporated in September 2014 and its goal is to ensure access to flexible and lower cost funding for Irish SMEs.  The SBCI launched its first product programme in February 2015 and lending to SMEs commenced in early March 2015 through its initial 'on lending' partners AIB and Bank of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Up to 30 September 2015, some &euro;110 million in SME loans were approved and drawn down by c.3200 SMEs.  The loans have been taken up by Irish SMEs for a variety of purposes and across a range of sectors in the economy.  More than 90% of loans were for investment purposes and the average loan size is approximately &euro;35,000. There is a wide geographical spread and the vast majority of loans are to regionally based SMEs outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  To further meet the financing needs of SMEs in Q4 2015 the SBCI announced on-lending agreements with two non-bank lenders, Finance Ireland and Merrion Fleet.  This is a key step in creating greater competition for SME lending in the Irish market, by supporting smaller indigenous providers of finance and providing funding for a broader range of products, including Asset Finance, Leasing and Contract Hire. Furthermore, the SBCI announced in December 2015 an additional &euro;200m facility with AIB to continue to lend to Irish businesses seeking lower cost working capital, business investment, agriculture and refinancing loans.</p>  <p>  The SBCI is in advanced discussions with a number of other bank and non-bank lenders, and it is anticipated that further announcements of new on-lending agreements will be made in the coming weeks and months.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that of the SBCI's initial funding capacity of &euro;800 million, &euro;676 million has now been committed to its 'on lending' partners to support the financing needs of SMEs.</p>  <p>  The SBCI is committed to leveraging existing and new relationships with on-lending partners to support SME growth and investment through the provision of lower cost and longer term funding.   The SBCI has made significant progress over 2015, both in terms of providing funding to SMEs, and in relation to building a strong infrastructure through which it will continue to provide long term support to SMEs.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may be interested to note that the SBCI is currently preparing a detailed analysis of its lending activity for 2015 and that this will be published during quarter one of 2016.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-01-14a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016011400053#WRA02400"><p>The Deputy will be aware that in my role as Minister for Finance I have no direct function in the relationship between the banks and their customers. I have no statutory function in relation to the banking decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time and these are taken by the board and management of the relevant institution. This includes decisions in relation to product interest rates as determined by the banks from time to time.  </p>  <p>  In the latest Central Bank of Ireland report on Trends in Business Credit and Deposits: Q3 2015,  interest rates charged on new drawdowns by non-financial, non-property related SMEs was 4.78% during Q3 2015, a 16 basis point decline from the previous quarter.  </p>  <p>  In addition, it should be noted that in the most recent Department of Finance SME credit demand survey, covering the six month period to September 2015, only 1% of SMEs that did not demand credit thought that it was too expensive to borrow. The same survey notes that, among those SMEs with outstanding loans, the average claimed cost of credit across all outstanding loans is 4.7%.  </p>  <p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland ensures access to flexible funding for Irish SMEs by facilitating the provision of:</p>  <p>  - Flexible products with longer maturity and capital repayment flexibility, subject to credit approval;</p>  <p>  - Lower cost funding to financial institutions which is passed on to SMEs;</p>  <p>  - Market access for new entrants to the SME lending market, increasing competition.</p>  <p>  To September 2015, in the first 7 months of the SBCI's operation, &euro;110 million was loaned to c.3,200 SMEs by AIB and Bank of Ireland, with broad coverage across various business sectors and regions.  Each on-lender is contractually obliged to pass on the full financial advantage of the SBCI's funding, thereby reducing the cost of credit to SMEs and creating additional competition in the SME credit market.  In Q4 2015 the SBCI signed an agreement with two non-bank on lending partners, Finance Ireland and Merrion Fleet Management, who provide a range of lower cost financing solutions including vehicle leasing for SMEs. Lower cost funding by the SBCI should act as a catalyst for downward pressure on interest rates by fostering greater competition in the marketplace.

Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) is charged at 41%, with limited exemptions, on interest earned on deposit accounts.  Local Property Tax (LPT) introduced in 2013 is a tax based on the market value of residential properties. Finance Act 2010 introduced a new levy known as the Domicile Levy which can be seen as a form of wealth tax. It is aimed at high wealth individuals with a substantial connection to Ireland, whether they are tax resident or not, to ensure they make a tax contribution to this country in a year of at least &euro;200,000. </p>  <p>  Issues relating to expenditure policy, including investment in health and education, are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p></reply>

The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and lenders to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  </p>  <p>  The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders. Furthermore, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 now requires that the CCMA applies to credit servicing firms and an addendum to the CCMA was published during 2015 to reflect this fact. Regulated entities are required to comply with this Code as a matter of law.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that in order to determine which options for alternative repayment arrangements are viable in each particular case, a lender must explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements that they offer. The CCMA also requires lenders to review an alternative repayment arrangement at appropriate intervals for the type and duration of the arrangement.  The lender must also carry out a review of an alternative repayment arrangement at any time, if requested by the borrower.</p>  <p>You will be aware that on 23 June 2015 the Central Bank published the outcome of a themed inspection of lenders' compliance with its statutory CCMA, which found that, overall, lenders have implemented frameworks as required by the CCMA.   The Central Bank has confirmed that all lenders that were subject to the CCMA themed inspection provided a response by the deadline of the 30th   November 2015, all of which are currently being reviewed. It continues to engage with these lenders as part of it's on-going supervisory engagement to ensure compliance with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA).</p>  <p>  In August 2014, the Central Bank of Ireland wrote to mortgage lenders to set out its expectations of them in their engagement and communications with borrowers who have interest-only for term mortgages on primary residences.  Lenders were reminded that they should proactively communicate with borrowers about their repayment strategies throughout the term of the mortgage, with a view to identifying risks at an early stage.  Where risks are identified, lenders should engage with borrowers in an appropriate and consumer-focussed way and consider options to facilitate the borrower in meeting their mortgage obligations.</p></reply>

I asked the banks to provide options by which borrowers could reduce their monthly repayments and I believe options have been put in place. It is up to the individual banks themselves to advertise their rates and products but as I am sure you are aware, some banks have focussed on fixed rate offerings or rates based on loan-to-value, while others have reduced their variable rates.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, I am pleased to see that new initiatives and reductions continue to take place. As recently as last week one bank introduced a 0.5% reduction on managed variable rates for new or switcher mortgages with a loan to value of 80% or less. Another bank reduced its SVR in December. These initiatives illustrate the increasing competitive dynamics in the market. </p>  <p>  I note that the Central Bank's statistical release of 11th December 2015 stated that mortgage interest rates generally declined during the third quarter of 2015. Variable Principal Dwelling House (PDH) rates declined by 17 basis points over the second quarter with corresponding Buy-to-Let (BTL) rates falling by 14 basis points during the same period. </p>  <p>  There has been discussion in the public domain over the last number of months regarding whether the regulation of interest rates would lead to a reduction in mortgage costs for borrowers. I believe that competition rather than regulation represents the best long term solution to this issue and Central Bank and ESRI research supports this position. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the previous Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, indicated his opposition to the administrative control of interest rates. While he acknowledged that a reduction in bank interest rates would benefit the economy at large, it was his firm belief that the introduction of administrative control on interest rates in Ireland would be bad for the country as a whole in the medium term  including its negative effect on the entry of other banks to the market.</p>  <p>You will also be aware that on 12 November the Central Bank published a consultation paper on proposed increased protections for variable rate mortgage customers. This is called Consultation Paper CP98 and is available on their website. The suggested measures fall under three broad categories:</p>  <p>  - Lenders would be required to publish a summary statement of the factors that impact on their variable rate and the criteria and procedures that apply to setting such rates;</p>  <p>  - On an annual basis lenders would be required to notify variable borrowers of alternative mortgage options.  They would also have to notify borrowers of these options when increasing SVR rates and provide borrowers with a link to the Competition and Consumer Protection (CCPC) website to assist borrowers who wish to switch;</p>  <p>  - The Central Bank is consulting on increasing the notification period for variable rate increases (it is currently 30 days) and they are also consulting on a proposal to require the lender to state the reason for changing the rate.</p>  <p>  The closing date for submissions to the public consultation is 12 February 2016. </p></reply>

They project GDP growth of 6.2 per in 2015 and 4.3 per cent in 2016, with an average growth rate of around 3 per cent for subsequent years. This forecast takes account of the most recent IMF and OECD forecasts at the time of the Budget - which continue to project growth in our main trading partners, although they do identify risks to this scenario.</p>  <p>  The text in the Budget documentation explicitly recognises that outside of Ireland's main export markets the pace of economic expansion has slowed and the outlook has become increasingly uncertain. The text also notes that while the spillover effects to Ireland's main trading partners appear to have been limited to date, a more pronounced impact cannot be ruled out. The Budget documentation also sets out a detailed analysis of risks which are described as being titled to the downside.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will already be aware that these forecasts were endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and also, that in its recent Fiscal Assessment Report, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council welcomed the Department's view of the balance of risks and noted that it represented an important input into discussions around the macroeconomic and fiscal outlook.</p>  <p>  However  despite the disappointing data flow in emerging market economies, Irish export growth was indeed very strong in 2015, with year-on-year growth of over 13 per cent recorded for the first three quarters of the year compared with the same period in 2014. Recent high frequency data releases point to continued strong growth in the fourth quarter in both the manufacturing and services side. </p>  <p>  Overall I am confident that these forecasts are realistic, and take due account of risks which are explicitly recognised.  </p></reply>

These include but are not limited to:</p><p>- Targeting of CAT relief for agricultural property to ensure it is used by active farmers</p><p>- Broadening of CGT retirement relief so that, for example, individuals can now lease out their land for up to 25 years prior to disposal and still be eligible for CGT retirement relief</p><p>- Extension of stamp duty relief for non-residential land transfers between certain close relatives</p><p>- Extension of general stock relief, stock relief for certain young trained farmers and stock relief for registered farm partnerships and</p><p>- Extension of the stamp duty exemption for young trained farmers. </p><p>In addition, a new &quot;succession transfer partnership&quot; proposal was introduced in Finance Act 2015, which is subject to State Aid approval, in order to provide an incentive to assist long-term planning for the transfer of a farm, mitigate some of the financial concerns that may arise when considering how a farm may support two generations for a period, allow a gradual transfer of control and also facilitate knowledge transfer from one generation to another. </p><p>These measures and reliefs will be monitored by officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and by my officials to assess their impact, and ensure that the policy objectives set for them are being met.</p><p>The introduction of any further agri-taxation measures in this regard will be a matter for consideration by the next Government.</p></reply>

These would include:</p>  <p>  - The Employment and Investment Incentive provides tax relief for investors who invest in qualifying SMEs and is closely targeted at job creation. Tax relief is available at an initial rate of 30% on investments of up to &euro;150,000 per annum per investor. Companies may raise up to &euro;5 million per annum, subject to a lifetime limit of &euro;15 million. Shares must be held by investors for a minimum of 4 years. After three years, if employment levels have increased or the monies raised have been expended on R&amp;D, a further 10% of tax relief is available.  </p>  <p>  - SURE or Start-Up Refunds for Entrepreneurs (formerly the Seed Capital Scheme) provides a refund of income tax previously paid to qualifying entrepreneurs who start their own qualifying business. The refund of tax available is based on the amount of the investment made by the entrepreneur and the amount of income tax paid over the previous 6 tax years, subject to certain conditions. This scheme is intended to assist entrepreneurs to invest seed capital in order to commence trading. Once the company has commenced trading, they can then seek further investments under the EII.  </p>  <p>  - The Start Your Own Business initiative provides an exemption from income tax for 2 years for individuals starting a new business where the individuals were previously long-term unemployed. The profits of such a business, up to a maximum of &euro;40,000, are relieved from income tax in each year of the first two years of trading. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware also of a number of corporation tax relief measures which are available to all corporate taxpayers throughout Ireland, such as the R&amp;D tax credit and the 3 year corporation tax relief for start-up companies.  While these are not specifically targeted at development on a regional level they would nonetheless be available to taxpayers in the regions to stimulate investment and development.</p>  <p>  With regard to the overall question, any incentive targeting a specific location is likely to be subject to EU State Aid rules, and needs to be carefully considered in order to achieve the necessary results and obtain the necessary approval of the European Commission. Also, a tax incentive alone will have limited impact on regional development.</p>  <p>  In addition, I would note that there is no provision under the EU VAT directive which allows for different VAT rates to be charged on depending on the region in which the activity takes place.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to know that there are non tax related measures in place to promote investment and development regionally. In particular up to the end of September 2015 the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has lent approximately &euro;110 million to c.3200 SMEs across Ireland. The vast majority of these loans, approximately 85%, were to regionally based SMEs outside of Dublin. The average size of these loans is about &euro;35,000 and more than 90% have been for investment purposes.</p></reply>

Dr Thornhill's review has been published and is available on the Department of Finance website. </p>  <p>  In the course of the review, the Economics Division of the Department of Finance prepared estimates of the potential implications on taxpayer liabilities of price developments as a result of price increases since May 2013.  The paper prepared by the Economics Division is included in Dr Thornhill's report at Chapter 7.  I can confirm that the discussion and analysis undertaken in the course of the review did not, however, take account of projected price movements after that date.  This was because residential price movements show considerable volatility not just from year to year but quarter to quarter. Any forward projections would be highly conjectural and run the possible risk of providing a poor basis for policy making. </p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Amendment Act 2015 was enacted in the last D&aacute;il term. Among other things, it defers revaluation of properties for LPT purposes from 1 November 2016 to 1 November 2019; self-assessed valuations for properties made by homeowners as of 1 May 2013 stand for a further 3 years, until 1 November 2019, and this means that home owners will not be faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values. This arises out of one of the recommendations of the review.  </p>  <p>  Issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Report will be a matter for consideration by the next Government.</p></reply>

Both myself and my officials  met with the three credit union representative bodies to discuss these concerns. Meetings were also held with the Central Bank where the views of the credit union movement were considered. Following careful consideration I have been informed by the Central Bank that a number of modifications were agreed regarding the &euro;100,000 cap on credit union savings as follows: </p>  <p>  - Credit unions that hold individual members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 at commencement of the regulations may apply for approval to the Central Bank to retain these savings, subject to certain criteria. </p>  <p>  - Regulation 37 now provides that certain credit unions may apply for approval to increase individual members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000. Credit unions with a minimum asset size of &euro;100 million may be granted approval to increase individual members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 where they have demonstrated to the Central Bank that it is appropriate for them to do so. </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the application process will be updated to reflect these changes and that credit union bodies have been advised that the Central Bank will communicate with them on the matter in early 2016.</p>  <p>  I welcome the steps that have been taken to provide clarity for credit unions on the criteria for retaining savings of over &euro;100,000 and I also welcome the Central Bank proposed engagement with the representative bodies to seek their comments on the application process. </p></reply>

When one takes into account that property price inflation was over 16 percent in late 2014, this figure represents a significant moderation in price growth. As regards rents, the Private Residential Tenancies Board report that rents nationally increased by 8.6 per cent on an annual basis in the third quarter of 2015.    </p>  <p>  Recent price and rent developments are primarily the result of a shortage in the supply of accommodation particularly in Dublin and to some extent in the other major cities. As the economy continues to recover there has been significant growth in the number of people at work which has led to increased demand for housing. While there is evidence of a pick-up in building activity, it has not yet reached the level necessary to match demand.</p>  <p>  To improve housing supply, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government and I recently announced the Stabilising Rents and Boosting Supply package which was agreed by Government. This package is designed to provide greater stability in the rental market in the short run and support sustainable growth in the housing market. This package builds on the Construction 2020 and Social Housing strategies and is also complemented by the plans of NAMA to fund the construction of 20,000 units by 2020. In turn, these efforts should improve the capacity of ordinary families to access affordable accommodation as supply increases.</p>  <p>  It is not clear what the Deputy has in mind where his question refers to an increasing concentration of property ownership amongst corporate investors. In fact, property ownership is well distributed across the income distribution as is clear in the CSO's Household Finance and Consumption Survey 2013. In terms of the private rental market, this is made up of a large proportion of small landlords. However, there is a clear need to professionalise the private rental sector in order to better serve tenants. To help address this issue, the REIT tax regime was introduced in the Finance Act 2013 to attract large scale investment. </p>  <p>  In summary, I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the housing market, including their implications for macroeconomic performance and stability. </p></reply>

The REIT framework is designed to produce an after-tax result for shareholders similar to that from direct investment in property, while also providing the benefits of risk diversification and professional management associated with collective investment. </p>  <p>  The acquisition and management of properties by professional REITs is part of a more sustainable, long-term property rental market for both investors and property tenants.  While commercial property investment has been a key focus for some of the REITs launched to date in Ireland, residential property also forms part of the sector's interest and exposure. It is expected that the sector will continue to develop over time and in so doing to increase the supply of professionally managed, good quality, secure and affordable rented accommodation.</p>  <p>  Historically the private rented sector in Ireland was characterised by small-scale landlords. The double layer of taxation had tended to result in individual investors holding individual, highly-mortgaged properties. This had exposed investors to significant risk in times of falling equity and falling rental returns.  Attracting large scale investment in professionally managed residential property has an important role to play in helping to deliver the professional high-standard sector that tenants deserve.</p>  <p>  The success of REITs has resulted in benefits on a number of fronts.  They have brought new capital into the Irish property market; new listings to the Irish Stock Exchange; and a new risk-diversified property investment option for investors. </p>  <p>  With its introduction in 2013, the REIT regime is in its relative infancy in Ireland.  However, the REIT framework will be reviewed in the next one to two years in line with good practice.</p></reply>

It provides financial support to community companies that provide revenue generating services of a social inclusion nature.  Many of these companies are also funded from other sources and generate revenue from the public use of their facilities and services.  The CSP provides a contribution to the wage costs of the companies on the basis that the services are not fully self-financing or the cost of provision would be prohibitive on users.  The Department does not set the wage rate but requires the payment of appropriate wage rates, consistent with local norms.</p>  <p>  At December 2015, 398 companies employing some 2,800 employees were directly supported by the CSP.  The Department estimates that, at the end of 2015, some 60% of these employees were being paid above the level of the minimum wage, in keeping with the social inclusion and social benefit objectives of the programme.  The Department is committed to working with the remaining companies to achieve the objective of paying a reasonable wage.   The Deputy should note that the CSP accounts for less than a third of the resources generated by these companies.</p>  <p>  Contracts of up to three years duration are provided for under the CSP.  Arrangements whereby individual companies will be able to access additional financial resources to compensate for the welcome increase in the minimum wage are being put in place.  Submissions will be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the annual funding commitment being adjusted accordingly, where it is found to be warranted.  An advance of 25% of the contract value for 2016 has been, or is in the course of being, paid to companies currently in the programme.  This ensures that immediate cash-flow requirements are supported.  </p>  <p>  Overall, I am satisfied that the level of resources available to the CSP in 2016 at just over &euro;45m will be adequate to meet the on-going funding needs of the programme.</p></reply>

This process began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available at 65, thereby currently standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  The changes introduced in 2011 were on foot of a Government commitment included in the National Recovery Plan published in 2010 and in the subsequent Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF. </p>  <p>  The purpose of these changes is to make the pension system sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  More people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  In this context, the duration for which an average pension will be paid will continue to increase.  The number of pensions is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually as a result of demographic change.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision. </p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  It was estimated at the time that the net saving resulting from its abolition, when taking into account that many people would instead be in receipt of other payments at the lower rates applicable to those under 66, would amount to &euro;33.5m in 2014 and approximately &euro;65 million in 2015. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no general retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers. </p>  <p>  In terms of financial supports, social welfare benefits will continue to be available to the age of 66 for those who are contractually obliged to leave employment.  Jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66.  Where a jobseeker's benefit claim spans two benefit years, a new Governing Contribution Year requirement is not applied to the second benefit year of a claimant aged 65 (effectively this means that they may receive payment in both years based upon eligibility in the first year). </p>  <p>  There are no plans to introduce legislation to change from the current position. </p></reply>

The declared valuation is not affected by any repairs or improvements made to a property or by any general increase or decrease in property prices that might occur over the course of the valuation period. </p>  <p>  While the LPT Act does not provide for revised or reduced valuations on foot of occurrences such as the recent flooding, Revenue has advised that initial analysis indicates that the majority of properties situated on affected 'flood plains' are already valued in the lowest Valuation Band and the question of a reduction in value would therefore not arise.  The annual LPT liability for properties in the lowest valuation band is &euro;90.</p>  <p>  Part 12 of the LPT Act provides for Deferral, and Partial Deferral (50%) schemes that can apply to liable property owners under certain conditions including, 'Income Level', 'Hardship', 'Personal Insolvency' and also to 'Personal Representative of a Deceased Person'.  The deferred tax remains as a charge on the property and must be paid before a sale or transfer can be completed.  Interest is charged on the deferred amount at a rate of 4% per annum and the duration of the relief normally coincides with the valuation period (1 May 2013 to 31 October 2019). </p>  <p>  Revenue recently announced that it is making the Deferral and Partial Deferral relief available to property owners, in respect of the 2016 liability, whose principal private residence was flooded during the recent bad weather.  The relief is available to the people affected providing they are in receipt of assistance through the Department of Social Protection Humanitarian Relief Fund.</p>  <p>  Property owners wishing to avail of the relief should contact the LPT Helpline at 1890 200 255 to make the necessary arrangements.  </p></reply>

The report does not specify the methodology used to calculate this figure, however I would note that the figures differ from estimates by the Revenue Commissioners in response to PQ number 51 of 13 October 2015, indicating that replacement of the income tax structure (including the Universal Social Charge) with a flat rate of 23% on all incomes and removing all tax credits would result in an increase in yield in the order of approximately &euro;672 million in a full year. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the introduction of a flat tax of this nature, with no tax credits or basic allowances, would result in significant tax increases for lower income earners.  The report also notes that a flat tax system would normally incorporate an Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for all income earners, in order to protect those on lower incomes, and suggests that a growth-driven flat tax system would include an EITC.  The report estimates that a break even Exchequer yield for a flat tax system incorporating a graduated EITC would be up to 29%.  In this context, it is worth noting that the average effective tax rate for the highest 10% of income earners under the current tax system is approximately 31% (calculated by the Revenue Commissioners, based on estimates for 2016, using the actual data for the year 2013 (the latest year for which data are available) adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim).</p>  <p>  The report further posits that the increase in net incomes for higher earners could have consequential increases in exchequer revenues of &euro;493.5 million per annum, through economic growth associated with attracting high net worth individuals to remain in, or relocate to, Ireland.</p>  <p>  I have said on many occasions that individuals in Ireland start to pay the higher rate of tax at too low an income level, and that I would seek to address this issue when the public finances would allow me to do so.  The changes I introduced the last two Budgets have begun the process of reducing the burden of income taxes for all taxpayers, not just those on higher incomes.  Furthermore, Budgets 2015 and 2016 have reduced the top tax rate on incomes of up to &euro;70,044 from 52% to 49.5%, so in 2016 this rate has now fallen below 50% for the first time since supplementary Budget in 2009.  This will help to support consumer confidence, particularly for middle income earners who have borne the greater share of the cost of the economic downturn, and help to stimulate economic growth.  I have also stated my belief that the top rate of tax on all income should not exceed 50%, and that I would continue to work towards this objective in future Budgets, subject to being returned to Government in the next election.</p></reply>

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm. The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p>The Central Bank is the competent authority in Ireland for the purposes of the Act. Following the conduct of a public consultation exercise, the Central Bank published for Credit Servicing Firms on 10 December 2015 which firms have to meet both in order to obtain an authorisation and on an ongoing basis. </p><p>As the Deputy will know, the Act also provides for transitional arrangements for existing Credit Servicing Firms who were conducting credit servicing prior to the enactment of the 2015 Act. Section 34F of the Act provides that a person carrying on the business of a Credit Servicing Firm immediately before the commencement of the 2015 Act is taken to be authorised to carry on the business of a Credit Servicing Firm until the Central Bank has granted or refused authorisation to the person, provided that the person applies to the Central Bank under section 30 of the Act for authorisation, in a form specified by the Central Bank, no later than 3 months after that commencement. Persons seeking to avail of these transitional arrangements were therefore required to have completed and submitted an application for authorisation to the Central Bank by 8 October 2015 in order to continue to provide such services.</p><p>The list of Credit Servicing Firms that have notified the Central Bank that they wish to avail of the Transitional Provisions under Section 34F of the Central Bank Act, 1997 is available at .  Currently there are sixteen firms on this register. </p></reply>

This comes on the back of an increase of 6.8 per cent in the second quarter and 7.3 per cent in the first quarter. As a result, GDP per capita is now above its pre-crisis peak. In Budget 2016, published in October 2015, my Department forecast that the economy would grow by 6.2 per cent in 2015 and 4.3 per cent in 2016.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the recovery is now being felt in the domestic economy with consumption up almost 3.5 per cent in the first three quarters of 2015 and investment up over 25 per cent. In fact, based on latest available information in 2015 domestic demand made its strongest positive contribution to economic growth since the crisis began. This is very important as the domestic sectors are both jobs-rich and tax-rich. The external sector is also showing continuing signs of growth with exports increasing by over 13 per cent in the first nine months of 2015.</p>  <p>  The economic recovery is also clearly evident in the labour market where we have now had thirteen successive quarters of solid annual employment growth. As a result, the unemployment rate has fallen by over 6 percentage points since its peak in early 2012.</p>  <p>  Over the medium term, my Department expects that the economy can grow by around 3 per cent per annum on a sustainable basis. However, achieving a sustained economic recovery cannot be taken for granted and is contingent upon a number of factors including sustainable public finances, maintaining our competitiveness position and ensuring inflationary pressures remain in check over the medium term. </p>  <p>  Substantial progress has been made in terms of improving Ireland's competitiveness in recent years. The European Commission in its autumn forecasts estimated that relative unit labour costs in Ireland declined by 0.8 per cent annually in 2015. This is one of the largest declines across all EU Member States. Competitiveness gains have been achieved through productivity improvements.

These changes have included reductions of the interest rates and, in the case of the EU facilities, extensions of maturities. While not part of the EU-IMF Programme we have also negotiated the replacement of the Promissory Notes issued to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) with a series of longer term, non-amortising floating rate Government bonds. In addition, we made an early repayment of the vast bulk of Ireland's IMF programme loans which resulted in considerable savings.</p>  <p>  The savings arising from these measures are set out as follows:</p>  <p>  When the programme was initially agreed in late 2010, the average interest rate on the &euro;67.5 billion available to draw down from the external sources was estimated by the EU Commission to be 5.82% on the basis of market rates at that time. The average life of the borrowing was initially set at 7.5 years. </p>  <p>  In July 2011, the Euro Area Heads of State or Government (HOSG) agreed to reduce the cost of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) loans, and similar reductions were subsequently agreed for the interest rates on the loans provided by the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and also by the three bilateral lenders (UK, Sweden and Denmark).  It is estimated that the interest rate reductions on the EU funding mechanisms and the bilateral loans are worth of the order of &euro;9 billion over the initially envisaged 7&frac12; year term of these loans.  The average maturity of the EFSM and the EFSF loans was extended to a planned 12.5 and 15 years respectively.  </p>  <p>  In April 2013, EU Finance Ministers agreed in principle to further extend the maximum weighted average maturities on our EFSF and EFSM loans by up to 7 years, over and above the extension agreed in 2011. This further maturity extension removes a refinancing requirement of some &euro;20 billion for the Irish State in the years 2015 to 2022.   This extension of maturities has a number of significant benefits for Ireland, including smoothing our redemption profile, improving long term debt sustainability and it also has a positive impact on the cost of Exchequer borrowing through creating further downward pressure on our borrowing costs.  As of end-December 2015 the euro equivalent cost of our EU IMF programme loans is estimated by the NTMA to have been 2.2%.</p>  <p>  While not part of the EU-IMF Programme, it is also worth mentioning that in February 2013, the Irish Government replaced the Promissory Notes issued to IBRC with a series of longer term, non-amortising floating rate Government bonds. This has resulted in significant benefits to the State, including increasing the weighted average life from c.7-8 years for the Promissory Notes to c.34-35 years for the floating rate notes.</p>  <p>  The early repayment of some 81 per cent of IMF loans, which was completed in Quarter 1 of last year, will generate further interest savings, estimated at over &euro;1.5 billion, over the original lifetime of these loans. The current interest rate on the residual IMF loan balance is just 1.05 per cent. </p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), will always seek to avail of any opportunity for savings on the cost of our EU-IMF programme loans.</p></reply>

This undertook to reduce the marginal tax rate on low and middle-income earners, in a manner that maintains the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system. The first stage of the plan was given effect in Budget 2015, when a suite of Income Tax and Universal Social Charge (USC) measures were introduced.   </p>  <p>  The measures announced in Budget 2015 were the first steps to reducing the burden placed on Irish taxpayers, particularly for middle-income earners who have borne the greater share of the cost of the economic downturn, and this process continued in Budget 2016.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2015, I reduced the top rate of income tax from 41% to 40% and extended the standard rate band on which income tax is chargeable at the lower 20% rate by &euro;1,000. I also made a number of changes to USC, including reductions in the two lower rates of USC.</p>  <p>  Budget 2016 continued this process of reducing the tax burden on low and middle income earners including, among other changes, a decrease in the three lowest rates of USC which took effect from January 2016. In total, Budgets 2015 and 2016 have reduced the three lowest rates of USC from 2%, 4% and 7% to 1%, 3% and 5.5% respectively. The changes to the income tax system included in these Budgets mean that individuals who paid Income Tax and / or USC in 2014 saw a reduction in their tax bill in 2015 and should see further reductions in 2016, where incomes remain unchanged year-on-year. </p>  <p>   Ireland already has one of the most progressive income tax systems in the developed world. To preserve that progressivity, the 8% rate of USC introduced in Budget 2015 has acted to limit the benefits from the Budget 2015 and 2016 tax packages to income of up to &euro;70,044 for any individual taxpayer, which means that those with very high incomes will only benefit to the same extent as those with more modest incomes.</p>  <p>  Looking to the medium term, in order to enhance transparency, the Budget sets out the indicative amount of fiscal space which future governments can decide can be used for additional expenditure increases or to fund tax measures.</p></reply>

Reflecting this lack of liquidity, investors would likely require higher yields than standard Government bonds. </p>  <p>  However in the case of a Public Private Partnership (PPP), where the State selects a private consortium to Design, Build, Finance &amp;amp; Operate State infrastructure, that private consortium can issue project-specific bonds. Such bond issuance may be deemed to be outside of General Government provided that the necessary risks are contractually transferred to the private sector in line with Eurostat rules. These latter type of bonds are considered by investors to carry significantly more risk than standard Government issued bonds and consequently require higher yields to reflect the risk profile. The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) has advised that there is currently a strong supply of funders for PPP projects.  </p>  <p>  I can confirm that the Government remains committed to exploring alternative means of financing capital projects. The NDFA is charged with advising on the optimal means of financing the costs of all public investment projects over &euro;20 million in order to achieve value for money, including the &euro;2.25 billion stimulus package announced by the Government in July 2012. NDFA continues to facilitate securing funding for both PPPs and non-PPP capital projects from a wide range of sources including domestic and international banks, institutional investors and supranational organisations such as the European Investment Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank.</p></reply>

To facilitate this, Government policy since 2011 has been focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources. Officials from my Department regularly meet representatives from the Small Firms Association, Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association and Chambers Ireland to discuss issues around access to finance. AIB and Bank of Ireland are concentrating on growing their balance sheets. In this context, both banks recognise the need to increase business lending and have put on record their commitment to the SME sector. The recent Department of Finance SME credit demand survey covering the period April-September 2015 shows that 85% of SME credit applications were approved, excluding pending applications. Further results from the survey can be found at .</p><p>My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small and medium sized businesses. The SME State Bodies Group provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance. </p><p>Some of the main policies introduced by this Government to encourage access to credit for small and medium businesses include:]</p><p>- The Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014. On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at .</p><p>- The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been established as a means of ensuring that SMEs are provided with sufficient finance for growth. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is an initiative designed to increase the availability of funding to SMEs at a lower cost and on more flexible terms then have recently been available on the Irish Market in recent times. The SBCI does not lend directly to SMEs. It uses a network of lending partners known as 'on lenders' to make its funds available to SMEs. More information on the SBCI can be found on .</p><p>- The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs. My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has recently brought legislation to the Oireachtas which will enable the development of a more flexible Credit Guarantee Scheme with longer duration and more products and providers included.</p><p>- The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides support in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions.  Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund ().</p><p>- The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition. They also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment. This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Reviewer John Trethowan and his team have overturned 55% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.  Further details are available at .</p><p>My Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate participants in the SME sector to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation. </p></reply>

Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 requires that credit institutions, prescribed credit institutions and bureaux de change must make a submission to the Central Bank if they wish to introduce any new customer charges or increase any existing customer charges in respect of certain services. Section 149 does not cover interest rates rather it applies to fees and commissions only. The Central Bank may direct the institution not to impose the new or increased charge or it may approve the charge, or approve it at a lower level than requested by the institution. Once approved, the bank is entitled to impose the charge.  </p><p>Relevant charges are assessed by the Central Bank in accordance with the assessment criteria laid down in the legislation as follows:</p><p>- the promotion of fair competition between credit institutions;</p><p>- the commercial justification submitted in respect of the proposal; </p><p>- the impact new charges or increases in existing charges will have on customers; and</p><p>- passing on costs to customers.</p><p>Credit institutions are legally bound to comply with Letters of Direction, which set out the maximum amount the credit institution is allowed to charge for the relevant service. Credit institutions are free to impose any pricing differentials for the service up to the permitted maximum and are free to waive fees at their discretion.</p><p>My Department published a report on the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges in December 2013. This contains a detailed description of the process by which the Central Bank makes decisions on whether or not to approve proposed charges. It is available on my Department's website at . Among the key findings of the review was that while fee and commission income has become a more important source of income to the banks in recent years, net fee and commission income in Irish banks was well below the average of their European peers. </p><p>The European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009 (the Payment Services Regulations) include requirements for banks and other payment institutions to provide information to the consumer about charges, interest and exchange rates on the accounts and these are reflected in the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012, which contains requirements in relation to the provision of information on charges to consumers.  The revised Payment Services Directive (known as PSD2) was published in the Official Journal on 23 December 2015. Member States will be required to transpose the Directive by January 2018. Among its other objectives, PSD2 is expected to promote competition, meaning increased choice and better conditions for consumers and businesses.</p><p>Irish financial institutions have varying models for charges and have different regimes and conditions under which they are willing to grant transaction free banking. Individuals' use of their bank account will be specific to each individual and I would strongly encourage people to shop around for the best deal for them. In this regard, the CCPC website, is a valuable resource.</p></reply>

However, for all loans I would encourage prospective borrowers to shop around for the best deal available. In this regard the Competition and Consumer Protection (CCPC) website, has very useful information for borrowers.</p><p>With regard to mortgage interest rates, I would like to confirm to the Deputy that the lending institutions in Ireland - including those in which the State has a shareholding - are independent commercial entities. I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or in relation to the mortgage interest rates charged.</p><p>The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding. </p><p>Last May, I requested a report from the Central Bank on the topic which was subsequently published. The Report on the Influences of Standard Variable Rate Mortgage Pricing is available here: . It stated that the spread between official ECB interest rates and the standard variable mortgage rate is relatively high in Ireland, both by historical standards and compared to European peers. However, three factors are important determinants of this margin, namely increased credit risk resulting from high levels of non-performing loans and lengthy and uncertain processes of collateral recovery, weak competition, and the constraints on bank profitability arising from legacy issues of the financial crisis, such as an increased regulatory requirement for capital.</p><p>Nonetheless, I have taken steps to ensure that the banks provide options for mortgage holders to reduce their monthly repayments. I met with the six main mortgage lenders in May and outlined my view that the standard variable rate being charged to Irish customers was too high. The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers.  </p><p>In September I concluded a series of follow up meetings with these banks and the reality is that the majority have put options in place to allow many borrowers reduce their repayments. These options range from lower variable rates to new suites of variable rates based on loan-to-value and reductions in fixed rates. I therefore encourage borrowers to contact their bank to see what is available to them in their circumstances or consider moving to another bank, where possible, if the offer is not satisfactory. In this regard, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) website www.consumerhelp.ie which I referred to earlier is a valuable source of information on the rates charged by various financial institutions. In addition, the CCPC are currently running a mortgage switching campaign and have a mortgage switching tool on their website which should allow borrowers compare rates charged across institutions.  I also note that some lenders offer repayment of legal fees or cash incentives to borrowers switching mortgage provider.</p><p>I asked the banks to provide options by which borrowers could reduce their monthly repayments and I believe options have been put in place. Furthermore, I am pleased to see that new initiatives and reductions continue to take place. As recently as last week one bank introduced a 0.5% reduction on managed variable rates for new or switcher mortgages with a loan to value of 80% or less. Another bank reduced its SVR in December. These initiatives illustrate the increasing competitive dynamics in the market. </p><p>I note that the Central Bank's statistical release of 11th December 2015 stated that mortgage interest rates generally declined during the third quarter of 2015. Variable Principal Dwelling House (PDH) rates declined by 17 basis points over the second quarter with corresponding Buy-to-Let (BTL) rates falling by 14 basis points during the same period. </p><p>The most recent statistics are available : .</p></reply>

They may carry out flood alleviation works from their own resources or apply to the Office of Public Works (OPW) for funding under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  This purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  The scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame. Any application received will be considered in accordance with the scheme eligibility criteria, which comprise economic, social and environmental criteria including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management.  </p>  <p>  The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding, is the OPW's Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme. The Programme is focussing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding.  It is the principal vehicle for implementing the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy.  </p>  <p>  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans. </p>  <p>  Good progress is being made on the CFRAM Programme, the draft mapping is now being finalised following completion of the national statutory public consultation on 23rd December, 2015. Work on the development of preliminary options to address flood risk is underway.  Following finalisation of the mapping and the identification of flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified. The Plans, which are scheduled for completion by the end of 2016, will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.  Further information on the Programme is available on www.cfram.ie.</p>  <p>  The Government recently announced increased levels of investment in the area of flood relief as part of the overall Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 and this investment programme will allow for the implementation of the Flood Risk Management Plans.</p></reply>

A Steering Group which comprises representatives of KCC, OPW and the consultants, was set up to advance the project.</p>  <p>  KCC and their consultants submitted a Draft Options Report/Feasibility Study to OPW outlining possible flood relief measures for the Lower Morrell River Catchment in 2014. Following consideration of the draft report by the OPW, it was agreed by the Steering Group that the consultants would carry out a more detailed review of the proposed scheme with further analysis of the various options considered to assess the benefits of the current works proposals as they have evolved.  The review would also investigate if there are additional or alternative and more cost effective measures that can be put in place to alleviate flooding in the area. Any changes identified by the review process would need to be incorporated into the Cost Benefit Analysis and Environmental Impact Statement before the scheme can be advanced.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the consultants have completed the review process and KCC has submitted their findings to the OPW for consideration. It is envisaged that OPW and KCC will meet later this month with a view to finalising the Feasibility Report. Once the Feasibility Report has been finalised, and provided the scheme is still economically and environmentally viable, KCC and the OPW will decide on how best to advance the proposed works.  I can confirm that the Lower Morrell scheme remains a priority and the OPW has included provision for the cost of the proposed works in its financial profiles in the period up to 2018.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the most recent flood events of late December 2015 and early January 2016, I am advised that KCC is preparing a report on the impacts of these events on the Morrell River Catchment with particular emphasis on the effects of the flooding for property owners in the Killeenmore and Turnings area.</p></reply>

The OPW continues to have a statutory responsibility for the maintenance of this scheme.</p>  <p>  Each year the OPW carries out work to approximately 2,000 km of channels and some 200 structures around the country as part of its ongoing and rolling arterial drainage maintenance programme.  While the average cycle of maintenance is generally in the range of 4 to 7 years, the OPW does routinely inspect all channels and structures for which it has maintenance responsibility.  The timing of work on individual projects is determined having regard to the needs of regular maintenance and the prioritisation of urgent jobs.</p>  <p>  In the case of the River Maine Catchment Drainage Scheme, maintenance resources are currently concentrated on works to damaged defences in tidal reaches and it is not possible at this stage to provide a specific timeframe when work will proceed at the location mentioned by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The charges associated with the use of 1890 numbers and the potential savings with 076 numbers which would benefit both customers and public bodies were outlined.</p>  <p>  Delivery of an effective and quality customer service is a priority for my Department and there are guidelines on my Department's website that provide details of the cheapest way of contacting my Department from anywhere in the country.  </p></reply>

It is open to the Councils to undertake any local flood mitigation works using their own resources or to submit an application for funding if necessary under the Office of Public Works (OPW) Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme. Any application received will be assessed under the scheme's eligibility criteria which includes a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding. The OPW only funds works related to fluvial or river flooding. Any necessary works to address flooding caused by pluvial or inadequate surface water drainage systems are the responsibility of the local authority. The local authority is responsible also for the ongoing maintenance of certain watercourses within Drainage Districts in the county.</p>  <p>  The OPW carries out its own programme of Arterial Drainage Maintenance to a total of 11,500km of river channel and approximately 730km of embankments nationally. These maintenance works relate to arterial drainage schemes completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995, whose purpose was primarily to improve the drainage of agricultural lands.  The OPW has a statutory duty to maintain the completed schemes in proper repair and in an effective condition. The annual maintenance programme typically involves some clearance of vegetation and removal of silt build-up on an average five-yearly cycle. </p>  <p>  The planned OPW maintenance programme in Co. Cavan in 2016 includes work on some 18km on the Inny scheme, approximately 7km on the Boyne scheme and 3km Glyde and Dee scheme.</p>  <p>  The planned OPW maintenance programme in Co. Monaghan in 2016  includes work on approximately 65km of the Monaghan Blackwater Arterial Drainage Scheme and some 35km of the Glyde and Dee scheme.</p></reply>

Funding for this scheme has regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management. Further details on this scheme including eligibility criteria are available on the OPW website, www.opw.ie</p>  <p>  The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding, is the OPW's Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme. 300 locations nationwide are being assessed under the Programme the purpose of which is to implement the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy.  </p>  <p>  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the River Erne system, Cavan Town is an Area for Further Assessment (AFA) being assessed as part of the North Western/Neagh Bann CFRAM Study. No other areas of the River Erne system were designated at being potentially significant risk. Those parts of Erne system which affect Cavan Town have been modelled and mapped and are being assessed for preliminary options to address assessed flood risk. Drainage works are part of the suite of measures that are being assessed. A Public Consultation Day was held in Cavan Town on the draft flood mapping on 19th February, 2015 and a further event will be held locally in the coming months on the preliminary options.  Discussions are ongoing with the Rivers Agency of Northern Ireland in relation to any flood risk issues within the Erne system in Co Fermanagh and catchment wide preliminary options will be available at the upcoming public consultation for discussion. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Dromore River system, Ballybay is an Area for Further Assessment (AFA) being assessed as part of the same CFRAM Study. Those parts of the Dromore system which affect Ballybay have been modelled and mapped and are being assessed for preliminary options to address flood risk. Drainage works are part of the suite of measures that are being assessed. A Public Consultation Day was held in Ballybay on the draft flood mapping on 18th February, 2015 and a further event will be held locally in the coming months on the preliminary options.</p>  <p>  Under the CFRAM Programme, the draft mapping is now being finalised following completion of the national statutory public consultation on 23rd December, 2015. Following finalisation of the mapping and the identification of preliminary flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific feasible measures to address significant flood risks identified. The Plans, which are scheduled for publication in mid 2016 for public consultation towards final plans being completed by the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  Further information is available on the study website: www.northwestcframstudy.ie</p></reply>

This involves a 3 phase exercise. Phases 1 and 2 involving the identification of key themes and building on those through a broad consultation process to produce high-level objectives for the years 2016 - 2019 have been competed. Phase 3 will focus on agreeing specific actions and time frames in relation to each objective. In summary, my aim is to ensure a rigorous focus on identifying the key themes that impact on the lives of people with disabilities, on identifying agreed objectives within each theme and on developing specific actions to be undertaken to achieve each of the agreed objectives, together with time frames and key performance indicators so that the new Strategy will make a real difference to the lives of people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  I welcome the positive engagement of all stakeholders in the process so far including their participation in the first round of public meetings and in the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group and look forward to continuing to work with all interested parties in completing and delivering the Strategy.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in autumn 2014, I launched the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with Disabilities.  The aim of this strategy was to ensure that the barriers faced by those living with a disability in finding employment could be addressed.  I appointed Fergus Finlay as the independent chairperson of the strategy's implementation committee to ensure that the government is provided with regular updates on the strategy's progression.</p></reply>

The Bill is now outdated and needs to be comprehensively reviewed, particularly in the light of the changed public finances since it was presented.</p>  <p>  In order to progress this important legislation, last year I instigated a comprehensive review of the 2007 Bill:</p>  <p>- to identify how best to deliver an integrated, reformed structure that will support coroners more effectively, within the Government&rsquo;s current financial possibilities;</p>  <p>- to bring the 2007 Bill up to date for legal and forensic developments, and in particular to ensure full compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights; and</p>  <p>- to put in place improved support to ensure that bereaved families receive a prompt, responsive, and effective service &ndash; recognising that coroners already strive to do so within the constraints of the existing administrative framework.</p>  <p>  Minister of State Simon Harris T.D. has already presented my views on these issues to the Dail on 11th December in the debate on the Private Member's Bill, which the Government decided not to oppose.  I am very sympathetic to the concerns motivating the proposal for introduction of mandatory inquests into maternal deaths. I believe that bereaved families in this situation are entitled to a prompt, transparent and sensitive response to their questions and concerns.</p>  <p>  The Coroners Bill 2007 already proposed a legal requirement to report any maternal death to a coroner.  As was indicated on 11th December, I would intend to keep that proposal, but consider that there are strong arguments for looking at whether an inquest should be legally required in cases of maternal deaths as defined by this Bill.</p>  <p>  As I indicated to the Dail on 11 December, it is important and appropriate that this question be fully examined within my Department&rsquo;s review of the Coroners' Bill.  I can confirm to the Deputy that this examination is under way in the context of the passage of Second Stage of the 2015 Bill by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, and that the review is making good progress.</p></reply>

A panel consisting of two senior and five junior counsel was established for that purpose.</p>  <p>  The Panel has provided recommendations to me in all 320 cases submitted to them and has therefore largely concluded its work.  The issuing of notification letters to complainants commenced on 29 June. To date, 307 complainants have been notified of the outcome of the review of their cases. Letters will continue to issue to all complainants, until the process is completed which I expect will be very shortly as we are nearing the end of the process.  The outcome of the review in this complainant's case issued last month.</p>  <p>  I have repeatedly emphasised that the Independent Review Mechanism was not established to act as a Commission of Inquiry or Investigation.  Nor was it designed to make findings. Its purpose was to triage the allegations to see whether further action was needed and what that action would be.</p>  <p>  I wish to stress the independence of this process.  The cases have all been considered by independent barristers, members of the Panel constituted to conduct this review.  Following their reviews of the papers in each complaint, counsel made recommendations to me, as to whether or not further action should be carried out by me, and if so the nature of that action.  I also appointed a retired judge, Mr Justice Roderick Murphy, to advise on the preparation of letters notifying individuals as to the outcome of the review in their particular cases.  I was concerned that these letters should not only set out the recommendation of counsel, but also outline as far as possible the reasons for the recommendation, subject to any legal constraints there may be.  I made this appointment in order to provide complete reassurance on the probity and independence of this entire process, from start to finish.</p>  <p>  I have previously assured Deputies that where further investigation has been recommended by the review then that will occur.  However, I have also pointed out that in a large proportion of cases, counsel would be likely to recommend that no further action could reasonably be taken.  This has proven to be the case.  The crucial point, however, is that every case has been reviewed by independent counsel, who have made an objective recommendation.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that I have received correspondence from the person concerned, and from her legal representatives, requesting a meeting and that a response will issue shortly.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-01-14a.497.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016011400068#WRQ00900"><p>The position in relation to the recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission Report on Mandatory Sentences is summarised in a tabular form below.  However, I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to the Report of the Penal Policy Review Group which was tasked with carrying out a strategic review of penal policy.  That report, which I published in September 2014, made a number of recommendations about sentencing. Adopting an approach similar to the LRC in its Report, the Review Group recommended that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences be introduced and existing provisions should be reviewed.  At the time of publication of the report I pointed out that it was my preference to maintain the minimum mandatory life sentence for murder as was also recommended by the LRC. The recommendations of the Review Group, and the LRC, about sentencing are still under consideration within my Department.</p><p>More generally, and as the Deputy will appreciate, judges are independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  The approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient. </p><p>The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  This system is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families, and I very much support the initiative led by the Judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information on sentencing via the website.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that in 2014, the Court of Criminal Appeal issued a number of judgments which addressed the question of sentencing and which acknowledged the many factors that can be considered in individual cases which undermine the usefulness of direct comparisons between one case and another.  Nonetheless, every effort to promote consistency should be made and in this respect it is appropriate for the courts to provide guidance on sentencing matters.</p><p><b><font color="#2F2F2F">REPORT ON MANDATORY SENTENCES (LRC 108-2013)- </font></b><b>CHAPTER 6 SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS</b><table><tr><th>6.01 </th><th>The recommendations made by the Commission in this Report are as follows: </th><th></th></tr><tr><td>6.02 </td><td>The Commission supports the recommendations made in 2000, and reiterated in 2011, that a Judicial Council be empowered to develop and publish suitable guidance or guidelines on sentencing, which would reflect the general aims of criminal sanctions and the principles of sentencing discussed in this Report. The Commission also recommends that such guidance or guidelines should have regard to: (i) the sentencing guidance and guidelines available from decisions of the Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal (including those discussed in this Report); (ii) the aggravating and mitigating factors, and individual offender characteristics, identified in the Commission&rsquo;s 1996 Report on Sentencing and developed by the courts since 1996; and (iii) information in relevant databases including, in particular, the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS). [paragraph 1.128] </td><td>A Judicial Council Bill is in the course of preparation which will, inter alia, provide for the establishment of a Judicial Studies Committee.  In its present form, the Bill envisages that this Committee would have the function of disseminating information on the sentencing of persons convicted of criminal offences</td></tr><tr><td>6.03 </td><td>The Commission, by a majority, recommends that the mandatory life sentence for murder be retained. [paragraph 3.76] </td><td>No specific action is necessary to give effect to this recommendation</td></tr><tr><td>6.04 </td><td>The Commission recommends that where an offender is convicted of murder, and is therefore sentenced to life imprisonment, legislation should provide that the judge may recommend a minimum term to be served by the offender. [paragraph 3.84] </td><td>This recommendation is currently under consideration in my Department</td></tr><tr><td>6.05 </td><td>The Commission recommends that the Parole Board be established on an independent statutory basis, and welcomes the Government&rsquo;s proposal to introduce legislation bringing about this effect. [paragraph 3.86] </td><td>Consideration of measures required to place the Parole Board on a statutory footing is underway</td></tr><tr><td>6.06 </td><td>The Commission recommends that the following be repealed: (i) the presumptive minimum sentencing regime applicable to drugs offences under section 27(3C) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, and (ii) the presumptive minimum sentencing regime applicable to firearms offences under section 15 of the Firearms Act 1925; section 26, section 27, section 27A and section 27B of the Firearms Act 1964; and section 12A of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990. The Commission also recommends that the use of presumptive minimum sentencing regimes should not be extended to other offences. [paragraph 4.238]</td><td>The recommendations about sentencing are still under consideration within my Department</td></tr><tr><td>6.07 </td><td>The Commission also recommends that a more structured, guidance-based sentencing system (as envisaged in the recommendations made in Chapter 1) would provide an appropriate alternative to these provisions. In the context of drug-related crime, the Commission also considers that law enforcement efforts may be beneficially supplemented by other initiatives, such as those highlighted in the research conducted by the Health Research Board and the Misuse of Drugs work sector of the British-Irish Council. [paragraph 4.239] </td><td>See main body of reply given above</td></tr><tr><td>6.08 </td><td>The Commission recommends that the following be repealed: (i) the presumptive sentencing regime applicable to serious repeat offences under section 25 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007; (ii) the mandatory minimum sentencing regime applicable to repeat drug offences under section 27(3F) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977; and (iii) the mandatory minimum sentencing regime applicable to repeat firearms offences under section 15(8) of the Firearms Act 1925; section 26(8), section 27(8), section 27A(8), and section 27B(8) of the Firearms Act 1964; and section 12A(13) of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990. The Commission also recommends that the use of presumptive and mandatory minimum sentencing regimes should not be extended to other forms of repeat offending. [paragraph 5.133] </td><td>The recommendations about sentencing are still under consideration within my Department</td></tr><tr><td>6.09 </td><td>The Commission also recommends that a more structured, guidance-based sentencing system (as envisaged in the recommendations made in Chapter 1) would provide an appropriate alternative to these provisions.

The House will appreciate that at any given time there will inevitably be a significant number of warrants outstanding as indicated by the fact that the House was informed in May 2010 that at the time 37,394 bench warrants were recorded as unexecuted.  The attached table shows the number of bench warrants outstanding in each Garda Division on 25 November, 2015.  I am further informed that is not possible to identify the number of unexecuted warrants as they relate to the years 2011 to 2014.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, difficulties in relation to the execution of warrants are a long standing issue for many police forces around the world,  notably relating to persons actively seeking to evade detection and the limited identification information which might be available to support enforcement.  These difficulties are compounded where the warrant has been outstanding for some years, as is often the case.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na gives priority to the execution of warrants relating to serious crimes.  A welcome analysis of this issue was provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate in their report on Crime Investigation of November 2014.  The Inspectorate Report acknowledges the difficulties often faced by Garda&iacute; in pursuing the execution of warrants but it also points to deficiencies in the current systems, some of which are tied to the available technology for recording and monitoring information on warrants.  In this regard the Government is providing a very important investment in new Garda technology under the Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021, amounting to &euro;205m over the life of the Plan, with a view to modernising Garda information systems to support policing services.</p><p>In addition, as part of the overall strategic transformation programme underway in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a Warrants Review Group has been working on means of better managing and enforcing warrants taking on board the Inspectorate&rsquo;s analysis.  A number of improvements have been put in place, including greater use of clerical support staff which helps to free up Garda&iacute; to concentrate on the execution as opposed to the administration of warrants.  I am further advised that warrants enforcement is a recurring agenda item at Garda Senior Management Meetings, as well as regional performance and accountability meetings, to ensure that the situation is continually monitored. </p><p><b>Bench warrants awaiting execution in each Garda Division on 25 November 2015</b><table><tr><th>Region</th><th>Division</th><th>Bench Warrants</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin Region</td><td>D.M.R.

Immigration Officers will, when presented with an employment permit, seek to verify the validity of such a permit.  In some cases such permits whilst validly issued in the first instance can subsequently cease to be extant.  In the current case, by virtue of the non-national's extended absence from the State for over two years the employment permit previously issued ceased to be valid and having established that the person intended to enter employment in the State they were refused permission to enter.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that should a non-national wish to come to Ireland to engage in employment where an employment permit is necessary, an application for such a permit should be made to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the permit obtained before the person seeks to enter the State.

Once the identification process is complete, a profiling exercise to determine the support needs of these young people will be completed.

The high standards of training of these Irish skilled people are recognised by Canadian employers who have actively recruited in Ireland in recent years. As is true for all skilled people who did not receive their trade qualifications in Canada, it is currently the case that Irish electricians must sit the Red Seal examination as a means of converting their Irish qualifications.</p>  <p>  The Canadian authorities are currently undertaking a &lsquo;Foreign Qualifications Recognition&rsquo; initiative to establish a framework for more effectively evaluating trade qualifications which were earned outside of Canada. I welcome this initiative and hope that it will lead to a more streamlined process for the recognition of Irish qualifications across a range of trades.</p></reply>

Embassy officials undertake regular consular visits to the citizen in prison, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade interacts frequently with his family and his Egyptian legal team to provide support and assistance. Such a high level of visitation means that Embassy officials are well-placed to intervene on his behalf when issues arise, and several positive interventions have already been made on his behalf with the Egyptian authorities. The most recent consular visit took place on 28 December and the most recent direct contact with the citizen&rsquo;s family was when Embassy officials spoke with a member of the family following last Saturday&rsquo;s hearing. Embassy officials have attended all court hearings so far &ndash; a clear demonstration of the importance we attach to this case.</p></reply>

These secondments are subject to annual review.  The arrangements provide flexibility and ensure that the in-service needs of teachers and other support priorities of the school system can be met within the resources available.</p><p>  Having teachers with relevant and recent teaching experience and expertise is a key requirement for the role. It is a condition therefore that the maximum length of time that a teacher may be on secondment is five years, following which they return to their teaching roles in their schools.  In this way, their expertise and knowledge is not lost to the system.  Each Education Centre has a management committee and staff which ensures continuity at a local level. The teacher secondment arrangements have been disseminated extensively so the necessary planning can take place at all levels including education centres, support services, school boards of management and individual teacher. Accordingly, there are no plans to change this policy on teacher secondments. </p><p>  My Department has recognised that it may be necessary from time to time to allow some flexibility to the five year policy whereby a small number of Directors would remain on secondment for a limited additional period.  This provides continuity in management, planning and leadership and retention of expertise.  Following consultations between officials in my Department and the Directors some alleviation was agreed to allow a number of Directors to serve beyond the five years for a limited period.  </p><p>  As a result of this alleviation the secondment tenure of a number of Directors will be ceasing over a phased basis for the next 3 years up to the end of the school year 2017/18.All the Directors concerned and their relevant Management Committees have been informed of the revised arrangements. </p><p>  My Department will provide support to any Management Committee in the recruitment process for a Director where required and appropriate continuous professional development support can be provided to facilitate Directors return to school should that be requested.</p></reply>

This is a stated aim of the programme for government.  In this regard, progress continues to be made on a number of fronts.  Firstly, the new school establishment procedures put in place since 2011 now provide parental input into the type of new school to be provided.  Secondly, a patronage divesting process is ongoing in areas of stable population growth that do not have diversity of primary school provision but don't require a new school due to stable demographics.  The aim of this process is to ensure diversity of provision through reconfiguration of existing school provision.  To date, since 2013 eight schools have opened under the divesting process.  Work is ongoing to ensure delivery of choice in other areas.  Thirdly, a public consultation on inclusivity at primary level was conducted in 2013 and a report on the outcome of this was published on my Department's website.</p></reply>

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date is liable to pay the Household Charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. The Charge has operated on a self-assessment basis with an owner of a residential property determining liability and paying the Charge or claiming a waiver.</p><p>The Household Charge was operational in respect of 2012 only, with arrears and penalties in respect of a 2012 liability being collected by local authorities, assisted by the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) on a shared services/agency basis, up to and including 30 June 2013. As of 1 July 2013, outstanding Household Charge liabilities were increased to &euro;200 and converted to a Local Property Tax (LPT) liability due on the property; the Revenue Commissioners, who have responsibility for the collection of Local Property Tax, are now pursuing outstanding liabilities.</p><p>Section 4(4)(b) and section 4(6) of the Act provide that a waiver from the Household Charge applies to properties in certain unfinished housing estates specified in a list prescribed by the Minister. As part of the process of preparing the National Housing Survey 2011, published by my Department in October 2011, local authorities provided details of all unfinished housing developments in their areas. Unfinished housing developments were divided into one of four categories, as follows:</p><p><b>-  </b>Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;</p><p><b>-  </b>Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;</p><p><b>-  </b>Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and</p><p><b>-  </b>Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious public safety issues for residents.</p><p>Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge. The development in question is included in the Local Government (Household Charge) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 which list the developments in which households are eligible for the waiver.</p><p>Under Section 10 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, an exemption from liability can arise for properties located in developments prescribed on a list made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government where the Minister is satisfied that the developments on the list are incomplete to a substantial extent, having regard to the condition of public infrastructure and amenities, including access, water services, public lighting and amenity areas. An exemption from the Local Property Tax applies to developments listed in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013. The list of unfinished housing developments eligible for the exemption was compiled by local authorities utilising the categorisation employed for the purposes of the National Housing Survey 2012. The survey was carried out over the course of summer 2012 by my Department in conjunction with local authorities and the Housing Agency. Only developments that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013.  Certain parts of the development in question, identified by map coordinates, are included in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013 which list the developments in which households are eligible for the exemption.</p><p>The administration of issues relating to unfinished housing developments is a matter for individual local authorities.  Each local authority has appointed an Unfinished Housing Development co-ordinator; contact details can be found at: .</p></reply>

As part of this remit my Department operates a number of schemes, including the Social and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) and the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme, that deliver a range of benefits and supports to communities throughout Ireland, including those in our rural towns and villages.  Details of these schemes and other schemes delivered by my Department are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following weblinks: and .</p><p>In addition to the SICAP and LEADER programmes, the Government recently announced a new Town and Village Regeneration scheme, which will be delivered by Local Authorities in conjunction with local communities to support the sustainable development of Ireland&rsquo;s towns and villages.</p><p>This new scheme is part of a concerted effort to support the development and revitalisation of rural towns and villages, not only as a component of a broader approach to rural development but also to improve the environment of rural dwellers in a way that will increase their quality of life and simultaneously support potential economic activity in their areas into the future.  The scheme will be multi-annual in nature and will have an overall budget of &euro;30 million. It is proposed to allocate &euro;5m to the scheme each year from 2016 to 2021.  Details of the application process will be available shortly.</p></reply>

Following receipt of the Eurostat decision last year, the CSO indicated that the classification of Irish Water involved complex technical decisions and the CSO would be engaging with Eurostat through the appropriate channels to clarify some interpretation issues which arose in the decision, which was one of the first decisions for a new public utility under the new ESA regulations.  They also indicated that the first opportunity to review the classification decision for Irish Water would be in 2016 when annual financial statements become available and that this would be done as part of the normal annual review of the register of public bodies.  The timing of any review of classification is entirely a matter for the CSO, who are wholly independent in this function.</p></reply>

This Act gives RT&Eacute; the power to establish and operate a public service broadcasting radio multiplex for the purposes of providing a digital sound broadcasting service.  It also provides that the primary responsibility for ensuring the development of commercial digital radio rests with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI).  Finally, the Act gives the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) responsibility for licensing spectrum in respect of digital sound broadcasting services.</p><p>In April 2009, ComReg issued a digital radio multiplex licence to RT&Eacute; and,<font color="#333333"> </font>to date, RT&Eacute; has invested in a DAB network for carriage of its PSB services that covers approximately 53% of the population, predominantly in the areas around Dublin, Louth, Meath, Kildare, Wicklow, Cork and Limerick.  A commercial multiplex has yet to be established in Ireland, although I understand that DAB trials have been carried out by two different companies through ComReg&rsquo;s Test and Trial Regime.  Additional content for such DAB trials is supported through short duration reduced fee contracts by the BAI.</p><p>While I understand that there are no plans at present to rollout DAB services on a national basis, in line with its statutory responsibilities in this area, the BAI continues to monitor and consider the potential for the development of digital radio in Ireland.</p></reply>
