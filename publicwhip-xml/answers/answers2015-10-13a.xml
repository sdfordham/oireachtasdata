As Table 1 shows the overall stock of persons employed at given points in time, the changes which are calculated using these stock figures depend both on the number of jobs lost and jobs created over the period in question. The QNHS does not record whether a job is newly created.</p><p><b>Table 1 Seasonally adjusted number of persons aged 15 years and over in employment classified by NACE Rev.2 Economic Sector (ILO) Q1 2012 and Q2 2015</b></p><p>'000<table><tr><th><div>-</div></th><th><div>Q1 12</div></th><th><div>Q2 15</div></th><th><div>Change from Q1 12 to Q2 15</div></th></tr><tr><td>Agriculture, forestry and fishing</td><td><div>82.3</div></td><td><div>111.7</div></td><td><div>29.4</div></td></tr><tr><td>Industry</td><td><div>237.2</div></td><td><div>248.1</div></td><td><div>10.9</div></td></tr><tr><td>Construction</td><td><div>104.2</div></td><td><div>126.3</div></td><td><div>22.1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles</td><td><div>271.8</div></td><td><div>273.4</div></td><td><div>1.6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Transportation and storage </td><td><div>90.0</div></td><td><div>92.1</div></td><td><div>2.1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Accommodation and food service activities</td><td><div>119.8</div></td><td><div>136.5</div></td><td><div>16.7</div></td></tr><tr><td>Information and communication</td><td><div>79.2</div></td><td><div>81.8</div></td><td><div>2.6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Financial, insurance and real estate activities</td><td><div>102.0</div></td><td><div>103.7</div></td><td><div>1.7</div></td></tr><tr><td>Professional, scientific and technical activities</td><td><div>98.0</div></td><td><div>115.7</div></td><td><div>17.7</div></td></tr><tr><td>Administrative and support service activities</td><td><div>63.9</div></td><td><div>64.0</div></td><td><div>0.1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Public administration and defence; compulsory social security</td><td><div>99.9</div></td><td><div>100.0</div></td><td><div>0.1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td><div>144.7</div></td><td><div>148.9</div></td><td><div>4.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Human health and social work activities</td><td><div>241.7</div></td><td><div>248.9</div></td><td><div>7.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Other NACE activities </td><td><div>98.4</div></td><td><div>101.4</div></td><td><div>3.0</div></td></tr><tr><td>In employment</td><td><div>1,837.6</div></td><td><div>1,963.6</div></td><td><div>126.0</div></td></tr></table></p><p>Data may be subject to sampling or other survey errors, which are greater in respect of smaller values or estimates of change.'</p><p>Source: Quarterly National Household Survey, Central Statistics Office.';</p><p>It is not possible to calculate the percentage of the net change in employment that were in Government supported employment schemes. </p><p>The Live Register is compiled from returns made for each local office to the Central Statistics Office by the Department of Social Protection. </p><p>It should be noted that the Live Register is not designed to measure unemployment.

This requires the CSO to define the scope of the public sector (which includes the General Government Sector) in Ireland. This classification process is governed by legally binding accounting rules which must be used by all EU countries.  The public sector includes all bodies which are directly or indirectly controlled by government.  The general government sector comprises public sector bodies which are classified as 'non-market', i.e. not operating on a commercial basis.  The borrowings of this latter group are included in general government debt as reported under the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP).</p><p>The CSO maintain and publish  the Register of Public Sector Bodies (including General Government Bodies) in Ireland.  The current version of the register (reference year 2014) is available at.  The composition of this register is not static.  Government controlled bodies are established, closed and merged over time.  Also the market/non-market status of bodies must be continually reviewed.  Consequently the Register of Public Sector Bodies is reviewed and up-dated periodically (at least annually).  Recently the CSO and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform established and carried out a survey of central government departments to routinise the updating of the register.  Preliminary results of this survey are reflected in the latest version of the register, which lists the non-market agencies which are classified to the general government sector, by Department.  This information is available in Table 1.1.2 of the register which is also reproduced below.  A separate table in the Register provides a listing of Departments of State, Additional Votes and Extra-budgetary funds.</p><p>While all of the bodies listed above can potentially contribute to government debt not all of them will necessarily have borrowings in a given year. The composition of general government debt and the contribution of different parts of government to debt in recent years are shown in Tables 7 and 9 of the CSO's annual Government Finance Statistics release which is available at</p><p><font color="#0000FF"></font></p><p>Table 1.1.2 from Register of Public Bodies (including General Government Bodies) in Ireland<table><tr><th bgcolor="#C0C0C0">Government Department</th><th bgcolor="#C0C0C0">Agency</th></tr><tr><td rowspan="13">Agriculture, Food and the Marine</td><td><blockquote>Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board (ALAB)</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Bord Bia (Irish Food Board)</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Bord Iascaigh Mhara (Irish Sea Fisheries Board)</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>FEOGA </blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Horse Racing Ireland (HRI)</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Horse Sport Ireland</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>HRI Racecourses</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Marine Institute (Foras na Mara)</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Moorepark Technology Ltd </blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>National Fisheries Board </blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>National Milk Agency</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Sea Fisheries Protection Agency (SFPA)</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Teagasc (Agriculture and Food Development Authority)</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="20"></td><td><blockquote>Arts Council (An Chomhairle Eala&iacute;on)</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Chester Beatty Library</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Crawford Gallery, Cork</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Council of National Cultural Institutions (CNCI)</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Discovery Programme Ltd</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Foras Teanga (The Language Body) - NS.BODY</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>Foras Teanga (Ulster-Scots Agency) &ndash;

In addition, they must comply, when requested to do so, with the Department&rsquo;s activation measures.  Legislation currently provides for the imposition of penalties in the form of payment reductions for refusal or failure to engage, without good cause, with these measures.  </p>  <p>  In 2013 new provisions were announced for older persons who left work before reaching the State pension age of 66 and who wished to claim a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  Ordinarily, people in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment must engage with the Department&rsquo;s activation process and can face penalty rates if they refuse to engage with Department offers of training or education.  These criteria were eased for people aged 62 and over in light of their contribution to society.  They can still avail voluntarily of an array of supports, which are available from the Department if they wish to return to work, training or education.  However, penalty rates are not applied to this cohort should they decide they do not wish to engage with the activation process.</p>  <p>  Arrangements have been made so that they will have to register with their local office only once a year and will have their Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments paid directly into their bank accounts.  </p>  <p>  The core scheme provisions continue to apply to jobseeker customers aged from 62 years and older in the same way as any other jobseeker, namely they are required to be available for full-time employment and genuinely seeking work.  Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions is not entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.</p>  <p>  By giving a person aged over 62 the option of voluntarily availing of supports if they wish to return to work, training or education, we are continuing to support longer working while acknowledging the contribution of those moving towards retirement.</p></reply>

The Central Bank had briefed industry representatives a number of weeks ago that it was proposing significant increases in those levies in 2015. The proposed increases were driven by a proliferation of legislative regulation and corresponding regulatory activity, a need to meet a shortfall from 2014's levies and an increase in staff pension costs arising from Financial Reporting Standard 17, coupled with prevailing low yields on the bond market.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank's original proposals have since been revised to partially mitigate those increases as per a statement of 30th September 2015 published on the Central Bank's website. The revised proposals significantly reduced the increase in pension costs charged to the regulated sector in 2015 which is instead spread over coming years thereby easing the burden on financial services sector firms this year.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that a robust regulatory environment benefits the financial services industry by promoting stability, a level playing field and facilitating prudent development and innovation. A well regulated financial services sector also benefits consumers, industry, and the economy at large. In order to ensure a well regulated financial services sector the Central Bank must be sufficiently resourced, particularly in terms of staff who are key to an effective regulatory regime. Pensions are a standard component in financial regulation costs given their link to staff costs.</p>  <p>  Under Section 32D of the Central Bank Act 1942, the Central Bank is required to seek my approval for the Regulations prescribing industry levies. Following the publication of the Central Bank's revised proposals, which significantly reduced the pension element of the 2015 levies, I approved the Regulations prescribing the 2015 levies on 7 October last.</p></reply>

Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) is charged at 41%, with limited exemptions, on interest earned on deposit accounts.  Local Property Tax (LPT) introduced in 2013 is a tax based on the market value of residential properties. </p>  <p>  Both CGT and CAT rates have been increased significantly over recent years, from 20% in 2008 to 33% in and from 2012, in order to ensure that the taxation of capital makes its contribution to the consolidation of our fiscal position.</p>  <p>   I should say, however, that I have no plans to introduce a wealth tax. All taxes are, of course, constantly reviewed and the results of my decisions on the latest review of taxation are being published in this afternoon's Budget.</p></reply>

Following that, an implementation timetable for the 2012 Act was devised in consultation with stakeholders, including credit union representative bodies.  </p>  <p>  Commencement of all sections of the 2012 Act has been aligned with the credit union financial year and the introduction of the underpinning Central Bank regulations, with a view to implementation of the 2012 Act in a coherent and cohesive manner. This has provided credit unions with the time necessary to ensure that any required processes or procedures are in place prior to implementation of each tranche.</p>  <p>  My role as Minister for Finance is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions. </p>  <p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank is the independent regulator for credit unions.  Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members. </p>  <p>  While it is important to distinguish this division of roles, it is equally important to recognise that both the Registrar of Credit Unions and myself, as Minister for Finance are working together for the safety of members' savings and the security of the credit union sector. </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the draft regulations set out in Consultation Paper 88 (CP88), will be introduced at end December 2015.  It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations.  These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act. </p>  <p>  As outlined in the Central Bank's feedback statement on CP88, as part of the consultation process I proposed that in the interests of clarity and fairness, credit unions are provided with details of the process of applying for a retention of savings above the limit amount.  I have been informed by the Registry of Credit Unions that all credit unions have been contacted giving further information on its application criteria for the retention of savings in excess of &euro;100,000.  The Registry of Credit Unions intends to engage with the representative bodies and to invite comments from them prior to finalisation of the application process. When the application process is finalised, the Registry will provide an application form and explanatory notes in order to assist credit unions. It is anticipated that application forms will be available during December 2015.  It is envisaged that applications will be accepted in the first quarter of 2016 and that applicant credit unions will be informed by the end of the second quarter of 2016 on the outcome of the process, which is well within the 12 month transitional period. Where a credit union has demonstrated that it meets the criteria, it will be in a position to retain members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 held at the commencement of the regulations. </p>  <p>  I welcome the steps that have been taken to provide clarity for credit unions on the criteria for the retention of savings over &euro;100,000 and also welcome the proposed engagement with the representative bodies to seek their comments on the application process.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that it is committed to undertaking a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit, once the impact of the restructuring process can be assessed. It is envisaged that this review will commence within three years of the introduction of the regulations. The Central Bank has agreed to provide regular updates to my Department on developments in this matter.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that it is open to working with the credit union sector to ensure that prudent and appropriate business development can be facilitated within the regulatory framework. As set out in the feedback statement on CP88, the Central Bank intends to invite interested parties to discuss business model development in the coming months.</p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.</p></reply>

However, the Deputy will no doubt be aware that borrowers whose loans are sold are now protected by the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 which was enacted on 8 July this year. The purpose of the Act is to ensure that consumers retain the protections they had prior to the sale of their loan. The Act requires entities dealing with the consumer to be authorised by the Central Bank and subject to its Codes of Conduct. Dealing with the consumer is credit servicing and the definition of credit servicing is broad. Owners of loan books who deal directly with consumers, that is, who are servicing their own loan books, need to be authorised by the Central Bank. Otherwise they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm.</p><p>All consumer and relevant SME loans sold by regulated financial institutions are covered by this Act. Borrowers are therefore restored to the protections they previously had, such as the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises. Borrowers who previously had access to the Financial Services Ombudsman also have this right restored by this legislation. These borrowers, including those whose loans are owned by Cerberus, can complain to the Financial Services Ombudsman if they are unable to resolve the complaint with the firm.</p><p>The Central Bank is the competent authority in Ireland for the purposes of the Act and will implement a regulatory framework for credit servicing firms. I understand from the Central Bank that the Cerberus group is not on the list of firms currently authorised by the Central Bank. The Central Bank's registers can be found on the Central Bank's website at the following link: . The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 has transitional provisions for firms who now require authorisation provided that they applied to the Bank for authorisation no later than 3 months after the coming into operation of the Act.</p><p>Due to the confidentiality provisions set out in Section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942, the Central Bank has informed me that it is not in a position to confirm whether Cerberus or any other entity is in the process of seeking authorisation by the Central Bank.</p></reply>

The amendment confines the allowable cost of an asset, in the computation of any chargeable gain or loss arising on its disposal, to the actual cost incurred on the acquisition of the asset.  Accordingly, where an asset had been acquired with borrowings from which the borrower has been in whole or in part released from repaying, that part of the cost not actually incurred, is not allowable in computing an allowable loss or a gain.  This is to ensure that a person cannot claim the benefit of a base cost that has not, in fact, been incurred. The amendment also provides that, where a debt is forgiven in a year of assessment after the asset is disposed of such that the base cost of the asset will not have been reduced by the amount of the debt at the time of computing the gain or loss on the disposal, then a chargeable gain equal to the amount of the debt released is deemed to accrue in the year of assessment in which the debt is released.</p></reply>

This estimate is based on the removal of all income tax credits including the PAYE, Personal and Homecarers credits. The percentage of the total tax yield from gross incomes in excess of &euro;100,000 would be in the order of 23%.</p>  <p>  These figures are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2013, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim. They are estimated by reference to 2016 incomes and are provisional and may be revised.</p>  <p>  Assuming no changes other than the replacement of the income tax and universal social charge systems with a flat income tax rate of 23%, the OECD progressivity measure of the ratio of the average tax wedge at 167% and 67% of the average wage for Ireland in 2014 would fall from 1.79 to 1.  In terms of Ireland's OECD ranking on this progressivity measure, Ireland would move from 2nd in the OECD in 2014 to the bottom of the rankings, jointly with Hungary.</p></reply>

The 'liability date' for the 2013 half-year was 1 May 2013 while for subsequent years it is 1 November in the preceding year; for example the 'liability date' for 2015 was 1 November 2014.</p>  <p>  In the scenario quoted by the Deputy in Question 35405-15 it is the vendor, as the person who was in possession of the property on 1 November 2014, who is liable for the 2015 charge.</p>  <p>  In regard to Question 35407-15, I am advised that Section 119 of the Act specifies the statutory payment date/s for LPT. For the 2013 half-year the payment date was 1 July 2013 and is 1 January for all subsequent years, for example payment for 2014 was due on 1 January 2014, payment for 2015 was due on 1 January 2015 and payment for 2016 will become due on 1 January 2016. However, where a property owner chooses to use either the Single Debit Authority or Annual Debit Authority payment option to meet his/her LPT liability, Revenue will not deduct the amount until 21 March in the due year, for example the payment due on 1 January 2016 will not be deducted until 21 March 2016.</p>  <p>  Revenue also provides for payment of LPT on a phased basis beyond the statutory 1 January due date to assist people in meeting their liabilities in a manner that best suits their individual circumstances. Where property owners wish to avail of such an arrangement, having paid in a single payment the previous year, it is very important that they confirm their phased payment method preference to Revenue by the end of the preceding November so that the required arrangements can be put in place from the beginning of the due year.</p>  <p>  Where a property owner is already availing of a phased arrangement via direct debit from a bank account or through deduction at source from salary or pension there is no need to make any contact with Revenue as the payments automatically roll over from one year to the next.</p></reply>

Qualifying expenditure is that which is subject to the 13.5% VAT rate.  The work must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 (inclusive of VAT) which would attract a credit of &euro;595.  Where the cost of the work exceeds &euro;30,000 (exclusive of VAT) a maximum credit of &euro;4,050 will apply. The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is carried out.  </p><p>As the HRI is a tax relief, it is not possible to extend it to individuals who pay no tax. However, unused credits may be carried forward to future years so that if in the future an individual becomes liable to income tax, the credits will be available to them at that stage. </p><p>In relation to the proposed refund of VAT, the EU VAT Directive does not specifically provide for the introduction of schemes for VAT refund. While providing a compensation method does not affect VAT being charged according to the Directive, this is not clear cut, as it is generally counter to the provision that VAT should be paid by the final consumer of goods and services.  </p><p>It is for this reason that Ireland has not introduced any new VAT refund orders since the 1980s.  The existing refund orders are all historic, going back to the 1970s and 1980s, and any changes to VAT refunds since then have been either by EU requirement or by making minor changes to existing refund orders.</p><p>It is worth noting that the SEAI operates the Better Energy Homes Scheme where cash grants are provided for qualifying works. The SEAI also install energy efficiency measures at no cost to qualifying individuals under the Warmer Homes Scheme. Further information on these schemes is available on the SEAI website, </p></reply>

I have no statutory function in relation to the banking decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time. These are taken by the board and management of the relevant institution. This includes decisions in relation to product interest rates as determined by the banks from time to time.  </p>  <p>  The recent CBI publication, "Microfinancial Review 2015:1", states that "the mean rate on SME loans during 2014 was 5 per cent in Ireland, compared to 3.5 per cent in the euro area." However, the report goes on to note that "differences in the underlying lending composition, however, may be a factor here. For example, the data include restructured and renegotiated loans, of which there is likely to be an increasing share in Ireland. Cross-country differences are also likely in terms of loan type and borrower type." </p>  <p>  It should be noted that in the most recent Department of Finance SME credit demand survey, covering the six month period to March 2015, only 1% of SMEs that did not demand credit thought that it was too expensive to borrow. The same survey notes that, among those SMEs with outstanding loans, the average cost of credit across all outstanding loans is 3.9%. This is down slightly from 4% in September 2014. 36% of SMEs with outstanding loans report a very low cost of credit between 0-2% , while the majority (61%) have an average cost of credit of between 3-10%.</p>  <p>  In addition, the lower cost funding by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) should act as a catalyst for downward pressure on interest rates by fostering greater competition in the marketplace. The establishment of the SBCI is a further important step to help Irish businesses, and the crucial SME sector in particular, to grow and contribute further to our economic recovery.</p>  <p>  This creates positive competitive pressure in the banking infrastructure, encouraging new entrants while also pushing existing financial providers to better meet the needs of their clients.</p></reply>

If this is no longer the address he wishes to use in regard to his tax affairs then the onus is on him to inform Revenue of his new address. </p><p>I understand that the Sheriffs operate a Code of Practice, which sets out how they will engage with taxpayers in relation to their tax collection activities. The Code is designed to provide an opportunity to taxpayers to resolve disputes without the necessity to initiate Court proceedings. Where direct discussions between the Sheriff and the taxpayer fail to resolve an issue the Code provides that a 'Joint Standing Committee' (JSC), which includes a Revenue representative, a representative from the Sheriffs' Association and a representative from the Department of Justice and Law Reform, will review the complaint. Requesting an issue to be reviewed under the Code of Practice does not infringe on the rights of a person to subsequently take his/her complaint before the Courts.</p><p>I am advised that a copy of the Code of Practice is available from any Sheriff office or can be viewed on the Revenue website via the following link: .</p></reply>

Parts or accessories and training are also liable to VAT at the standard rate.</p>  <p>  There is no provision in the EU VAT Directive that would make it possible to exempt from VAT or apply a zero rate to the supply of defibrillators.

The fees charged by a PIP in connection these services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23% (section 46 Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010). The Revenue Commissioners do not share the Deputy's assessment of the role of a PIP since they consider a PIP to be acting in a capacity not entirely unlike liquidators, receivers or examiners whose services are also subject to VAT at the standard rate. </p>  <p>  Having regard to the activities carried out by a PIP, Revenue has formed the opinion that the service provided by a PIP is not one that qualifies for exemption in accordance with the VAT Directive, Irish VAT Law, and relevant decisions of the European Court of Justice. It should be noted that exemptions for VAT are to be construed strictly and the activities of PIP practitioners do not fall within the exempted activities outlined under paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010. </p>  <p>  While particular activities of Insolvency Practitioners operating under the UK Individual Voluntary Arrangement procedure were held by a UK First Tier VAT Tribunal to be exempt from VAT, there are distinct differences between the activities undertaken by UK practitioners and Irish PIPs and between the UK VAT legislation and the Irish VAT legislation.  </p>  <p>  I would point out that under a Personal Insolvency Arrangement, the Personal Insolvency Practitioner's fees are ultimately deducted from the dividend payments to the creditors under the arrangement rather than charged to the debtor.  Therefore, it is the creditor who is bearing the ultimate cost of the fees, including VAT.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations is his sole prerogative and I, as Minister, have no role in decisions in this regard. </p>  <p>  The current position under the Valuation Acts regarding claims for exemption on charitable, community, cultural or religious grounds is that in order for a property occupied by an organisation to be exempt from rates under the terms of Schedule 4, it must satisfy certain criteria prescribed and articulated in a number of specific provisions in the Schedule. For example the building has to be used exclusively for the purpose of religious worship (paragraph 7) or exclusively as a community hall (paragraph 15), community hall being further defined in the Acts.</p>  <p>  With regard to the particular property to which the Deputy refers, these premises were the subject of a revision of valuation in 2012 when the occupier applied to the Valuation Office for exemption on the grounds that it was a non-profit organisation and that the premises was a Community and Cultural Centre.  The applicant did not at that time satisfy the criteria to qualify for exemption and did not appeal the Commissioner's decision to that effect. The time for appealing the decision on the 2012 revision has passed but the occupier can make a new revision application seeking exemption setting out the applicable grounds for exemption in Schedule 4 if he considers that the use of the premises meets the relevant conditions.      </p>  <p>  In general, if an occupier of property is dissatisfied with a decision not to exempt a property under Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 as amended, there are extensive appeal avenues, provided for in the Valuation Acts. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations in relation to a proposed valuation to the Revision Manager in the Valuation Office. Following consideration of the representations and determination of the valuation, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, an independent body set up for such purposes and, finally, there is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law.  </p></reply>

Much work has been undertaken on the project since then on the outline design of the Scheme and with the development of the flood forecasting system which will facilitate decision-making on the discharge rate from the dams at Inniscarra and Carrigadrohid.</p>  <p>  The main Lower Lee Scheme for the City is likely to be the largest flood relief scheme ever undertaken in the country and covers the area from Inniscarra Dam to downstream of the City. When the outline design has been completed and an Environmental Impact Statement has been prepared the OPW will formally exhibit the proposals over a four week period in the City which is expected to take place in the Spring of 2016. The detailed design will be commenced after the Exhibition. Once the detailed design is complete, the Scheme will be submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for Confirmation or approval as required by the Arterial Drainage Acts. </p>  <p>  Subject to the Scheme being Confirmed the OPW will aim to appoint a civil works contractor and commence construction within a short period thereafter. Due to the likely scale of the proposed Scheme, it is possible that the Scheme will be undertaken on a phased basis under a number of contracts. The design consultants have commenced work on a Phasing Report which will assist a structured implementation of the Scheme. This will be a very significant scheme with commensurate costs and it is anticipated that the works will take at least 4-5 years to complete. </p>  <p>  It was indicated by the OPW in the early stages of this project that should there be delays to the main City Scheme then every effort would be made to progress the Blackpool element of the project. Progress has been made in relation to the identification of a preferred scheme for Blackpool and this has now been separated from the main Scheme and has become a Scheme in its own right.  It is intended to bring the preferred Scheme in Blackpool forward to public Exhibition before the end of November this year. Detailed design will then be undertaken as early as possible with a procurement process expected to be undertaken in the first half of 2016 which would coincide with the Confirmation process. The Confirmation process itself will require the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to have the Environmental Impact Statement independently assessed before it can be Confirmed. It is hoped to commence construction works in the second half of 2016.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to the provision of a flood relief scheme for the people of Cork City and the OPW has made provision for the cost of implementing the scheme in its Multi Annual Budget Profiles.</p></reply>

Local Authorities and other stakeholders are involved in the Programme, in partnership with OPW, on Steering Groups and Progress Groups across six regional studies.  The Programme, which is focusing on 300, mainly urban, potentially significant flood risk areas, involves the production of predictive flood risk and hazard mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans.  The Plans will be used to determine national priorities for State investment in flood defences.  An OPW website, cfram.ie, provides information and updates on the CFRAM Programme.</p>  <p>  In conjunction with a national public consultation on the draft predictive flood maps scheduled for late 2015, the draft flood maps will be made available to the county councils for their consideration following which each county council may provide observations on the maps.  The county councils will not be asked to approve the maps.  The flood maps, when finalised following this consultation process, are vital to inform the development of prioritised plans for both the structural and non structural solutions to manage flood risks.  The maps will assist the emergency response authorities with regard to responding effectively to flood events.  The maps will also be available for use as an information source for sustainable planning.</p>  <p>  The OPW has no role or function in relation to the oversight or regulation of the insurance industry or of insurance matters generally. The provision of insurance cover, the level of premiums charged and the policy terms applied are a matter for individual insurers. Insurance companies make commercial decisions on the provision of insurance cover based on their assessment of the risks they are prepared to accept on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  I am aware that some insurance companies are using their own flood risk survey and mapping information as part of their risk assessment approach. The draft Flood Maps scheduled to be published later in 2015 for public consultation purposes cannot be relied upon for commercial or other decision making purposes.</p>  <p>  When the maps are finalised, the OPW's Flood Risk Maps will provide an analysis of the number of properties, business and other public amenities that are at risk from a predictive assessment of flood risk. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, which was signed on 24th March 2014, outlines the principles of agreement between the parties on the provision of information to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.</p>  <p>  The Working Group established through this MOU and that includes the Department of Finance provides the forum to discuss and exchange information between the parties and the impact on flood insurance. This is the appropriate structure for the OPW to analyse any possible strategic impact to the availability of insurance cover when the flood maps are finalised.</p>  <p>  I have recently reconvened an Interdepartmental Policy Co-ordination Committee that is due to report to the Government next Spring on the Whole of Government policy measures, including those to support availability of affordable insurance, to support the OPW's Flood Risk Management Plans arising from the CFRAM programme.</p></reply>

It was developed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in consultation with the Public Service Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council to progress and support the aims of the Public Service Reform Plan.</p><p>Much of what was planned in eGovernment 2012-2015 has been achieved and good progress has been made in relation to other plans. Two particularly significant developments which have taken place since eGovernment 20122015 was launched are the publication of the new Public Service Reform Plan 20142016 and the publication of a Public Service ICT Strategy. Many of the remaining elements included in eGovernment 2012-2015 are now subsumed by or reflected in work being undertaken through a number of initiatives arising from these developments.</p><p>Digital Government is a central theme of the Public Service Reform Plan 20142016. The Public Service ICT Strategy, published in January 2015, supersedes eGovernment 2012-2015 and complements the overarching objectives of the 2014 Reform Plan. The provision of new digital services to citizens, businesses and public servants is a key aim of the Strategy.</p><p>The Public Service ICT Strategy, sets out a new model for ICT delivery across the entire Public Service, delivering more efficiency and effectiveness in service delivery through a more integrated, shared and digital environment. It identifies a number of key strategic objectives that will set the future direction for innovation and excellence in ICT within the Public Service:</p><p><b>- Build to Share</b>: Creating ICT shared services to support integration across the wider Public Service to drive efficiency, standardisation, consolidation, reduction in duplication and controlling of costs;</p><p><b>- Digital First</b>: Digitisation of key transactional services and the increased use of ICT to deliver improved efficiency within Public Bodies and provide new digital services to citizens, businesses and public servants;</p><p><b>- Data as an Enabler</b>: In line with statutory obligations and Data Protection guidelines, facilitate increased data sharing and innovative use of data across all Public Bodies to enable the delivery of integrated services, improve decision making and improve openness and transparency between Government and the public;</p><p><b>- Improve Governance</b>: Ensure that the ICT strategy is aligned, directed and monitored across Public Bodies to support the specific goals and objectives at a whole-of-government level and with an emphasis on shared commitment; and </p><p><b>- Increase Capability</b>: Ensure the necessary ICT skills and resources are available to meet the current and future ICT needs of the Public Service.</p><p>The Public Service ICT Strategy is aligned with the objectives of the 2014 Reform Plan and the goals of the Civil Service Renewal Plan and has the overarching objective of providing better outcomes for citizens, businesses and public servants through embracing the latest technological advances. Further initiatives will be progressed in line with this Strategy.</p></reply>

At that time I indicated to them my support for the formation of  a pensioner representative grouping along the lines of the Alliance of Retired Public Servants. I also committed to move towards reducing  the impact of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) at the earliest date the economic and fiscal recovery enabled this Government to do so, with the majority of the planned benefit focussed on benefitting those PSPR-affected public service pensioners who are in receipt of relatively lower public service pensions.</p>  <p>  Since then, representatives of the Alliance have met me and officials of my Department on a number of occasions. For example, the Alliance made a submission regarding the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR), among other issues, to my Department in May of 2015. At subsequent meetings the Alliance had the opportunity to discuss the issues covered in their submission.</p>  <p>  I am happy to have delivered on my commitment to reduce the impact of PSPR on public service pensions. The proposals provide for the part-restoration of the PSPR pensions cuts in three stages effective from 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018. From 1 January 2018, all public service pensions in payment with pre-PSPR values of &euro;34,132 or less will be fully exempt from PSPR, while those pensioners not fully removed from the PSPR "net" will, in general, benefit by &euro;1,680 per year. The cost of the announced changes is estimated at &euro;90m on a full year basis in 2018.</p>  <p>  My proposals to Government were welcomed by the Alliance at the time of their announcement.</p>  <p>  While the award of a negotiating licence to a group representing pensioners under the Industrial Relations Acts would be a policy matter for my colleague,  the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I believe that the current arrangements for engagement with the Alliance are operating satisfactorily.</p></reply>

Under Irish law, military export licences have to be sought in respect of the goods and technology, and any components thereof, listed in the Annex to the Control of Exports (Goods and Technology) Order, S.I.216 of 2012 which reflects the EU Common Military List.  The EU Common Military List includes military goods and technology, and components for such items that should be licensed for export from the Union. Items which are classified as &ldquo;military goods&rdquo; from an export control perspective and which are exported from Ireland involve components rather than military equipment.</p><p>My Department is also responsible for licensing those dual-use items controlled pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No. 428/2009 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items, as amended.</p><p>While the term &ldquo;dual-use&rdquo; refers to those items that are normally used for civilian or commercial purposes but may also have a military application, the vast majority of dual-use licences issued by my Department are for commercial purposes.</p><p>Application for the export of Military List and Dual-Use products to Israel, as with all other destinations, are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Applications are subject to a rigorous licence application process which centres on a careful assessment of the proposed end-user and the end-use. Furthermore, the Department consults with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in respect of all export licence applications involving Israel.</p><p>In view of security concerns and the relatively small number of export licence holders, it is the policy of my Department not to identify licence holders or recipients of controlled goods. The Information Commissioner has previously affirmed my Department&rsquo;s decision to not release confidential export licensing information that could identify export licence holders.</p><p>I have however provided, as follows, details of licences issued for the export of Military List and dual-use items to all end-users in Israel from 2011 to date.</p><p><b>Licences issued for the export of Military List items to Israel, 2011 to date</b></p><p>Eleven licences for the export of Military List items to Israel have been issued from 2011 to date. Details are provided as follows:</p><p>2011</p><p>Three licences for the export of Military List products to Israel were issued in 2011, to the total value of &euro;6.138 million. Two licences were issued for Military List (ML) &ldquo;category 6&rdquo; items while one was issued for ML &ldquo;category 22&rdquo; items. The ML &ldquo;category 6 &ldquo;refers to &ldquo;Ground Vehicles and Components&rdquo;, while ML &ldquo;category 22&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;Technology&rdquo;. &ldquo;Technology&rdquo; is that which is &ldquo;required for the development, production or use of items or components specified in the EU Common Military List&rdquo;.</p><p>2012</p><p>One licence for the export of Military List products to Israel was issued in 2012. The value of the licence was &euro;39,525 and it was issued for ML &ldquo;category 6&rdquo; items, i.e. &ldquo;Ground Vehicles and Components&rdquo;.</p><p>2013</p><p>Five licences for the export of Military List products to Israel were issued in 2013, to the total value of &euro;119,971. Two licences were issued for ML &ldquo;category 6&rdquo; items while three were issued for ML &ldquo;category 10&rdquo; items. The ML &ldquo;category 10&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;Aircraft, lighter-than-air vehicles, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles &ldquo;UAVs&rdquo;), aero-engines and aircraft equipment, related equipment, and components&rdquo;.</p><p>2014</p><p>Two licences for the export of Military List products to Israel were issued during the first quarter of 2014, to the total value of &euro;126,637. Both licences were issued for ML &ldquo;category 6&rdquo; items. No applications for the export of Military List products to Israel have been received since the end of the first quarter of 2014.</p><p>The figures provided above represent the maximum value which can be exported under the above export licences and not the value of the goods and technology actually exported under those licences. It is important to recall that items which were classified as &ldquo;military goods&rdquo; from an export control perspective and which were exported from Ireland involved components for inclusion in, rather than finished military equipment.</p><p><b>Licences issued for the export of dual-use items to Israel, 2011 to date</b></p><p>A small number of dual-use export licences are issued each year in respect of Israel. Twelve licences were issued in 2011, twenty in 2012, twenty in 2013, twenty one in 2014 and seventeen for the year to date. Further details of these licences are provided as follows.</p><p>Israel is also included as a destination on a proportion of the small number of global dual-use licences issued by my Department each year. Global dual-use licences are issued to companies that have a very high volume of relatively low-risk exports. These licences are issued subject to a number of strict conditions, such as a prohibition on their use for exports to military, police or State security forces end-users. Global licence holders must submit an application for an individual dual-use licence where they intend exporting to this category of end-users.</p><p><b>Individual dual-use licences issued in respect of exports to Israel</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Dual-Use Category</th><th>Number of Licences Issued</th><th>Number of Licences where Individual Licence Value= <br /><br />&euro;0 - &euro;100,000</th><th>Number of Licences where Individual Licence Value= <br /><br />&euro;100,000 - &euro;500,000</th><th>Number of Licences where Individual Licence Value is above &euro;500,000</th></tr><tr><td>2015 (to date)</td><td>Category 3</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Category 5</td><td>15</td><td>11</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Total number of licences issued </td><td></td><td>17</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>Category 3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Category 5</td><td>17</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Category 7</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total number of licences issued</td><td></td><td>21</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Category 2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Category 5</td><td>12</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Category 7</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total issued</td><td></td><td>20</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Dual-Use Category</td><td>Number of Licences Issued</td><td>Number of Licences where Individual Licence Value= <br /><br />&euro;0 - &euro;100,000</td><td>Number of Licences where Individual Licence Value= <br /><br />&euro;100,000 - &euro;500,000</td><td>Number of Licences where Individual Licence Value is above &euro;500,000</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Category 2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Category 4</td><td>1</td><td>1 </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Category 5</td><td>18</td><td>15</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total issued</td><td></td><td>20</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>Category 2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Category 3</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Category 5</td><td>9</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Total issued</td><td></td><td>12</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>It is important to note that the figures provided above represent the maximum value which can be exported under the above export licences and not the value of the goods and technology actually exported under those licences.</p><p>The dual-use categories correspond to the product category classifications as set out in Annex I to the Dual-Use Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No. 428/2009, as amended): </p><p>Category 2: Materials Processing </p><p>Category 3: Electronics </p><p>Category 4: Computers </p><p>Category 5: Telecommunications and &ldquo;information security&rdquo; </p><p>Category 7: Navigation and avionics</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-10-13a.251.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015101300057#WRE02600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 89 together.</p>  <p>  The EU Commission&rsquo;s mandate to negotiate with the United States on a free trade agreement includes in its scope (paragraphs 22 and 23), investment protection.  The stated aim of negotiations on investment is to secure the highest levels of liberalisation and highest standards of protection that both sides have negotiated to date.</p>  <p>  The mandate makes it clear that the inclusion of investment protection will depend on EU interests being met and on the final balance of the Agreement.  Importantly, the mandate states that the objectives of any investment protection provisions would be without prejudice to the right of EU and the Member States to adopt and enforce measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives in a non-discriminatory manner.</p>  <p>  There is an awareness of the need to reform investment arbitration systems and to that end the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals for an investment court system published on 16th September set out the context for these proposed improvements.  This proposal builds on the progress achieved in the EU investment agreement negotiated with Canada and sets out four areas for further improvement: Governments&rsquo; right to regulate, establishment and functioning of tribunals, relationship between national judicial systems and an investment protection system, and an appellate mechanism.  These improvements represent a move away from privately conducted arbitration to a familiar public justice system that is accountable, transparent and subject to democratic principles.</p>  <p>  This means that the type of investment arbitration system under the EU US Free Trade Agreement will be a clear improvement on investment protection in existing Bilateral Investment Treaties, some of which date back to the 1950&rsquo;s.  Ireland already provides the highest protection for investors by virtue of Article 43 of our Constitution, so the policy intention of the Commission in these negotiations is not new to Ireland.</p>  <p>  I welcome these improvements and the Commission&rsquo;s efforts to follow up on the views expressed by Member States, the European Parliament and other stakeholders through the Commission&rsquo;s public consultation process.  I have consistently reinforced the message with the Commission that the investment protection model included in any final agreement between the EU and the US must be in the interests of EU Member States.  I am of the view that the inclusion of this acceptable model of investment protection would provide a common floor of protection across the 28 EU Member States and at federal and state level in the US.</p></reply>

One facility is currently leased to a company called Meridian and the remaining facility is under contract to sell to an Enterprise Ireland client.  In addition, I have been informed by IDA Ireland that there are a variety of privately owned property solutions in Tallaght which include offices and industrial units.  The Agency has assured me that they are happy to show the facilities to future potential clients who require premises for investment in the area.</p><p>Information in relation to IDA Ireland sponsored site visits by potential investors is provided on a county basis only.  I am informed by IDA Ireland that from 2011 to the end of June 2015 there were 827 IDA Ireland-sponsored site visits by potential investors to Dublin City and County.  These visits were from new companies visiting the location for the first time and also from senior executives of existing client companies.  It must be remembered that the final decision on where to visit and where to locate are made by the investor.  Details of the number of these site visits during this period are set out in the attached tabular statement.</p><p>At the end of<b></b>2014, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 596 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Dublin employing 70,989<b></b>people.  IDA Ireland works closely with these companies to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.</p><p>As is evidenced with IDA Ireland investment announcements over the past number of years, a significant number locate in Dublin so it is reasonable to expect that this trend will continue.</p><p>A typical example of the type of investment which was announced in the City West area of Dublin in 2015 includes the announcement in September by Google that they will begin construction of a new data centre in West Dublin which will create 400 jobs during this period.  This announcement builds on previous investments announced in 2014 by Aspen, Alexion and SAP.</p><p>I am confident that these investments will have a positive impact directly and indirectly on job creation in the greater Dublin area which includes Tallaght.</p><p>While significant progress has been made in supporting job creation and in reducing unemployment rates in all regions of the country this Government is not complacent about the challenge of achieving sustainable full employment over the medium term, in all regions including Dublin.  As part of the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs we launched the process for developing Action Plans for every region and the work on the preparation of the Dublin Action Plan for Jobs is currently commencing.  Two areas of particular focus will be how we can generate future entrepreneurship and investment in manufacturing and services sectors of the economy.</p><p><b>Table shows the total number of IDA Ireland sponsored site visits by potential investors to County Dublin since 2011 to the end of June 2015.</b><table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Dublin </th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>196</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>180</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>205</td></tr><tr><td>2015 (to end of June)</td><td>96</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The ultimate objective is increased employment and prosperity in Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland supported companies created 19,705 new jobs in 2014, resulting in a net increase of 8,476 in the number of people employed within the Agency&rsquo;s client base.  The companies that Enterprise Ireland works with are a vital source of employment, both direct and indirect, in every county in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Employment data for Enterprise Ireland is collected annually as part of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Annual Employment Survey which measures the number of jobs in Agency assisted client companies, as permanent full time jobs and other jobs.

The complaint was withdrawn in April 2015.  From the details provided it would appear that the Deputy may be referring to the Cattle Movement and Monitoring System (CMMS) unit rather than the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) of the Department.   </p>  <p>  Following the introduction of a new identification system for bovines which led to significant discrepancies in the early stages, the CMMS Unit was initiated as a support to the work of the local District Veterinary Offices.</p>  <p>  For operational management purposes, staff assigned to the CMMS Unit were under the same line management as the SIU. The CMMS unit staff were not part of the SIU.   </p>  <p>  In 2009, a review of the District Veterinary Office (DVO) operational management within my Department was carried out in order to maximise efficiency. This review led to several significant changes at operational level. As the volume of discrepancies had decreased and there was, following the DVO operational management review, an increased capacity among local office staff to carry out such work, it was decided to discontinue the CMMS unit and to re-deploy the CMMS Unit staff to other areas of my Department where vacancies existed. In Sept 2010, my Department met with the staff side&rsquo;s representatives to discuss the redeployment of the staff that had been assigned to the CMMS unit. Following the announcement of the proposed transfers, the eleven staff of the CMMS Unit, in the period Sept-Oct 2011, lodged similar individual complaints regarding work issues against line management under the Civil Service Grievance Procedure. Mediation efforts were made on 2 occasions, namely July 2012 and Oct 2014. In the former case, the mediator withdrew from the process as he was of the view that the issues raised were not appropriate to the grievance procedure. In the latter case, the mediator made an offer, to bring closure to the issue and allow the parties to move forward. That offer was not accepted by the staff.</p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise that no action was taken against any of the staff who complained. Ten of the eleven staff are presently employed by my Department in areas where vacancies existed and one member has retired.</p>  <p>  At the time of the making of the complaints, there were 11 staff in the SIU of which 6 were technical staff reporting to line management. Following the retirement of a number of staff in the intervening years coupled with the embargo on staff recruitment, the number reporting to line management at this time is two.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that the Chief Veterinary Officer and the Personnel Officer are aware of the complaints made.</p></reply>

It would be inappropriate for me to deal with the detail of the case other than through the appropriate legal channels at this point.</p>  <p>  The general position in relation to mackerel management policy is as follows. After extensive and lengthy consultations in 2009 and 2010, the then Minister introduced new management arrangements for polyvalent mackerel in November 2010. Mackerel allocations were made available to vessel owners based on track record from the two best years 2007, 2008, 2009. </p>  <p>  The policy sets out that 13% of the national mackerel quota is available to the polyvalent segment as follows: 76.5% of the polyvalent mackerel quota is allocated to Tier 1 and 21% for Tier 2, the remaining 2.5% is available to cover the artisanal gill net fishermen and under 18m vessels with periodic boat catch limits set usually on a monthly or bi-monthly basis. Vessels qualified for either of the Tiers on the basis of having caught more than 35% of the mackerel allocated to them in an average of 2 of the reference years. In order to qualify for Tier 1 allocations, a vessel had to have landed more than an average of 275 tonnes of mackerel per year. To qualify for a Tier 2 allocation, a vessel had to have landed more than 25 tonnes of mackerel per year. These quantities were chosen so as to ensure that there is no general loss of fishing opportunities to vessels with qualifying track record, based on fishing in the period 2007-2009.</p>  <p>  Given the long and detailed consultation process which went into development of the mackerel policy in recent years, I consider this policy settled.</p></reply>

The US is one of our leading trading partners, and we have a large and growing agri-food trade surplus with them (exports of &euro;570m last year, compared to imports of &euro;268m). The drinks industry currently accounts for over 60% of the value of exports.  We have significant offensive interests in the TTIP negotiations. For example, we see worthwhile opportunities in the US for cheese, powdered milks and sports products, and further opportunities for branded packaged butter, if we can remove some regulatory barriers. Prepared consumer foods and fish could also benefit from trade liberalisation.   </p>  <p>  Beef is a unique sector in that we have both offensive and defensive interests. In the long term, any significant increase in beef imports to the EU could have adverse effects on the Irish industry. That was confirmed by a number of recent studies and is an issue we have raised strongly with the European Commission. Admittedly, adverse effects look much less likely at present, as US prices are currently at historic highs. But it does mean that we have legitimate concerns about the size, composition and administration of any quota offered to the US. </p>  <p>  Of course, we should also seek a significant EU quota for beef to the US as part of any TTIP agreement. Following the re-opening of the market, Irish beef exports now fall under a 65,000 tonne quota for &lsquo;other countries&rsquo; on a first come, first served basis. This is mainly filled by Latin American countries. When we get access for manufacturing beef - which I hope will be soon - we would stand to benefit greatly from a specific EU import quota in the US and this can only be achieved through TTIP.</p>  <p>  A number of key issues in these negotiations arise in relation to hormone treated beef, food standards, GMOs and Geographical indicators. All of these arose in the Canadian negotiations and were resolved and I believe they can also be resolved in TTIP.</p></reply>

The aim of this initiative was to create 250 cross sectoral jobs in the Killybegs area by 2014. Seafood processing was just one of the areas identified as having the potential to create additional employment.</p><p>To drive forward the initiative, I established a High Level Group on Job Creation in the Killybegs Region and requested that the Group identify the potential actions required to deliver job creation in the following five key areas, that is; promoting seafood value added activity; enhancing ancillary services; developing offshore supports; promoting tourism and marine leisure; and promoting the green economy and renewable energy.</p><p>The High Level Group comprised representatives of the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation (who chaired the Group), Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Donegal County Council, Letterkenny Institute of Technology, Enterprise Ireland, local industry and from my Department. BIM provided secretariat services to assist the chair.</p><p>The High Level Group finished its work in 2011 and its Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: </p><p>Since 2012, a local implementation group reporting to Donegal County Council has taken on responsibility for driving forward the initiative. Bord Iascaigh Mhara provide advice to the Group as requested on any aspects relevant to the responsibilities of my Department. Donegal County Council may assist the Deputy with the specific details requested. </p><p>I am informed by Bord Iascaigh Mhara that by the end of 2014, 89 jobs had been created in seafood processing companies in the Killybegs area. I do not have information available to me on jobs created in areas outside of my area of responsibility.</p><p>It is clear that the future is very promising for the seafood industry generally and Killybegs is central to that growth story. While the Killybegs Jobs Initiative was important in terms of fostering a diversified blue economy in Killybegs, seafood will continue to be the driver of economic growth for Killybegs in the years to come.</p><p>The seafood sector continues to be a high-growth area of the economy and indeed of our food industry. Exports have grown 70% since 2009 and the sector is now worth &euro;850 million in sales. Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Bord Bia are working with seafood companies in Killybegs and elsewhere around our coast to grow the sector to &euro;1 billion in the next few years. This will be driven by our seafood processing sector adding value to commodity products, innovating and developing new consumer seafood products, with the assistance of BIM&rsquo;s Seafood Development Centres in Clonakilty and Killybegs, and winning new markets for Ireland&rsquo;s top quality seafood. </p><p>Earlier this year, I announced a new &euro;241 million Seafood Development Operational Programme under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. This new Programme will double the level of supports for the sustainable development of the seafood sector over the coming years. I expect that the new Programme will be adopted by the European Commission by December. My Department is working with Bord Iascaigh Mhara to have a range of supports ready to launch from the start of 2016 to support and promote the sustainable growth of the processing, aquaculture and fishing sectors through that Programme.</p></reply>

The maximum area for planting was increased under the new scheme from 30 hectares to 50 hectares in response to submissions from the sector. Applicants wishing to avail of the grant had to submit evidence of linkages with end-users to use the biomass crop as a source of bioenergy.  Despite the package of supports available and the changes made, take-up of the new scheme has been very low and the scheme is now being reviewed once more in my Department. There are no direct links in place currently for the output of the scheme to supply fuel to biomass electricity generating plants, but this is an aspect that will be considered in the review.</p></reply>

An essential element required to achieve this overall goal is a robust and reliable replacement index built to suit Irish animals and production systems on which farmers can make informed breeding decisions.  In order to achieve this, it is imperative that the index is developed using the most accurate information available to us and that is why genotyping is such a major part of the BDGP. The genotyping requirement within the BDGP reflects the need to genotype a high percentage of female calves at birth within scheme herds and to genotype female animals introduced from non-scheme herds so that sufficient 4 and 5 star animals can be identified. Genotyping greatly improves the reliability of the breeding indexes and of course ensures the identification of sufficient numbers of 4 &amp;amp; 5 star females required by BDGP herds.</p>  <p>  Inevitably while improving the index there will be minor fluctuations in some individual animals&rsquo; ratings due to the addition of new information on that animal. This of course will further improve the reliability of that animal&rsquo;s rating. Similarly, the collection of additional information across the entire herd, including the genomic data, will result in more accurate &euro;uro-Star evaluations. Some animals will end up moving to lower star ratings while others will increase their rating reciprocally, but with these changes the index becomes more accurate and a more useful tool for suckler farmers across the country. The cattle breeding industry in Ireland is very accustomed to genetic evaluations moving over time, as more data accumulates.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the female replacement requirements that must be fulf illed by a farmer under the BDGP are focused on ensuring that a percentage of their heifers/eligible suckler cows (rounded to the nearest animal), in the years 2018 and 2020 are genotyped animals that are:</p>  <p>(i) 4 or 5 stars on the replacement index;</p>  <p>(ii) at least 16 months old and;</p>  <p>(iii) born in 2013 or later.</p>  <p>  I have subsequently clarified to the scheme participants on point (iii) above that a female animal born before 2013 will be considered eligible if it was present in the herd before 5th June 2015 and also meets the requirements of parts (i) and (ii) above. In addition the scheme also allows animals to count as eligible even if their rating is subsequently downgraded from 4 and 5 stars provided that the animal is genotyped 4 or 5 star at the time of purchase.</p>  <p>  The focus now on the BDGP has moved to engagement with scheme participants. My priority now is to work closely with ICBF and individual scheme participants to ensuring that implementation of the BDGP continues to deliver for Irish suckler farmers.</p></reply>

In this case the Board&rsquo;s finding was that the applicant had a degree of disablement which did not reach the minimum required for the grant of a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts, but was eligible for consideration for the award of a gratuity under the Acts. On foot of this a gratuity of &euro;28,050 was awarded in April 2013.  The applicant appealed this award and the Board agreed to reopen its consideration of his case. My Department received a revised report from the Army Pensions Board following on from the appeal but required clarification on a number of matters. Clarification was received recently from the Board and my Department is considering this and will be writing to the applicant in the near future. I should say that in the event that a disability pension were to be awarded in this case the amount of the gratuity paid previously will be taken into account in setting the commencement date of the disability pension.</p></reply>

However, on a routine basis the Air Corps monitors and communicates with foreign military aircraft where such aircraft are flying in the airspace in the vicinity of Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, where air traffic control is provided by the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence (2015) provides that should additional funding beyond that required to maintain existing Air Corps capabilities become available, the development of a radar surveillance capability is a priority for the Air Corps. The Air Corps&rsquo; existing Pilatus PC9 aircraft provide a very limited air to air and air to ground capacity. The development of a more capable air combat intercept capability will be considered over the lifetime of the White Paper update.</p>  <p>  Separately, an inter-agency agreement between my Department, the Air Corps, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) defines how coordination is organised between civil and military authorities at the strategic, pre-tactical and tactical levels of airspace management. Coordination is achieved through the establishment of agreements and procedures in order to increase safety, airspace capacity, and to improve the efficiency and flexibility of aircraft operations. Actions in the event of an unauthorised penetration of airspace by unidentified aircraft are defined by international convention and outlined comprehensively in documentation from the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). These ICAO provisions are replicated in the relevant unit procedures and manuals of Air Traffic Services at Stations of the Irish Aviation Authority.</p>  <p>  All of the Departments and Agencies referred to above, as well as the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have primary responsibility for the internal security of the State, work closely together to ensure coordination in areas of mutual interest.  In this regard, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has overall responsibility for the development and formulation of national policy in the field of aviation security, and for aviation security obligations under all national and international legislation. The National Aviation Security Committee meets regularly, under the chairmanship of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p>  <p>  As part of its role, the IAA exercises Air Traffic Control responsibilities for an airspace of some 450,000 sq. kms comprising of both sovereign airspace and also airspace over the high seas, largely off the western seaboard. All air traffic, both civil and military, is monitored and controlled by the IAA in respect of this airspace and in line with ICAO rules it is normal practice for the IAA to be informed by the relevant State of any military flights operating in Irish controlled airspace.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the Government is briefed, as appropriate, by relevant Ministers and decisions sought as necessary on a range of issues relating to national security and this includes aviation security. In addition, the National Security Committee considers threats in a confidential manner on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that no Constitutional issues arise from the arrangements that are in place in accordance with our domestic requirements and international obligations.</p></reply>

At the request Department of Justice the National Disability Authority (NDA) facilitated consultations with the Deaf Community in Ireland to identify actions for inclusion in the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan which could make improvements in the lives of deaf people.  Submissions received as part of that process informed the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan which was published in July 2013. As part of the follow-up to that initiative, the first special themed meeting of the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group (NDSIG) focussed on the issue of Irish Sign Language on 28 November 2013.  This meeting brought together representatives of relevant Departments, the NDA, the Deaf Community and other relevant stakeholders with a view to further progressing the inclusion of actions for the Strategy in this regard. The meeting reviewed the current situation across Government Departments and their Agencies with regard to promoting recognition of Irish Sign Language, including in service provision, and provided the Deaf Community with the opportunity of presenting their experience of interaction with the Public Sector.  It also provided a useful opportunity to examine mechanisms which could promote the further use and recognition of Irish Sign Language and understand practical implications for service users.</p>  <p>  Further to this meeting, the Deaf Community prepared a report to reflect their views on key actions and priorities. This report was submitted to the then Minister of State Kathleen Lynch for consideration in May 2014 and was then circulated to Departments in November 2014 for their observations. The intention now is that the recommendations from this report will be reflected as appropriate in the new Disability Inclusion Strategy to take effect as from 1 January 2016, through the incorporation of new actions and related performance indicators and time lines.  Progress on all relevant actions will then be monitored as part of the monitoring process for the overall Inclusion Strategy. The focus therefore remains on the identification of practical mechanisms for the further promotion and recognition of Irish Sign Language with a view to promoting and supporting its use, thereby improving service delivery on the ground, rather than on legislation.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the existing supports for use of Irish Sign Language in Ireland give a level of recognition and practical measures equal to, or above that, in countries which have formally recognised sign language.</p></reply>

This humanitarian crisis is an EU issue which requires a coordinated EU response and I have made it clear to our European partners that Ireland will work closely and collaboratively with them in this regard.</p>  <p>  As part of the Government's response to the crisis, a multi-faceted approach is being adopted including the following measures:</p>  <p>  - establishing  the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and agreeing to accept up to 4,000 persons overall under the EU Resettlement and Relocation Programmes. It is expected that these numbers will be augmented by further family reunifications;</p>  <p>  - establishing a new cross-departmental Taskforce, chaired by my Department, to deal with the operational and logistical aspects of the support programme. The Taskforce is adopting a whole of Government approach and is working with NGOs, religious bodies, local authorities and the Red Cross to implement the Government's response to this crisis;</p>  <p>  - engaging with the public on their pledges of support. The Red Cross will lead this task;</p>  <p>  - establishing a network of Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres for the initial reception of those arriving under the relocation programme;</p>  <p>  - introduce the International Protection Bill as a major priority; and</p>  <p>  - providing an additional package of processing resources to deal with major increases in asylum and other immigration cases, including the relocation measure, preparation for the Single Protection application process and increased enforcement across a number of areas, including removals.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government has agreed to resettle 520 refugees displaced by the Syrian crisis under the Irish Refugee Resettlement Programme during 2015/2016. To date, 100 refugees have arrived  in Ireland from Lebanon and Jordan. 195 refugees living in Lebanon were recently approved for admission and arrangements are underway for their transfer to Ireland. A further 225 refugees will be selected in 2016 for resettlement in Ireland.</p>  <p>  With regard to the EU Relocation programme, Ireland has agreed to accept a total of 2,600 of the overall volume of 160,000 formally approved to date at the Justice and Home Affairs Council. The first group of persons to be relocated from Italy and Greece are expected to arrive later this year.</p></reply>

The vehicle for this programmatic reform is the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 which is being delivered on foot of the commitment of the Programme of the Government for National Recovery 2011-2016 to &ndash; &ldquo;establish independent regulation of the legal profession to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints&rdquo;.  Though initiated under the EU/IMF/ECB Troika Programme of 2010, the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to the Bill is reflected in the fact that it continues to be a component of the Action Plan for Jobs 2015and of the Medium Term Economic Strategy 2014-2020while also being part of the National Reform Programme 2015.</p><p>The Legal Services Regulation Bill completed its D&aacute;il Stages on 22<sup>nd</sup>April 2015. Since then, I have commenced its passage through the Seanad where it completed Second Stage on 13th May 2015. Preparations are, therefore, ongoing for Seanad Committee Stage which I would anticipate taking place in the coming weeks.  It is the Government's continued intention that the Bill be completed by the end of this year so that the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority can come into operation at the start of 2016. Work on the Bill continues on that basis including in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel. This legislative work is taking place alongside the practical planning that is necessary for the accommodation, staffing and functioning of the new  Regulatory Authority.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>An allocation of &euro;500,000 has been made under my Department's Vote this year to support the start-up of the new Authority.</p><p>I would remind the Deputy that the Bill and the historical reforms which it contains have not stood still since the Bill's initial publication. Indeed, the Bill is now much advanced and developed and comprises 158 sections spread over 13 Parts. During its passage through the D&aacute;il over 235 enhancing amendments were made. These included a series of amendments which reinforced the independence of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority in its appointment, which is to be done through nominating bodies, and in the discharge of its statutory functions. I would, therefore,  point the Deputy to the four main levers of change and reform now contained in the reinforced Bill.</p><p>Firstly, the Bill provides for a new, independent, Legal Services Regulatory Authority with responsibility for the oversight of both solicitors and barristers. While the Law Society has historically discharged the function of regulator under the Solicitors' Acts up to now, barristers have not, in the past, been subject to similar legislation.</p><p>Secondly, the Bill provides for an independent complaints system to deal with public complaints including those relating to professional misconduct. There will also be an independent Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal to deal with both legal professions thereby replacing the two separately operated Tribunals that exist at the moment. The public will now make their complaints directly to the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority and not through the professional bodies as happens at present. In addition to the Bill's formal misconduct procedures, I have now made additional provision by Government amendment for the informal resolution of more minor, consumer-type complaints such as those relating to inadequate services.</p><p>Thirdly, the Bill provides for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to legal costs in how they are charged and disclosed to clients and this regime will apply to barristers as well as to solicitors. I would point out that the Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a set of Legal Costs Principles (Schedule 1 of the Bill refers). The Bill also provides that a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will replace the existing Office of the Taxing-Master. The new Office will have a modernised and  efficient business structures, will deal with disputes about legal costs, will prepare Guidelines and maintain a public Register of its legal costs determinations. I have also made a range of technical enhancements  to the legal costs provisions of the Bill taking account of expert views received. These measures complement those cuts and savings in legal costs made across the board by State Bodies who are, in combination, the largest consumer of legal services.</p><p>Fourthly,  the Bill provides a framework for Alternative Business Models.  It facilitates new forms of legal services provision such as Legal Partnerships and, in due course, Multi-Disciplinary Practices. These take account of the emergent new business models in other common law jurisdictions and the huge advances made in business and on-line technology which might otherwise leave Ireland at a continuing competitive disadvantage. The new models will operate, by choice, alongside the existing modes of business used by legal practitioners, including small solicitors&rsquo; firms and, for barristers, the Law Library. The Deputy will wish to be aware that there were three main elements to the changes which I introduced at D&aacute;il Report Stage in relation to these new business models which are now embedded in the Bill, namely,</p><p>- A series of new provisions to strengthen the regulatory powers of the new Authority and to make additional prudential provision for any future participation in Legal Partnerships and Multi-Disciplinary Practices. These business models will also be subject to periodic review.</p><p>- Legal Partnerships, that is to say partnerships between barristers and solicitors or between barristers themselves, will be subject to a public consultation process to be completed within six months of the establishment of the new Regulatory Authority and are then to be introduced within six months of those consultations being completed.</p><p>- Multi-Disciplinary Practices, that is to say practices in which legal practitioners provide their services alongside other non-legal service providers, will now be supported by detailed research. This will focus on the likely effects which their introduction may have on competition, on the Irish legal services market and in relation to the legal professions. The findings of this research on MDPs will then inform the six-month public consultation process already envisaged under the Bill and will also be laid before the Houses. The commencement of the provisions governing Multi-Disciplinary Practices will then become a matter for the Minister following these processes and on foot of their outcomes and recommendations.</p><p>As we approach Seanad Committee Stage, I consider the Legal Services Regulation Bill to be at a very advanced stage of development having taken on board a whole range of concerns and improvements in the furtherance of legal services reform.We have, in this key piece of legislation, the wherewithal to realise the desired reforms which lie at the root of the Deputy's Question and I look forward to working with him and the Members of both Houses in the weeks ahead to bring them to early finalisation and enactment.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will know, judges are appointed by the President pursuant to Article 35 of the Constitution on the advice of the Government pursuant to Article 13.9 of the Constitution.<b><i></i></b>Such appointments are dealt with by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which was established pursuant to the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995.  Under section 16 of the Act, where a judicial office stands vacant or before a vacancy in a judicial office arises, the Advisory Board submits to me, as Minister for Justice and Equality, the names of the persons recommended for appointment.  I then bring the names to Government which decides on the person(s) to nominate to the President for appointment.  This system has operated, in accordance with the Constitution, under successive Governments since 1995, and our independent judiciary has served the country extremely well.</p><p>In this regard I was pleased to note the conclusions in the Council of Europe's Group of States against corruption  Fourth Round Evaluation report on Ireland which found the Judiciary to be among the most trusted public institutions in the country.  It is significant  that the principle of judicial independence should be recognised by an international evaluation team such as GRECO and that the independence and professionalism of our judges is undisputed.</p><p>The need to ensure and protect the principle of judicial independence was a significant factor in the consultations process on the system of judicial appointments carried out last year.  Another factor was that, while the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board process was a model of best practice in its day, almost 20 years from its establishment it was considered worthwhile to review the operation of the entire judicial appointments system to ensure it reflects current best practice, that it is open, transparent and accountable and that it promotes diversity.</p><p>There was a significant response to the call for submissions with substantive and wide-ranging views received about the legislative framework that provides for eligibility for judicial appointment and for the actual process of appointment. Arising from the consultations process, draft legislative provisions to reform and update judicial appointment procedures are being prepared by my Department and such legislation is part of the Agreed Programme for Government.  The review and reform of this area which is of critical importance to the functioning of our system of justice provides an opportunity to determine what system can best respond to the expectations and needs of a modern State.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-10-13a.454.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015101300061#WRJ03400"><p>The Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, which was passed by the D&aacute;il in April and is now before the Seanad where it will commence Committee Stage in the coming weeks, gives legislative expression to the commitment in the Programme for Government to "establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints". The Legal Services Regulation Bill is, therefore, a key component of the Government's strategy to bring greater transparency to legal costs and to reduce their burden on consumers and enterprise. Historically, legal costs matters have been obscured in legal rules, jurisprudence and practice notes which were largely out of sight to the consumer and, for that matter, to many legal practitioners. The Bill is set to codify and open up the legal costs regime to greater scrutiny while also achieving greater balance and transparency in relation to how such costs arise and are made known to the consumer.</p>  <p>  The Bill makes extensive provision, in Part 10, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime. Legal practitioners, whether solicitors or barristers, will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients. This will be in the form of a Notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions. Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in section 123 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not reasonably practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated. A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question. In addition, the Bill sets out that it will not be permissible for legal practitioners to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business and that it will no longer be permissible for barristers to charge junior counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees.</p>  <p>  An aggrieved client also has the option of applying for the taxation of disputed legal costs by the Office of the Taxing-Master.  Under the Legal Services Regulation Bill the current functions of the Taxing-Master will be taken over by the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator. The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles. These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account in the adjudication of disputed legal costs. The Bill also provides for the establishment of a public Register of Determinations which will disclose the outcomes and reasons for decisions made by the Legal Costs Adjudicator.</p>  <p>  The Bill also contains other measures that are intended to bring greater competition in relation to legal costs. For example, the Bill facilitates the introduction of Legal Partnerships, that is to say partnerships between barristers and solicitors or between barristers themselves and, in due course, of  Multi-Disciplinary Practices, that is to say practices in which legal practitioners provide their services alongside other non-legal service providers. The intention is that these new legal service models, which are already available in a number of other common law jurisdictions,  will be available alongside the Law Library and other traditional legal service structures. These new practice options will facilitate legal practitioners by removing current restrictions on the way they can deliver their services. They will facilitate consumers by providing more choice, better access and, in due course, lower costs, and they will facilitate the removal of a number of barriers to competition previously identified by the Competition Authority. They will also complement the availability of alternative dispute resolution frameworks such as those contained in existing arbitration legislation or in the proposed Mediation Bill which provide more affordable alternatives to the pursuit of court or other litigious proceedings. In a parallel reform initiative I will also be introducing legislative measures to support the introduction of pre-action protocols in relation to medical negligence cases and of periodic payment orders in relation to which draft legislation is at present under scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.</p>  <p>  Other direct measures have been taken by the Government to reduce legal costs. This has included a series of cuts and savings in legal costs that were made across the board by State Bodies who are, in combination, the largest consumer of legal services. The range of reductions made has included,</p>  <p>  - an 8% reduction to all legal fees with effect from 1 March 2009 applied to legal counsel fees in the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office; Brief and Refresher fees in the Director of Public Prosecution&rsquo;s Office; Payment of Witness Expenses; Criminal and Civil Legal Aid fees including barrister, private practitioner, medical and legal fees; and Tribunal fees,</p>  <p>  - a further 8% reduction with effect from 1 January 2010 applied to legal counsel fees in the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office; Brief and Refresher fees in the Director of Public Prosecution&rsquo;s Office; and Criminal and Civil Legal Aid fees,</p>  <p>  - a fee reduction of 10% on Criminal Legal Aid fees was applied with effect from 13 July 2011 and 1 October 2011 for District, and Circuit and Higher Courts, respectively,</p>  <p>  - a reduction of 50% in the rate paid in respect of travel and subsistence and a reduction of 50% in the rate paid for sentence fees in respect of adjourned sentence hearings in the Circuit and higher courts was applied,</p>  <p>  - in October 2011, a further 10% reduction was applied to brief and refresher fees paid by the Director of Public Prosecutions Office to reduce the level of fees in parallel with the reductions applied to fees payable under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, and</p>  <p>  - a further 10% reduction was applied to Tribunal fees on 1 March 2012.</p>  <p>  By way of a centralised Government approach to legal costs, the Deputy will also wish to be aware that, in conjunction with the appointment of a Chief Procurement Officer for the Public Service, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued a circular in July 2013 on "The Procurement of Legal Services and Managing Legal Costs" which outlines the appropriate competitive procedures that can be used in the engagement of legal services and sets out a number of approaches and tools for public bodies to use in managing legal costs.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding some evidence of an initial time lag when compared, for example, to accountants, there is an amount of statistical and anecdotal evidence pointing to downward pressures having been exerted on legal costs during the recent recession. At the same time, the National Competitiveness Council, in its "Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2014" report, has highlighted the continued need to embed structural reform in the legal services and other sectors if we are to achieve sustained economic recovery. The Council observes that, "looking to the future, further structural or policy induced changes are necessary to ensure that prices do not escalate and erode competitiveness as the Irish economy returns to stronger rates of growth".  With this in mind, I would expect that, along with those other cost reduction measures that have and continue to be introduced by the Government, the Legal Services Regulation Bill will support greater competition and choice in the provision and pricing of legal services while also supporting our future economic growth.</p></reply>

The Personal Insolvency Practitioner has important statutory responsibilities and duties under the 2012 Act, in examining a debtor&rsquo;s financial situation, providing expert independent advice  on available options, drawing up a proposal for a PIA, and negotiating it with creditors.  The PIA itself is designed to provide a fair balance between the rights of creditors and of borrowers, and includes a number of important protections for the debtor, such as legal enforceability, statutory priority for protecting the debtor staying in the family home where that is possible, protection for reasonable living expenses, and, under the Personal Insolvency Amendment Act 2015, the option of seeking review by the courts if creditors refuse  a reasonable proposal.</p>  <p>  It is where a Personal Insolvency Arrangement has been approved by the courts and has entered into force, that a creditor is restrained by the Personal Insolvency Act from seeking  to dispose of or take possession of, a property covered by the Arrangement.</p>  <p>  It is of course always possible for the owner of a principal private residence to formulate a proposal to the lender outside the scope of the Personal Insolvency Acts, and without the help of a Personal Insolvency Practitioner, if they choose to do so. Such a proposal may come into effect if it is agreed between the parties. However, it does not provide the legal protection for the parties which applies under the 2012 Act.</p></reply>

The latest figures from FRONTEX indicate that over 700,000 illegal border crossings have taken place this year though the Eastern and Central Mediterranean and Western Balkans routes.  We have all seen what this means for the lives of the people involved.  In response to the escalating crisis the European Council first met in April 2015 to set out broad guidelines on the immediate steps necessary to respond to the situation. The EU Commission brought forward proposals for implementation of a package of measures under the European Agenda on Migration in May.  This package of measures included a proposal for relocation (to alleviate pressure on the frontline States of Italy and Greece) as well as a recommendation on resettlement, proposals to strengthen FRONTEX operations in the Mediterranean, Common Security Defence  Policy (CSDP) mission and broader strategy to tackle the criminal dimension of the smuggling networks, enhanced cooperation with third countries and humanitarian and developmental aid to address the root causes.</p><p>  The European Council met again in June where the main discussion point was the Commission&rsquo;s relocation proposals. Overall the Council endorsed a three-stranded comprehensive approach to migration based on the principles of solidarity and responsibility. The first strand relates to resettlement and relocation of refugees and asylum seekers as an expression of solidarity. The second strand involves a return and readmission policy involving safe countries of origin, whereby migrants who have entered the EU illegally are returned to their country.  The third element relates to improved management of borders and enhanced cooperation with third countries<b>.</b></p><p>In July the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council agreed in principle to relocate, on a temporary and exceptional basis, up to 40,000 persons from Italy and Greece over two years and this proposal was adopted at the JHA Council on 14 September.  </p><p>A second implementation package was published by the European Commission in September. The principal proposals were to amend the Dublin Regulation to provide for a permanent relocation mechanism;  a further  temporary relocation proposal (bringing the total number of persons being relocated over the next two years to 160,000) and a proposal to amend the Asylum Procedures Directive to establish a list of safe countries of origin.  Other aspects of the package looked at the external dimension, including a Communication on this topic and the proposal for an EU Trust Fund for Africa, with a budget of &euro;1.8 billion of EU funding.</p><p>A further two extraordinary JHA Councils were held on 14<sup>th</sup>and 22<sup>nd</sup>September with agreement reached on the emergency relocation measures of a further 120,000 persons by Qualified Majority Vote (QMV). To take account of the rapidly evolving situation, 66,000 places will be allocated initially for relocation from Greece and Italy with an option to relocate the balance of 54,000 from other Member States as they come under pressure. In contrast to the position adopted on the first relocation proposal the distribution among Member States under the later proposal is mandatory.</p><p>Following the Extraordinary JHA Council, the European Council met in an informal configuration on 23 September to discuss the migration crisis again. The meeting reaffirmed the important principles underpinning EU mobility, including; the Schengen Acquis and Dublin Convention.  The Council also agreed to pledge &euro;1 billion to support refugees displaced within the region; to increase dialogue and cooperation with key transit countries such as Turkey and the Western Balkan countries and to provide additional resources for the EU agencies engaged with the crisis &ndash; FRONTEX, EASO and Europol.</p><p>I am committed to continue to work with my EU colleagues to find solutions to this crisis. Ireland has already made a significant contribution to the EU-wide response and has now formally opted into the two emergency EU relocation measures following approval by both Houses  of the Oireachtas on 1<sup>st</sup>October.  These measures form part of the Government overall response when on 10<sup>th</sup>September it approved the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and agreed to accept up to 4,000 persons under the European programmes for resettlement and relocation.</p><p>Ireland has also contributed to search and rescue efforts in the Mediterranean, via a bilateral agreement with the Italian Navy.  The LE Eithne and LE Niamh have previously been deployed to the Mediterranean, and the LE Samuel Beckett replaced the LE Niamh at the end of September.</p><p>Ireland has also provided supports to areas particularly affected by instability and conflict. By the end of 2015, a total of &euro;41 million will have been provided towards assisting those displaced as a result of the Syrian crisis, including through participation in a Regional Development and Protection Programme in the Middle East.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources.</p>  <p>  It is, of course, the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises. In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a point highlighted by the Garda Inspectorate in their third report entitled "Policing in Ireland&mdash;Looking Forward" in which they stated that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na now operates a new model of Community Policing which aims to build upon and enhance progress made so far. I fully support this renewed emphasis on Community Policing particularly in light of the priority given to this in the Programme for Government. The model is about renewing, reinvigorating and restructuring the community policing function within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver a consistent national structure to the community policing function, a more co-ordinated and efficient Garda service to the community and a spread of good practice and quality of service in community policing on a national basis.</p>  <p>  The information requested regarding the number of Garda&iacute; by rank in each Community Policing Unit in each Garda District in Dublin for the years 2013 and 2014 is currently being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy in due course.</p></reply>

Since their introduction on 28th September, 2015, the following arrangements are now in place to improve throughput and relieve the congestion in the public office that occurs at this time of the year as demand for registration increases as students return to their studies. The measures have been successful by reducing the number of persons who are required to call to the office to a minimum and on a par with the number who call at all other times of the year where no significant issues with queuing arise.</p><p>One of the key measures is that persons who are students of the colleges listed below and who are registering for the first time or seeking to renew their registrations are not required to<b></b>attend at the Public Office.  Separate arrangements are being put in place to register students of these colleges. The colleges concerned have been contacted and the arrangements communicated directly to the colleges and students involved. Students from these colleges are already being registered under the new arrangements which will see periods set aside to deal with students by arrangement. There is no need for students of these colleges to queue at Burgh Quay and no person will lose residence status or continuity of permission to remain by the application of these arrangements.  The colleges concerned are:</p><p>- Dublin City University (DCU),</p><p>- Dublin Institute of Technology and constituent colleges (DIT)</p><p>- Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland (RCSI),</p><p>- Dublin University (Trinity College),</p><p>- University College Dublin (UCD).</p><p>From 30th September, all new registrations are being be dealt with on Monday and Tuesday of each week.  Wednesday to Friday is reserved for renewal of registrations i.e. for those who have an existing GNIB registration certificate.  In addition to these measures, extra staff resources are being deployed to the GNIB to assist with the registration process.  The Public Office will operate on every Saturday in October and November; the remaining Saturday openings will be by prior arrangement only and in most cases confined to students of the above colleges. The arrangements will be kept under constant review and changed or added to as required to address the demands on the office in this peak period.</p><p>The nature of the services provided is such that it is demand led and accordingly, there are peaks and valleys in the numbers of callers at different times of the year.  For the purpose of the efficient processing of the registration of up to five hundred people who are dealt with in the peak period at this registration office every day, GNIB personnel who are employed there operate a shift system, which ensures it is open from 8am to 9pm each Monday to Thursday and 8am to 6pm each Friday (excluding bank holidays) and remains open through lunchtime.  A numbered ticket issuing system is operated at the office; priority is given in the early morning period for particular categories including those coming here to work or conduct business.  This is to minimise the amount of time persons at work are required to be away from their jobs.  In addition, the GNIB with the assistance of the Garda Press Office has recently established a Garda website notification system for the purpose of assisting persons who are required to attend at Burgh Quay for registration.  On three separate occasions during each day an announcement  is posted on the Garda Website alerting customers to the number of available tickets remaining at the Burgh Quay public office for that day.  Furthermore, those attending are advised of the approximate time that they will be dealt with, which allows them to leave the office and return later in the day, if they so wish.  A GNIB officer is also deployed to meet with each person on arrival at the office to ensure that they are in possession of all of the necessary documentation required for registration, so that unnecessary delays are avoided.</p><p>In common with the operation of immigration functions in other States, immigrants seeking to register are required to present in person at my offices.  This is necessary for establishment of identity and as an anti-fraud measure and is the practice of immigration services worldwide.  For the majority of customers the Garda National Immigration Bureau provides a <i>&lsquo;</i>same day service<i>&rsquo;</i>at its Burgh Quay office.  Currently, this office handles all registrations in the Dublin area.  At times of high demand, it is not possible, currently, to send this demand elsewhere, it has to be accommodated within the capacity of the Burgh Quay office where the necessary technical infrastructure for registration card recording, generation of registration certificates and fingerprinting exists.  Use of other buildings for this purpose is not an option because the biometric equipment and elaborate smart card production systems are not mobile and in any event has to be linked up in real-time to the Garda IT systems.</p><p>Work is underway to transfer the registration function to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS).  As part of that work new systems are being developed with the aim of reducing footfall and random arrivals to the public office by use of on-line systems and to undertake registrations renewals off-site.</p><p>I would like to acknowledge the work of the staff in the public office who diligently perform a very important function for the State.  It is one of the busiest public offices in the State dealing with, in the region of, 100,000 people every year.  The new arrangements outlined above mean that queuing is not necessary and these arrangements will be strictly enforced to ensure that they are implemented as effectively as possible.  The new arrangements are already proving effective in addressing queue times and in improving the service experience for customers in this busy period.</p></reply>

I am mindful that all complainants are anxious to know the outcome of the review of their case and every effort is being made to conclude the process.  In each case a submission will be prepared. Mr Justice Roderick Murphy will review the summary of the conclusion and the letter of notification drafted to ensure that they are a fair and accurate reflection of the recommendation.</p>  <p>  The issuing of notification letters to complainants commenced on 29 June. To date, notification letters have issued in respect of 165 cases. Letters will continue to issue to all complainants until the process is completed.</p>  <p>  I have previously assured Deputies that where further investigation is recommended by the review then that will occur.  It is my intention, on the completion of the process, to make a comprehensive statement on all the actions I have decided to take in line with the recommendations of counsel.  I understand that the general overview report from senior counsel of the panel is currently being finalised.  Once I have had an opportunity to consider it, I intend to publish it.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources.</p>  <p>  The An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Policing Plan for 2015 sets out the continued commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to pro-actively target groups and individuals engaged in serious crime in all its forms, in particular violent crime and organised criminal activity.   An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na target organised criminal groupings with all available resources. This includes operating at local and community level as well as national and international level in partnership with other policing agencies. The resources available to target the activities of Organised Criminal Groups include direct resources allocated to the Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau itself as well as indirect resources which include the services of specialist units as well as Divisional and District Drugs and Detective Units.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement operations and strategies aimed at targeting, dismantling and disrupting criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies. Multi-Disciplinary approaches are utilised to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted, including the use of the Proceeds of Crimes Legislation, including money-laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau. Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also continue to utilise the additional legislative provisions introduced by the Oireachtas in 2009 which amended the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 relating to organised crime.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda Authorities that Organised Crime is constantly evolving and new innovations in crime are continuously emerging. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na proactively participate in international seminars that assist in identifying emerging crime trends. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na participate in training through CEPOL, Interpol, Europol and actively encourage international police cooperation in the fight against organised crime.  I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are currently conducting a number of ongoing operations in cooperation with Revenue Customs, other International Law Enforcement units and are actively assisted by Europol and Interpol.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is satisfied that in addition to the considerable volume of drugs seized in recent years, it has also made a significant impact by arresting and prosecuting a number of important gang members involved in drug trafficking and other criminal activity.  They have also disrupted and dismantled a number of Organised Criminal Groups which operate drug trafficking into Ireland.  These successes by law enforcement agencies led by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been acknowledged by our international partners and Ireland has shown that it is ready, willing and able to play its part in international drug enforcement and combating organised crime.</p></reply>

To date there has been four intakes of Garda Trainees into the Garda College, giving a total intake of 400.  A further 150 recruits will enter college by year end, bringing total recruitment of Garda Trainees to 550. So far 290 of the new Garda Trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I am pleased that the budget allocation for 2016 will allow the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; in addition to the 550 that will be recruited by year end. </p>  <p>  The recruitment of additional trainee Garda is essential to renew An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to ensure the delivery of effective policing services throughout the country. With this in mind I hope to be in a position to make an announcement shortly in relation to a new recruitment campaign for 2016. </p>  <p>  As regards the impact of new members on urban and rural areas, the Deputy will appreciate that it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda Regions, Divisions and Districts.

I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that it is continuing to reduce the capacity of our prisons to align with the Inspector of Prisons recommended bed capacity of 3,982 in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.  Significant decreases in prison numbers have taken place over recent years.  The overall daily average number in custody for 2014 was 3,915 compared to 4,390 in 2011, a decrease of 10.8%. The Deputy may wish to note that the number in custody reached a peak of 4,621 on 23rd February 2011. On the 9th October 2015, there were 928 less prisoners in custody, a decrease of 20%. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government outlines the commitment of this Government to finding alternatives to custody as a means of reducing overcrowding.  We continue to ensure that violent offenders and other serious offenders serve appropriate prison sentences while at the same time switching away from prison sentences and towards less costly non-custodial options for non-violent and less serious offenders.</p>  <p>  Alternatives to custody continue to be pursued and legislation has already been passed. This includes the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 which requires the sentencing judge to consider the imposition of community service where a custodial sentence of 12 months or less is being considered. </p>  <p>  The Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014 provides that the Court imposing a fine shall take into account a person's financial circumstances. It further provides, inter alia, that where a person fails to pay a fine by the due date, the Court may make an attachment order to earnings as a means of recovering the unpaid fine. As a result of this legislation, it is expected that we will see a reduction in the number of committals to prisons on short sentences.</p>  <p>  In conjunction with the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service has continued the national roll out of the Community Return Programme, an incentivised scheme for earned temporary release under which carefully selected offenders can be granted structured temporary release in return for supervised community service. In addition to this programme, Community Support Schemes have been set up in Cork Prison, Mountjoy Campus, West Dublin Campus and Limerick Prisons, the aim of which is to reduce recidivism rates by arranging for additional support structures and provide for a more structured form of temporary release.  </p>  <p>  In tandem with efforts to reduce the numbers in custody, huge improvements have been made to prison conditions in recent years. Overcrowding has been eliminated in Mountjoy Prison and priority has been given to addressing capacity issues in Cork, Limerick and the D&oacute;chas Centre. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service Strategy Statement 2012/2015 identified the elimination of slopping out in the prison estate as a priority. A new accommodation block was opened in the Midlands Prison in December 2012. The opening of this new accommodation allowed the Prison Service to reduce the capacity of both Cork and Limerick Prison resulting in the closure of the antiquated B wing of Limerick Prison. The closure of the B wing effectively halved the number of prisoners who do not have in cell sanitation in Limerick Prison.</p>  <p>  The IPS capital programme has identified the replacement of B Division as a priority and plans are being advanced in this regard. The building programme for the Prison on completion, will replace both the A &amp;amp; B Wings with a 150 cell block and will end the practice of slopping out in Limerick Prison.</p>  <p>  All of the wings in Mountjoy Prison have been completely refurbished thereby facilitating the elimination of the practice of slopping out in the prison.  A completely new replacement prison in Cork is almost complete and will be operational in early 2016. The enabling works for the redevelopment of Limerick Prison are scheduled to begin in 2016 with the main construction phase to start in early 2017.  Significant building and refurbishment projects are also scheduled for 2016 in Castlerea Prison.</p></reply>

Phase I is for 32 weeks at the Garda College, at the end of which successful students will be attested (i.e. become members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with full police powers).  Phase II is for 65 weeks based in Garda stations, and Phase III consists of seven weeks of exam preparation, exams and assessments (total 104 weeks).  The new programme will now result in an award of a Bachelor of Arts (Level 7) in Police Studies.</p>  <p>  Approximately 14,000 training days were delivered to Garda&iacute; through the College in 2014. These training programmes include continued professional development for members. The College has excellent links with other third level institutions including University of Limerick and Waterford Institute of Technology. Recently the Garda College has obtained accreditation with the University of Limerick for its Senior Investigative Officers (S.I.O.) Programme at a level 9 Special Award. </p>  <p>  In addition, I understand An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is supporting a number of staff in managerial positions to undertake the Executive MBA with the University of Limerick commencing in autumn 2015.</p>  <p>  More generally, it is also the case that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, in its reports on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, benchmarks the performance of the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with best international policing practice.</p>  <p>  The Government Capital Plan 2016-2021 sets out the strategic objectives for investment in the Justice Sector over the life time of the plan. The substantial investment of &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles over the life time of the Plan, illustrates this Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to ensuring that the Garda fleet is modern, effective and fit-for-purpose. Funding will be provided for both regular Garda patrol vehicles as well as specialist, high-power vehicles for targeted operations.  Access to new and modern vehicles is vital in ensuring Gardai can be mobile, responsive and visible in both urban and rural communities. This investment builds on the nearly &euro;29 million invested in new Garda vehicles since 2012. So far this year 370 new Garda vehicles have come on stream and I have secured a further &euro;700,000 for the purchase of specialist vehicles to support Garda&iacute; in tackling highly mobile criminal gangs. As regards investment in Garda technology and ICT the Plan provides an additional &euro;205 million.  This will bring the overall Garda ICT funding to &euro;330 million over the lifetime of the Plan and will deliver on my commitment to progress important reforms of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on foot of last year&rsquo;s comprehensive report from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate on crime</p></reply>

These studies will allow the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service access to a comprehensive bank of data in relation to the rate of recidivism among ex-prisoners and offenders. This will help to inform future policy on the management of offenders and will facilitate the formulation of strategies aimed at reducing recidivism. The next recidivism studies are expected to be published by the end of this year.</p><p>The issue of recidivism is dealt with in the Report of the Penal Policy Review Group which I published in September 2014. The Report proposes the adoption of a penal policy with the dual purposes of punishment and rehabilitation both in the imposition and management of criminal sanctions. It identified rehabilitation and reintegration as a core principle and significant factor in reducing crime. It considers that such aims are best achieved in a non-custodial environment as far as possible. In my view, prison is not the only sanction when it comes to those convicted of lesser non-violent offences. Re-offending can also be tackled head on by imposing a supervised community sanction, with appropriate supports, which could see punishment being served, but which would also lead, not only to rehabilitation, but to a reduced risk of re-offending.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that both the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service work through a variety of programmes to address offending behaviour and to promote desistance from future criminal activity. Community Return is a scheme where carefully selected prisoners can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work. The type of work involved is intended to assist the community and the scheme is involved with a large number of charitable organisations and local community groups. The scheme represents a move away from releasing prisoners in an unstructured way. There has been a steady increase in the numbers of offenders participating in the scheme as outlined in the table beneath.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Numbers participating</th></tr><tr><td>2011 (introduced in October)</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>299</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>396</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>461</td></tr></table></p><p>Compliance rates operate at about 90% with the remainder being returned to custody to serve out their sentences in full. The scheme forms a core element of the Joint Probation Service and Probation Service Strategic Plan for 2015 to 2017. As well as allowing prisoners complete their sentence by way of performing an unpaid service to the community it has helped them to successfully reintegrate back into their community.</p><p>Tackling recidivist and prolific offending is a key focus for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the criminal justice system generally. Garda operations such as Operation Fiacla identify and target prolific offenders, including members of gangs, and arrangements are in place for the case management of such offenders so that all relevant information is co-ordinated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and available when such persons come before the courts.</p><p>The Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015 addresses issues relating to bail and sentencing for repeat burglars of dwellings. It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that this Bill will be enacted during the Autumn D&aacute;il session. The Bill emerged from a review of the criminal justice system&rsquo;s response to the problem of burglaries, which I initiated earlier this year. The review highlighted that many burglaries are committed by serial offenders. The Bill targets this cohort of repeat offenders and has the potential to significantly reduce the number of burglaries being committed.</p><p>The review identified two key problems which can be tackled by legislation. One relates to repeat offenders who are granted bail despite being charged with multiple burglaries and who often commit further burglaries while on bail. The other relates to the fact that relatively short sentences can be imposed by the courts when multiple burglary offences are taken into account.</p><p>The Bill will amend the Bail Act 1997 to provide that for the purposes of bail applications, previous convictions for domestic burglary coupled with pending charges or recent convictions shall be considered as evidence that an accused person is likely to commit further domestic burglaries. The Bill will also amend the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 to require a court which decides to impose custodial sentences for multiple burglary offences committed within a 12 month window, to impose such sentences consecutively.

Applicants for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable then to pay for legal representation.  The Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the "gravity of the charge" or "exceptional circumstances", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  The nature of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme is that it is demand led, driven by the incidence of crime, detection rates and the prosecution of cases through the courts system. </p>  <p>  In seeking to reduce the expenditure on the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, the rates of fees paid to the legal practitioners were reduced by 8% in March 2009 and by a further 8% in April, 2010. There was also a reduction of 10% in July 2011 in the fees payable in the District Court. Fees payable in the Circuit and higher courts were also decreased by 10% in October 2011 following the reduction in the fees payable by the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecution practitioners. A reduction of 50% was also applied to payments in respect of adjourned sentence hearings and travel and subsistence payments from 2011. Following these and other measures introduced in the course of 2011, a 10% reduction in expenditure was recorded in 2012 compared with 2011, down from &euro;56.1m to &euro;50.5. This was the first substantial reduction ever recorded under this Scheme and represents a fall of approximately &euro;10 million, or 16% over the peak recorded in 2009. Expenditure on the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme is monitored on an ongoing basis with a view to identifying any areas where further efficiencies may be achieved.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that a new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is currently being drafted to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Legislative provisions under consideration include provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, enable the Board to verify the means of applicants and to provide for prosecution of cases of abuse.</p>  <p>  Provision to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions must have regard to a person's rights to the presumption of innocence, to a fair trial and to be given legal aid, where appropriate.</p></reply>

Most significant is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have the permanency of organisation and structure that a subversive organisation or other more fixed group would have.  Relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid with shifting memberships, alliances and a membership which may depend on circumstance.</p>  <p>  However, criminal legislation has been updated in recent years, with a view to ensuring that it provides a comprehensive range of provisions for the prosecution and punishment of crime, in particular the activities of those involved in organised crime.</p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.  These offences include participation in a criminal organisation and directing a criminal organisation.  The latter offence specifically targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders without requiring their direct participation in the commission of criminal offences.  On conviction, this offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also makes it an offence to conspire with one or more persons to do an act that constitutes a serious offence, irrespective of whether such act actually takes place or not.</p>  <p>  Evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation were introduced aiding prosecution for the offences under the Act.</p>  <p>  Provision was also introduced so that where a serious offence is committed as part of or in furtherance of a criminal organisation, it shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining sentence.</p>  <p>  At international level, the question of how best to deal with participation in and/or directing a criminal organisation through the criminal law has been the subject of debate in the development of common international standards. Relevant international instruments to which Ireland is a party are the European Union Council Framework Decision 2008/841/JHA on the fight against organised crime and the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime.</p>  <p>  Ireland has given effect to these instruments through domestic criminal law including the legislation outlined above.</p></reply>

These programmes can offer purposeful activity to those in custody while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead law abiding lives on release.  These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.</p>  <p>  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date. Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.</p>  <p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015. There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning through Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes.</p>  <p>  As well as seeking to draw on best practice in adult and further education in the community, there has been a lot of curriculum development over the years that is specific to prison circumstances, such as courses on addiction, health issues and offending behaviour. </p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole time teacher equivalents to the Prison Service through the Education and Training Boards (ETB). Education in prisons is delivered in partnership between the ETBs and the Irish Prison Service with a focus on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and which facilitates lifelong learning. The partnership endeavours to meet the needs of students through helping them cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life after release. A broad and flexible curriculum is provided which ranges from basic literacy classes and peer led tutoring to Open University. There is an increasing focus on QQI accreditation as the modular structure best meets the needs of students in prison. </p>  <p>  Other areas where there has been significant progress in prison education are in physical education, in the provision for higher education, in the arts and in preparing prisoners for release and supporting their transition to life, and often to education, on the outside.  A top priority for the Irish Prison Service is ensuring help for those with reading and writing problems and peer mentoring programmes are currently active in all of our prisons.</p>  <p>  The guiding principles which underpin the prisons' work and training service are to make available, work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in custody.  Training activities are chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to acquire practical skills which will help them secure employment on release.  Work Training Officers have recently been appointed and assigned to areas such as catering, laundry, industrial cleaning, industrial skills and gym.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled us to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification. </p>  <p>  The manner in which records are collated does not allow us to differentiate between first-time offenders and repeat offenders.</p>  <p>  However, from the records that are available I can inform the Deputy that 38.5% (1,458 persons) of the prisoner population participated in Education activities in June.</p>  <p>  Similarly 26% (961 persons) of the average prison population engaged in vocational training in August.  It should be noted that a prisoner may participate in more than one activity.   </p></reply>

It is a feature of offending behaviour that recidivism rates decrease as the offender age increases. Research on desistance from offending has found that there are different paths to change and desistance from offending that can be prompted, implemented and supported. The community return scheme is a good example of how a structured programme of release for offenders can assist them to change by providing the opportunity to pay back to the community in the form of unpaid productive work and by providing the necessary individual supports.</p>  <p>  There is evidence to show that the right interventions at the right points of time can successfully lead to a reduction in the offending rate among young adults. Therefore the Probation Service and Irish Prison Service together with the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) have adopted a distinct policy for 18-21 year olds.  The Garda Youth Diversion programme is a successful example of diverting young people away from crime. </p>  <p>  I published the Report of the Penal Policy Review Group in early September 2014. The report proposes the adoption of a penal policy with the dual purposes of punishment and rehabilitation both in the imposition and management of criminal sanctions. The Review Group identified rehabilitation and reintegration as a core principle and significant factor in reducing crime and considered that such aims are best achieved in a non-custodial environment as far as possible.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in partnership with the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service has published a number of studies on recidivism rates for offenders who were given a community sanction or a custodial sentence in recent years.  The next recidivism studies are expected to be published before the end of this year. These studies, along with the implementation of the recommendations of the Penal Policy Review Group, will help to inform future policy on the management of offenders and will facilitate the formulation of strategies aimed at reducing recidivism.</p></reply>

This case was one of those inquired into previously by the late Mr. Justice Henry Barron and examined subsequently by a sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.</p>  <p>  I have great sympathy for the family in this case.

In summary, in the circumstances where an independent judicial inquiry had already been carried out which focused in great detail on the Garda investigation and found that it could not advance the issues to a conclusive outcome; where an Oireachtas committee had carried out an examination of these same issues, including public hearings, and found also that it could not conclusively address questions relating to the investigation; and where a public apology for identified failings in the investigation was made to the family by former Garda Commissioners and a former Justice Minister, I could not conclude that the issues relating to the Garda investigation could be addressed any more conclusively now than they have been already.</p>  <p>  I would note in addition that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carried out a full review of the original investigation and the original evidence and submitted a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions who directed that no prosecution should be brought.</p>  <p>  I regret that my decision in this case is, inevitably, a disappointment for the family.

As regards remaining ground rents, Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act 1978 contains a statutory scheme whereby the holder of a leasehold interest may, at reasonable cost, acquire the fee simple in his or her dwelling. To date, over 80,000 applicants have acquired freehold title to their property under this scheme. Comprehensive details of the manner in which the fee simple can be acquired under this scheme are available on the Property Registration Authority's website (www.prai.ie).<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>In the case of remaining ground rents, I should also add that a ground landlord is statute barred from claiming more than 6 years arrears of ground rent<b><font color="#000080">.</font></b></p><p>With regard to the abolition of ground rents, the position is that this matter was considered by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in their 2004 Report 'Private Property'. The Committee took the view that a ground landlord's ground rent is a form of property right which is constitutionally protected and that abolition of such rents would be unconstitutional in the absence of adequate monetary compensation. The Committee also noted that where leases were approaching expiry, any legislation providing for the abolition of ground rents would have to provide for the payment of enhanced compensation by the ground tenant.

In the main, these emergency situations arise out of hours. </p>  <p>  At present, out-of-hours emergency services for children at risk in the greater Dublin area are provided by Tusla through the Crisis Intervention Service (CIS). The remit of the service is to respond to crisis situations in which a child or young person requires immediate placement either due to child protection concerns or accommodation issues. The service is delivered by Tusla's social work service. </p>  <p>  Outside the greater Dublin area, a more limited Emergency Place of Safety Service (EPSS) is provided for the Agency under a commercial arrangement by Five Rivers Ireland.  Under Section 12 of the Child Care Act, 1991, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may remove a child to a place of safety where they have reasonable grounds for believing that there is an immediate risk to the health or welfare of a child.  Under the EPSS, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can access an emergency placement for such children found to be at risk out of hours. The child is placed in a family setting until the following working day, when the local social work service assumes responsibility for the case.  The intention is to expand this service so that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can consult with a social worker out of hours. This is presently not the case outside the greater Dublin area.   </p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm that Tusla is establishing the Emergency Out of Hours Service (EOHS) in 2015. The EOHS will incorporate the existing Emergency Place of Safety Service. The key objective of the service is to co-operate with and support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the execution of their duties and responsibilities under Section 12(3) of the Child Care Act, 1991.</p>  <p>  The EOHS will provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with:</p>  <p>  -  A National Call Centre which will be provided by the Crisis Intervention Service. It will provide social work consultation and advice, and will commence in Quarter 4, 2015.</p>  <p>  -  Access to a local on call social worker, if required. This service element will also commence in Quarter 4, 2015.</p>  <p>  -  Placement for children under Section 12 of the Child Care Act, 1991 using the services of a private company (Five Rivers Fostering Service).</p>  <p>  The service will be available from 6.00pm to 7.00am, 365 days a year and between 9am and 5pm every Saturday, Sunday and Bank holiday. The service will be coordinated through the National Call Centre.</p></reply>

In the region of 67,000, including  children with special needs, avail of the free pre-school provision each year.   </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to ensuring that all children have the opportunity to access and benefit from this free pre-school year and has, in addition to the HSE, made various practical efforts in recent years to support mainstreamed provision for children with special needs. These include: more flexible rules regarding access to the free pre-school year, the provision on a limited ad hoc basis by the HSE of funding towards the cost of pre-school support assistants in some areas, elective modules on special needs in mandatory courses for early years practitioners, and various initiatives by City and County Childcare Committees, HSE / HSE funded services, and by Better Start&rsquo;s Early Years Specialist Service to support providers who need expert advice and guidance. In addition, the on-going reorganisation of disability therapy services into multi-disciplinary geographic-based teams by the HSE under the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People  Programme and the early intervention and support that reconfigured teams provide is of importance in the context of mainstreaming. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, this Government recognises that co-ordination and provision of appropriate supports for pre-school children with special needs could be improved. Accordingly, when I established the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and School Age Care and Education, I included in its terms of reference the need to examine how best to provide for children with special needs within mainstream pre-school settings.</p>  <p>  To advance this, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, and Health are working together to develop a new model of supports for pre-school children with special needs.  My Department is leading the process, with full and active support from the other two Departments and their respective agencies.  </p>  <p>  An Inter-Departmental Group comprising representatives from these three Departments, the HSE, Tusla, the National Council for Special Education, the National Disability Authority, Better Start and the Dublin City Childcare Committee has completed its work and has made a cross-departmentally supported proposal for the resources required as part of the Estimates process.  </p></reply>

Tusla has been in contact with schools that operate the school completion programme to emphasise the importance of identifying and supporting children whose families are homeless.  Parents are being encouraged to share with schools their family circumstances in order that support may be provided to them. Schools have been asked to provide details of their inputs in situations where children need additional support with attendance matters and engagement in the life of the school. Tusla will, then conduct an analysis of information provided by the schools with a view to working closely with them on a coordinated approach to respond to children&rsquo;s needs.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that Tusla has assigned an additional Educational Welfare Officer to assist schools where a number of homeless children are presenting in the Dublin region.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-10-13a.645.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015101300065#WRN03200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 234, 249, 304, 321, 324, 330 and 339 together.</p><p>The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).  NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. </p><p>Immunisation is regarded as one of the safest and most cost-effective of health care interventions.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  The vaccine is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from the NIAC which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.  The vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p><p>In Ireland school based immunisation has been used successfully to vaccinate primary school children for over 30 years to protect children from vaccine preventable diseases and is now reaching the 95% vaccination rate recommended by the World Health Organisation.  Vaccinations programmes were extended to second level schools since the introduction of the human papillomavirus vaccination programme in 2010 and uptake rates have exceeded the target of 80% for a three dose course in first year girls. </p><p>The National Immunisation Office (NIO) provides and updates Guidelines annually for staff who work in the School Immunisation Programme.  The NIO continually liaises with the Department of Education in the implementation of the school vaccination programmes and the local HSE vaccination teams work very closely with the school management and staff to minimise disruption.  The school based service also provides an additional clinic service where parents can attend with children if there are difficulties with school vaccination.</p><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>is a medicinal product which has been authorised for use across the European Union since September 2006 following a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  The procedure timelines were not fast-tracked (a US term) or accelerated (the EU term).  The procedure started on 28 December 2005, a positive opinion was issued by the EMA's scientific committee on 7 July 2006, and a marketing authorisation was issued by the Commission on 20 September 2006.  Allowing for the time period taken by the applicant for responses, the time between start of the procedure and the scientific committee's opinion was 190 days.</p><p>While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  This is done by both monitoring of individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe (including the HPRA) and Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (i.e. license holder) for the vaccine on a regular basis.</p><p>Up to the 11 September 2015, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 901 reports of suspected adverse reactions/events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines (Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>899 and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>2). The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA regarding both Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and Cervarix vaccines to date have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information. Vaccination related events, occurring at the time of vaccine administration, such as syncope (faints) has been among the most commonly reported effects.  Other commonly reported symptoms include gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, headache, dizziness and injection site reactions.  Reports of allergic-type reactions including skin rashes, urticaria and flushing have also been received, including isolated reports of more severe hypersensitivity-type reactions.</p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting ().  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.  All reports received through the online reporting options receive an acknowledgement and case record number on successful submission of a report.  Further information is provided to reporters in respect of any questions/concerns reflected in their reports, in the context of report follow up.  In accordance with its reporting obligations, the HPRA provides anonymised details of reports received to the EMA, the World Health Organisation and to the marketing authorisation (i.e. licence) holder for the medicine.</p><p>The EMA has commenced a review of the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine &quot;<i>to further clarify aspects of their safety profile</i>,&quot; although the agency points out that this review &quot;<i>does not question that the benefits of HPV vaccines outweigh their risks</i>.&quot;  The review is specifically focusing on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  Recommendations from the first stage of this review are expected in November.  The agency also notes that while the review is being carried out, no change in the use of these products is recommended.</p><p>In addition the EMA is currently evaluating data from a on the safety of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines, Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>.  The study conducted jointly by the French medicines agency (ANSM) and the French national health insurance fund (CNAMTS) compared the incidence of autoimmune conditions in girls given HPV vaccines with the incidence in girls not given the vaccines.  In the meantime, the EMA have advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of these vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>in accordance with the current product information.</p><p>It has been confirmed by the Danish authorities that they continue to offer HPV vaccination to 12 year old girls as part of the Danish child immunisation programme.</p></reply>

When first authorised for use in Ireland in 1983, Roaccutane was authorised for the management of cystic or conglobate forms of acne vulgaris, or for use in cases of severe acne which have failed to respond to adequate courses of accepted therapy. </p>  <p>  Information is not collected in relation to the clinical condition for which a drug is prescribed in individual cases.  In relation to Roaccutane the only available information relates to the number of prescriptions dispensed under the GMS and Community Drugs Schemes.  This information was provided to the Deputy by the HSE in response to a previous parliamentary question (Ref no. 33338/15).</p>  <p>  The information breakdown held by the HPRA that the Deputy refers to is the breakdown of reported adverse reactions notified to the HPRA and I understand that the HPRA has provided this breakdown directly to the Deputy.  Of the five cases where Roaccutane was used for an unknown indication, the HPRA made efforts to obtain this information from the person reporting the adverse reaction but such information was not forthcoming.</p>  <p>  European and Irish legislation provides for ongoing monitoring of the benefits and risks of medicines through a system known as pharmacovigilance.   This monitoring includes review and evaluation of suspected adverse reaction reports at National and EU level.  The national regulatory medicines authorities (in Ireland the HPRA) in each EU Member State are responsible for gathering and evaluating national adverse reaction reports and in turn submitting these reports to the European Medicines Agency, which is responsible for the overall co-ordination of pharmacovigilance activities across the EU.</p>  <p>  In accordance with European and national legislation, marketing authorisation holders (manufacturers) are legally obliged to notify all suspected serious adverse reactions in Ireland (reported either by a healthcare professional or a patient) to the HPRA within 15 days of first notification of the company.  Reporting of suspected adverse reactions by health professionals and patients is undertaken on a voluntary basis across the EU with all health professionals strongly encouraged to report any suspected adverse reaction.  International data indicates that Ireland has a high rate of reporting and the HPRA regularly reminds health care professionals about reporting in its Drugs Safety Newsletter. </p>  <p>  In previous replies to the Deputy I have provided detailed information on the authorisation process for a medicine and the safety monitoring process once the medicine is placed on the market.  Before it can be made available to patients a medicine must meet predefined standards of quality, safety and efficacy and approval is given on the basis of a favourable benefit versus risk balance for a specific indication. </p>  <p>  There is in addition extensive pharmacovigilance legislation which monitors the medicine&rsquo;s safety once it is in use to ensure that risks can be promptly identified and managed so that harm is prevented.  Reporting of suspected adverse reactions is only one of a number of ways of identifying new adverse reactions.  However individual reports of suspected adverse reactions alone are rarely sufficient to confirm that a certain reaction is caused by the medicine in question.  Other factors such as the extent and conditions of use of the medicine, the nature of the reaction, the condition being treated, any new conditions arising and other medicines taken by the patient have all to be taken into account. Further data is usually required, including worldwide spontaneous case reports, clinical trials and epidemiological studies, to confirm the reactions and help determine their significance. </p>  <p>  A review of Roacccutane across the EU took place in 2011 when further warnings regarding skin reactions were added to the product information for patients and their doctors.  The risk of depression associated with Roaccutane was also reviewed at that time.  However it was concluded on the basis of all the available evidence that the existing monitoring requirements provided on the product information is sufficient.</p>  <p>  In conclusion therefore no medicine is without risk but the extensive authorisation and monitoring process in place across the EU ensures that risks are identified and managed.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will have previously received from the HPRA a copy of the current product information.  I am arranging to forward the Deputy a copy of the original product authorisation from 1983. Following authorisation any change (e.g. new indications, updated safety information, product changes) require approval on foot of a formal application to vary the authorisation and the submission of relevant supporting data. In practice product information changes frequently.  Information relating to all these the changes is not readily available in the HPRA and will entail detailed searches through archived material.</p>  <p>  However the HPRA is happy to meet the Deputy to discuss his information requirements further and will be communicating directly with the Deputy in coming days to arrange a meeting. </p>  <p>  Since it was first authorised for use in Ireland, Roaccutane has been contraindicated in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.  An EU wide Pregnancy Prevention Plan (PPP) was introduced in October 2003 to further reduce the potential risk of pregnancy in women. The Plan consists of key educational information on the risks of treatment and specific criteria for managing therapy in women of child-bearing potential.  I am arranging to send the Deputy copies of material distributed by the marketing authorisation holder for use by prescribing doctors, pharmacists, other relevant healthcare professionals and patients, including a checklist for prescribing to female patients. </p>  <p>  In addition the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003 were amended in 2005 to introduce restrictions on certain medicines containing Isotretinoin.  Regulation 7(9) of the Regulations provides that the prescription of a medicine containing Isotretinoin which is intended for the treatment of a woman of childbearing potential, shall not be dispensed later than seven days after the date on the prescription and the treatment shall not exceed a period of thirty days.</p>  <p>  While the legislation does not restrict the type of medical practitioner that can prescribe Isotretinoin, the product&rsquo;s product information (SmPC) requires that the product should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of physicians with expertise in the use of systemic retinoids for the treatment of severe acne and a full understanding of the risks of isotretinoin therapy and monitoring requirements.</p></reply>

This delivers on a commitment in the Programme for Government to develop a national Alzheimer's and other dementia's strategy to increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention and develop enhanced community based services.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have agreed a joint initiative with the Atlantic Philanthropies to implement significant elements of the Strategy over the period 2014-2017. This National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme will represent a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m, and the HSE contributing &euro;15.5m.</p>  <p>  This programme will promote a greater focus on timely diagnosis of dementia and on the value of early intervention, along with the long-term objective of  making people in Ireland generally more aware and understanding of the needs of people with dementia, and of the contribution that those with dementia continue to make to our society.</p>  <p>  Key elements of the initiative include:</p>  <p>  -  the roll-out of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Home-care Packages for people with dementia;</p>  <p>  -  the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GP's, who are the critical and initial point of contact with the health system for those with dementia.  The resource material will include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points.etc;</p>  <p>  -  Measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia.</p>  <p>  A Monitoring Group, chaired by the Department of Health, has been established to assist with and advise on implementation of the National Dementia Strategy, including the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme. This Group includes health professionals, administrators, researchers and advocates. The Group also includes a person living with dementia and a representative of those who care for people with dementia.  The most recent meeting of this Monitoring  Group was held on 24 September 2015.</p>  <p>  As the delivery of dementia services is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

Those S.I.s ensure full conformity with the Directive and its aims of ensuring EU citizens may access safe and good quality healthcare across EU borders. </p>  <p>  The measures employed by the HSE ensure Irish patients who seek to have healthcare abroad under the terms of the Directive are assisted with access to the information they need to make an informed choice, and following any episode of healthcare abroad in line with the Directive, they are promptly reimbursed for the cost of the healthcare upon return to Ireland. I am satisfied that the measures in place in respect of the application procedures are proportionate and do not constitute an unjustified obstacle to the free movement of patients. Furthermore, I consider the prior authorisation process provides patients seeking hospital care which requires overnight accommodation with an assurance on the level of reimbursement they will receive.</p>  <p>  The HSE, in producing its website, including the pages relevant to this Directive, works at all times to use plain, understandable English, particularly in areas of the site that describe services for the public. This is with a view that the website is understandable to all. My Department and the HSE will keep the information provided on the Directive pages under regular review, as would be the case in respect of any new scheme, and will update them as required based on experience and feedback received. My Department has discussed the matters raised by the Deputies with the HSE and any updates required to those webpages will be promptly implemented. </p>  <p>  The phone line provided for this scheme, 056 7784546, is constantly manned during working hours. Due to a high level of interest in this scheme, the number of calls can exceed the number of available personnel and on those occasions there may be a delay in calls being answered.</p></reply>

These include homes that provide a 24/7, 365 days a year service and community based models which are staffed for certain parts of the evening, night and weekends.  Residential services are provided by over 60 agencies.   Residential settings vary in size from large congregated settings defined as 10 or more bedded facilities to community group homes to supported independent living.  </p>  <p>  In community group homes, the model of care is based on providing a family type residence with a house parent who sleeps over in the house but is very rarely required to be active during the night.   The rate of payment for the sleepover has been determined by the Labour Court Recommendation 20837 which states that &lsquo;Having regard to all the circumstances currently prevailing, the Court recommends that, with effect from the date of this Recommendation, staff should be paid an hourly rate in respect of each hour spent on sleepover in excess of 39 hours equal to the national minimum hourly rate.&rsquo;</p>  <p>  The European Working Time Directive (EWTD) provides that workers shall not be required to work in excess of 48 hours per week.  It is currently not clear what proportion of these staff are compliant with the EWTD.  However this is being addressed by a data collection exercise which the HSE has commenced.   Using the results of the data collection exercise, the HSE will draw up an EWTD compliance plan for the disability sector for approval by my Department.  This plan will establish clearly what the overall level of compliance is within the disability services and will set out a timeline for compliance with the EWTD.</p></reply>

Both chief negotiators confirmed after the 7th Round of negotiations that no commitments will be taken on public services.</p><p>On the 20 March 2015, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m and the US Trade Representative Michael Froman confirmed in a joint statement that trade agreements do not prevent governments from providing or supporting services in areas such as water, education, health, and social services.  On the 8 July 2015, the European Parliament adopted a resolution which built on this statement to exclude current and future Services of General Interest as well as Services of General Economic Interest from the scope of application of TTIP.  This includes but is not limited to water, health, social services, social security systems and education, to ensure that national authorities retain the right to introduce, adopt, maintain or repeal any measures with regards to the commissioning, organisation, funding and provision of public services as provided in the Treaties as well as in the EU's negotiating mandate.  The resolution also stated that this exclusion should apply irrespective of how the services are provided and funded.</p><p>On the 16 September 2015, the European Commission published the text of its proposal for the Investment Chapter of TTIP.  It will be presented as the EU text proposal in the EU-US trade talks following consultation with the Council and discussion with the European Parliament.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (DJEI) informs my Department that the proposal states that the right to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives such as the protection of public health is preserved; the proposal also clarifies that investment protection provisions shall not be interpreted as a commitment from governments not to change their legal framework, including in a manner that may negatively affect the investor&rsquo;s expectations of profits.  </p><p>DJEI leads on the negotiations for Ireland and liaises with the EU Commission as appropriate. DJEI commissioned Copenhagen Economics to prepare a report on TTIP and its impact in Ireland.  This report is available on the Department's website. </p><p>As negotiations progress my Department continues to liaise with DJEI to consider potential impacts for the health sector.  </p><p>I welcome the views of stakeholders in the interests of assessing the potential implications of TTIP for health.</p></reply>

This delivers on an a commitment in the Programme for Government to develop a national Alzheimer's and other dementia's strategy to increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention and develop enhanced community based services.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that there are approximately 50,000 people with dementia in Ireland today.  These numbers are expected to increase to over 140,000 by 2041 as the number of older people in Ireland increases.  The Strategy emphasises that most people with dementia live in their own communities and can continue to live well and to participate in those communities for far longer than many people appreciate.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have agreed a joint initiative with the Atlantic Philanthropies to implement significant elements of the Strategy over the period 2014-2017.  This National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme will represent a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m, and the HSE contributing &euro;15.5m.</p>  <p>  This programme will promote a greater focus on timely diagnosis of dementia and on the value of early intervention, along with the long-term objective of making people in Ireland generally more aware and understanding of the needs of people with dementia, and of the contribution that those with dementia continue to make to our society.</p>  <p>  Key elements of the initiative include:</p>  <p>  -	the roll-out of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Home-care Packages for people with dementia;</p>  <p>  -	the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GP's, who are the critical and initial point of contact with the health system for those with dementia.  The resource material will include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points.etc;</p>  <p>  -	Measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia.</p>  <p>  A Monitoring Group, chaired by the Department of Health, has been established to assist with and advise on implementation of the National Dementia Strategy, including the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme.  This Group includes health professionals, administrators, researchers and advocates.  The Group also includes a person living with dementia and a representative of those who care for people with dementia.  The most recent meeting of this Monitoring  Group was held on 24 September 2015.</p></reply>

This National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme will represent a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m, and the HSE contributing &euro;15.5m.  </p>  <p>  This programme will promote a greater focus on timely diagnosis of dementia and on the value of early intervention, along with the long-term objective of  making people in Ireland generally more aware and understanding of the needs of people with dementia, and of the contribution that those with dementia continue to make to our society.  </p>  <p>  Key elements of the initiative include:</p>  <p>  -	the roll-out of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Home-care Packages for people with dementia;</p>  <p>  -	the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, who are the critical and initial point of contact with the health system for those with dementia.  The resource material will include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points.etc;</p>  <p>  -	Measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia. </p>  <p>  A Monitoring Group, chaired by the Department of Health, has been established to assist with and advise on implementation of the National Dementia Strategy, including the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme.  This Group includes health professionals, administrators, researchers and advocates.  The Group also includes a person living with dementia and a representative of those who care for people with dementia.  The most recent meeting of this Monitoring  Group was held on 24 September 2015.  </p>  <p>  As the delivery of dementia specific intensive home care packages is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

This additional funding came on top of measures already taken in Budget 2015, when the Government provided &euro;25 million to support services that provide alternatives to, and relieve pressure on, acute hospitals.  Further additional funding of &euro;18m was provided in July for a winter initiative which includes the provision of approximately 300 additional hospital beds.</p>  <p>  The Director General of the HSE will co-chair the ED Taskforce Implementation Group from now until March 2016.  He has taken this decision in order to ensure that all relevant parts of the health services, including acute, social and primary care, are optimising resources in order to deal with the particular challenges associated with the winter months.  A meeting of the Implementation Group took place on 12 October.</p></reply>

Additional funding of &euro;12 million, was allocated by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to meet the needs of around 1,400 young people who require continuing health-funded supports on leaving school or rehabilitative training this year, of which &euro;6 million has been made available to provide services from September.</p>  <p>  Finding the resources and the physical capacity to meet the needs of a growing number of new service users every year is a challenging task.  When this year&rsquo;s support requirements were identified, the cost of meeting those needs in full exceeded the amount available, therefore, an additional &euro;1.5 million was added by the HSE to the overall allocation, making a total of &euro;13.5 million full-year costs available to meet those needs.  A further &euro;1.5 million once-off capital funding was also allocated by the HSE for the provision of suitable buildings, premises and accommodation.</p>  <p>  In January 2015, a National Project Group was established by the HSE to develop and oversee a national process to responding to the needs of these young people and to ensure a consistent approach is taken across the country to meeting those needs.  This initially involved identifying all individuals who would require a day service in 2015.  Once individuals were identified and their individualised needs were assessed, the capacity of the existing services to meet those needs was determined.  It was not until this process was completed that the number, location and type of additional support needs and resources could be finalised.  </p>  <p>  The approach adopted by the National Project Group from the outset was that a cost banding structure would be developed to inform the allocation of the available funds.  The costing bands were then applied to the identified need in each of the county&rsquo;s nine regions so that a nationally consistent approach would be applied, which was needs-based as opposed to population-based.  Based on this cost-band structure, five support levels were identified and the following amounts were allocated for new placements at each support level: intensive support (&euro;34,000); high (&euro;16,000); moderate (&euro;11,000); low (&euro;7,000) and minimum (&euro;5,000).  Most of the placements for those who had applied to attend Gheel Autism Services are in the intensive support category.</p>  <p>  I understand from the HSE that most young people have been offered a placement from September which meets their needs.  Only a small minority of placements remain to be finalised.  In relation to the individuals that had applied to Gheel Autism Services, the HSE indicated that there would be an allocation of &euro;708,000 made available to Gheel to provide the model of day service that they had developed and once off capital funding of &euro;80,000.  However, following extensive negotiations with Gheel, it was established that the placements for these individuals cannot be delivered by Gheel within this allocation.  The HSE has initiated discussions with two alternative service providers who already provide quality day services to young people with autism and these providers have agreed to develop appropriate service responses for these young people.</p>  <p>  Over the coming weeks the HSE will continue to actively work with these service providers and families until placements are finalised for all young people at this important transition point in their lives and they will ensure that resources available for specialist disability services are used in the most effective manner possible.</p></reply>

The objective of this scheme is to support early learning in a formal setting in advance of starting school.  I understand that certain flexibilities are built into the scheme in an effort to accommodate children with special needs, such as an overage exemption, or waiver, for children with special needs who do not meet the age criteria and the option to avail of the free pre-school year over two years.  </p><p>The Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year.  However, the HSE does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.</p><p>The <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>children and young people's policy framework that has been developed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs contains a commitment to develop a plan for the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school and early years settings.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has lead responsibility for the implementation of this commitment and has recently concluded an intensive process of deliberation and consultation on the matter in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Education and Skills.  Work is ongoing to develop an appropriate model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with special needs in the ECCE Programme.</p><p>Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case he has highlighted.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

That strategy is based on two clear objectives: firstly to see this individual released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland and, secondly, to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention.</p>  <p>  Any decision to release this individual will ultimately be taken by the Egyptian authorities and given that the trial is ongoing, the Government must exercise restraint in its public comments.  However, I can say that the Egyptian authorities are in no doubt about our position and we are keeping channels of communication with them open and sustained. I have raised the case on a number of occasions with my Egyptian counterpart and the Taoiseach discussed it with President Al-Sisi when they met in New York in late September.  It is, however, clear that the Egyptian government position remains that the judicial process must be permitted to take its course.</p>  <p>  While the further adjournment of the trial on 4 October was a disappointment, the Government's considered view, supported by decades of diplomatic experience in other consular cases and extensive consultation with states which have had citizens in similar circumstances, remains that the firm, measured and sustained diplomatic approach we are taking continues to be our best hope to return this citizen to Ireland at the earliest possible date. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, we continue to review our approach in line with developments and retain the flexibility to adjust it as and when that may be required.</p></reply>

The more violent conflicts elsewhere in the region have somewhat masked the continual rise in tension and in localized violence in East Jerusalem over more than a year.  The main factors are the operation of policies on the ground intended to push Palestinians out of Jerusalem in favour of settlers, the absence of any political process or perspective which might promise an end to this situation, and among Palestinians the consequent loss of authority by political leaders and belief in a political path.  To this has been added in recent months a reckless and provocative challenge by minority elements in Israel to the long respected status quo of the holy places in Jerusalem.</p>  <p>  This is a very dangerous combination of negative factors, and the issue of the holy places has caused deep offence and concern also in the wider Arab world.</p>  <p>  In common with others, I deplore any resort to violent attacks on civilians, be they prompted by despair or revenge.  It is the job of local leaders, on all sides, to go beyond this, and beyond a mere security response, and to address the underlying issues.  I again urge all sides to refrain from any provocative actions, and call on Israel to make clear &ndash; in practice as well as words &ndash; that the status quo on the Temple Mount or Haram al Sharif will be restored and respected.  I note that President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu have already taken some steps in this direction, and I encourage them to continue.</p>  <p>  More broadly, these events underline the message I have conveyed at international level since I took office.  Political leadership, including from the international community, needs to address the problems of the relentless expansion of settlements and the absence of any process aiming at the end of the occupation.</p></reply>

I launched a special anniversary exhibition on Ireland&rsquo;s First Years at the United Nations (1955-1957), which then went on display at UNHQ and will be officially launched in Dublin in December.  This exhibition is part of a wider programme of events and projects planned to mark the 60th anniversary.</p>  <p>  My meeting with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon recalled his visit to Ireland in May of this year.  The Secretary General referred in particular to Ireland's role in co-facilitating the newly agreed Sustainable Development Goals and the ongoing contribution of Irish staff to the work of the UN.  We also discussed the current migration crisis and Ireland's commitment to UN peacekeeping operations.</p>  <p>  I also attended a number of high-level events, including a Summit on UN Peacekeeping Operations convened by President Obama, a meeting with EU Foreign Ministers during which the Syria crisis and Middle East Peace Process were discussed, a meeting convened jointly by the EU and Jordan on the humanitarian consequences of the Syria crisis, an event hosted by my Finnish counterpart on the post-2015 Agenda and an event on countering terrorism and violent extremism hosted by President Obama.  I participated in an awareness-  raising event around nuclear disarmament with my counterparts from South Africa, Mexico and Austria.  Participation in these events created valuable opportunities to advance Irish priorities across the areas of peace, security, development and human rights, the pillars of the United Nations.</p>  <p>  During my meeting with Mr. Juan Carlos Alurralde, Bolivia's Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, we discussed the Michael Dwyer case and also the potential to further develop bilateral relations between Ireland and Bolivia.</p>  <p>  I also met with Mr. Malmierca Diaz, Minister of Foreign Trade of Cuba.  We discussed recent developments in US-Cuban relations as well as the ongoing changes to the enterprise regime in Cuba.  We also touched on the potential for greater cultural, political and professional exchanges between our two countries.</p>  <p>  In my meeting with Mr. Gebran Bassil, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lebanon, we discussed Ireland's recently passed Marriage Equality Referendum and our engagement with the Irish diaspora.  We also discussed Ireland's support for UN peacekeeping, including UNIFIL in Lebanon and the ongoing migration crisis in the Middle East, resulting from the Syrian conflict  .</p>  <p>  When I met Mr. Oldemiro Julio Marques Baloi, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Mozambique, we discussed recent violent incidents in Manica Province as well as the prognosis for the Mozambican peace process.  We touched on bilateral cooperation in the areas of agriculture, health and energy as well as the support provided through Irish Aid to Mozambique.</p>  <p>  With Mr. Murray McCully, Minister of Foreign Affairs of New Zealand, we discussed Ireland's economic recovery, the UN and New Zealand's relations with the EU.  I also discussed with Mr. McCully the scope for cooperation between the agricultural sectors of our countries.</p>  <p>  In my meeting with Mr. Riyad al-Maliki, the Palestinian Minister of Foreign Affairs, we discussed the current situation in Jerusalem, and the issue of international recognition of Palestine.  Mr. al-Maliki also provided an update in terms of the progress that has been made towards hosting Palestinian elections.</p>  <p>  My meeting with Ms. Victoria Nuland, US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs focused principally on the Northern Ireland Peace Process, with bilateral and international issues also being discussed.</p></reply>

The Conclusions call for the early, full and effective implementation of the peace agreement and commit the European Union to stepping up our engagement in support of its implementation.  </p>  <p>  The implementation of the South Sudan Peace Agreement will be complex and challenging.  The European Union will enhance its support to the peace process, including through participation in, and the provision of financial support for, the transitional institutions.  A sound transitional process will be essential to rebuild the country. </p>  <p>  The civil war which broke out in South Sudan in December 2013 resulted in the displacement of 2 million people, with evidence of murder, torture, looting and sexual violence perpetrated by both sides.  The EU will work to pursue that the Commission of Inquiry reports are published and that the necessary steps to establish the Hybrid Court of South Sudan will be taken to ensure accountability for crimes committed by both sides during the conflict.  Justice and accountability are crucial elements for sustainable peace and stability. </p>  <p>  The Council Conclusions also draw attention to the disastrous humanitarian situation in South Sudan and call for full and unconditional humanitarian access.  Security conditions in South Sudan remain volatile with sporadic fighting being reported across the country.  More than 4 million people are suffering from acute hunger and one in three children are severely malnourished. </p>  <p>  Since December 2013, Ireland has provided &euro;16.7 million to support UN agencies, as well as international and national NGOs, in their life saving work in South Sudan and the region.  We are committed to continuing Ireland&rsquo;s support.  Last week I approved an additional &euro;2 million in humanitarian funding for South Sudan. </p>  <p>  I am confident that this additional funding will assist in alleviating suffering in South Sudan, though I remain acutely aware that this is a humanitarian situation which we need to continue to address, together with EU and other partners, in the months and years ahead.</p></reply>

We attach great importance to combating all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.  Ireland is deeply concerned by the persecution of Christians, and officials in my Department have conveyed our concern in this regard to the Embassy of Pakistan.   Ireland and the EU consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including at the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Human Rights Council, of which Ireland is currently a member.  Ireland reiterated its commitment to defending the right to freedom of religion or belief during a UN Security Council debate on 27 March 2015.  I personally highlighted the issue when I addressed the UN Human Rights Council at its 28th session in March 2015, and at the UN General Assembly in New York on 1 October 2015.  I also raised it during my meetings with the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, in September 2014 and May 2015.  </p>  <p>  During Pakistan&rsquo;s last Universal Periodic Review, Ireland also raised the issue of freedom of religion and belief, recommending that Pakistan &ldquo;take all appropriate measures to combat and prevent discrimination against children belonging to religious or other minority groups, including by removing educational material which could serve to perpetuate discrimination.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Ireland also works within and alongside the EU to address the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013.  These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected. </p>  <p>  The EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Mr. Stavros Lambrinidis visited Pakistan in October 2014 where he held an in depth dialogue with the Pakistan authorities on key human rights issues. He also discussed the importance of implementing domestic laws to address major human rights challenges, including freedom of religion and belief.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to raise the issue of the persecution of Christians, through its official bilateral contacts with other countries, including Pakistan, stressing the responsibility of governments to protect all citizens and minorities, irrespective of their religion or belief.</p></reply>

ISIS has boasted of its use of murder, torture, mass sexual violence and forced religious conversions in areas under its control.  Ireland has publicly condemned ISIS and other terrorist groups at the United Nations, including at the recent Human Rights Council session.   I note that the High Commissioner for Human Rights concluded in his March 2015 report that, subject to a determination by an independent and competent court, ISIS may have committed war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.  We echo his call that, in order to provide accountability and justice for the victims, all crimes are investigated in line with international human rights standards, and perpetrators are brought to justice.</p></reply>

I then visited the Irish Famine Memorial in Battery Park and heard of plans to assure its long term sustainability. Given the importance of trade promotion,<i></i>on 29 September I addressed an audience of 150 international financial services professionals at a joint Enterprise Ireland/BNY Mellon showcase event.</p><p>Six Irish companies took part in the event, which allowed them to interact with the key influencers, investors and buyers of payment technology in the North American market, while also helping to create awareness of Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in this sector. </p><p>In Washington on 30 September, I met with key Democratic and Republican contacts on Capitol Hill, including Congressmen Joseph Kennedy III, Paul Ryan, James Sensenbrenner, Richard Neal and other members of the Congressional Friends of Ireland group, and also with Senator Patrick Leahy.  The main focus of our discussions was on developments on the Northern Ireland peace process and on the prospects for immigration reform.  On foot of these meetings, a Bill has now been tabled by Congressman Sensenbrenner in the US House of Representatives, which aims to provide access to several thousand E3 visas for Irish citizens.  I warmly welcome this positive step towards meeting the desire of many Irish people to live and work in the US for a time, but would also point out that there is a great deal of work to be done in both Houses of Congress before this Bill might become law.  I am also aware that while this particular measure would help with our objective of securing improved legal migration channels, it would not address the concerns of undocumented citizens currently in the US.  These remain a key priority for this government and continue to be the subject of our ongoing contacts with the US authorities. </p><p>At a lunch hosted by Ambassador Anderson I had a productive exchange on Northern Ireland with a number of Irish-Americans and friends of Ireland with a long-standing interest and involvement in the peace process. I also met with a senior representative of Vice President Biden&rsquo;s staff and later that day addressed a special event on Capitol Hill to highlight the work of the International Fund for Ireland (IFI).</p><p>Back in New York, on 1 October, I met over a working breakfast with leading figures from the Irish-American community in New York.  I briefed them on the latest developments in Northern Ireland, the prospects for U.S. immigration reform, developments on the Irish economy and the upcoming 2016 commemorations.</p><p>There was a lively and useful exchange on some of these topics.After the breakfast, I presented the inaugural W.B. Yeats Emerging Playwright Competition award and launched the inaugural Frank McCourt Scholarship, both initiatives supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which are designed to recognise and celebrate Irish culture in the United States.  I then met with some of the Board of the New York Irish Arts Centre to be briefed on progress on their major redevelopment project, which will see a new state of the art facility developed as a showcase for Irish culture in New York.  Ireland has provided $4.65 million towards the expected capital costs of the project of $62 million.</p><p>Finally I had a meeting with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, Ms. Victoria Nuland, to discuss developments in Northern Ireland.  Some international and bilateral issues, including in particular our concerns about proposed changes to the J1 programme, were also discussed with Ms. Nuland.</p></reply>

In June, the Foreign Affairs Council extended the duration of the economic sanctions until 31 January 2016.In response to Western sanctions, President Putin signed an order in August 2014 banning the import of a range of food and agricultural products from the EU, Norway, Australia, Canada and US.  The Presidential ban was initially fixed for one year. However, in June it was extended for a further year to August 2016.    In 2014, the value of Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral trade with Russia stood at &euro;948 million, comprising exports of &euro;722 million and imports of &euro;226 million.  This was an increase of &euro;169 million on the previous year. However, the figure for exports in 2014 included a once-off order for fertilizer products valued at over &euro;150 million and this had the effect of distorting the overall exports performance for the year.    </p>  <p>  In the first seven months of 2015, bilateral trade with Russia has fallen significantly.  Between January and July, the value of exports to Russia reduced from &euro;508 million to &euro;217 million compared to the same period last year.  This represents a drop of 57%.  At the same time, imports from Russia fell from &euro;155 million to &euro;119 million, a drop of 23% on the corresponding period in 2014. </p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons for the sharp drop in bilateral trade with Russia in the year to date. EU sanctions and, in particular, Russian retaliatory measures are clearly having a negative impact on trade flows. However, this does not capture the full picture as there are a number of other factors which have contributed in no small way to the current reduction in trade.  These include the dramatic decline in the value of the rouble, the fall in oil prices, the economic downturn in Russia, negative investor sentiment towards the Russian market and a ban on pork products from the EU following an outbreak of African Swine Fever in a number of  EU states in Eastern Europe.  The decline in the value of the rouble is particularly striking, resulting in the cost of imports to Russia almost doubling in the past year.       </p>  <p>  Despite the challenging environment, the Embassy in Moscow, together with the state agencies, remains focused on raising awareness of Ireland as an attractive investment location and continues to support Irish companies present in Russia and those seeking to explore new market opportunities there.       </p>  <p>  The EU sanctions were imposed on Russia in response to its aggressive actions in Ukraine and with the clear aim of encouraging a change in its behaviour towards its neighbour.  They are clearly having an effect on Russia&rsquo;s economy and they remain a key element of the EU&rsquo;s approach to the conflict in Ukraine.  The measures can be strengthened or eased in light of developments on the ground and progress made towards the objectives set by the EU when they were put in place. </p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that the restrictive measures against Russia, coupled with open dialogue and continued political and diplomatic engagement with the various sides involved in the conflict, offer the best way of creating the conditions for a peaceful resolution of the crisis.</p></reply>

The Project's purposes were to provide information sessions for the public around deaf awareness and sign language training for tutors and for the public.</p>  <p>  Donegal ETB formed part of a project board, established with representatives from Catholic Maintained Schools/Western Education and Library Board (CCMS/WELB) to consider the potential for a pilot cross-border education project involving St Mary's High School, Brollagh and post-primary schools in Donegal.</p>  <p>  Donegal ETB has worked with the Western Education and Library Board, Omagh, as part of a project examining cross-border student flows involving the Department of Education and Skills, Letterkenny IT (LYIT), SOLAS, and HEA.  Also, Donegal ETB informally facilitated a Cross Border ICT Sharing Group with counterparts in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Cavan and Monaghan Education and Training Board has a Memorandum of Understanding with Stranmillis University College to deliver a degree in Early Childhood Education.  The students are registered students of Stranmillis.

LYIT has also partnered with the North West Regional College in Derry to deliver programmes, and engages in outreach activity with several schools in Northern Ireland.  Another major project is the joint proposal by LYIT and the Northern Ireland Science Park to develop a North West Regional Science Park (NWRSP), based in Derry.  LYIT also has a collaborative agreement in place with Cavan Institute.</p>  <p>  Sligo IT's main cross border link is in the delivery of three Biomedical Science degrees in conjunction with the University of Ulster, which are aimed at hospital laboratory staff as well as biopharmaceutical industry personnel primarily in Ireland and the UK.  In addition, the Centre for Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technologies (CREST) project operates across a network of educational institutions including South West College, Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre, IT Sligo, and Dumfries &amp;amp; Galloway College in Scotland and has been set up to provide expertise and a range of facilities to help entrepreneurs and SMEs to bring innovative sustainable ideas from concept to reality.  The project is supported by the EU's INTERREG IVA Programme, managed by the Special European Union Programmes Board (SEUPB), with matching funding provided by Department for Enterprise, Trade and Investment and Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation.</p>  <p>  Dundalk IT is a key partner in the North East Further and Higher Education Alliance which involves close links between the institute and regional further education providers, allowing for outreach activity to be better targeted and for increased access, transfer and progression between further and higher education in the North East region.  The Regional Development Centre (RDC) at Dundalk Institute of Technology (DkIT) was established in 1989 to act as the commercially-oriented interface between DkIT and the industrial, commercial and business life of the region and has had a long history in working on a cross-border basis with University Partners in Northern Ireland including the University of Ulster and Queen's University Belfast on economic development projects.  DkIT also collaborates closely with those institutions on a range of research projects.</p>  <p>  St Angela's College Sligo has now merged with NUIG and is used as a regional outreach centre by NUIG, alongside the delivery of its own courses.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Centre for Cross Border Studies, based in Armagh, has strong representation from both Irish and Northern Irish universities.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) have primary responsibility for the delivery of State support to the indigenous micro-enterprise sector and provide financial assistance, soft supports and a signposting and referral service for micro and small business at the local level.  The LEOs in the border counties participate actively with their counterparts in Northern Ireland in a number of educational initiatives designed to assist the micro-enterprise sector across Northern Ireland and the six border counties.</p>  <p>  LEO Cavan has been active for a number of years in conjunction with Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre (CITC) in partnering with Ulster University and South West College in delivering a range of outreach programmes in Cavan, such as 'Higher Attainment Through Cross Border Hubs' (HATCH), funded by the INTERREG IVA programme.  The programme was targeted at up-skilling persons affected by the downturn in the construction sector, migrant workers, and promoting female entrepreneurship.  LEO Cavan partnered with CITC in collaboration with the Business Institute of University of Ulster, and South West College, Omagh and Enniskillen.  As a follow on to the HATCH project, CITC is involved with Ulster University in planning the delivery of a second BSc Hons in Management Practice on an outreach basis, which is expected to commence in January 2016.

These secondments are subject to annual review.  The arrangements provide flexibility and ensure that the in-service needs of teachers and other support priorities of the school system can be met within the resources available.  Having teachers with relevant and recent teaching experience and expertise is a key requirement for the role.  It is a condition therefore that the maximum length of time that a teacher may be on secondment is five years, following which they return to their teaching roles in their schools.  In this way, their expertise and knowledge is not lost to the system.  Each Education Centre has a management committee and staff which ensures continuity at a local level.  The teacher secondment arrangements were disseminated extensively so the necessary planning could take place at all levels including education centres, support services, school boards of management and individual teacher.  Accordingly, there are no plans to change this policy on teacher secondments.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises that it may be necessary from time to time to allow some flexibility to the five year policy whereby a small number of Directors would remain on secondment for a limited additional period.  This provides continuity in management, planning and leadership and retention of expertise.  Following consultations between officials in my Department and the Directors some alleviation was agreed to allow a number of Directors to serve beyond the five years for a limited period.</p>  <p>  My Department will provide support to any Management Committee in the recruitment process for a Director where required and appropriate continuous professional development support can be provided to facilitate Directors return to school should that be requested.</p></reply>

The remaining sections of the EPSEN Act have not yet been commenced.</p>  <p>  In light of the very difficult economic situation and the significant costs involved in fully implementing the EPSEN Act, the previous Government deferred the full implementation of Act.</p>  <p>  At present, all schools are encouraged to use Education Plans.  The Departmental Inspectorates' advice is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education planning for children with special needs.  In line with Circular 30/2014, schools are required to put in place a Personal Pupil Plan including a care plan for all pupils availing of SNA support.</p>  <p>  As the role of the Special Education Appeals Board, as provided for in the EPSEN Act, was intended to provide for appeals in relations to the implementation of the other statutory provisions under the Act, the Appeals Board would only be required to become operative in the event of the other sections of the Act being commenced.</p>  <p>  While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p>  <p>  These reports include the NCSE policy advice on Support Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools (2013) and The Report of the Working Group on a Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for pupils with Special Educational Needs (2014).</p>  <p>  It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.</p></reply>

The bulk of this increase has been at first level and it is now feeding through to second level. Enrolment levels are still rising annually at both levels and an estimated 55,000 additional places will be required nationally by 2022. Clearly, this level of additionality will require the provision of new schools. I cannot be precise though on the number of new schools that will be required as it will depend on the distribution of the increase within areas and the extent to which the increase can be met by existing schools or extensions to existing schools.</p>  <p>  The process for new school establishment was revised by my predecessor in June 2011 and full details of the process are published on my Department's website. New schools are established to meet demographic demand. Once the Department has identified the need for a new school, its location and projected enrolment level, a process is conducted to allow for different patrons/bodies to be considered as the patron of the new school. The main criterion for the selection of the patron body is the extent to which a school under its patronage would extend or strengthen diversity of provision in the area, having regard to the views of parents. Since the revised process was announced in June 2011, the patronage of 44 schools has been determined under the revised procedures (19 primary schools and 25 post-primary schools). In addition, 8 primary schools have opened under the patronage divesting process.</p>  <p>  In general, the Department's policy is to integrate children with special educational needs into the mainstream primary school system wherever possible. Many of our new schools have special education units included within them. However, special schools are also necessary to meet the educational needs of pupils whose needs cannot be adequately catered for in a mainstream primary school. The need to establish a new special school would be identified by the National Council for Special Education in conjunction with the Department. The necessity would arise where there is a specific and quantified need that could not reasonably be met through existing provision. Any process to establish a new special school would have to take account of the views of parents who are the key stakeholders with regard to their child.</p></reply>

Following completion of Stage 2B the project will be progressed to tender and construction stages. </p><p>  However, until such time as planning permission has been secured and the project has progressed to and completed tender stage and the appointment of a building contractor, it will not be possible to provide an indicative timeframe for the completion of the construction stage of the project. </p><p>  It is a matter for Dublin &amp;amp; D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB to determine if a staff or school authority representative may attend meetings with officials in my Department in relation to this school building project.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, which is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014. </p><p>  Circular 0030/2014 sets out the policy of allocating SNA support for a newly enrolling Junior Infant who has clear and obvious need for such support e.g. a child who has a significant additional care need arising from an intellectual, sensory or physical disability. </p><p>  For those children where it is not yet clear whether difficulties will manifest in a classroom environment, the Circular states that, in general, it is expected that all primary school pupils having their first school experience will have been enrolled and will have commenced attending school before any application for SNA support will be made. Particularly in relation to possible anticipated behavioural difficulties, it is more appropriate to wait until the child begins school in order to see how they have been able to engage in the classroom. </p><p>  The Circular explains that provision of SNA support should not be considered as a first response for management of behaviour, and should only be provided where it is clear that behavioural management strategies have not been successful to date and where it is demonstrated how access to such support can assist with ongoing planning and intervention for the child. </p><p>  A range of guidelines have been provided for schools by my Department in relation to management measures for difficult behaviour which are available on my Department's website www.education.ie. </p><p>  It is open to schools to contact their local SENO to discuss the SNA allocation process. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p></reply>

The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. At primary level, it currently operates on the basis of 1 classroom teacher for an average of every 28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools.  I have already indicated that I am determined that education should be prioritised for investment as our economy recovers and I will be seeking to agree a set of priorities for such increased investment into the future. In the last Budget, I was able to secure the first increase in education spending in recent years. I am very aware that we need to invest more in our youngest children, and in supporting parents to make the choices that are right for them.

The principal vehicle for the delivery of pre-school education is the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which was introduced in January 2010 and provides for early learning in a formal setting to children in the year before they commence primary school. </p><p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) currently provides for care support for pupils with special needs attending a range of HSE funded pre-schools.

To the end of September 2015, NAMA had identified 6,574 residential properties controlled by its debtors and receivers under this initiative as being potentially available for social housing. Of this figure, 2,526 properties have a confirmed demand and are available for social housing. In respect of the 4 Dublin local authorities in particular, since the engagement with NAMA began, 2,005 residential properties have been identified by NAMA as being potentially available for social housing, and of these demand has been confirmed by the local authorities concerned in respect of 763 of these properties.</p><p>The remaining 4,048 of the total of 6,574 units identified nationally are no longer available for social housing purposes for a variety of reasons. In respect of 2,469 of the properties identified by NAMA, local authorities considered them unsuitable for social housing because of sustainable planning and housing policy issues associated the units or they were located in areas with no social housing demand.  A further 1,579 units originally identified as available for social housing were subsequently discovered by NAMA to be unavailable.  </p><p>Of the 2,526 that are available and for which local authorities have confirmed demand, 1,600 have been delivered for social housing use at the end of Q3 2015. This figure includes<b></b>1,241 units that are complete and a further 359 units where contracts have been signed and final completion works are under way.  A further 486properties are considered as being active transactions whereby terms are agreed or active negotiation is on-going by all parties concerned or where a detailed appraisal is being carried out. An additional 440 properties are to be further appraised. Of the 1,600 units have been delivered through the NAMA process, 649 (41%) of these are situated within the 4 Dublin local authority areas. </p><p>The process of reviewing units previously deemed unsuitable by local authorities is on-going. Local Authorities, particularly those in high demand areas, are continually reviewing the list of available NAMA properties to see if they are suitable to be brought into use as social housing.</p></reply>

Of this figure, 2,526 properties have a confirmed demand and are available for social housing.  In respect of the 4 Dublin local authorities in particular, since the engagement with NAMA began, 2,005 residential properties have been identified by NAMA as being potentially available for social housing, and of these demand has been confirmed by the local authorities concerned in respect of 763 of these properties.</p><p>The remaining 4,048 of the total of 6,574 units identified nationally are no longer available for social housing purposes for a variety of reasons.  In respect of 2,469 of the properties identified by NAMA, local authorities considered them unsuitable for social housing because of sustainable planning and housing policy issues associated the units or they were located in areas with no social housing demand.  A further 1,579 units originally identified as available for social housing were subsequently discovered by NAMA to be unavailable.  </p><p>Of the 2,526 that are available and for which local authorities have confirmed demand, 1,600 have been delivered for social housing use at the end of Q3 2015. This figure includes<b></b>1,241 units that are complete and a further 359 units where contracts have been signed and final completion works are under way.  A further 486 properties are considered as being active transactions whereby terms are agreed or active negotiation is ongoing by all parties concerned or where a detailed appraisal is being carried out.  An additional 440 properties are to be further appraised.  Of the 1,600 units have been delivered through the NAMA process, 649 (41%) of these are situated within the 4 Dublin local authority areas. </p><p>The process of reviewing units previously deemed unsuitable by local authorities is ongoing.

This measure has the objective of equipping rural dwellers and communities with an appropriate range of skills and training.  It should be noted that the Local Action Group are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding, including for the training measure.  Such decisions are made in the context of the local development strategy of the individual groups and in line with the rules and regulations governing the programme, including displacement and public procurement requirements.   </p>  <p>  It is a basic principle of public procurement that a competitive process should be used unless there are justifiably exceptional circumstances.  The type of competitive process can vary depending on the size and characteristics of the contract to be awarded and the nature of the contracting authority.  Where projects are undertaken by the Local Action Group itself or by associated companies, the projects must be subject to the same evaluation process and scrutiny as outside promoters. </p>  <p>  To ensure value for money in respect of projects run by the Local Action Group, a check must be completed to determine whether a more cost effective delivery of the project/service may be available.  To this end, the Local Action Group must publicly advertise/seek quotations from outside providers to ensure that at all times that there is a clear competitive situation.   </p></reply>

The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 now require greater accountability for compliance with the Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.  These regulations place a strong emphasis on competence, professionalism and quality in relation to the design and construction of works and buildings.  I am satisfied that they will foster a climate of quality and compliance within the construction industry thereby ensuring that homeowners and clients can rely on getting the high quality homes and buildings they expect and deserve.</p><p>Any consumer engaging a builder to undertake building works on their behalf should as a minimum satisfy themselves that the builder is competent to undertake the works concerned (on the basis of having satisfactorily undertaken similar works for others); is tax compliant; is compliant with relevant requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act; and is prepared to sign a contract which may be enforced by civil means should that be necessary. </p><p>The Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) has been established as a voluntary register of builders, contractors and specialist trade persons by the Construction Industry Federation (CIF).  I understand that over 750 construction entities are currently included on the register which is available online at .  Under the <i>Construction 2020</i>strategy, the Government has signalled its commitment to placing the register on a statutory footing. This is seen as an essential consumer protection measure giving consumers who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.  Legislative proposals in this regard are currently being prepared by my Department with a view to their being presented to Government for consideration in the near future.</p></reply>

In the context of our national Building Regulations, the Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2010 and the accompanying <i>Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use (2010)</i>, which came into effect on 1 January 2012, set out the minimum statutory requirements applicable to new buildings, and to existing buildings where new works, a material alteration or a material change of use is proposed, in order to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.  The requirements of Part M aim to ensure that regardless of age, size or disability:</p><p>(a) new buildings other than dwellings are accessible and usable;</p><p>(b) extensions to existing buildings other than dwellings are, where practicable, accessible and useable;</p><p>(c) material alterations to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable;</p><p>(d) certain changes of use to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable, and</p><p>(e) new dwellings are visitable.</p><p>While the upgraded Part M /TGD M 2010 requirement initially coincided with the general downturn in economic and construction activity, its positive effects on access and use in the built environment will now be seen more widely as economic recovery takes hold.  Building Regulations, including Part M requirements, are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and wellbeing of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of technological progress and innovation.</p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.  Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces.  Locally elected members adopt the annual rate on valuation they consider necessary in order to provide the required services.  I am aware of the continued need to restrain the costs for businesses.  My Department has in recent years requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting, and where possible to reduce, ARVs and they have responded positively in this regard.  The national average ARV decreased each year from 2010 to 2014; 2015 is not directly comparable due to the local authority mergers and the necessity to harmonise rates across new local authority areas. </p>  <p>  The local government reform programme requires authorities to harmonise ARVs across former rating authorities within each of the restructured 31 local authorities within a 10 year period, generally.  This will ultimately result in one ARV being in place for each of the 31 authorities.  The 10 year timeframe was put in place to ensure that there would be a gradual adjustment to all businesses affected and also to minimise the impact on local authorities&rsquo; funding levels.   </p>  <p>  I will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under active review, and am determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain costs in the local government sector.</p></reply>

The Capital Assistance Scheme provides funding to local authorities for the advancement of sheltered housing projects that the authorities have agreed with approved housing bodies.  The funding in this case relates to land costs of &euro;456,000 and professional and legal fees of &euro;82,711 incurred by the approved housing body.  I understand that Leitrim County Council have incurred costs of &euro;800 in relation to having the site valued; the exact breakdown of this expenditure is a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  The project in question was originally proposed by Leitrim County Council in 2005 in respect of a proposed development at Dromahaire, County Leitrim by the approved housing body for a sheltered housing development of 30 units of accommodation for disabled persons, the elderly and elderly emigrants. In advancing the design of the proposed development, the approved housing body had acquired a site at Dromahaire and incurred other costs relating to the project. </p>  <p>  Following a detailed assessment and appraisal of the project proposal, the local authority deemed that there was insufficient housing need at that time to justify its advancement and the commitment of public funding that would be required.  In light of the costs already incurred by the approved housing body, the local authority   submitted an application for these costs to be paid to the approved housing body which, in the circumstances, my Department agreed to fund. </p>  <p>  The review of this project undertaken by my Department&rsquo;s Internal Audit Unit highlighted certain weaknesses in the operation of the Capital Assistance Scheme, particularly in relation to record-keeping and clarity around procedures and processes.  It identified the need to review the Department&rsquo;s circulars to provide more clarity regarding the respective roles and responsibilities of local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies and the Department.  A structure was put in place within my Department&rsquo;s Housing Division following completion of the Internal Audit review to examine and implement its recommendations.  As a result, a comprehensive review of and updating of the main Departmental circular relating to the Capital Assistance Scheme is being undertaken which, inter alia, has resulted in the full alignment of the project assessment and approval procedures under the Scheme with the Capital Works Management Framework for publicly funded construction projects.</p></reply>

However, it is clear that a multi-agency response to the substantive issue is required with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), as the body with a statutory remit, in the lead. IFI have confirmed that they are happy to participate in a multi-agency group and to contribute any expertise they have in this regard. </p>  <p>  I am advised by IFI that their intervention in this issue has primarily concentrated on their statutory responsibilities as regards the protection conservation, development and promotion of the inland fisheries resource.  IFI have been involved in preliminary work from a fisheries perspective, with early action taken to close the fishery, erect public warning signs and install essential bio-security stations, with assistance from ESB, to reduce the threat of further spread from angling activity and equipment. </p>  <p>  This was completed promptly and, with appropriate bio-security measures in place for anglers, the fishery was re-opened.  I understand, however, that the main potential vectors as regards potential spread of the species are outside the remit of IFI.</p>  <p>  IFI also engaged, as a groundwork measure, in a scientific survey in the Lanesborough area and I have asked IFI to forward a copy of the resultant report, which also sets out many of the physiognomies of the species, directly to the Deputy. </p>  <p>  Following a trial dredge carried out by Waterways Ireland with assistance from IFI, some 2.5 tonnes of material was removed from the trial site and moved to the IFI store in Roscommon.  The issue of disposal of material from any substantive intervention, and of material stored following the trial dredge, would be subject to advice from, and agreement of, the Environmental Protection Agency. </p>  <p>It is important to emphasise that scientific expertise clearly indicates that this species is particularly pervasive in the environment and that eradication, as referred to by the Deputy, does not appear to be a viable option but that ongoing management of the situation, on a multi-agency basis, may be required.</p></reply>

This is being achieved through a combination of accelerated commercial investment by telecoms operators, and a proposed State intervention to provide high speed broadband to those parts of the country where the commercial sector will not invest.  Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at .  The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER and was developed based on the most up to date information available at the time of publication.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services by 2016.  The areas marked AMBER represent those areas where the State intends to intervene to ensure those areas will have access to high speed broadband services and includes Legan, Co Longford. </p><p>More specifically I can confirm that high speed broadband has been extended to serve 7,105 premises to date in County Longford with a further 3,786 expected to be served over the next 18 months.  This coverage is referred to as &quot;homes passed&quot; and consumers will need to enter into a contract for service in order to activate the service. The remaining 11,691 premises in county Longford will be covered by further commercial investment or the NBP intervention.</p><p>My Department is currently in the process of updating the Map, taking into consideration any new information received or operator announcements made of any new plans.

It outlines various aspects of the proposed intervention including the type of network envisaged, the minimum speeds being demanded, the length of the contract for services, and whether the network should be public or privately owned.</p><p>The Government is determined to ensure that the network is built out as quickly as possible and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award.</p><p>In this context, the NBP proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of addresses in Ireland will have access to high speed services by 2018 with all addresses passed by 2020.</p></reply>

The Green Paper on Energy Policy, inter alia, sought feedback on the role that alternative technologies, such as solar, could play in delivering our renewable energy ambitions. Views received will be taken into consideration in the preparation of the White Paper on Energy which will be published before the end of this year.  The Renewable Electricity Feed-in-Tariff (REFIT) schemes are the principal means of supporting renewable electricity generators for renewable energy exported to the grid.  These schemes support electricity generated from a range of renewable sources including small scale hydro, biomass and wind.  Small scale renewable generation is eligible to apply for support under the REFIT schemes.  Solar PV is not one of the qualifying technologies for this scheme. Further information is available on my Department's website, .</p><p>Analysis of the potential of microgeneration technologies such as small scale wind, solar (including photovoltaic) and small scale hydro, has been carried out by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  The SEAI's findings, along with responses to the recent consultation on the Green Paper on Energy Policy in Ireland, will inform future policy on the provision of any market support for microgeneration.</p><p>On 31 July the Department launched a consultation on a new support scheme for renewable electricity. While the initial phase of the consultation closed on 18 September 2015, there will be two further opportunities to contribute at key stages in the design of any new scheme.  The consultations will be informative regarding the technologies that will assist in meeting our future renewable energy targets.  Subject to Government approval and State Aid clearance from the European Commission, the new scheme would become available in 2016.</p></reply>
