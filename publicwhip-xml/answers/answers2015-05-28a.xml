However, the relevant data has since been collated and data from Waterford will be included in future reports.  University Hospital Waterford has seen 100% of patients triaged as urgent with the two week target timeframe each month from January to April this year. This exceeds the national performance target of seeing 95% of urgent referrals within two weeks.</p>  <p>  I want to thank the staff and management in Waterford for this achievement.</p>  <p>  University Hospital Waterford had three Consultant Breast Surgeons in the Symptomatic Breast Disease unit in the period in question, the full allocation of posts.</p></reply>

Key to the reform is the development of a single national control system and the rationalisation of control centres to one national centre.  This project is introducing better technology and improving response times.  Developments such as national digital radio, computer aided dispatch, mobile data and electronic patient care reporting, will allow the National Ambulance Service to deploy resources more effectively and efficiently, on a national rather than a small geographic basis. </p>  <p>  A landmark was reached in January when the Townsend Street control centre, the National Ambulance Service command and control headquarters, moved seamlessly to the new National Emergency Operations Centre  in Tallaght.  In April Tullamore control centre and the National Aeromedical Coordination Centre transferred successfully to the National Centre.  Wexford, the only remaining regional centre, will transfer later this year.  Work is also underway with Dublin Fire Brigade to integrate ambulance call taking and dispatch for the Dublin area and make best use of HSE and Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance resources on a real-time basis.</p>  <p>  A &euro;5.4m budget increase in 2015 will help address service gaps, particularly in the west, by reforming rostering and staffing additional stations.  Tuam and Mulranny stations have now commenced operations and discussions are underway concerning staffing of a newly refurbished facility at Loughglynn.  The number of community first response teams is expanding, with 123 teams now operating.  The Emergency Aeromedical Support Service continues to provide rapid access to appropriate treatment for very high acuity patients.  </p>  <p>  I am confident that all of these measures will further improve our ambulance service in 2015.</p></reply>

The key objective of the Progressing Disabilities Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery across the country. This involves the creation of a clear pathway to services for children with disabilities, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the individual child's difficulties.</p>  <p>  A number of HSE Community Healthcare Organisations across the country are successfully implementing the programme. It requires significant preparatory work in engaging with families, schools, voluntary providers and local communities and the development of new procedures and protocols in respect of multidisciplinary and multiagency working. Once this preparatory work has been completed additional posts are being provided to support the implementation of the new model of service.</p>  <p>  In the Laois/Offaly area considerable work has been done to put in place the required governance structure which will allow for additional posts to be provided in 2015. A total of 120 new therapy posts will be provided across the country from an additional &euro;4 million allocated this year (equating to &euro;6 million in a full year). The HSE is currently finalising details of the allocation of additional therapy posts and it has informed me that Laois/Offaly will be prioritised. </p>  <p>  The allocation of additional resources to Laois/Offaly to support the implementation of the Progressing Disabilities Programme will help address waiting times under the statutory Assessment of Need in the area. Research done by the National Disability Authority has demonstrated that where the Progressing Disabilities Programme has been successively implemented it has had a very positive impact on reducing waiting times for the Assessment of Need. </p>  <p>  In addition the HSE is planning a waiting list initiative in Laois/Offaly shortly utilising spare capacity across public, voluntary and private providers to seek to reduce waiting times for the assessment and treatment of children pending the allocation and filling of the additional posts.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-28a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052800056#WRA01200"><p>At my request, the HSE developed and set out a considerably enhanced and strengthened Accountability Framework in its 2015 National Service Plan.  The Framework makes explicit the responsibilities of all managers to deliver on the 2015 Service Plan targets across a balanced scorecard covering the four vital areas of:</p>  <p>  - Quality and Safety</p>  <p>  - Access </p>  <p>  - Finance and </p>  <p>  - Human Resources. </p>  <p>  The Framework describes in detail the means by which the HSE and in particular the Hospital Groups and Community Health Organisations will be accountable in 2015 for performance across these four areas and allows for a level of  transparency in the process of accountability which has not been there in the past. </p>  <p>  A key feature of the Accountability Framework is the introduction of formal Performance Agreements between the Director General and each National Director and between the National Directors and the newly appointed Hospital Group CEOs and Community Health Organisation Chief Officers.  </p>  <p>  A set of Key Performance Indicators are in place to assess performance on an ongoing basis.  A formal escalation and intervention process has been introduced for under-performing services which includes a range of sanctions for significant or persistent underperformance. The escalation process requires supports, interventions and sanctions to be applied. Sanctions fall to be considered at a later stage if supports and interventions do not lead to sufficiently improved performance. The response to underperformance will be differentiated and includes limitation of autonomy in relation to staffing decisions, close monitoring of remedial actions, restrictions in access to additional development and capital funding and restrictions to participation in non-core activities.  </p>  <p>  My Department engages with HSE senior management on a monthly basis to review performance across the areas of quality and safety, access, finance and HR and detailed performance information on these areas is published on a monthly basis.  </p>  <p>  The recent HIQA report on Portlaoise highlighted the need for greater accountability across all levels of the health service.  The report raised serious questions and issues relating to the appropriateness and effectiveness of managerial actions.  These matters will be addressed through HSE internal disciplinary procedures. The Director General of the HSE has confirmed that two review processes will be set up and will involve external reviewers from outside of the HSE in order to guarantee full independence and transparency.  One of these reviews will investigate managerial decision making and risk management issues raised in the HIQA report. It will be open to this review to recommend that the disciplinary procedure commenced in respect of particular staff.</p>  <p>  The accountability of officials of my Department is governed by the Public Service Management Act. My Department has recently published its Strategy Statement 2015-2017 which sets out a range of commitments and against which performance will be evaluated over the period.</p></reply>

A recruitment campaign is currently underway for paramedic resources, which once recruited will enhance the service provision in County Limerick. The number of community first response teams is expanding, with 123 teams now operating across the country. The National Ambulance Service has ongoing communication and engagement with community first responder groups in conjunction with CFR Ireland to enhance the capacity of communities to respond to emergency cardiac calls.  </p>  <p>  The Emergency Aeromedical Support Service, which has been very successful with over 980 missions completed, will continue to provide rapid access to appropriate treatment for very high acuity patients where this might be difficult to achieve by road.  The Intermediate Care Service is now providing transport for lower acuity, non-urgent, inter-hospital patient transfers.  This service frees up emergency vehicles for more urgent calls. I am confident that all of these measures will further improve our ambulance service in 2015.</p></reply>

Last January, taking into account current pressures on acute hospital services, I directed the HSE to ensure maximum permissable waiting times for in-patient and day case treatment or a first consultant-led outpatient appointment of 18 months by mid year and 15 months by year end.  </p><p>Over the last 7 weeks, the number of people waiting for an outpatient appointment has reduced by 7,773.  The HSE, in conjunction with Hospital Groups, is focused on this requirement through maximising the use of internal capacity within and across Hospital Groups in the first instance, in addition to validating waiting lists and facilitating additional clinics where capacity exists to do so.</p><p>Letterkenny General Hospital advises that the average waiting time for patients to receive an orthopaedic appointment, based on recent attendance data, is 39 weeks.</p><p>In April 2015 Letterkenny General Hospital introduced physiotherapy-led musculoskeletal outpatient clinics to address the needs of those referred with lower back pain.  It is anticipated that this clinic will provide significant additional capacity for this cohort of patients, contributing to a spectrum of care which supports the efficient use of hospital resources<font color="#1F497D">. </font></p><p>As well as initiatives at local level, it is recognised that judicious outsourcing may be required to address prolonged waiting times.</p></reply>

The Government values the role which people with disabilities play in Irish society and is committed to facilitating the full inclusion of people with disabilities in the life of the community through access to individualised personal social supports and services. My response will refer specifically to health service supports.</p><p>In 2015, we will continue to support the major transformation programme underway in disability services, and in particular, the reconfiguration of residential services, including moving people from institutions to homes in the community and reconfiguring adult day services based on individualised and person-centred supports. Continued emphasis will also be maintained on enhancing quality and safety, especially through implementation of the HIQA standards for residential settings, reform of adult day services and children's therapy services, planning for emergency places and changing needs, maximising efficiencies and further development of enhanced governance and accountability arrangements. Our focus is to bring about reforms that will positively impact on the way in which people with disabilities are supported to live the lives of their choice. </p><p>Funding of almost &euro;1.5 billion will be provided for health and personal social services through the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2015. Residential services are provided by almost 60 agencies to around 9,000 people with disabilities at over 1,200 locations. Day services are provided to around 22,000 people with intellectual, physical or sensory disabilities and autism at 850 different locations by 80 organisations. Approximately 1,400 young people who are due to leave school and Rehabilitative Training programmes in 2015 will receive new placements. In 2015, an additional &euro;6 million has been allocated to provide places for these school leavers and graduates.  Respite residential support totalling 190,000 overnights will be provided. The target for provision of personal assistant/home support in 2015 is 3.9 million hours. </p><p>In addition, work is advanced on the re-configuration of therapy services for children aged up to 18 years as part of the HSE's <i>Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years) Programme.</i>An additional &euro;4 million was allocated in 2014 to assist in implementing the Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts. A further investment of &euro;4 million will also be made to support the development of therapy services in 2015 (equating to &euro;6 million in a full year).</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-28a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052800056#WRA02000"><p>My attention has been drawn to the findings of this survey. One of my priorities for 2015 is the publication of a National Maternity Strategy.  This will provide a roadmap to better maternity services. It will ensure that women have access to safe, sustainable, well staffed maternity care in a setting most appropriate to their needs. </p>  <p>  An extra &euro;2 million has been included in the HSE National Service Plan 2015 to address current pressures within the Maternity Service.  The measures proposed by the HSE include the appointment of 7 consultant obstetricians, 3 sonographers and additional senior midwives and midwives, the numbers of which will be informed by the Birthrate Plus study, which will be completed in June. A benchmarking exercise is being undertaken to establish baseline midwifery and maternity care assistant staffing levels in all maternity units.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has a relatively low ratio of staff per birth in our maternity services.  However, the numbers of obstetricians and midwives are increasing.  In 2015, we have 123 whole time equivalent consultant obstetricians, compared with 116 in 2011, when this Government came into office.  Midwife numbers have increased significantly from 1,189 whole time equivalents in 2011 to 1,424 in 2015. This on-going increase in staffing came at a time when the country was in a financial emergency.  This is significant and shows that government and the HSE protected maternity services during the toughest financial environment. Increasing staff numbers, coupled with a falling birth rate, means that, although there is a way to go, the ratio of obstetric and midwifery staff to births is improving and will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  While staffing levels and expertise form part of the service delivery, resources are not the only issue. Guaranteeing better outcomes for patients is a fundamental principle of our health reform programme.  We all continue to strive to ensure that patients receive the best care possible when they need to access health and social care services. </p>  <p>  Action 46 of Future Health commits the Department of Health to work with the HSE to implement an approach to workforce planning and development that achieves the objectives of: recruiting and retaining the right mix of staff; training and upskilling the workforce; providing for professional and career development; and creating supportive and healthy workplaces.

Motivated by the desire to ensure that other families would not suffer as they had, they voiced their concerns.  We must ensure that the opportunity provided by the HIQA Investigation Report on Services at Portlaoise Hospital to learn from the mistakes of the past, and to put things right for the future, is not missed.  That is the least we owe to the families who spoke out.</p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that any new patient advocacy service should be set up independent of the HSE from the outset.  I do not think that people would trust a patient advocacy service to advocate on their behalf to the HSE, if the people working in it were employees of the HSE. My view has been supported by the recommendation made in the HIQA Investigation Report for the need to establish an independent patient advocacy agency.  </p>  <p>  I am keen to get an independent national patient advocacy service up and running as soon as possible.

Treatment figures indicate an increase in the number of people seeking treatment for benzodiazepine use.         </p>  <p>  The Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2015, as well as controlling substances decontrolled as a result of a Court of Appeal decision, reconfirmed existing Ministerial regulations and orders made under the 1977 Act.  These regulations and orders may now only be amended by primary legislation.  While it is intended to bring forward regulations to impose additional controls on benzodiazepines and z-drugs, a second Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill must first be enacted in order to provide the Minister with the necessary powers in this regard.  It is my intention to have this Bill published and enacted within the current year.   </p>  <p>  Clinical guidelines are set out in the Department of Health's "Good Practice Guidelines for Clinicians" for the prescribing of benzodiazepines.  The HSE addiction services provides a comprehensive substance treatment service orientated towards those with polydrug issues.  Consequently, problem drug users attending such services and who are dependent on benzodiazepines or other z-drugs have this addressed as part of their treatment.  I am advised by the HSE that clinical protocols in relation to benzodiazepine treatment are currently under consideration by the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee, and that some HSE addiction services are piloting these protocols. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is beginning work on the development of a new National Drugs Strategy for the period after 2016.  The process will include a comprehensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public on the current national drugs policy and future priorities, including treatment. It will also take account of evidence-based research, information and data sources on the extent and nature of problem drug use in Ireland. As Minister with lead responsibility for drugs policy, I will play an active role in the development of the new Strategy and I would urge all interested parties to engage in the process.</p></reply>

It was estimated that 350 women would apply to the Scheme, but in fact 576 applications were accepted. Applications are being assessed by former High Court Judge Maureen Harding Clark. The Scheme has in the region of &euro;34 million available and participants will receive awards at three levels - &euro;50,000, &euro;100,000 and &euro;150,000. The Scheme was designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial, and aims to minimise the stress for all women concerned. It was designed following meetings with all three support groups, two of which have welcomed its establishment.  It was established to give women who do not wish to pursue their cases through the courts an alternative, simple, non-adversarial option in which payments are made to women who have had a surgical symphysiotomy whether or not negligence is proven. </p><p>Judge Clark has informed my officials that as at 22 May 2015, 206 offers have been made to women including 1 offer that was rejected. 194 of those offers had been accepted with 11 offers awaiting a response. Of the 194 offers accepted by applicants, 118 were assessed at &euro;50,000, 71 at &euro;100,000 and 5 at &euro;150,000.  A large number of  applications have been made without medical records or evidence of symphysiotomy and this information is being sought by Judge Clark in order to progress the applications.  Where there was a delay arising in the compilation of a woman's supporting documentation due to difficulty in obtaining medical records, applications were accepted by the Scheme, provided the application was received within the time period set out in the Scheme, with a written explanation of the reasons for the absence of the documentation. </p><p>The Scheme is voluntary and women do not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition to participating in the Scheme. Women may opt out of the Scheme at any stage in the process, up to the time of accepting their award.  It is only on accepting the offer of an award that a woman must agree to discontinue her legal proceedings against any party arising out of a symphysiotomy or pubiotomy. The Deputy may be aware of a High Court Judgment that was delivered on 1 May 2015, where the Judge dismissed the claim for damages by a 74 year old woman who had a symphysiotomy 12 days before the birth of her baby at the Coombe Hospital in 1963.  The Judge ruled that even though the woman has suffered since the operation, the practice of prophylactic symphysiotomy <i>&ldquo;was not a practice without justification&rdquo;</i>in 1963. The Judge also stated in his judgment that <i>'Though I would in the words of Sir Ranulph Crewe, Chief Justice of England, &ldquo;take hold of a twig or twine-thread&rdquo; to uphold the plaintiff&rsquo;s case, I must find that this remarkable lady whose story indeed deserves to be told must fail in her case against the defendants'.</i></p><p><i></i>While the Government is aware of the comments made by the UN Human Rights Committee, it believes that the provision of the ex-gratia scheme, together with the ongoing provision of support services by the HSE, including medical cards, represents a fair and appropriate response to this issue.</p></reply>

Accordingly, funding was allocated in the HSE Service Plan for 2015 for the appointment of an orthopaedic surgeon, anaesthetist and support staff at Crumlin. This will maximise the use of available theatre sessions in the hospital. The first of these additional staff is now in post, and recruitment for the remaining posts is in process. In addition, capital funding has been agreed for a new theatre on site at Crumlin, which will expand theatre capacity further. As a further measure, available capacity is being identified in other hospitals and some children are being transferred for their surgery, where it is considered clinically appropriate for them.</p>  <p>  The Children's Hospital Group, OLCHC and the HSE are working together on an ongoing basis to identify all options to increase capacity further.</p></reply>

Schedule 5 to these Regulations lists the policies and procedures that a registered provider must have in place including, for example, health and safety (to include infection control and food safety); risk management; prevention, detection and response to abuse; staff training; responding to emergencies; fire safety management; handling of complaints; medications management.  </p><p>National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People are also in place.  These standards outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services. </p><p>In June 2012 the HIQA National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare were approved by the previous Minister for Health. The National Standards are aimed at protecting patients and they provide a strategic approach to improving safety, quality and reliability in our health services. They describe high quality safe healthcare services. Such services deliver care which is safe, effective, person centred and which promotes better health for service users. The National Standards also describe what capacity and capability factors service providers require to implement these standards. Service providers, including the private (independent) service providers, can use the National Standards as a framework to organise, manage and deliver their services safely.  It is envisaged that the proposals being developed for the licensing of healthcare providers will be based on key concepts within the National Standards.</p><p>HIQA continues to monitor the quality and safety of healthcare service with the National Standards through the delivery of a programme of thematic monitoring reviews based on identified priorities and consultation with stakeholders. HIQA also carries out a programme of announced and unannounced infection prevention and hygiene inspections in hospitals in line with the<i>National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections.</i></p><p>The National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) was established in 2010.  Clinical effectiveness is a key  component of patient safety and quality.  The integration of national and international best available evidence in service provision through utilisation of clinical effectiveness processes promotes healthcare that is up to date, effective and consistent. </p><p>Clinical effectiveness incorporates the utilisation of quality assured National Clinical Guidelines, National Clinical Audit and general clinical practice guidance.  This is a quality improvement approach which promotes cost-effective healthcare that is evidence-based, with subsequent improved clinical decision-making and clinical outcomes.  Clinical effectiveness will underpin the models of care for the HSE's national  clinical programmes. </p><p>To date, the NCEC has quality assured 6 National Clinical Guidelines which have been endorsed by respective Ministers and mandated for implementation in the Irish health system. These include:</p><p>1. National Early Warning Score (NEWS);</p><p>2. Prevention and Control of MRSA;</p><p>3. Clostridium difficile;</p><p>4. Irish Maternity Early Warning System ( IMEWS);</p><p>5. Clinical Handover in Maternity Service; and</p><p>6. Sepsis Management.</p><p>Their implementation will be monitored through the HSE Assurance Reports, compliance with HIQA's National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare and increased alignment with the Clinical Indemnity Scheme.</p></reply>

Its role includes overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the recommendations of the 2007 Report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation, developing national protocols to facilitate the level of inter-agency cooperation needed to implement shared care plans, and overseeing case management and care planning processes.</p>  <p>  The committee has developed a National Drugs Rehabilitation Framework to provide a 'continuum of care' for the recovering drug user through promoting a more integrated and client-centred approach based on shared care planning and inter-agency working. The rollout of the framework is currently being advanced through the HSE's Addiction Services and the Local and Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Forces.  As part of this rollout, NDRIC is developing competency based training to be provided to all treatment providers and relevant agencies in Drug &amp;amp; Alcohol Task Force areas.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has commenced work on the development of a new National Drugs Strategy for the period after 2016.

In practice, this means facilitating the patient in accessing the information or service required to meet their needs from another pharmacist/pharmacy.  </p><p>In addition to the Code, the PSI issued a guidance document<font color="#0000FF">, </font>which provides guidance in fulfilling their professional responsibilities in the supply of these medicines.

In our statement of Health priorities for 2015, the Minister for Health and I have reiterated our commitment to implementing the Strategy.</p><p>The National Positive Ageing Strategy provides a vision for an age-friendly society and includes four National Goals and underpinning Objectives to provide direction on the issues that need to be addressed to promote positive ageing. As Minister of State with responsibility for older people, I am driving implementation at the political level. The Strategy is a cross-Departmental one and my Department has an overall coordinating and collating role and a more direct role for the health-related objectives.</p><p>A key objective of this Strategy is to change the mindsets of decision makers across Government agencies and to raise the priority that is given to the concerns of older people. The first step in doing this is to establish a system of regular reporting on actions and initiatives that impact on older people, and these reports are regularly sought and collated by my Department. The fact that such reports are already and will continue to be required will in itself increase the focus that is given to older persons' issues, and these reports will be submitted for consideration by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Sector Reform chaired by An Taoiseach.  Implementation is accordingly an ongoing process.</p><p>It is important to point out the many initiatives already in train which contribute to the Strategy's goals. For example, in the health sector, in the area of older people&rsquo;s services and supports, the Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will be completed shortly. The Single Assessment Tool, which will allow for a systematic assessment of need and allocation of services to older people, is being developed by the HSE; measures are being taken to ensure integrated care for older patients, and palliative care services are being improved. The Deputy will also be aware that &euro;25m<b></b>was allocated in Budget 2015 to support services that provide alternatives to, and relieve pressures on acute hospitals.  In April 2015, an additional &euro;74m was allocated to further tackle the ongoing issue of delayed discharges in acute hospitals. The majority of these patients are older people, and these funds are being applied across both long term and short term residential services and at community level.  As a result the waiting time for funding of approved patients under the Nursing Home Support scheme has fallen to four weeks now from eleven weeks in March.</p><p>A Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative (HaPAI) has also been established to implement the research objective of the National Positive Ageing Strategy. It is a joint initiative between the Department of Health, the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies and will run from October 2014 to December 2017, with a commitment to Department of Health funding for a further two years. The Initiative will monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing linked to the Goals and Objectives of the Positive Ageing Strategy. This will be done primarily through the development of positive ageing indicators to be published every two years. A preliminary positive ageing report will be published shortly.  The HSE will also develop a physical activity communications campaign under the Initiative.</p></reply>

The key objective of the Progressing Disabilities Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery across the country. This involves the creation of a clear pathway to services for children with disabilities, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the individual child's difficulties.</p>  <p>  A number of HSE Community Healthcare Organisations across the country are successfully implementing the programme which requires significant preparatory work in engaging with families, schools, voluntary providers and local communities and the development of new procedures and protocols in respect of multidisciplinary and multiagency working. Once this preparatory work has been completed additional posts are being provided to support the implementation of the new model of service.</p>  <p>  In the Laois/Offaly area considerable work has been done to put in place the required governance structure which will allow for additional posts to be provided in 2015. A total of 120 new therapy posts will be provided across the country from an additional &euro;4 million allocated this year (equating to &euro;6 million in a full year). The HSE is currently finalising details of the allocation of additional therapy posts and it has informed me that Laois/Offaly will be prioritised. </p>  <p>  The allocation of additional resources to Laois/Offaly to support the implementation of the Progressing Disabilities Programme will help address waiting times under the statutory Assessment of Need in the area. Research done by the National Disability Authority has demonstrated that where the Progressing Disabilities Programme has been successively implemented it has had a very positive impact on reducing waiting times for the Assessment of Need. </p>  <p>  In addition the HSE is planning a waiting list initiative in Laois/Offaly shortly utilising spare capacity across public, voluntary and private providers to seek to reduce waiting times for the assessment and treatment of children pending the allocation and filling of the additional posts.</p></reply>

Requests for additional resources made in 2011 had to be considered in the context of competing demands for funding, and against the backdrop of the worst financial crisis ever to fall on the State.  In 2010 and 2011 the HSE had total budget reductions of &euro;1.75bn and staff levels were further reducing. The reality is that all services were under pressure and there were frequent requests for additional funding. </p>  <p>  The Clinical Programmes were in their infancy and a lot of issues and services, which were in need of development, were being identified.  Many meetings were held with clinicians, all of whom were, understandably, very vocal about perceived funding and resource needs in their own facilities and specialties. The priority at the time was to deliver the maximum level of safe services possible with the reduced funding and staffing levels. The budgetary challenges continued in 2012. However, I am advised that in applying the cost reduction measures required, the then Dublin Midlands Region afforded a level of protection to paediatric and maternity services. </p>  <p>  Following the publication of the HIQA report earlier this month, I will, together with my Department,  engage with the HSE to ensure that the report's very serious findings are addressed, and that the recommendations are fully implemented and all other issues arising are dealt with appropriately.</p>  <p>  Since the Chief Medical Officer's report on Portlaoise last year, much has been done to strengthen services in the hospital.  New management is in place, there is significantly improved clinical governance and additional key clinical staff have been appointed.  Portlaoise is now part of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. The hospital will be supported to ensure that patients receive their treatment and care in the most appropriate setting within the Group.</p></reply>

To ensure this, additional funding of &euro;6 million (at a full year cost of &euro;12 million) was allocated by the HSE this year to meet the needs of around 1,500 young people who will require continuing health-funded supports.  The HSE has assured me that all service providers will be informed of their funding allocation by the end of May.</p><p>The HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, continues to work with schools, service providers, young people with disabilities and their families to identify training needs and explore suitable options.  </p><p>The provision of services to school-leavers and RT graduates is challenging each year as the number of individuals requiring health funded supports continues to increase year on year.  Last year, the HSE implemented a coordinated and streamlined approach to manage the process of providing services to young people based on their individually expressed preferences and assessed needs.  As a result, almost 1,400 young people with disabilities who finished school or rehabilitative training received placements which fully met their needs.  This year, the HSE is committed to building on last year&rsquo;s efforts and I understand that the HSE is on target to notify all young people and their families by the end of June of the placement that will be available to them from September.</p><p>One of the most significant projects being progressed by the HSE this year within the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services framework is the implementation of the person-centred approach to day services as outlined in &quot;<i>New Directions - Report on the National Working Group for the Review of HSE funded Adult Day Services&quot;.  </i>The New Directions policy proposes that health-funded day services for adults with disabilities should be based on the principles of person-centredness, community inclusion, active citizenship and high quality service provision.  This projects demonstrates the HSE's commitment to providing services in a more individualised and person-centred way to all people availing of day services including school-leavers and RT graduates whose service should in future take the form of individualised and personally chosen outcome-focused supports.</p></reply>

There are approximately 69,000 rent supplement recipients, for which the Government has provided a total of over &euro;298 million for in 2015. </p>  <p>  Under the Residential Tenancies legislation, landlords are legally obliged to register tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) within one month of the start date of the tenancy or at a later date on payment of an increased fee.  For this reason, it is not practicable for the Department to insist that a tenancy be registered with the PRTB before payment of rent supplement can be made.  Not all tenancies are required to be registered with the PRTB as the relevant legislation, the Residential Tenancies Act, provides for certain exceptions. </p>  <p>  The Department works closely with the PRTB to help ensure that rent supplement tenancies comply with the statutory system of tenancy regulation and safeguards. The Department advises the PRTB, on a quarterly basis, of all new rent supplement tenancies to assist them in implementing tenancy regulations and co-operates in any initiatives taken by the PRTB to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for setting and enforcing housing standards rests with the Local Authorities. However, accommodation occupied by rent supplement tenants should at least meet minimum housing standards.  Social Welfare legislation provides that rent supplement can be terminated where the Department is notified by a housing authority regarding the non-compliance with standards. </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short term income support by transferring responsibility for persons with long term housing needs to the local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme (HAP). HAP is being designed so as to bring all of the social housing services provided by the State together under the local authority system and is currently being rolled out to almost 2,000 recipients in selected local authority areas.</p></reply>

There has never been a statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to contribute to their pension scheme.  Rather, when a defined benefit scheme is set up, the level of employer and employee contributions is agreed and established in contract in each schemes Trust Deeds and Rules.  The Trust Deeds and Rules differ from scheme to scheme, and as with any contractual situation, reflect the parameters on the level of obligation of the parties involved.  </p>  <p>  You will be aware that a range of legislative measures have been put in place in recent years to assist employers and the trustees of pension scheme address the funding difficulties encountered by many defined benefit pension schemes. The imposition of a debt on employers or the provision for a pension protection fund were considered during the deliberation process leading up to introduction of these legislative changes. However, given the uncertainties as to the overall impact and potential for unintended consequences of applying debt on the employer selectively or otherwise and  having regard to the small size of the defined benefit sector, and given the administrative complexities and costs associated with a pension protection fund, these measures were not progressed</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the measures put in place in recent years take an approach which will support schemes with funding difficulties to gradually move to a more sustainable funding position.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-28a.176.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052800058#WRC03400"><p>The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by unemployed  jobseekers, and by young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee. </p><p>The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment, education or training within four months of becoming unemployed. The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people, who become unemployed, in finding and securing sustainable jobs. For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training. Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. There are additional planned measures that have not yet been implemented (International Work and Experience Training, County Enterprise Board Youth Entrepreneurship and Mentoring Supports). Those under 18 are offered second chance education, e.g., through Youthreach.</p><p>Table 1 at the end of this reply shows places taken up in 2014 on the programmes for unemployed young people that were included in the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.  </p><p>Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall (with a rate of 21.1% in March 2015 estimated by Eurostat, as compared to 25.9% in March 2014 and with a peak of over 30% in 2012).</p><p>The purpose of the Ballymun Youth Guarantee (BYG) pilot project was to test key elements to inform the national roll-out of the Youth Guarantee. The project officially finished on the 31st December 2014. It will take time to see whether the opportunities taken up by young people through the BYG project have had a positive impact in terms of improved employment and other outcomes. The local Intreo office continues to work with participants (through the Ballymun Job Centre Guidance Counsellors) to progress them towards employment opportunities that continue to emerge as the economy recovers. </p><p>It is clear that the project has been highly successful in building the participants&rsquo; confidence and ability to move towards employment. From the perspective of both the participants and the staff involved in the delivery of the service, the BYG approach has contributed towards the development of career identities, improved self-esteem and human and social capital.</p><p><b>Table 1.

Following instructions from the Minister for Finance, NAMA were no longer obliged to purchase the unsold IBRC assets at their individual valuation as previously envisaged, as the expected proceeds to be raised from the sale of the IBRC loan assets were to be sufficient to fully repay the IBRC debt to NAMA.</p>  <p>  The Special Liquidators then devised a further sales process in respect of the final &euro;2.5 billion worth of loans left unsold from the first process (as well as IBRC s stake in the IBRC Assurance Company and the NAMA subordinated bonds) which was initiated in August 2014.  Again, the Special Liquidators corresponded with those borrowers of the unsold loan assets and sought representations of how their loans should be sold. Having given due consideration to the representations made by the borrowers of the remaining loan assets and the professional advice received, the Special Liquidators divided the remaining loan assets into four portfolios: Quartz, Pearl, Amber and Amethyst. Project Opal was the sale IBRC s stake in IBRC Assurance Company and Project Jade was the sale of IBRC holding of NAMA subordinated bonds. The sale of each of these portfolios completed in March 2015.</p>  <p>  No IBRC borrower was provided with an exclusive opportunity to buy back their loan(s) at a discount or was offered an incentive discount on their loans to refinance their loans.  However, as per my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 285 of 12 May 2015, following the Special Liquidators' due process and as part of the competitive sales processes devised by the Special Liquidators, it was possible for some borrowers to bid for their own loans.</p>  <p>  The Special Liquidators can confirm that no loans were sold for less than their valuation price (as per the Ministerial Instruction) however they will not be providing information on the prices achieved in the sale process as this is commercially sensitive information.</p>  <p>  I would also point out that the progress reports on the Special Liquidation of IBRC, published in June 2014 and March 2015, are available on the Departmentt of Finance website which provide further detail around the sales processes and the progress of the special liquidation more generally.</p></reply>

The meetings focused on the mortgage market and specifically the comparatively high standard variable rates currently being charged by the banks. </p>  <p>  I outlined my view, that Standard Variable Rates being charged in the Irish market are too high.  There was agreement from all lenders that customers should have access to more competitive mortgage products as per my recommendation.</p>  <p>  The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers. Some of the potential products include lower standard variable rates for existing and new customers, competitive fixed rate products and lower variable rates taking account of loan to value for new and existing customers. </p>  <p>  In addition to the issue of rates I also outlined the need for greater competition in the market and the need for a more active and well-resourced campaign by the individual banks. This should focus on promoting awareness of their best offering and how easy it is for customers to take up new products and switch between different institutions if they wish to avail of better rates. </p>  <p>  The position of home owners who are in negative equity was also discussed and assurances were sought and received that these homeowners will be able to avail of options to reduce their monthly repayments. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department will review progress over the coming weeks and a follow up set of meeting with each of the six banks will take place in September in advance of the Budget. The issue of a penal banking levy in the Budget or powers for the Central Banks to regulate interest rates will be considered at that time if sufficient progress is not made.</p></reply>

Parties to a hearing may, however, engage such services for the purpose of making transcripts and all costs in relation to this are borne by the party who engages the service providers. There are no provisions in relation to making such records available to participants or the general public. However, if a party seeks to introduce any part of a transcript in evidence, the ordinary rules which apply when a document is being used in cross examination apply and in such circumstances the Tribunal would normally request that the relevant extract be made available to the Tribunal and the parties concerned. In the event of transcripts being made available to the Tribunal, these records would normally be maintained by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, 65A Adelaide Road, Dublin, 2.</p></reply>

Some gift cards, such as the One4all card issued by the Gift Voucher Shop or the gift cards issued by some shopping centres, are subject also to the European Communities (Electronic Money Regulations) 2011 enacted by the Minister for Finance and enforced by the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Scheme of a proposed Consumer Rights Bill which I launched on Monday includes a number of proposals aimed at strengthening the rights of consumers who purchase gift cards. The Scheme provides that contracts for the supply of a gift card or voucher must not include a term that makes the card or voucher subject to an expiry date. Traders would also be required to inform consumers of any charges applying to a gift card, or any restrictions on the use of the card, before the consumer was bound by the contract. The charges applying to gift cards would also be assessable for fairness under the provisions of the Scheme on unfair contract terms. I am prepared to consider additional protections for consumers in this area if the consultation on the Scheme of the Bill shows a need for them.</p></reply>

Any change to that principle which would put in place a mandated right to be part of the process would alter fundamentally the conduct of industrial relations. </p>  <p>  As it stands, where changes to pension schemes are negotiated at company level whether as a result of a crisis in the scheme or otherwise, the outcome of that engagement cannot, of itself, change the pension scheme. Rather, any proposed changes to the scheme are effected through the trust deeds and rules of the scheme and are at the discretion of the parties so designated in the rules/deeds of the scheme. In my view, it is within this framework, rather than through the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery, that a collective approach would be most effective.</p>  <p>  In terms of changes to pension schemes generally, the Trustees of a particular pension scheme are required by law to act in the best interests of all the members, be they active deferred or pensioner members. Until recently, this has been done on an individual basis.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection has now provided for the recognition by trustees and the Pensions Authority of groups representing the interests of retired and deferred scheme members of a particular pension scheme. The required revised section 50 guidance has been published by the Pensions Authority.</p>  <p>  From now on, the trustees of a pension scheme are required to notify the groups representing the interests of retired and deferred scheme members where the trustees of a scheme propose to apply to the Pensions Authority to restructure scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act. This notification affords the representative group an opportunity to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to such proposals. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Pensions Authority is now required to notify groups representing the interest of scheme members where the Pensions Authority proposes to either issue a unilateral direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to the trustees of a scheme to restructure scheme benefits or to wind up a pension scheme under section 50B of the Pensions Act. This notification affords the representative group an opportunity to make representations to the Pensions Authority in relation to such proposals.</p></reply>

His participation in the Scheme ended on 31 December 2014.    REPS4 is a measure under the 2007-13 Rural Development Programme and is subject to EU Regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications to be completed before any payments can issue.

These non-compliance issues were notified to the person named on 15 April 2014 by letter from the Department&rsquo;s local office.</p>  <p>  As a result of an appeal and a review within the Department, the penalty amount was reduced by &euro;948.83.

If applying using a paper form, the applicants must have submitted that form directly by post, or delivered by hand, to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, SPS Co-Ordination Unit, Government Buildings, Old Abbeyleix Road, Portlaoise, Co. Laois. It was not permitted to submit the form through any other office of the Department.  If the application form was being posted to the Department, farmers were advised to obtain acceptable proof of postage (see below), which could be used in the event of the application(s) not being received by the Department. In 2014 the only acceptable proof of postage for a 2014 SPS Application Form, Amendment Form and/or the Entitlements Forms was:   </p>  <p>  - Express post receipt i.e. a receipt is attached to each return envelope sent out with the pre printed application form, or </p>  <p>  - Registered post receipt.</p>  <p>  No other proof of post was acceptable in 2014. In cases where a dispute arises the Department has an internal appeals procedure in place. Where an applicant is dissatisfied with the outcome of the Department&rsquo;s appeal procedure, it is open to the person concerned to make an appeal to the Agriculture Appeals Office.  If not satisfied with the outcome of that appeal each applicant is advised of his/her right of further appeal to the Office of the Ombudsman.</p></reply>

However, not every watercourse which may have been included in the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) necessarily qualifies under GLAS. REPS was a whole farm scheme whereas the GLAS is targeted at pre-determined environmental assets at individual farm level. The introduction of new regulations since the inception of REPS and in particular the implementation of the Nitrates Directive now provides general protection of watercourses under Pillar 1 allowing for a more focused approach under Pillar 2 agri-environment schemes.</p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, has identified specific reaches of rivers for inclusion in the Protection of Watercourses from Bovines and Riparian Margin Actions in GLAS. These rivers have been categorised within GLAS in accordance with their water quality status, with those in the most pristine condition receiving the highest priority (Tier 1) followed by lower status rivers on holdings identified as having predominantly wet soils, which qualify a farmer access to GLAS under Tier 2. Protection of other watercourses shown on the GLAS system may be taken as a Tier 3 action. </p></reply>

The on-line option is becoming increasingly popular as a secure means of lodging applications and was availed of by over 80,000 applicants in 2014. There are no specific regulations and/or Statutory Instrument that refer to the proof of postage necessary to comply with the scheme&rsquo;s terms and conditions. The required proof is specified annually in the Terms and Conditions of the Single Payment Scheme/Basic payment Scheme.</p>  <p>  Commencing in 2011, it became a requirement of the Single Payment Scheme for an applicant to furnish an Express Post or Registered Post receipt as proof of postage where such was required. Internal procedures were put in place to keep a record of all post received via registered/express post. Each applicant is supplied annually with a pre-addressed return envelope and express post label with their Single Payment Scheme/Basic Payment Scheme application pack. Part of that label is proof of postage.</p>  <p>  Prior to 2011, my Department had reason to conclude that some of the proof of post certificates provided, were unreliable. It was for this reason that procedures were updated while still providing for two very accessible and reliable proof of postage options readily available to all applicants.   </p>  <p>  While my Department has over the years made strenuous efforts to facilitate its customers and simplify the application procedure, its primary function is to act as a Competent Authority in processing payment applications. Under the Regulations governing the Schemes the primary onus rests firmly, at all times with the applicant to ensure a completed application form is lodged by the closing date.</p></reply>

The BDGP builds on the investment in data recording and genomics in recent years, and will ultimately bring about long-term improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.  One of the requirements of the programme stipulates that from 30 June 2016, at least 80% of the AI used on participating holdings must be from 4 or 5 star bulls on either the terminal or replacement index. This complements the requirement that where a stock bull is used, at least one stock bull on the holding on the 30 June 2019 must be a genotyped 4 or 5 star bull on either the terminal or replacement index.</p>  <p>  There is a very wide range of AI bulls available for pedigree beef breeding that are 4 or 5 stars on either the replacement or terminal index. For example, ICBF recently completed its listing of recommended sires for bull breeders involved in the Gene Ireland maternal beef breeding program. In total there are some 164 bulls in that catalogue of which 151 (92%) are 4 or 5 stars on either the replacement or terminal index within or across breeds.</p>  <p>  The fact that 20% of the AI used can come from other types of bulls gives scope for pedigree breeders that wish to use some outcross sires as part of the scheme. ICBF calculates a euro star evaluation for imported sires based on their foreign data so that they can be utilised under the programme. For example, there were 166 new beef AI sires coded last year, both Irish and internationally bred, and of these 69% are already compliant with the scheme. Indeed, ICBF can provide an indication of the likely euro star rating to be given to such bulls when imported into Ireland and it is likely that AI companies and breeders will be much more vigilant regarding the type of &ldquo;outcross&rdquo; bulls that they purchase/import in the future.</p>  <p>  Finally the Deputy will wish to note that I have extended the deadline for scheme applications to next Friday 5 June in order that as many suckler farmers as possible can join. As of this morning we have received over 17,000 applications and I am encouraging other farmers to submit their application before this revised deadline.</p></reply>

I understand that significant refurbishment works are required at the hospital to comply with HIQA standards.

This is a matter for the management of the Hospital and HIQA.  </p>  <p>  Demand for capital investment for the Community Nursing Unit programme far exceeds the funding available, and investment must therefore be allocated as effectively as possible based on the HSE's assessment of priorities. At present this funding programme focuses on the upgrade and refurbishment of existing public facilities to achieve compliance with HIQA.     </p>  <p>  I understand that the HSE has worked closely with New Ross Community Hospital in relation to the challenges faced and will continue to support them in every way possible.</p></reply>

There is no entitlement to a medical card for a person with a particular illness or medical condition. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the publication of the <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility</i>and the <i>Medical Card Process Review</i>in November 2014. Key findings of the Expert Panel were that it would not be feasible, desirable or ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility  and that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.</p><p>However, the Government recognises that the health service needs to be responsive to the circumstances of people with significant medical needs.  Following publication of the two reports, in November 2014, the Minister for Health and I announced a series of measures to enhance the operation of the medical card scheme and make it more sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs, especially where serious illness is involved. Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold. Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that a Clinical Advisory Group has been appointed and it will provide an interim update on its work in June on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions, so as to take account of the burden involved and the needs arising from the condition and to ensure that appropriate services are provided to people who need them.  </p><p>The medical card system is now operating in a more sensible and sensitive manner. The HSE is exercising greater discretion, as is evident in the increase in the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation - by over 63% from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 85,000 at the end of April this year.</p></reply>

The number of registered nurses per capita was highest in Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. While registrations do not convert directly to numbers employment, it has been estimated that Ireland has 9.22 working nurses per 1,000.  Though numbers in employment fell between 2008 and 2013, given the recruitment embargo, numbers employed have increased in the last year and a half and continue to do so. </p>  <p>  It is Government policy to move to a consultant delivered service.  While the ratio of consultants to patients is lower in Ireland than in other countries, reflecting a historical low base, significant progress has been achieved.  There has been a large increase in the number of consultants since the establishment of the HSE, the number having increased by 737 from the end of 2004 to the end of March 2015 (1,905 to 2,642 - Whole Time Equivalents).  There are some specialties in which there are international shortages and which have been traditionally difficult to fill.  This means that progress in improving the ratios is more difficult.  Shortages in specialties such as emergency medicine, anaesthesia and psychiatry are a worldwide phenomenon and not specific to the Irish health services.</p>  <p>  The number of NCHDs has also increased significantly in the past decade, reflecting service demands and ongoing efforts to achieve full compliance with the requirements of the European Working Time Directive.  From 1 January 2005 to 30 April 2015 the number increased from 4208 to 5,280, and increase of 1,072. </p>  <p>  The HSE is actively pursuing the recruitment of additional nurses, consultants and NCHDs at present to fill vacant posts.</p></reply>

The National Standards are aimed at protecting patients and they provide a strategic approach to improving safety, quality and reliability in our health services.  They describe high quality safe healthcare services. Such services deliver care which is safe, effective, person centred and which promotes better health for service users.  The National Standards also describe what capacity and capability factors service providers require to implement these standards.  Service providers, including the private (independent) service providers, can use the National Standards as a framework to organise, manage and deliver their services safely.  It is envisaged that the proposals being developed for the licensing of healthcare providers will be based on key concepts within the National Standards.</p><p>HIQA continues to monitor the quality and safety of healthcare service with the National Standards through the delivery of a programme of thematic monitoring reviews based on identified priorities and consultation with stakeholders.  HIQA also carries out a programme of announced and unannounced infection prevention and hygiene inspections in hospitals in line with the<i>National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections.</i></p><p>The National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) was established in 2010.  Clinical effectiveness is a key  component of patient safety and quality.  The integration of national and international best available evidence in service provision through utilisation of clinical effectiveness processes promotes healthcare that is up to date, effective and consistent. </p><p>Clinical effectiveness incorporates the utilisation of quality assured National Clinical Guidelines, National Clinical Audit and general clinical practice guidance.  This is a quality improvement approach which promotes cost-effective healthcare that is evidence-based, with subsequent improved clinical decision-making and clinical outcomes.  Clinical effectiveness will underpin the models of care for the HSE's national  clinical programmes. </p><p>To date, the NCEC has quality assured 6 National Clinical Guidelines which have been endorsed by respective Ministers and mandated for implementation in the Irish health system.  These include:</p><p>1.  National Early Warning Score (NEWS);</p><p>2.  Prevention and Control of MRSA;</p><p>3.  Clostridium difficile;</p><p>4.  Irish Maternity Early Warning System ( IMEWS);</p><p>5.  Clinical Handover in Maternity Service; and</p><p>6.  Sepsis Management.</p><p>Their implementation will be monitored through the HSE Assurance Reports, compliance with HIQA's National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare and increased alignment with the Clinical Indemnity Scheme.</p></reply>

Nursing staff account for approximately one third of the workforce,  it is the biggest staff category, and consequently has experienced a greater reduction in number terms than other categories.</p>  <p>  Although there was a significant reduction in the number of nurses and midwives up to the end of 2013, the position is now improving.  Between the end of 2013 and the end of 2014 nursing and midwifery numbers increased by 365.  The recruitment rate has accelerated, and an extra 493 nurses and midwives have been taken on between December 2014 and March 2015.</p></reply>

As of 19 May, there are 668 delayed discharges nationally, of whom 381 are in the Dublin Academic Teaching Hospitals. This compares to a high of 830 in December 2014.</p><p>In Budget 2015, <b>&euro;25m </b>was provided to support services that provide alternative to, and relieve pressures on acute hospitals. </p><p>Of this &euro;25m:</p><p><b>- &euro;10m</b>was used to provide an additional 300 places under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme reducing the waiting time from a peak of 17 weeks to 11 weeks;</p><p><b>- &euro;8m</b>was allocated to provide access to an additional 115 short-stay beds across the Dublin area;</p><p><b>- &euro;5m</b>was used to provide 400 additional Home Care Packages which will benefit 600 people in the course of the year; and</p><p><b>- &euro;2m</b>was used to expand the community intervention team services in primary care across Dublin and the surrounding region.</p><p>At the beginning of April 2015, it was announced that an additional<b>&euro;74m</b>has been allocated to further tackle the on-going issue of delayed discharges, to reduce length of stay in hospitals and have faster assessment of patients in emergency departments. </p><p>Of this &euro;74m:</p><p><b>- &euro;44m </b>has been allocated to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme which will provide 1,600 places and has already reduced the waiting time for approved applicants down to 4 weeks from 11 weeks in March; the numbers on the national placement list have reduced down to 565 as of the 19 May 2015.</p><p>-  The remaining<b>&euro;30m</b>will meet the cost of measures additional to those covered by the above &euro;25m allocation which were needed because of the severity of the on-going pressures.  This included the provision of <b>1,819</b>(at 1st April 2015) additional transitional care beds on a temporary basis.  As a measure to address delayed discharges,<b>250</b>community care beds are to be opened up outside of acute hospitals on a permanent basis.</p><p>-  173 beds have been identified which can be opened on a short or long term basis and as a mix of short stay, rehab and long-term care. </p><p>As of  8 May, 110 of these beds are opened.</p><p>-  24 beds have been opened at Moorehall in Co. Louth.</p><p>-  65 beds are to be opened on a phased basis in Mount Carmel - as of 8 May 10 of these beds are opened.</p><p>The HSE is continuing to look at every possible options for alternative accommodation to address the issue of delayed discharges.  Among the priority areas identified for the health sector is the commitment to &quot;modernise health facilities&quot;.  This includes pursuing alternative public/private options to provide new community nursing units.</p><p>The Department has commissioned a research project to identify and assess the various policy options available to Government to encourage the provision, including the upgrading and refurbishment of nursing home and community nursing unit facilities in areas where they are needed.  This project is currently underway and is due for completion in July 2015.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable.  It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need i.e. Grade 5 or Grade 4 are provided with treatment by the HSE. </p><p>Waiting lists are compiled quarterly and for the intervals as shown.  The most recent figures available relate to Quarter 1 of 2015.  5,653 patients were awaiting assessment. This compares with 6,003 for the same period last year.  The number of  patients awaiting treatment has risen from 15,697 in Quarter 1 2014 to 18,025 in Quarter 1 2015.  Information on waiting times for treatment is as follows:<table><tr><th>Waiting time from assessment to commencement of treatment</th><th>1 - 6 months</th><th>7 - 12 months</th><th>13 - 24 months</th><th>25-36 months</th><th>37-48 months</th><th>Over 48 months</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>Grade 4</td><td>1,326</td><td>1,523</td><td>2,715</td><td>2,024</td><td>1,371</td><td>873</td><td>9,832</td></tr><tr><td>Grade 5</td><td>1,694</td><td>1,727</td><td>2,588</td><td>1,505</td><td>551</td><td>128</td><td>8,193</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>3,020</td><td>3,250</td><td>5,303</td><td>3,529</td><td>1,922</td><td>1,001</td><td>18,025</td></tr></table></p><p>The HSE has established a pilot scheme in Dublin North East which will involve the use of orthodontic therapists in the treatment of a number of eligible children.  Consideration will be given to expanding this Scheme to other HSE areas in the future.  In addition to the services provided by HSE staff, orthodontic treatment for certain categories of misalignment will be provided by a panel of independent practitioners under contract to the HSE over the next three years.  A national procurement process is being finalised.  This initiative will especially focus on those waiting for 4 years or longer.  It is expected that this initiative will commence later this year and will have a positive impact on waiting times.</p></reply>

It aims to  ensure that every person who is entitled to a medical card or a GP visit card is given the opportunity to avail of his or her entitlement which necessitates, in some cases, the provision of detailed personal and financial data and supporting documentation.  In addition, the HSE routinely examines for indications of medical or social circumstances, which might result in undue financial hardship in arranging medical services, and may seek additional information.  In exercising discretion, the HSE may grant eligibility for a medical card.  If a more streamlined application process, which required less information from people, were to apply, it could result in a more simplified but less sensitive assessment process relative to an  individual's circumstances. </p><p>Following on from the publication of the <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility</i>and the <i>Medical Card Process Review</i>in November 2014, a range of actions were identified to improve the operation of the medical card system, particularly for people with significant medical needs.</p><p>A detailed programme of reform was drawn up by the HSE with short, medium and long-term actions to be addressed over the period 2015-2016.  The HSE  appointed a senior manager, at Assistant National Director level, with specific responsibility for Primary Care Schemes and Eligibility, to lead the reform.  A Clinical Advisory Group was appointed to provide oversight and guidance to the operation of a more compassionate medical card system and will focus initially on the development of a framework for assessment and measurement of the burden of disease in this context.  The Group will provide an interim update on its work in June.</p><p>The HSE has already implemented a number of short term and medium term processes identified in the programme of reform and work is underway on  the longer term actions, some of which will be informed by the findings of the Clinical Advisory Group.  I can advise the Deputy that the HSE has put arrangements in place for a more integrated and sensitive processing of medical card applications involving significant medical conditions with greater interaction between the central office regarding the assessment of a person&rsquo;s eligibility and the local health office regarding the person&rsquo;s medical condition and the services that they may require.  The HSE has also appointed a senior manager to lead the reform of the systems for handling medical card application and reviews.</p></reply>

It should be noted, however, that the response to mental health issues is not the sole remit of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), and may for example, be more appropriately addressed in other care areas, such as Primary Care, or Disability. </p>  <p>  While a broad range of services support the mental health of children and adolescents, the term &lsquo;CAMHS&rsquo; is usually applied very specifically to services that provide specialist mental health treatment and care to young people up to 18 years of age, through a multidisciplinary team.  In 2015, the HSE National Service Plan objective for improved performance for the year is for 72% or greater of accepted referrals to Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams to be seen within three months, together with an overall 5% reduction in the waiting list, combined with a position where no-one is waiting over 12 months at end December 2015. </p>  <p>  In relation to waiting times for an appointment , the following should be noted:</p>  <p>  -  All cases are triaged and urgent cases seen as a priority.  Many of these urgent cases are seen within days.  55% of children seen in 2014 were seen in under 4 weeks.</p>  <p>  -  There has been an increased number of referrals to the service, including 16 and 17 yr. olds (over 50% of teams are seeing new referrals up to the age of 18 years, and the remainder new referrals up to the age of 17 years).</p>  <p>  -  In March last, there were around 1,800 children and adolescents waiting for a first appointment for longer than three months, of which some 480 were waiting more than 12 months for a first appointment with CAMHS.</p>  <p>  -  In March 2015, 75% of referrals nationally were offered a first appointment and seen within 12 weeks, with the year-to-date performance consistently ahead of the target of 72%.</p>  <p>  A targeted approach to addressing the needs of those waiting over 12 months, combined with maintaining targets for first appointments and seeing individuals within three months, is a priority for 2015.  A number of factors can contribute to an individual waiting longer than 12 months.  The HSE has an on-going CAMHS Service Improvement Project and is currently carrying out a specific Validation Exercise on the waiting lists, to improve various aspects of CAMHS service provision.</p>  <p>  I, and the HSE, will continue to progress and monitor the development of the CAMHS service, in line with agreed HSE Service Plan commitments, to ensure the adequacy of the service to meet current and future demands.</p></reply>

Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001/2002 levels. </p><p>In recent times, the Government has entered into a number of price reduction Agreements with both the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI) delivering a number of important benefits, including, significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future. Cumulative savings and cost avoidance generated from these Agreements between 2006 and 2014 amount to approximately &euro;1.5 billion.</p><p>Another important reform measure introduced to reduce the cost of drugs was the implementation of generic substitution and reference pricing, as provided for under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.<i></i>Reference pricing has generated approximately &euro;50 million in savings in 2014 and is expected to deliver a further &euro;25 million in 2015.

We discussed a range of legacy and political issues.  It was an opportunity also for the Secretary of State and me to discuss the current political impasse within the Northern Ireland Executive.</p>  <p>  I have remained in close contact with her since then on this matter, as I have also with the Northern Ireland Executive Parties and with US Senator Gary Hart.  It is disappointing that a resolution has not yet been found and I urge the Parties to consider the serious consequences of a continued failure to find a way forward.  The shared aim of the British and Irish Governments is to support the parties with a view to seeing the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement back on track.  Political stasis in Northern Ireland benefits no-one.</p>  <p>  On 19 May, I again raised with Secretary of State Villiers the issue of access by an independent international judicial figure to original documents in the possession of the British Government relating to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. She assured me that she is reflecting on how her Government can respond.  I also briefed her on my recent meeting with Justice for the Forgotten on 15 May, on the eve of ceremonies in Dublin to mark the 41st anniversary of the bombings.</p>  <p>  We discussed the Pat Finucane case.  I made clear that the Irish Government considers there was a political commitment made at the highest level by both Governments at Weston Park in 2001 in relation to the holding of public inquiries in a number of controversial cases and that this commitment remains unfulfilled in the case of Pat Finucane.</p>  <p>  I also outlined, as I had in the Seanad on 14 May, the Irish Government&rsquo;s serious concerns in relation to any proposal to replace the 1998 UK Human Rights Act without taking account of the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  The UK Human Rights Act of 1998 was the means of satisfying the obligation of the British Government arising from the Good Friday Agreement that the European Convention on Human Rights would be incorporated into Northern Ireland law.</p>  <p>  The Secretary of State and I discussed and welcomed the then approaching visit of TRH the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall to Ireland and Northern Ireland. I believe the visit served as a further contribution to building peace and reconciliation on this island.</p></reply>

This was the first meeting of EU Foreign Ministers since the formation of the Israeli government, and in the run up to the meeting I had urged High Representative (HR) Mogherini to include the Peace Process on the Council agenda.  The exchange of views was frank, and Ministers will return to the issue next month for more substantive discussions.  For my part, in the exchange of views that took place, I emphasised that the EU has the capacity to make a positive difference and, further, that we have a responsibility to act.  The Peace Process itself is at a standstill.  We know that events on the ground are rapidly closing the window on a possible two-state solution.  We must act to defend that solution which is the core of our policy on the Middle East Peace Process and the only path that will provide peace, security and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians alike.  I look forward to continuing discussions on the Peace Process next month - at which time HR Mogherini and newly-appointed EU Special Representative for the Peace Process, Fernando Gentilini, will report back to Ministers on their visit to the region, which took place last week.   Foreign Ministers briefly addressed the crisis on the ground in Burundi, where Conclusions were adopted condemning the violence, and re-iterating support for the UN Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region, Sa&iuml;d Djinnit. Concern was also expressed about the crisis in Macedonia.  It was agreed to monitor the situation closely, and to discuss the matter again at the Council in the near future.</p>  <p>  The Council also met in joint session with Foreign and Defence Ministers, where initally, in the presence of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, we had an exchange of views on the security situation in the EU&rsquo;s broader neighbourhood. </p>  <p>  The Council &ndash; EU Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers only &ndash; then proceeded to discuss  preparations for the European Council in June, where Heads of State and Government will discuss the Union&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).  Ministers adopted a comprehensive set of conclusions on CSDP which will feed into that discussion.  Key areas covered by the conclusions include enhancing the effectiveness, visibility and impact of CSDP in contributing to international peace and security; enhancing the development of capabilities required for that purpose and improving the capacity of European industry to provide those capabilities.  The conclusions highlight the fact that the EU and its Member States, through CSDP and other policy instruments, have a strong role to play in preventing and managing conflicts and addressing their causes. </p>  <p>  HR Mogherini then outlined to us her thinking on a new European Foreign Policy and Security Strategy.  An assessment of the changed global environment will be prepared by HR Mogherini for consideration by Heads of State and Government when they meet next month.  It is expected that work will then commence on drafting a new European Foreign Policy and Security Strategy in consultation with the Member States - Ireland will participate fully in this process. Indeed, having recently concluded a review of our own national foreign policy strategy, I believe it is timely that a similar exercise is conducted at EU level.</p>  <p>  Discussions then turned to follow up to the Special Meeting of the European Council on 23 April, attended by the Taoiseach, which addressed the migration crisis in the Mediterranean.  The FAC adopted a Decision to establish a European Union operation in the Southern Central Mediterranean to disrupt the smuggler networks that drive this criminal trade in human misery and exploit vulnerable people for profit.  The Mission will be called EUNAVFOR MED and will implement its mandate in several phases. In discussions to date Ireland has insisted that the EUNAVFOR MED operation should be carried out in full accordance with international law.  The establishment of this operation is one strand of the comprehensive approach being pursued by the EU to tackle the root causes of the human emergency and to prevent the loss of more lives at sea which also includes continued provision of development  assistance to build capacity in source countries and performance of search and rescue tasks as necessary.  This follows on from the commitment made by Heads of State and Government to use all of the tools at the EU&rsquo;s disposal for this purpose.</p></reply>

The North West Gateway Initiative, the current position on the North South Consultative Forum and other matters of topical concern, in particular cross-border smuggling and fuel laundering, are other matters which are expected to be discussed at the meeting.</p>  <p>  The forthcoming Plenary meeting of the Council also offers an opportunity for substantive discussions with our Northern Ireland colleagues on shared interests such as increasing trade and business activity and EU matters, including the new PEACE and INTERREG Cross-Border Programmes.   </p>  <p>  I am looking forward to the Plenary meeting and to continuing, with my colleagues in Government, to actively pursue our priorities for advancing cooperation with the Northern Ireland Executive, primarily through the structures of the Council.</p></reply>

When state monies were provided to facilitate building works to school property owned by a third party, a legal mechanism had to be put in place in order to protect the State's interest.  This was known as a Charging Lease or Declaration of Trust.  These leases protect the Minister's capital investment in the school property and require that the property be used as a school for a set period.</p>  <p>  As a result of negotiations in the late 1990s on the reconstitution of Boards of Management, an agreement was reached whereby patrons agreed to cede representatives on the Boards of Management in lieu of the Department agreeing to insert a Deed of Variation into the existing property lease.  The objective of this Deed of Variation is to provide security for the denominational ethos of a school in cases where a patron or trustee owns the property.  Discussions have taken place with the relevant patron bodies over the years to obtain a mutually acceptable solution which meets this objective and these discussions are ongoing.</p>  <p>  The Deed of Variation refers to a change in the terms of a charging lease or Declaration of Trust.  With regard to admission policies, irrespective of property or Charging Lease arrangements, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  The Equal Status Act, 2000 provides that an educational establishment does not discriminate where the establishment is a school providing primary or post-primary education to students and the objective of the school is to provide education in an environment which promotes certain religious values, it admits persons of a particular religious denomination in preference to others or it refuses to admit as a student a person who is not of that denomination and, in the case of a refusal, it is proved that the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.</p>  <p>  Article 44.2.4 of the Constitution states that legislation providing State aid for schools shall not discriminate between schools under the management of different religious denominations, nor be such as to affect prejudicially the right of any child to attend a school receiving public money without attending religious instruction at that school. In this regard, Section 30 of the Education Act (1998), provides that no student can be required to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student.  Therefore, parents have the right, if so desired, to ensure that their children do not receive religious instruction.</p>  <p>  The objective of the recently published Education (Admission to Schools) Bill is to provide an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent.</p>  <p>  The Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation.  The Bill, while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect in their admission policy the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation, requires schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion.  The Bill also requires schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.</p></reply>

As this arrangement was approved outside of the general terms of the scheme it was not advertised.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Home Tuition scheme, home tuition is terminated in respect of a child for whom a school placement has been identified.  The private providers which are currently the subject of parent requested arrangements all facilitate the take up of identified placements in state funded schools.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Charitable organisation to which the Deputy also refers, it was clear to this Department that this organisation had no plans to facilitate the take up of school placements when such had been identified by the NCSE. This position was confirmed by this organisation in a comprehensive submission in 2011, in which it was made clear under section 9(b) that  the placement of the child in this organisation would replace the State funded placement until after the child reached 6 years.  The correspondent in this matter has been informed directly that my Department  could not agree to this proposal and has not agreed to such a proposal with any other private provider.</p></reply>

The letter added that applications for three children not approved for home tuition were to be submitted subsequently.</p>  <p>  Therefore the approach in my official's response was to advise that new applications for home tuition were to be processed in line with the relevant circular and outlined the general conditions for payment which were at that time compatible with arrangements in place for the aforementioned four children for whom tuition had been provided.</p></reply>

One of the key features of the new procedures is that the qualification period for the granting of an initial Contract of Indefinite Duration (CID) is reduced from a period of continuous employment in excess of three years with the same employer to a period of continuous employment in excess of two years. It remains the case that the post must continue to be viable for a reasonable period considered to be at least a full school year.</p>  <p>  Previously a post which concerned providing cover for a teacher absent on an approved scheme of leave of absence did not provide eligibility for a CID.  In line with the recommendations of the Expert Group eligibility for a CID is extended to include providing cover for a teacher absent on two specific schemes of absence but this is confined to covering the absence of a teacher on career break or secondment.</p>  <p>  Also in line with the recommendations of the Expert Group once a teacher has completed his or her first year of fixed-term employment in a school and the hours are available for that post for the following year, that position should be automatically re-advertised by the school and a new recruitment process undertaken for the filling of the post for the second year.   From the commencement of the 2015/16 school year, there is now a requirement that schools must certify to the Department that when a teacher is being placed on the payroll for a second year of continuous employment the post was advertised, interviews were conducted and that the teacher was successful following interview.  As an interim measure for the 2015/16 school year any teacher who has entered their third or more year of continuous employment may be considered for the award of a CID providing they satisfy the terms and conditions of circular 0023/2015 without the requirement of an interview at the end of their first fixed-term contract. </p></reply>

These secondments are subject to annual review. The arrangements provide flexibility and ensure that the in-service needs of teachers and other support priorities of the school system can be met within the resources available. </p>  <p>  Having teachers with relevant and recent teaching experience and expertise is a key requirement for the role. It is a condition therefore that the maximum length of time that a teacher may be on secondment is five years, following which they return to their teaching roles within their schools. In this way, their expertise and knowledge is not lost to the system.</p>  <p>  These teacher secondment arrangements were disseminated extensively so the necessary planning could take place at all levels including education centres, support services, school boards of management and individual teacher. </p>  <p>  Overall, secondment numbers available to my Department are limited and HR planning to meet business needs in terms of supporting national priorities is essential. </p>  <p>  The support services, including PDST, have engaged in succession planning as a key strategy in ensuring continued support for teachers and school leaders in implementing national education policy priorities and CPD and which allows for continuity, quality planning and management.</p>  <p>  A limited alleviation of the application of the five year limit, where required, has been agreed to allow secondees to serve for a further limited period. It is Department policy to apply alleviations to meet the business needs of each of the services, for example, to provide for continuity in management, planning and leadership and retention of expertise. Decisions are taken following consultation with service management and other groups where appropriate. Circumstances will vary across services and my Department's overall priority is to ensure continuity of professional development support for teachers and schools within the available resources.</p></reply>

The school was notified accordingly.The Primary Staffing Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>  <p>  I recognise that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities and will continue to be so. It is for that reason that I recently announced that a voluntary protocol for amalgamation is being developed for the very smallest schools. The protocol is still under development. Under the protocol, it is envisaged that the Department will write to the patrons of all such schools that are located within an 8km distance of another school of similar patronage and language of instruction. The letter will invite them to reflect on the benefits that amalgamation opportunities might provide in order to create more sustainable school communities into the future. Engagement with the protocol will be entirely voluntary.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the improvement in the staffing levels for small schools contained in my Department's Circular 0005/2015, which is available on my Department's website at www.education.gov.ie.

The special requirements of elderly persons and people with a disability are specifically highlighted in this regard.</p><p>Individual planning decisions are taken in this context, balancing the various perspectives and factors involved, including the amenity of adjoining properties.

These draft revisions proposed:</p><p>- The setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments,</p><p>- A mandatory minimum setback of 500 metres between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations, and</p><p>- The complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings.</p><p>A public consultation process was initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the Guidelines, which ran until February 21 2014. My Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this public consultation process. It is intended that the revisions to the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines will be finalised as soon as possible. In this regard, account has to be taken of the extensive response to the public consultation in framing the final guidelines. Further work is also advancing to develop technical appendices to assist planning authorities with the practical application of the noise measurement aspects of the Wind Guidelines.</p><p>The revisions to the Wind Energy Development Guidelines 2006, when finalised, will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions under the Planning Acts.</p><p>In the interim, the 2006 Guidelines will continue to apply to existing planning applications, including those currently with An Bord Pleanala.</p></reply>

The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.</p><p>Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 28 July 2014, the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot commenced with effect from 15 September 2014 in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council. HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils from 1 October. </p><p>While HAP is not currently available for all classes of qualified household in the Dublin City Council area, on 18 December 2014, Dublin City Council became part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households. Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities. South Dublin County Council is the only Dublin Local Authority that currently operates HAP in respect of all other classes of qualified household in its area.</p><p>The Dublin Homeless HAP Pilot is provided for through the following two statutory instruments which are available on at the links provided:</p><p>- Housing Assistance Payment (Section 50) (No. 3) Regulations 2014 (S.I. No.575 of 2014) and</p><p>- Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2014 (S.I. No. 576 of 2014)  </p><p>During the legislation&rsquo;s passage through the Oireachtas in July 2014 an undertaking was given that a progress report would be prepared for the relevant Oireachtas Committee. Data from the pilot sites has been gathered and I submitted a report to the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht last month. Based on the findings of that review, HAP commenced in Donegal County Council on 25 May 2015 and consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of a further cohort of local authorities to commence HAP on an incremental basis this year. There are now over 2,000 households in receipt of HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot scheme and these additional local authorities will assist in achieving the 2015 HAP delivery target as set out in the Strategy.</p></reply>

Hydro electricity makes a significant contribution to our renewable electricity. In April 2015 there was 2,576MW of renewable electricity connected to the Irish Grid, 238MW of which was from hydro. Onshore wind contributed 2256MW, and biomass contributed 82 MW.</p>  <p>  Additionally, there is approximately 3760MW of renewable electricity generation with signed grid connection offers. This is predominantly wind generation.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that rules are in place to deal with &ldquo;priority dispatch&rdquo;, i.e., when electricity generators produce more electricity than the grid can handle at a particular time. Those rules are implemented in the All Island Electricity Market by the Single Electricity Market Committee. While this is a matter in which I have no function, I would highlight that EU Regulation 2009/28/EU requires Member States to give priority dispatch to renewable generation on the electricity grid, including to hydro-electric generators, unless the generator concerned has elected to forego priority dispatch and to trade in the market. It is the case that hydro-electric generators who have elected to avail of priority dispatch may have their output reduced under certain circumstances. In such instances, these hydro generators are compensated in the Single Electricity Market.</p></reply>

Funding for the protection of built heritage will continue to be provided by my Department in 2015 via a number of schemes, which will be either directly administered or delivered through local authorities and agencies.</p><p>Recently I announced the awarding of &euro;624,000 in funding under the Structures at Risk Fund 2015,<i></i>to enable conservation works to twenty-eight heritage structures throughout the country, in both private and public ownership, deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration and which are protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  This Fund, which is being administered through the local authorities, encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helps to secure the preservation of protected structures, which might otherwise be lost.  The Fund was open to two applications per local authority, of which one application may be in respect of a privately-owned building.  The amount of funding available per project was subject to a minimum level of &euro;15,000 and a maximum level of &euro;60,000.  Since 2011, approximately 130 structures have been safeguarded for the future as a result of the Structures at Risk Fund.  </p><p>The remainder of my Department&rsquo;s built heritage capital budget for 2015 will be focused on the conservation and presentation of the State's heritage portfolio, which is managed by the Office of Public Works.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  The Council recently announced funding for 197 heritage projects its 2015 Community-based Heritage Grants Scheme totalling &euro;547,000.  The scheme, which supports the continuing conservation and development of Irish heritage through local community based groups, is expected to generate total investment of more than &euro;1 million.
