    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-13a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061300042#WRA00500"><p>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended sets out the process for the granting of a certificate of naturalisation. It is open to any individual to lodge an application for a certificate of naturalisation at any time if they consider they are in a position to meet the prescribed statutory requirements. In reaching a decision on applications full consideration is given to each case and I can say that in the vast majority cases the result is a positive decision for the applicant. For example, in 2012 over 98% of eligible applications resulted in a positive outcome.  Where a decision is made to refuse an application it is open to the person concerned to lodge a new application. However, in doing so they should bear in mind the reasons for refusal of their previous applications. For the sake of completeness, over 50,000 applications for naturalisation have been approved since I was appointed.  </p><p>  Visa required nationals are required to set out full details in a visa application of their reason for seeking to come to Ireland.  The visa, if granted, is pre-clearance to the person concerned to arrive at an approved port of entry and seek permission to enter.  Visa required nationals who wish to migrate to the State to take up employment must, in the great majority of cases, apply for and be granted a work permit before applying for a visa.  A minority of those seeking to come to Ireland to work, i.e.,  for periods of less than six months, may not need to apply for a work permit, but must apply for, and be granted, a visa.</p><p>  The procedure to appeal a Visa Refusal is the same for all Visa Application types. The only stipulation is that the appeal must be submitted in writing within two months of the refusal date. On receipt of the appeal, the Appeals Officer - who is a more senior immigration official - will review the application, taking account of any additional information or documentation submitted in support of the appeal. If the Appeals Officer does not alter the decision the applicant is notified in writing.  If the appeal is successful then a Visa will be issued to the applicant. For the information of the Deputy, the approval rate for 'employment' visas at first instance is approximately 98%.</p><p>  The issue and renewal of work permits is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Where a person is granted a work permit and requires a visa in order to come to Ireland to take up employment, the matter is expedited by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service subject to normal immigration controls.  Re-entry visas are issued to visa required work permit holders who wish to leave the State for short periods for business or personal reasons.</p></reply>

The Insolvency Service is currently in the process of finalising Regulations governing the above matters and I expect to be signing them in the coming days. I understand that the ISI will publish the Regulations on the ISI website, www.isi.gov.ie, shortly thereafter. This will allow those interested in working as Approved Intermediaries or Personal Insolvency Practitioners to apply to the Insolvency Service for authorisation.</p><p>  It is therefore my expectation that distressed debtors will be in a position to meet with Approved Intermediaries and Personal Insolvency Practitioners and begin to receive initial advice from them in early July. Subsequently, the ISI can begin processing applications shortly thereafter. </p></reply>

The Attorney General, who has traditionally acted as the formal link with the Judiciary, also attends the Group accompanied by the Secretary General to the Government.  As I indicated in response to Parliamentary Question No. 673 of 11 June 2013, there have been two meetings of the Group to date and it is intended that the Group will meet on an ongoing basis.</p><p>  The Deputy may also recall that the Programme for Government undertakes to &#8220;<i>legislate to establish a Judicial Council, with lay representation, to provide an effective mechanism for dealing with complaints against judges</i>  &#8221; and this commitment is being given expression in the form of the proposed Judicial Council Bill.  As well as providing for the establishment of a Judicial Council and Board that will promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges, the proposed Bill is aimed at providing a means of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct supported by the establishment of a Judicial Conduct Committee which will have lay representation.  The Judicial Council will be a formal statutory body, it will be independent and, it is important to note, will be a distinct entity from that of the Association of Judges of Ireland which has a different remit.</p><p>  In November 2011, the judiciary agreed to establish an Interim Judicial Council pending the publication and enactment of the proposed Judicial Council Bill.  A sub-committee of the Board of the Interim Judicial Council was subsequently established to consider the General Scheme for a Judicial Council Bill and its observations have been duly considered in my Department taking account of intervening developments and of current Government policy.  Work on the detailed drafting of the new Bill continues, therefore, in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel.  Under the Government's Legislation Programme publication of the Bill is expected later this year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-13a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061300042#WRA01200"><p>Since March 2011 the conflict in Syria has led to a dire humanitarian crisis.  According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees at least 1,600,000 Syrians have fled into countries neighbouring Syria.  To date approximately 37,000 Syrians have applied for asylum in the Member States of the European Union.</p><p>  The BBC Newsnight television programme to which the Deputy refers included elements regarding the situation of asylum seekers and irregular migrants in Greece.  The systemic deficiencies in the asylum procedure and in the reception conditions of asylum seekers in Greece have been on the agenda of the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council since Greece presented its Action Plan on Migration Management and Asylum Reform to the European Commission in August 2010.  At the most recent meeting of the Council on 6 and 7 June 2013, the Greek Minister provided information regarding progress in the implementation of the Action Plan.  The Council noted that considerable progress has been made to improve Greece&rsquo;s asylum and migration systems and that there is more work to be done.</p><p>  The Refugee Act 1996 provides that a person who arrives at the frontiers of the State, or who is in the State, may apply for asylum in Ireland.  Accordingly, I do not have any statutory responsibility in respect of persons seeking asylum in another EU Member State.</p><p>  Since the beginning of the conflict a total of 51 Syrians have applied for asylum in Ireland.  In compliance with the EU Asylum Procedures Directive, persons applying for asylum in Ireland are guaranteed access to the asylum determination procedure and have the right to remain in Ireland pending the examination of the application.  Also, I can confirm that since March 2011 no Syrian national has either been deported from Ireland or transferred from Ireland to Greece under the EU Dublin System.</p><p>  The European Union as a whole is one of the leading international response actors in the Syrian crisis.  Member States and the Commission have mobilised humanitarian funding of approximately &euro;900 million.  These funds are allocated for use both within Syria and to assist those fleeing the violence into neighbouring countries including Lebanon and Jordan.  To date Ireland has provided over &euro;8.15 million in assistance for Syria and the wider region.  This overall contribution includes Ireland's pledge of &euro;4.7 million made at the High Level Donor Pledging Conference for Syria in Kuwait City on 30 January 2013 attended by my colleague, Minister of State for Trade and Development Joe Costello.  This pledge was promptly met in full.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-13a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061300042#WRA01400"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Diversion Programme operates in accordance with Part 4 of the Children Act 2001, as amended, and under the general superintendence and control of the Garda Commissioner.   The programme embraces, whenever possible, the principles of restorative justice and has regard to the needs of the victims of youth offending.  An Annual Report of the Committee appointed to monitor the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme is published each year which gives details of the resources deployed by the Commissioner in relation to the Programme. The reports are available on the website of my Department via the Irish Youth Justice Service link.  The latest published report indicates that there are 123 Juvenile Liaison Officer (JLO) posts comprising of 115 Garda&iacute; and 8 JLO Sergeants.  </p><p>  The work of the Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers under the Diversion Programme is supported by the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) through the 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) located across the country. The Garda Youth Diversion Projects are multi-agency crime prevention initiatives managed by community based organisations in cooperation with the local Garda District Officers.  These projects seek to divert young people from becoming involved or further involved in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour. Last year approximately 5,100 young people engaged with these projects. Provisional funding of &euro;11.5 million has been allocated to the GYDPs for 2013. </p><p>  Moving on to restorative justice and its role in impacting on youth crime; I should say that, essentially, the delivery of restorative justice approaches are primarily a matter for IYJS strategic partners - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Young Persons Division of the Probation Service.  Restorative justice in the context of youth crime was introduced on a statutory basis for the first time in the Children Act 2001, as amended, with two restorative justice initiatives provided for in the Act: a restorative conference or restorative caution included in the Garda Diversion Programme and a court-ordered restorative justice family conference delivered through the Probation Service. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na use restorative justice processes in the delivery of the Diversion Programme under Part 4 of the  Act. The Diversion Report referred to earlier indicates that JLOs dealt with over 900 cases in 2011 using a restorative justice approach. In addition, since 2010 JLOs have been collaborating with local communities and other agencies, in particular the Probation Service, in delivering training and developing restorative practice in the community.  Restorative Justice philosophy and approaches have also been promoted through the training provided to Garda Youth Diversion Project staff and this training is ongoing.</p><p>  In regard to the Probation Service, all Young Persons Probation staff have been trained in the preparation, delivery and action planning/monitoring which are essential to the restorative family conference (as provided for under Part 8 of the Children Act 2001 as amended).  The Probation Service in conjunction with its partner agencies has also introduced and consolidated a number of restorative practices and approaches in the management of court ordered supervision in the community and more infrequently supervision following a period of detention. I am satisfied with the work undertaken to date and the ongoing developments in the further roll out of restorative youth justice initiatives and will continue to monitor the impact of these latest developments on an ongoing basis.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to add that the Diversion Programme has been shown to be successful in diverting young offenders away from crime by offering guidance and support to the young people and their families. Tackling youth crime continues to be a key priority for this Government as set out in the Programme for Government and I am committed to continuing the Programme as is reflected in the resources available to the Garda Commissioner and the 2013 budget for the GYDPs which remains similar to the budget of 2012.</p></reply>

This arises from reports of  difficulties in bringing successful prosecutions under that section in relation to domestic and sexual violence.  I understand that the Law Reform Commission expects to complete a discussion or consultation paper shortly in relation to their consideration of the provision.  I expect that their paper will also consider whether stalking should be specifically provided for in legislation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-13a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061300043#WRB00300"><p>It is of course the case that a resumption of Garda recruitment, at a time when both overall headcount and the size of the pay bill in the public service must be reduced, would have financial implications that must be managed within the overall resources available to Government.  In that context, it is important that the LRC proposals, or what is now known as the Haddington Road Agreement, on saving &euro;1 billion from the public service pay bill, including &euro;300 million this year are fully implemented.  I am aware that the Garda associations are currently balloting their members, and I will await the outcome of this process.</p><p>  Importantly, those proposals contain provisions for a review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which would start in September and would include an examination of the structure, organisation and staffing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The outcome of such a review would be an important determining factor in any final decision on Garda staffing levels.</p><p>  However, and whatever the approved staffing complement might be at any time, I do believe that it is important for an organisation such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to have some regular intakes of new recruits, even if on a modest scale.  I am currently engaged in discussion with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to see how this aim can best be progressed.</p><p>  I do have to again remind the House, however, that the expenditure ceilings for the years 2012 to 2014 planned by the last Government would have resulted in an average of &euro;90 million less for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na budget each year for 2012, 2013 and 2014 than is the case under this Government.  Such a scenario would have necessitated a significant further reduction, rather than an increase, in Garda strength.</p></reply>

For the purpose of preventing complaints arising or of reducing the number of complaints, the Minister under section 106 may request the Garda Ombudsman Commission to examine a practice, policy or procedure of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This request may be made on the Minister's own initiative or following a recommendation by the Garda Ombudsman Commission.  While I will certainly consider the suggestion which has been made that the Garda Ombudsman Commission should be enabled to carry out such an examination on its own initiative, it is worth emphasising that, in its core role in the oversight of the investigation of complaints against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda Ombudsman Commission may not only investigate any complaint itself, but may also, even in the absence of a complaint, and if it appears to it to be desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate any matter that appears to it to indicate that a member may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary hearings. </p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 has clarified the roles and responsibilities of the Minister and the Garda Commissioner in relation to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the relationship between them.  The Act provides that the Garda Commissioner is accountable to the Minister for the performance of the Commissioner's functions and those of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and of course the Minister is in turn accountable to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The Act also made the Commissioner the Accounting Officer for the Force, and liable in that capacity to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have no current plans to alter this accountability structure.</p></reply>

At that time there were approximately 22,000 applications awaiting decision, many of which had been waiting for 3 years or longer. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the significant increase in the volume of valid applications received from 12,500 in 2010 to just under 20,000 in 2012 &ndash; an increase of almost 60%, more than  55,000 decisions on naturalisation applications have been made since I came into office and 25,000 certificates for naturalisation were issued last year alone.  It is my intention that we continue to build on this success this year and, in this regard, over 15,000 valid applications have been decided to date in 2013.</p><p>  I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that a valid application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in December 2010.</p><p>  The application is at an  advanced stage of processing and I am advised  will be submitted to me for decision shortly. While good progress continues to be made in reducing the large volume of cases on hands, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that for a broad range of reasons some cases will take longer than others to process. It is a statutory requirement that, inter alia, applicants for naturalisation be of good character. In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</p><p>  It is my objective that the vast majority of applications be determined within 6 months of receipt. Achieving this can also be delayed by applicants failing to furnish necessary documents or the need to seek additional information on foot of an application received.</p></reply>

Neither I, as Minister, nor my Department have any function in such matters.</p><p>  Insofar as the Immigration Service is concerned the granting of an Immigration Stamp 4 denotes that the holder has an immigration permission to be in the State and the right to work without the need for an Employment Permit.

Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served. It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p><p>  A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty. The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.</p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. </p><p>  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.</p><p>  I believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.</p><p>Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law. In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public. My intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided. I am also taking the opportunity to introduce some general improvements to bail law to improve the overall working of the bail system. I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter as soon as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities.    <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>  In relation to the statistics requested by the Deputy. the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. I have requested the CSO to provide relevant statistics directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is also worth noting that, even after the closures, there will still be more Garda stations across the country than there are police stations in comparable jurisdictions.  I am confident that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to provide a professional policing service right across the country in a manner that is effective and is consistent with the highest standards for which the force is renowned.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-13a.71.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061300044#WRC01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 134 together.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that organised crime, by its very nature, is constantly evolving and diversifying in both its structures and activities and that membership of organised crime groups tends to be fluid.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are two categories of organised crime groups operating within this jurisdiction.  The first category consists of groups that are well established and tightly structured and are involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offences.  The second category involves groups whose activities are characterised by less cohesive group structures, and criminal activities which are mainly confined to Ireland.  The operation of these groups is monitored on an ongoing basis by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  Tackling organised crime remains a key ongoing priority for both the Government and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This priority is clearly reflected in the Garda Policing Plan for 2013 which sets out the continued commitment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to pro-actively target groups and individuals engaged in organised criminal activities.  The threat posed by organised crime is an ongoing threat that is tackled on a continuous basis both at national level and at international level.  As such it does not lend itself to the setting of a timetable.  However, we should recall that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are on an ongoing basis successfully bringing people involved in organised crime activities before the Courts and securing convictions.</p><p>  At European level, Ireland participates very constructively in the negotiation of initiatives and legislative instruments to strengthen police and judicial cooperation.  Just last week, under the Irish Presidency, the Justice and Home Affairs Council adopted conclusions on setting the EU's priorities for the fight against serious and organised crime between 2014 and 2017.  These conclusions will now inform the implementation by law enforcement agencies across Europe of multi-annual strategic plans and annual action plans in respect of each of the priorities.  I can also assure the House that I am committed to ensuring that all necessary legislative provisions are in place to give effect to our international commitments and to support the operational actions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  As I have previously indicated to the House, I am keeping under review the legislative framework underpinning the State's response to organised crime, including the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, to see whether any further improvements could be made in this area.  In addition, work on the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill, which will provide for the establishment and operation of the database to assist the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their investigations, is very well advanced.  I expect to be in a position to publish the Bill this term and am determined that it will be enacted this year.</p><p>  On the question of attacks on garda&iacute;, the Deputy will be aware that section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 provides specific protections in this regard.  I believe that it is absolutely right that the criminal law should afford garda&iacute; and other emergency workers such specific protection and that strong penalties should apply.  With regard to the issue of bail law, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter as soon as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities.</p></reply>

Such funds are paid into the Government&rsquo;s Central Fund, from which the Government draws for expenditure on all necessary public services and investment.  From time to time, it has been suggested that such monies should be used to fund community projects.  However, while it has been accepted that there may be some symbolic value in the suggestion, it is considered problematic and raises a number of practical difficulties.</p><p>  A policy of ring-fencing monies obtained by the Exchequer and the reallocation of these for a specific purpose runs contrary to the normal Estimates process.  While allowing for a small number of very specific targeted exceptions, it is believed that earmarking revenues for a specific expenditure programme would, in general, constrain the Government in the implementation of its overall expenditure policy.  There is also the problem of additional costs which would accrue in the administration of any scheme to divert such funds to local projects and additional administrative costs without any additional revenues being generated.  It could also be argued that a significant proportion of the monies secured by the Bureau are already owed to the Exchequer as it often relates to non-payment of taxes and social welfare fraud.</p><p>  In the current economic climate the Exchequer could not sustain a loss of revenue without making compensatory adjustments.  If the monies collected by the bureau were to be diverted to community projects, there would inevitably be implications for any other monies those projects received from the Exchequer.  Alternatively, other public expenditure programmes would have to sustain the loss.  There are currently no proposals to change the existing arrangements concerning such monies.</p></reply>

Non-EEA nationals, including students, residing in Ireland for more than three months must register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  The table is based on a series of snapshots taken in March 2011, 2012 and 2013 of the resident non-EEA student population at that time.  The table also indicates the number of those students who had first registered within the preceding 12 months (i.e. new students)</p><p>Not all students require visas to travel to Ireland.  However the statistics cover all registered non-EEA national students whether they are visa required or not and, as such, provides a more accurate representation of the number of international students who have come to Ireland in the years requested.</p><p><table><tr><th></th><th><div>March 2011</div></th><th><div>March 2012</div></th><th><div>March 2013</div></th></tr><tr><td>New Student Registrations</td><td><div>9061</div></td><td><div>7375</div></td><td><div>12224</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total Student Registrations</td><td><div>29911</div></td><td><div>28354</div></td><td><div>28962</div></td></tr></table></p><p>All of the above students are registered on a &quot;Stamp 2&quot; student permission which allows access to the Irish labour market without the need for an employment permit from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  That access is limited to 20 hours per week during academic terms and 40 hours per week during college holidays.</p><p>While there may be some potential for displacement it should be noted that the concession whereby students are permitted to work is similar to that in many of our competitor countries and it is seen by providers as a vital element of the &quot;package&quot; offered by Ireland when we seek to attract foreign students.  This concession together with the high quality of our education offering has facilitated the growth of a significant international student sector in Ireland which is a important  contributor to national economic activity.</p><p>Moreover, the international education sector provides significant employment and income for the Irish economy and any analysis of the student work concession must be balanced against this contribution.  The Government believes that there is significant potential for Ireland in attracting international students to study at high quality institutions.  My colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, is implementing a comprehensive reform process in the education sector including the establishment of the new Qualifications and Quality Agency and plans to establish a Quality Mark for English language schools and further and higher education colleges as part of efforts to get more international students to study here.</p><p>This work is operating in tandem with ongoing reform of the student immigration regime.  The value of the work concession is clear in terms of promoting Ireland's quality education sector in a competitive market.  However it would be naive to ignore the capacity of the student migration route to be abused by economic migrants and by less scrupulous parties seeking to facilitate their entry to the State.  Therefore the concession must be seen as inextricably linked with and dependent on the ongoing work led by the Department of Education and Skills in the area of quality assurance, the commitment of service providers to quality standards and the maintenance of effective immigration controls at all stages of the process.</p></reply>

This Group is charged with developing the Plan and monitoring its future implementation. The Group comprises representatives of relevant government departments, the City and County Managers Association, the National Disability Authority, the Disability Stakeholder Group and a number of people appointed in their personal capacity to bring their lived experience to the Group.  Significant consultation has taken place and drafting of the Plan is at a very advanced stage. The next meeting of the NDSIG is scheduled for 20th June and it is anticipated that the Plan will be finalised at this meeting. The Plan will be published as soon as possible thereafter.</p></reply>

Shortly after taking up office, I moved urgently to introduce additional legislation in this area which was enacted as the Criminal Justice Act 2011, and provides vital assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the completion of current white collar crime investigations, as well as providing assistance to them in future investigations.

It is to be hoped that Croatia&rsquo;s imminent accession will prove to be an inspiration for the other countries of the Western Balkans, including Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Along with international partners, it is the EU's aim to support a stable and viable Bosnia and Herzegovina co-operating peacefully with its neighbours and irreversibly on track towards EU membership.  EU membership for Bosnia and Herzegovina is firmly tied to the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the country.</p><p>  The path to EU membership for Bosnia and Herzegovina is clear.  The EU has set out its strategy towards Bosnia and Herzegovina in the European Council conclusions of March 2011 and the successive reinforcing conclusions. Since September 2011 the EU has installed a reinforced and comprehensive presence in the country combining the assets of the European Commission and the European External Action Service, through an EUSR office. The EU military force EUFOR ALTHEA remains present in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p><p>  A High Level Dialogue on Accession was launched in June 2012 which saw agreement between the political leaders on a roadmap towards accession.  It is regrettable that campaigning in advance of the municipal elections in October last year saw this positive atmosphere eroded. </p><p>  The EU has made great efforts to encourage the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to move forward with reforms.  There is obvious disappointment that the efforts that the EU has made on the ground to move Bosnia along have reached an impasse.  The EU will now need to examine what else can be done and I believe this can best be done in the context of a review of the EU Special Representative&rsquo;s mandate, which I hope to see taken forward by High Representative Ashton in July. </p><p>  However, I must emphasise that while we will do everything in our power to encourage movement on the path to EU integration, this is ultimately a matter for the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Recent diplomatic efforts, particularly the initiative of the US and Russia aimed at bringing both sides in Syria to a further peace conference in Geneva on the basis of the Geneva Communiqu&eacute; of June 2012, will undoubtedly be central to our discussions.  With preparations already underway under the guidance of SG Ban and Special Envoy Brahimi, the Council is likely to consider the degree of engagement on all sides with the US-Russia initiative and how the EU can help to ensure that this conference is successfully convened.  The renewal of the EU&rsquo;s sanctions against Syria, including the arms embargo, was extensively discussed at the last Foreign Affairs Council which I attended in Brussels on 27 May.  While I regret that the Council was unable to agree to renew the EU arms embargo against Syria, it was noted in the Council Declaration which accompanied the Decision on renewal of the rest of the sanctions package that no member State intending to do so will proceed at this stage with the delivery of arms to Syria.  It was agreed that the Council will review its position before 1 August, on the basis of a report from the High Representative on developments related to the US-Russia initiative and on the engagement of the Syrian parties.  Syria is likely to figure prominently on the agenda for the first FAC meeting of the Lithuanian Presidency in July.</p></reply>

While commending the high participation and orderly, calm conduct of the elections, EU High Representative Ashton expressed concern at the growing polarisation of Venezuelan society.  She added that it is important that the outcome of the vote can be accepted by all and that appeals be duly considered by the competent Venezuelan authorities.  Following a full audit of the April elections, on 11th June last the National Electoral Commission confirmed the result in favour of President Maduro.  I understand that Mr Capriles has been very critical of this audit process and may continue to pursue his appeal against the result through legal channels. </p><p>  I join with the EU High Representative Ashton in calling upon all parties in Venezuela to engage constructively in the promotion of good governance.

As the Deputy may recall, CT receipts in January 2012 benefited from a significant delayed payment proper to December 2011.  This significantly distorted the year-on-year comparisons of CT in 2012.  In light of this, CT was reported on extensively both on an adjusted basis, as well as on a headline basis, throughout 2012.  </p><p>  The distortionary impact of the delayed CT payment on 2013 year-on-year comparisons was again highlighted in the Exchequer Returns information note for January 2013.

This is &euro;108m (12.6%) behind the level that had been profiled in the period.  However, taking account of expenditure of &euro;63m in capital carryover, total expenditure to date amounts to &euro;814m.  A variance of between 10% and 12% is not unusual and there can  be variations in spending patterns between Departments with some ahead of target.  Departments have indicated that they do not expect any significant savings by year end and so expenditure is expected to return to profile at that stage.</p><p>  As you know, capital spending has general characteristics which influence the allocation drawdown pattern.  Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year.  This will, of course, affect the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure.</p></reply>

This increase will be partly facilitated by the provision, under the National Lottery Act 2013, for the sale of tickets through interactive channels.  In addition, the formula provided for in the next licence regarding returns to Good Causes will offer the holder of the next licence greater flexibility and scope for the growth and development of lottery games and distribution channels.  This formula provides that 65% of Gross Gaming Revenues (defined as sales less prizes) will be allocated to Good Causes during each year of the licence.</p><p>  I am confident that under these new arrangements, the level of annual returns for Good Causes under the next licence will grow significantly from the 2012 amount of 225 million euro.

This stone was offered to OPW National Monuments Service as a building materials resource having regard to its ongoing work in relation to National Monuments in State care.</p><p>  The assessment of the stone and its possible value in terms of its use in future heritage projects was made by experienced staff working in OPW's National Monuments District, Kilkenny and by OPW's Senior Conservation Architectural staff in Dublin.  Ultimately, the decision to accept the stone was based on a judgement of its value to the OPW National Monuments Service in the context of its work on the portfolio of National Monuments in State care and on the economic saving that would be gained by recyling the stone and thus avoiding the necessity of buying from commercial providers to fulfil needs for conservation projects.</p><p>  The decision to transfer the stone from OPW's Kilkenny National Monuments Depot to its current location on Coillte lands adjacent to Tintern Abbey in Wexford was made by National Monuments conservation staff on the grounds of economy and on the logistical efficiency of maintaining a store of good quality stone in a safe location close to sites where conservation works were likely to require recourse to such stocks.</p><p>  The material in question does not, in the opinion of professional OPW staff, contain any fragments related to any National Monument site and the appropriate statutory provisions relating to the treatment of such material in the various National Monuments Acts do not therefore apply.</p></reply>

Issues relating to public sector employment and pensions are the responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  In general, and similar to many civil and public servants, the social insurance class paid by women affected by the marriage bar was a modified rate (i.e. not the full Class A rate) which gives coverage for widow(er)'s and orphan's pensions, occupational injury benefit, bereavement grant and carer&rsquo;s benefit only.  It did not provide cover for the State pension.  The modified rate of social insurance was a condition of employment for public servants at that time.  Accordingly, even if those affected by the marriage bar had continued in employment, contributions paid at this class would not have given entitlement to a State pension (contributory) under the social welfare system.</p><p>  The homemaker scheme, which was introduced in 1994, can make qualification for the State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.   The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged to determine qualification for the State pension.  The homemaker disregard will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.</p><p>  The State pension is a valuable asset and is based on a system of contributions. Therefore, it is important that entitlement to State pension is based on a substantial contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over a working life.</p></reply>

There are approximately 86,000 recipients of rent supplement for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million in 2013.  I recently announced my intention to implement revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme which will come into force on Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014.  The new rent limits have been determined following an extensive review of the private rental market. This review has been based on the most up-to-date market data available.  This review continues the previous rent limit reviews&rsquo; emphasis, to ensure that value for money is achieved while at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation. The Department currently funds approximately 30% of the private rented sector so it is essential that the rent limits are kept under review.</p><p>   The research carried out during the review shows that the rent limits are in line with actual rents in the county. The current rent limit review maintains the rent limit rate of &euro;430 per month for a couple in County Kilkenny.</p><p>  It is a condition of award of rent supplement that the rent is within the maximum rent limit. Where rents are in excess of the limit, customers are being asked to contact their landlord and renegotiate the rent.  Where landlords do not agree to reduce the rent within the limits, staff will discuss the options open to the tenant, including seeking alternative accommodation. </p><p>  Officials in the Department continue to examine the impact of the rent limits on those who claim rent supplement. If the Deputy has a concern in relation to a specific case, he can provide the details to the Department for follow up.</p></reply>

Appeals against medical findings in relation to retirement on grounds of ill health are not provided for in the Superannuation Code and as such are not appropriate to the Pensions Ombudsman. Notwithstanding this, the person concerned wrote to the Pensions Ombudsman detailing their case in August 2012. In response the Ombudsman advised the person concerned, by letter of 21<sup>st</sup> August 2012, that they should first undergo the Internal Disputes Resolution process in my Department.  Subsequently the person concerned underwent the Internal Disputes Resolution process in my Department and the original findings were upheld. In this regard, the response which issued from my Department on 21<sup>st </sup>January 2013 in response to the appeal of 3<sup>rd</sup> September 2012 satisfies the criteria required by the Pensions Ombudsman regarding the provision of a notice of determination.</p><p>  My Department is satisfied that it has complied with its requirements under the Internal Disputes Resolution and the Pensions Ombudsman's office has confirmed that no further communication has been received from the person concerned in relation to this matter. The officer concerned retired from my Department on 28<sup>th</sup> February 2012 under the cost neutral scheme following an unsuccessful application to retire from the Civil Service on grounds of ill health.</p><p>  To clarify for the deputy, the procedures for dealing with an application by a civil servant to retire on grounds of ill health are outlined below. These procedures are contained in Department of Finance Circular 22/07. Ill health retirement applications are considered initially by the Chief Medical Officer for the Civil Service, who on receipt of an application from an officer, offers a medical opinion as to whether an individual is incapable on medical grounds of regular and effective service at the time of the application and whether the medical incapacity is likely to be permanent. Where an officer is not satisfied with the opinion provided by the Chief Medical Officer, an independent medical referee can be requested to re-examine the case. The final decision on whether or not a civil servant is granted ill health retirement lies with the relevant appropriate authority, having received the Chief Medical Officer's advice. The appropriate authority in this case was the Secretary General of my department.</p><p>  In the case of this officer, neither the Chief Medical Officer nor the independent medical referee supported the application for ill health retirement. Following representations from the officers' Union, the application for ill health retirement was further reviewed by the Personnel Officer who was satisfied that the correct procedures were followed and that the Department acted correctly in making the decision to refuse this application for retirement on grounds of ill health based on the facts that both the Chief Medical Officer and the independent medical referee did not support the application.</p></reply>

Based on a definition of child and family income supports that consists of the weekly equivalent rate for child benefit (&euro;29.92) and the rate for qualified child increases (&euro;29.80) the current value is 32.1% of the minimum social welfare weekly personal rate (&euro;186) and therefore falls slightly below the target range.  However, it might be borne in mind that if the weekly equivalent of the lowest rate of back to school clothing and footwear allowance is included in the definition of supports (&euro;1.92), the combined child related payments amount then falls within the target range, at 33.1% of the minimum social welfare weekly personal rate.  Furthermore  certain low-income families may also be in receipt of additional support from family income supplement payment.</p><p>  Any plans regarding the amount paid in respect of such payments will be a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day.  I do not therefore propose to speculate on any possible approaches to payment rates or whether the target will continue to be met.  Achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports raises complex issues about the effectiveness and the efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare prioritised the area of family and child income supports and its report on this issue was published in February.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the report will now contribute to the broader policy debate on future of child income support payments.</p></reply>

My Department has given priority in recent years to the development of island infrastructure as well as subsidising comprehensive transport services to and from the islands.  As the Deputy knows, my Department has spent over &euro;100 million on infrastructure projects on the islands in the past ten years, with improvements in island and mainland facilities as a result. The current funding provision of almost &euro;6m million allows my Department to continue to provide subsidies to various transport providers that deliver ferry, cargo, air and bus services for the offshore islands.  As a result of this investment in vital access services, the quality of life of the island populations has improved considerably. </p><p>  The Department's aim is to seek to meet the requirements of island communities through current and capital investment by the Department and other relevant Departments and organisations. While the study referred to by the Deputy provides valuable information with regard to the employment needs and the economic development potential of the islands, it also recognises that decisions with regard to the establishment and operation of commercial enterprises on offshore islands are complex and that cost is only one of a multiplicity of factors involved. </p><p>  The Deputy will of course be aware that the country has suffered considerable economic contraction in the last five years, resulting in a large reduction in my Department&rsquo;s budget, including the allocation for the islands. Notwithstanding this budgetary reduction, my Department has been able to maintain the level of transport services for the islands, albeit subject to some small increases in costs for users of these services. My Department will be focusing in the short-term on smaller infrastructure projects on the islands, as opposed to any large-scale expenditure, while at the same time subsidising the provision of transport services in order to maintain and enhance living standards on the islands.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-13a.291.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061300053#WRM01000"><p>Since market liberalisation in 1999, the provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is primarily a matter for the service providers concerned who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). Details of commercial services available in each County can be found on ComReg's website,   . </p><p>  Under EU rules, the State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  Broadband services under the NBS are available since October 2010 from the NBS service provider, &#8220;3&#8221;, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in all of the designated NBS Electoral Divisions.  I can confirm that the address referred to in the question is covered under the NBS and therefore residents of the particular Electoral Division are eligible to receive a service under the Scheme. </p><p>  In keeping with State Aid clearance for the Scheme, the broadband service contracted under the NBS is a basic affordable, scaleable product.  The NBS mobile wireless service is required to offer minimum download and upload speeds of 2.3Mbps and 1.4Mbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 18:1. The NBS satellite service, which is utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, offers minimum download and upload speeds of 3.6Mbps and 384 kbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 48:1. </p><p>  As regards service quality, my Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on 3, with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met. The NBS contract also provides that where NBS customers do not receive the minimum guaranteed service, as set out in the terms and conditions of their contract, they are entitled to service rebates. </p><p>  Should any NBS customer experience problems with the NBS service, they are advised to contact 3's customer care centre, 24 hours a day 7 days a week, by phone at 1913 (free of charge), via email to  or by post to 3 Customer Services, Hutchison 3G Ireland Limited, PO Box 333, Dublin 2.    Additionally, a team of field engineers has been established to address NBS specific maintenance issues at customers' premises.</p><p>  My Department has a role where customers have fully utilised the established complaints process and consider that their complaint has not been resolved.  My officials operate a dedicated NBS mailbox which NBS customers can contact by email at   , with any comments or complaints they may have about their NBS service.  My Department will then liaise with &#8220;3&#8221; personnel at its Head Office in Dublin to remedy any service performance issues.   To date, my officials have not received any communication from the person to whom the Deputy refers.</p><p>  With basic broadband available throughout the country, the Government, through the National Broadband Plan, which I published on 30<sup>th </sup>  August last year, has recognised that the key imperative now is to ensure high speed broadband availability to all.   This will require investment by the State in areas where there is no commercial market.  Ireland is therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband in Ireland which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country.  </p><p>  My Department will shortly embark on a formal mapping exercise to identify those areas where State intervention will be required to enable the delivery of high speed broadband services over the coming years in line with the commitments set out in the Plan.  This exercise will inform an EU State Aids application in respect of the State-led intervention and is a necessary prerequisite for State Aids approval. Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly throughout the country.  This will ensure that citizens or businesses, wherever they are located, have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business in the digital environment.</p></reply>

This is equivalent to 31,925 Gigawatt hours (GWh) or a reduction in annual CO<sub>2 </sub>  emissions of around 7.7 Mega tonnes (Mt).  Recognising that Government must lead by example, we are committed to achieving a 33% reduction in public sector energy use by 2020.</p><p>  Action number 20 of the second Action Plan states that: <i>We will work with public bodies to fulfil their exemplar role with respect to building energy efficiency</i>.  As part of delivering that goal we have committed, inter alia, to developing an inventory of public sector buildings by end 2013; requiring that Display Energy Certificates are prominently displayed in all buildings that are occupied by public bodies over certain defined thresholds; and requiring that all new buildings occupied and owned by public bodies from December 2018 be nearly zero-energy buildings.</p><p>  The NEEAP requirement therefore is to develop an inventory of public sector buildings and not a national inventory as the Deputy implies.  </p><p>  I should also point out that under the Energy Efficiency Directive (2012/27/EU) there is a requirement to publish an inventory of central government buildings over certain size thresholds and outlining their energy performance by 31 December 2013.  Member States have 18 months to transpose the Directive, with a transposition deadline of 5 June 2014.  However, there are a number of policy decisions and reporting requirements to be notified to the Commission in advance of the transposition deadline.  A series of subgroups have been set up with relevant stakeholders in order to progress the transposition of the Directive, with a formal consultation on the transposition and implementation of the Directive expected in Q3.  </p><p>  The Office of Public Works (OPW) manages the central government stock of buildings and they already have a register of the buildings they own and lease, which includes detailed energy usage information on about 250 of the larger buildings.  This register includes central government buildings, some agencies and Garda stations.  I understand they are considering adding buildings over 500 square metres over the next year, along with a detailed survey of their large owned office accommodation, about 120 buildings in all.  More generally discussions are ongoing with OPW in relation to our NEEAP targets and related obligations under the Directive.  The staffing and financial costs in relation to the inventory of OPW buildings are a matter for that office.</p><p>  As part of our Action Plan for Jobs commitments, we will issue later this month a mandate to public sector organisations with an annual energy spend of &euro;500,000 or more, to go to the market to identify solutions for the delivery of energy reduction services.  In 2010-2011 the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and my Department developed and launched a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system to record each individual public body's progress towards the 33% target.  A database of over 30,000 meters has been established to enable the accurate gathering of public sector data.  This database is being developed with linkages to the National Procurement service and will lead to better procurement of energy supplies for the public sector.  A report on public sector energy consumption will be published later this year.  </p><p>Should all measures detailed in the NEEAP reach their full potential by 2020 it is estimated that a potential reduction in energy spend across all sectors of approximately &euro;2.36 billion (at 2011 prices) will be realised.  A very significant element of this will be Exchequer savings in the public sector.  </p></reply>

Currently, only one class of licence and one level of licence fee exist and this covers any number of devices so long as they are all in the same property (residential or commercial). There is no separate, commercial television licence system in operation.As the Deputy will be aware, An Post administers the collection of the TV licence fee on my behalf. In terms of compliance with the TV licensing requirements, An Post makes every effort to bring evaders into the licensed pool and a considerable amount of time and resources are spent in dealing specifically with this issue.   Section 144 of the 2009 Act provides for the introduction of regulations in relation to different classes of licences in respect of different classes of premises e.g. commercial premises. In 2011, my Department carried out an internal evaluation of the feasibility and cost benefits of introducing different categories of licence. On foot of this exercise, it was decided to deal with the issues arising in the context of a wider on-going review, in relation to the introduction of a household based Public Service Broadcasting Charge.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for Government commits to examining the role and collection of the TV licence fee in light of existing and projected convergence of technologies and to transforming the TV licence into a household based Public Broadcasting Charge to be applied to all eligible households and applicable businesses, regardless of the device used to access content or services.</p><p>  My Department has been carrying out a Value for Money Policy Review on the proposed policy, the Report of which has recently been submitted to me. I am currently giving due consideration to the Report and its recommendations and, on this basis, expect to be in a position, subject to Government approval, to initiate work in the Autumn on the legislative and other work necessary to implement the household based Public Broadcasting Charge.</p><p>  Such proposals will, of course, involve an element of consultation to ensure that the views of interested parties are taken into account and I look forward to the engagement of all stakeholders with any such consultation at the appropriate time.</p></reply>

Some of these were Garda stations in name only and their closure was a formal confirmation of the fact that the stations in question were no longer operational. Many more were open for limited hours during the day. It is the Commissioner's professional opinion that a more effective policing service can be provided through the closure of these stations and the deployment of Gardai on front-line operational policing. I fully agree with the Commissioner in this assessment.</p><p>The Commissioner has stated that the revised structures now in place will continue to support the Garda community policing philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs.

Following the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, the offence is now punishable on indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to 15 years.</p><p>  Since 1997 the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has operated a Witness Security Programme in response to attempts by criminal and other groups to prevent the normal functioning of the criminal justice system, including threats of violence and systematic witness intimidation.   The operation of the Programme is supported by Section 40 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 which makes it an offence for any person, without lawful authority, to try to identify the whereabouts or any new identity of a witness who has been relocated under the Programme.  The offence is punishable on indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to five years.  </p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na rigorously enforces the provisions in the law relating to witness intimidation and protection.  In circumstances where the Senior Investigation Officer in a case has identified a witness who is crucial to the case and the evidence to be preferred is not available elsewhere, and there is a serious threat to the life of the witness or his/her family an application can be made, with the consent of the witness, to have him/her included in the Witness Security Programme.  Where a threat to or intimidation of a witness or a potential witness arises during the course of criminal proceedings, the matter may be addressed through the trial judge, who has discretion to revoke bail or place other sanctions on the accused/suspect.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>  With regard to the number of recorded incidents of witness intimidation in each of the past ten years and to date in 2013, I have requested the information from the Garda authorities and will communicate with the Deputy as soon as the information is to hand.</p></reply>

The policy of the Department is to fly the national flag on key buildings at all times. Apart from these key buildings, Departmental policy is that the national flag will not be flown on days when buildings would normally be closed, including St. Patrick's Day and Easter, in order to avoid giving rise to additional personnel costs associated with raising and lowering the national flag.  The Department of Justice building in Killarney fully complies with Departmental policy in all respects. I can advise the Deputy that the policy is sufficiently flexible so as to comprehend potential exceptions to the situation outlined above on a case by case basis.</p></reply>

I specifically asked for an early response on the proposed selection process for the members of the new Commission.   The Committee recommended that the Selection Panel envisaged in the Heads should be gender-balanced and the persons on the panel should have a proven track record and expertise in the field of human rights and equality.  They also suggested that a person serving on the Panel should be ineligible to become a member of the Commission whose members they are selecting.  I accepted all these recommendations.  Subsequently, an independent Selection Panel was appointed by me to manage the selection process and make a recommendation as to the persons to be appointed to the new Commission.</p><p>  Advertisements inviting expressions of interest for the position of Chief Commissioner and of &quot;ordinary&quot; member appeared in the media in November 2012.   The Panel forwarded its recommendations of 14 names to me in March 2013.  While the persons recommended by the Selection Panel cannot be appointed to the IHREC in advance of the required legislation being enacted and commenced,  the Government has appointed the 14 individuals as members of the Human Rights Commission.  These 14 persons will be appointed as members of IHREC when the legislation is enacted.  </p><p>  The Selection Panel reported to me that it has not proved possible to recruit a Chief Commissioner at this time.  This issue requires time for reflection and consultation and I am currently considering how best to progress the appointment of a Chief Commissioner.</p><p>  As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 170 of 9 May it is a fundamental requirement of the Paris Principles that the members of the IHREC be independent.  This includes but is not limited to being independent of Government.  The question of whether Commissioners should be nominated by any social partner organisation or be representative of any particular sector or NGO was expressly considered by the Working Group I established to advise me on practical issues in relation to the establishment of a new Commission.  The Group recommended that members of the new Commission be selected by a process independent of the Government, serving on appointment independently in their individual capacity and that their appointments should not be made on representative or nomination basis as heretofore was the case in relation to a number of positions on the Equality Authority Board.  </p><p>  I accepted this recommendation and it is reflected in the General Scheme as published.  The selection procedure set out in the Heads was also endorsed by the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  While I hope to be in a position to publish the Bill shortly, I am concerned at the length of time the Equality Authority has been without a board and the implications of this situation for proper corporate governance.  As an immediate step, I have with the agreement of the members designate appointed 12 of them to the Board of the Equality Authority. This satisfies the requirements of section 41 of the Employment Equality Act, as amended, that the board consist of not less than 12 and not more than 16 persons, and be gender balanced.</p><p>  I might also mention that the new legislation will allow IHREC to establish subcommittees of the Commission to enable representatives of a wide range of interests, including employee and employer interests, to contribute in an advisory capacity.  </p><p>  I am concerned that any appointments that might be made outside of the independent selection process that has recently concluded could attract adverse comment and possibly have adverse implications for the accreditation of the new Commission as an 'A' status national human rights institution.  Nonetheless, I am keeping the question of social partner appointments under review in the light of progress on drafting of the Bill.</p></reply>

There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.</p><p>  The criminal law takes a serious view of offences committed by persons on bail.  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served.  It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.  I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences continue to be committed by persons on bail.  I share that concern and believe bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by people on bail.  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will seek to restructure the law so it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.  I intend to bring proposals to the Government on the matter as soon as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities.</p></reply>

The average number of prisoners in custody in Ireland has risen in the last five years, from 3,321 during 2007 to 4,318 during 2012, an increase of over 30%.  Likewise, the total number of committals to prison has also risen sharply during the same period, from 11,934 in 2007 to 17,026 in 2012, an increase of over 43%.  Significant investment has taken place in our prison estate in recent years, with in excess of 900 new prison spaces having been constructed and brought into use since 2007.  Most recently, a new accommodation block at the Midlands Prison which has provided an additional 300 additional spaces, open in 2012.  As outlined in the Irish Prison Service's three-year strategic plan, it is intended to align the capacity of our prisons with the guidelines laid down by the Inspector of Prisons by 2014, in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.  In 2012 and in the first quarter of this year, priority was given to reducing overcrowding in Mountjoy, Cork, Limerick Prisons and the D&oacute;chas Centre.</p><p>  The strategy also contains a commitment to implement a 40-month capital plan to provide in-cell sanitation in all cells and radically improve prison conditions in the older parts of the prison estate.  Included in the plan is the replacement of Cork Prison with a new prison built on the site of the current car park and an adjacent greenfield site.  The new prison will have an average daily capacity of approximately 275 prisoners, which is broadly similar to the current daily average.  The plan also includes the proposed demolition of the early 19th century A and B blocks in Limerick Prison.  Their replacement with modern accommodation and related facilities will eliminate the practice of slopping-out and alleviate the current overcrowding difficulties.  As the Deputy will be aware, I have announced a number of initiatives and programmes to alleviate overcrowding in the prison system.  The Irish Prison Service's three-year strategic plan outlines a number of measures to be undertaken including the Community Return Scheme, a closer working relationship with the Probation Service and a more structured approach to temporary release.</p></reply>

In that context, the Deputy will be aware that an additional &euro;3 million was made available towards the end of last year which enabled the force to procure a further 171 vehicles.  This brought total investment in the Garda fleet in 2012 to &euro;4 million and resulted in a total of 213 new vehicles being procured during the year.  In addition to the investment provided in 2012, a specific allocation of &euro;5 million has been provided for the purchase and fit-out of Garda transport in the current year.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that to date this investment has resulted in a further 133 new vehicles being procured.  This represents a considerable financial investment in Garda transport, particularly at a time when the level of funding available across the public sector is severely limited.

Periods of unlawful residence, periods of residence which were for the sole purpose of having an application for refugee status determined or periods of residence where permission was granted for the purposes of study are excluded from the determination of periods of reckonable residence. Entitlement of a child to Irish citizenship is determined by the Passport Office following receipt of an application for a passport on the child's behalf. Where a child born in the State did not at birth have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, the parent or guardian or person who is in loco parentis to the child may lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of the child. The parent must satisfy the conditions for naturalisation including having five years reckonable residency in the State since the birth of the child i.e. the child must be five years of age at the date of application. An application for a Certificate of Naturalisation may be made by a naturalised parent on behalf of their minor child. The parent of the person concerned lodged applications for a Certificate of Naturalisation in 2006 and 2008, which were unsuccessful.

A definitive record of all occasions when the President was afforded a Guard of Honour in the past nine years is not kept by my Department. However, the Defence Forces have provided a full ceremonial Guard of Honour in each of these years when the President has attended the following annual State ceremonies: the Easter Sunday 1916 Commemoration at the GPO; 1916 Arbour Hill Commemoration Ceremony; National Day of Commemoration; the National Famine Memorial Day, (since 2009). Guards of Honour have also been provided by the Defence Forces to the President at other events of major national significance, for example, the Titanic commemorations in Cobh in 2012. The President is also afforded a Guard of Honour on departing the country for a State Visit and on his/her return<b>.</b></p></reply>

The Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector assists development of the sector by grant aiding capital investments in specialised buildings and equipment as well as emerging technologies specific to commercial horticulture production. The Scheme's objectives are to improve the quality of output, to facilitate environmentally friendly practices, to promote diversification of on-farm activities and to improve working conditions. This competitive grant aid scheme provides aid at a rate of 40% (50% in the case of approved young farmers), payable on the accepted cost (excluding VAT), of capital investments approved and completed to the satisfaction of the Department. Over recent years the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector has made a significant contribution to the growth and development of the horticulture sector across all areas; field vegetables, soft fruit, protected crops, mushrooms, nursery crops, apples, cut foliage and beekeeping. During the period 2008-2012, &euro;16.2 million was paid out under the Scheme. This supported investment of approximately &euro;40.5 million by growers over this period. Under the 2013 Round of the Scheme, I was pleased to approve a further &euro;4.4 million in grant aid for 175 applicants.  This will facilitate capital investments by these growers to the value of &euro;11 million over the coming months. The Scheme for the Marketing and Processing of Certain Agricultural Products provides funding for capital investment. Payments to the horticulture sector under the Scheme amounted to &euro;5.5 million for the period between 2007 and 2012 to support capital expenditure on horticulture processing investments and a further &euro;1.7 million was paid during the period to support potato marketing and storage investments.</p><p>  Support is also available to Irish growers through the Industry/ EU co-funded Promotion of Agricultural Products Programmes. These programmes cover aspects such as quality, safety, nutritional value or methods of production. The European Commission has approved two mushroom promotion programmes prepared by the trade and submitted through Bord Bia. A three-year &euro;2.5 million programme to promote mushrooms on the UK market commenced in September 2010. The campaign &#8220;<i>More to Mushrooms</i> &#8221; aims to address the decline in mushroom sales and to increase consumption by over 23,800 tonnes over three years by promoting their taste, nutrition and versatility. It is co-ordinated by Bord Bia and is funded 50% by the EU and 50% by the mushroom trade. To build on the success of the first programme and following my Department and the EU Commission's evaluation of a new proposal submitted by Bord Bia on behalf of the Irish and UK mushroom industry, the Commission decided this year to award 50% funding for a further &euro;2.7 million three year mushroom programme &#8220;<i>Just add Mushrooms</i> &#8221;. This will commence later this year and will promote mushrooms on the Irish and UK markets. In addition, financial support also continues to be available to those producers who participate in the Producer Organisation (PO) Scheme. This EU funded Scheme provides an important mechanism for growers to become part of a larger supply base, concentrate on marketing and to improve quality.</p><p>  My Department also provides funding to Bord Bia and Teagasc towards their work for the horticulture industry. Bord Bia continues to provide support to operators in the horticulture sector to develop new markets by way of assistance in the areas of product innovation and marketing skills as well as organising the very successful Bloom festival, which in 2013 attracted 110,000 visitors. Teagasc, on the other hand, is actively involved in providing education, research and technical advice to the horticulture industry.</p></reply>

However, for the sake of completeness, I am also providing data on deductions which arose from office-based processes in 2009, 2010 and 2011 associated with the Schemes concerned.</p><p>In 2009, a review of the Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) identified ineligible areas declared by the applicant, resulting in a reduction of &euro;2,665.85.</p><p>In 2010, because of failure to submit receipts in relation to his AEOS 1 application, an overpayment of &euro;1,061.66 arose.  The applicant was advised by letters dated 19 October 2012 and 10 January 2013 that, as he had not complied with the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme, the Department had no option but to terminate his Contract, and also in relation to the resultant overpayment.</p><p>In 2011, an on-farm inspection (Ground Eligibility and Ovine Identification and Registration) was initiated on 27 July 2011. Arising from this inspection, discrepancies were discovered in relation to the Flock Register and Dispatch Dockets resulting in a 1% penalty. The person named was informed of this outcome on 21 October 2011.</p><p>In 2011 also, due to the higher than anticipated level of applications for the Grassland Sheep Scheme, it was necessary that the initial rate payable per eligible ewe be reduced, for all applicants in order to ensure that the Scheme budget be respected  This resulted in an overpayment of &euro;90.29 in the case of this applicant.</p><p>In 2012, an on-farm Cross Compliance inspection was initiated on 10 December 2012, during the course of which discrepancies were discovered in relation to Nitrates and Bovine Identification and Registration, resulting in a 5% penalty.

This Act provides the legal framework for the operation of the criminal justice system in relation to children.</p><p>At this time, custodial accommodation for under 18 year olds is provided on the Oberstown campus, Lusk, Co Dublin and in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, Dublin 7.</p><p>There are 3 children detention schools on the Oberstown campus.  The entry criteria for each of these sites and their certified detention capacity under the Children Act are outlined below:</p><p><table><tr><th>Children Detention School</th><th>Entry Criteria</th><th>Certified Capacity (bedrooms)</th></tr><tr><td>Trinity House School</td><td>Males up to 17 years old on admission</td><td><div>24</div></td></tr><tr><td>Oberstown Boys School</td><td>Males up to 17 years old on admission</td><td><div>20</div></td></tr><tr><td>Oberstown Girls School</td><td>Females up to 18 years old on admission</td><td><div>8</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL:</td><td><div>52</div></td></tr></table></p><p>There has been a recent shortage of bed spaces for boys on the Oberstown campus. This arises in part from an increase in demand for places from the courts, compared to the trend over the past few years.  However, it has also been affected by a delay in reopening a detention unit of 8 bed spaces in Trinity House School.  This has reduced the available capacity in that site to 16 bed spaces.  As outlined in my reply to Parliamentary Question 246 on 16 May 2013 (23519/13), my Department is working closely with the Oberstown Board of Management to resolve this issue and bring this detention unit back into operation at the earliest possible date.</p><p>Apart from the Oberstown campus, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution currently provides detention spaces for boys aged 17 years on admission.  The facility also provides prison accommodation in a separate wing for males between the ages of 18 and 21.  There is no set capacity in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution for 17 year old boys.</p><p>The Children Act 2001 contains a transitional provision for the continued use of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution or a place of detention for 16 and 17 year old boys until such time as there are sufficient places to accommodate these groups in a children detention school.  With effect from 1 May 2012, I announced the ending of the practice of detaining 16 year old boys in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution through using existing capacity that was available on the Oberstown campus.   Since July 2012 there have been no 16 year old boys detained in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.</p><p>The Government is committed to ending the practice of detaining children in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  It is a priority of mine, since taking on responsibility for the children detention schools, to deliver on this commitment.  At present, there is insufficient capacity on the Oberstown campus for taking on responsibility for all children under the age of 18 years.</p><p>Funding for the development of increased capacity on the Oberstown campus is a key element in resolving this issue.  On 2 April 2012, I announced a capital investment package for the National Children Detention Facility project in Oberstown.  The project is at an advanced stage of the tender process and it is intended to begin construction in July 2013, with a view to ending the practice of detaining children in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution by mid 2014.  This will provide a facility with a capacity of 90 detention places in total.  I am advised that based on recent trends, this should be sufficient to meet the requirements of the courts for children detention places.</p></reply>

Complex issues have arisen during the course of the preparation of the Bill, including the criteria for balancing an adopted person's right to information about his or her identity as against a birth parent's right to privacy. My own view is that persons affected by adoption should be provided with as much information as possible within permissible Constitutional boundaries. Consideration of legal and policy issues is ongoing and once these have been satisfactorily resolved, I intend to seek Government approval to publish the Heads of Bill. It is my intention to bring this Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the coming months. </p><p>  The National Adoption Contact Register (NACPR) was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  Applicants decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  It is intended that the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2013 will provide for placing the National Contact Preference Register on a statutory basis. However, the number of successful matches made is reliant on the various parties joining the Register. It is an individual choice whether a person decides to join the register.</p><p>  At the end of 2012 there were 7224 adopted people and 3165 natural relatives registered with the NACPR. Just over 600 &ldquo;matches&rdquo; in total have been generated, i.e. over 600 adopted persons have been matched with one (or more) natural relatives. In 2012 the Information and Tracing Unit processed 542 new applications to join the Register, which resulted in 54 &ldquo;matches&rdquo;.  In the first five months of 2013 there have been a total of 28 &quot;matches&quot;.</p></reply>

The DES has an Early Years Policy Unit which is co-located in Mespil Road with my Department and is responsible for these areas.</p><p>  S&iacute;olta (the Irish word for Seeds) &ndash; the Childcare Quality Framework (2006) - is a set of National Principles, Standards and Components of Quality which collectively articulate a national vision and practical guidelines on quality in practice across all early childhood care and education settings.  Implementation of S&iacute;olta is supported by a range of activities including:</p><p> - Introductory workshops, delivered by a range of support organisations including the City and County Childcare Committees and the Voluntary Childcare Organisations</p><p> - The S&iacute;olta Quality Assurance Programme (QAP), which is a 12 step programme that supports early childhood care and education settings to engage in structured review and development of their practice.  Settings are supported by a trained S&iacute;olta Co-ordinator when they are working through the S&iacute;olta QAP. </p><p>  The S&iacute;olta QAP is currently being field tested within 135 early childhood care and education settings.  An evaluation of this field test has been commissioned by the Department of Education and Skills and will be completed by the end of this year.</p><p>  Aistear &ndash; the Early Childhood Curriculum Framework (2009) - is organised around four themes &ndash; Well-being, Identity and Belonging, Communication, Exploring and Thinking &ndash; and expresses the national vision for good practice in relation to curriculum in early childhood.  A range of activities are in place to disseminate the materials and resources of Aistear to all those working with children in the 0-6 age range. The on-line Aistear Toolkit provides a wealth of information and resources such as audio and visual podcasts.  These have been accessed by thousands of users. This web-based resource will be continually updated into the future.  Additionally, a network of Aistear tutors has been selected and trained to deliver professional development activities for infant class teachers through the education centre network nationally. The potential to extend this resource to practitioners in other early childhood care and education settings is currently under review.</p><p>  The only support for the implementation of S&iacute;olta and Aistear in the pre-school sector to date has been provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs via the local Childcare Committees and Voluntary Childcare Organisations.  International practice indicates that the best way to support quality in pre-school services is to provide regular mentoring support.  Northern Ireland, which introduced a free pre-school year some time ago, did so with Early Education experts providing mentoring support to services.  As a result, pre-school services in Northern Ireland have been evaluated as having very high standards of provision.</p><p>  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, and in ongoing consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure, is looking at options to develop a mentoring system for our pre-school sector to support implementation of the Siolta Framework and Aistear Curriculum.</p></reply>

The Plan acknowledged national and international research evidence which establishes a strong correlation between the availability of an appropriately trained workforce to staff early years services and the ability to deliver high quality pre-school provision. The implementation of the Workforce Development Plan is being overseen by the Early Years Education Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills, which is co-located with my Department.</p><p>  The Plan sets out the key areas that emerged from an extensive programme of research and consultation:  These key areas are:</p><p> - The necessity for clearly articulated professional pathways into and across professional domains of practice related to the care and education of children. These include occupational role descriptors with associated qualification levels.</p><p> - The establishment of an agreed set of national standards for all awards in early childhood care and education (incorporating core knowledge, skills, competencies and work experience) across all relevant levels of the National Framework of Qualifications in Ireland.</p><p> - Access to flexible, affordable and nationally accredited learning opportunities at all levels of  qualification for pre-service and in-service professional development.</p><p> - The necessity to ensure consistent quality of ECCE courses nationally across a range of variables including content, delivery and work placement.</p><p>  The publication by FETAC of Common Award Standards at Levels 4, 5 and 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications ensures that there is consistent quality of ECCE courses across the country and delivers on one of the key areas set out in the Workforce Development Plan.  I view this as an essential building block for developing and upskilling the workforce.  </p><p>  The Workforce Development Plan identified different distinct groups including new entrants to the workforce who wish to become appropriately qualified for specific occupational roles and responsibilities, and unqualified practitioners in the current workforce who want to achieve the Level 5 award. For new entrants to the workforce the publication of Common Award Standards at Levels 4, 5 and 6 is a welcome development.  Programmes of learning developed to meet these new award standards will incorporate national practice frameworks and will reflect national policy objectives, thereby ensuring that graduates are fully prepared to enter the workforce.  Training providers have begun to meet the new award standards in respect of the FETAC Level 5 Major Award in Early Childhood Care and Education. The first programme has been developed and is being provided through the VECs.</p><p>  My Department and I have been working on a comprehensive Pre-School quality agenda that will, inter alia, work towards increasing the qualification requirements for all childcare staff.  Future developments relating to early years and education, including workforce development, are being considered in the context of the National Early Years Strategy for children aged from birth to six years, which is being developed by my Department and expected to be completed later this year.</p></reply>

It is important to realise that inspections alone are not the answer to improving quality. What is required is a multi-faceted approach, and since this Government came to office we have been working to ensure issues relating to child protection and welfare are put front and centre. The establishment of a Department of Children and Youth Affairs was recognition of the huge body of work which needs to be done in this area.</p><p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, driving the early childhood care and education quality agenda is one of my key objectives.  I believe we can achieve this objective by taking a number of steps in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, including the adaptation of the existing pre-school inspection system to provide a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for pre-schools, moving to a greater focus on outcomes for children.  In support of this, a Joint Pilot Inspection of Early Years Services was carried out by Inspectors from the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills between September 2011 and May 2012.  This pilot will inform the proactive approach being taken.</p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to improve the quality of the free Pre-School Year and, by extension, the quality of all early childhood care and education, through the implementation of standards and by reviewing training options for the workforce.  This commitment has always been a key priority for me.  This is why my Department and I have been progressing work on Ireland's first-ever Early Years Strategy and this why we have been working on a comprehensive<b></b>Pre-School Quality Agenda. </p><p>  We have identified a number of key areas of action which I believe need to be considered and addressed as a matter of urgency.  These include:</p><p> - Introducing a registration system for all pre-school services </p><p> - Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust</p><p> - Publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible</p><p> - Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance</p><p> - Increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance. </p><p><b>Registration of all childcare providers</b></p><p>  Work is already underway in the Child and Family Services area of the Health Service Executive (HSE) to introduce a registration system for pre-school services.  I understand this system will be in place for new services from the end of this year and will be phased in for existing services thereafter.  This is an important development because it will move services from the current position, where they are required to notify the Pre-School Inspectorate of their intention to open, to a requirement to be inspected and found satisfactory, before being permitted to open.  All pre-school services are currently required to pay an annual fee to the HSE of between &euro;40 and &euro;80.  I am looking at increasing this fee.  The additional funds raised will assist in improving inspection and supports for quality improvement. </p><p><b>Publication of Inspection Reports</b></p><p>  Parents will rightly demand and expect the highest standards and this will be a key factor in driving change in the sector.  Publishing inspection reports is an essential step in ensuring high standards and accountability. All <i>new</i> inspection reports will be made available on-line from the HSE as a matter of urgency.  All <i>current</i> inspection reports will be made available on-line in 2014.</p><p><b>Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust</b></p><p>  We are working on developing a more robust, consistent and regular inspection system.  There has been a significant programme of work underway in the HSE over the past year to develop a single, consistent national inspection service (as opposed to 37 different local systems).  We propose moving to a position where there is consistent and assured national target rate for the frequency of inspection of pre-school services, while ensuring capacity for prioritisation based on risk assessment.  The HSE is currently reviewing the regional spread of inspectors with a view to identifying whether either additional resources or redeployment of existing inspectors is required to achieve this. </p><p>  Building on this work, officials of my Department and the Department of Education and Skills have been examining options to incrementally develop a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for pre-schools, moving away from a narrow focus on compliance, and leading to a greater focus on children's outcomes, including educational development and child wellbeing.  This work is being informed by the findings of the recent Joint Pilot Inspection carried out in a small number of settings by Inspectors from the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p><b>Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance</b></p><p>  We are working to ensure consistent action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance. There must be a follow-through on inspections.  Clearly, services which are found to be in serious breach of the Regulations will face closure and prosecution.  It is proposed to develop a protocol with the Pre-School Inspectorate which will take a calibrated approach and which will enable more decisive action to be taken in response to non-compliance.</p><p><b>Increased Sanctions for non-compliance</b></p><p>  My Department will also be undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.</p></reply>

Under the programme, the pre-school leader delivering the programme must hold a qualification in childcare/early education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ), or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare/early education field.  A higher capitation rate is payable to services where all of the pre-school leaders hold a bachelor degree in childhood/early education (minimum of Level 7 on the NFQ) and have three years experience working in the sector, and where all of the pre-school assistants hold a relevant major award in childcare/early education at Level 5 on the NFQ.</p><p>  I have indicated my intention to increase the qualification requirements for all staff working in pre-school services.  The minimum requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year will be increased to Level 6.  In addition, all pre-school assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a pre-school service, will be subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  This requirement will be effective from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services.  My Department is currently examining measures to support training for childcare staff in line with the increased qualification requirements.</p><p>  My Department holds information relating to the qualifications of staff currently delivering the pre-school year, and we are examining the possibility of extending this to a national registration system.  Given the vast range of childcare qualifications and awarding authorities, including international awarding bodies, this will not be an easy task.  However, I agree with the Deputy that a national qualification and registration system for all early years professionals would be useful, and my Department will be liaising with the Early Years Education Unit, which is co-located within my Department, to determine the optimum means of building and maintaining such a register.</p></reply>

Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities. This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of job opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and demonstrates how Departments are working together to deliver the Government's agenda on promoting employment and supporting children's development.</p><p>  The initiative is expected to receive full year funding of &euro;14 million to provide over 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school in order to support parents to take up employment.  This funding has been made possible through savings from the Vote of the Department of Social Protection. </p><p>  Eligibility for the new After-school Childcare programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  Officials from the Department of Social Protection and my Department are continuing in close collaboration on the operation of the programme.  The first pilot phase has commenced.  Up to 500 childcare places are available with Department of Social Protection local offices in Tralee, Mullingar, Dundalk, Cork City, Finglas, Kings Inn and Limerick City participating.  The second phase of the pilot will be rolled out in July, with the full roll-out of the programme in September 2013, to coincide with the new school year.   </p><p>  As you know the emphasis in relation to all childcare support programmes is the delivery of easily accessible, affordable and quality childcare provision.  The pilot programme will assist both Departments in determining the procedural, quality and practical issues that require attention prior to the finalisation of the programme.  Detailed costings and possible permutations in relation to this level of service provision for the cohort in question have not been carried out by my Department.  However, every year Pobal conduct a survey on behalf of my Department which provides a detailed insight into the early years sector, based on those services who receive funding from my Department. According to the figures for 2012, the average cost for the provision of an after-school place was &euro;71 per child per week.  Using this figure, 38 weeks of service provision as suggested and data from the 2011 Census indicating some 504,000 children attending primary school (aged from 5 to 12), the cost of after school provision, as outlined by the Deputy, would be in excess of &euro;1.36 billion annually.</p></reply>

This legislative proposal, along with a number of other measures, which will be set out in a new tobacco policy which will be put before Government for approval in the near future.</p><p>  In relation to the impact on the retail sector, the costs, benefits and impacts of this proposal will be included in the Regulatory Impact Analysis to be undertaken by my Department. However, it should be stated that the retail sector has played a significant and positive role over the past number of years in many tobacco control measures, e.g. tobacco advertising, point of sale display bans and prohibition of the sale of tobacco to those under 18 years.  I look forward to working constructively with it in relation to this measure and other measures into the future in order to reduce the number of deaths from tobacco related diseases. </p></reply>

The posts will be filled using the Resource Allocation model, based on deprivation and need, which was developed by the HSE's National Primary Care Office and Health Intelligence Unit.  Using this model, the HSE completed a detailed analysis of the numbers and distribution of public health nurses, registered general nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists.  The analysis revealed considerable variation across the 17 Integrated Service Areas in ratios of health care professionals to population, and to population numbers in areas of high deprivation.  Based on this analysis, it proposed that the following additional posts be recruited to Primary Care Teams:</p><p>- 70 Public Health Nurses;</p><p>- 37 Registered General Nurses;</p><p>- 51 Occupational Therapists;</p><p>- 46 Physiotherapists; </p><p>- 47 Speech &amp;amp; Language Therapists.</p><p>  The recruitment process has commenced and it is the intention to have these posts filled as soon as possible in 2013.</p><p>  The HSE has been asked to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the allocation of posts to the specific areas highlighted by the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, the new scheme supports the individuals in need of long-term nursing home care, not the facilities providing the care. It is designed to ensure that nursing homes are not being funded for empty beds.  </p><p>  In order to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme all private nursing homes, and voluntary nursing homes which previously received funding for long-term residential care under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, must negotiate and agree a price for the cost of long-term nursing home care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  This is necessary due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above individuals&rsquo; contributions.</p><p>  The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State.  The NTPF negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process.</p><p>  If price negotiations break down,  a three stage review process can be invoked.  Details of the process are set out on the NTPF website. </p><p>  Given the independence of the NTPF, the Minister for Health cannot intervene in the negotiations between it and the nursing home referred to by the Deputy.  Furthermore, the HSE cannot provide funding for long-term residential care services to nursing homes through any mechanism other than the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. </p><p>  Finally, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently being reviewed.  One of the terms of reference of the review is an examination of the overall cost of long term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices.  Work will continue on the review in the coming months with a view to completion by end 2013/early 2014.  </p></reply>

When fully implemented the programme will offer free screening to men and women aged 55-74 every two years.   The screening test, known as a Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT), is a home based test and approximately 94 to 95 per cent of people will receive a normal result and will be invited for routine screening again in two years time. A small number, in the region of five to six per cent, will receive a not normal result and will require an additional test.  They will be referred for a colonoscopy to a Screening Colonoscopy Unit within a hospital contracted by the HSE National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) for provision of this service.</p><p>  The accredited screening colonoscopy units provide good geographic coverage and are appropriate for the invited population to date.  The programme is being rolled-out on a phased basis and is providing screening colonoscopies as required.  The programme will be expanded over time until the full 55-74 age group is reached, at which stage once a person becomes a part of the programme they may be a participant for up to 19 years.

To date, different work streams of the National Clinical Programme for Asthma have resulted in the following initiatives: </p><p>-   The preparation of a Model of Care - this is currently in development.</p><p>-   The establishment of Asthma Check (Chronic Disease Watch Asthma - structured review) - this has been submitted to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) for review.</p><p>-   The preparation of Acute Emergency Asthma Guidelines for Adults - this has been submitted to the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) for review and feedback.</p><p>-   The preparation of Acute Emergency Asthma Guidelines for Paediatrics - these have been completed. </p><p>-   Asthma Control in General Practice - these guidelines have been signed off by ICGP and are being implemented.</p><p>-   Asthma Educational Programme - this is available online at www. hseland.ie. </p><p>-   Practical workshops have been delivered locally by Clinical Nurse Specialists to nurses in Primary and Secondary Care.</p><p>  Nurses and other health professionals have been enrolled in an asthma education module.  This education module is based on the National Asthma guidelines.  This supports healthcare staff in the delivery of evidenced based care and education for patients.  In partnership with the Asthma Society, patient information documents have been developed to support this initiative.</p></reply>

The Government is very conscious of the needs of people with a disability who have relied on individual payments of Mobility Allowance to support their independence and will take all of this into consideration when making a decision on future arrangements. </p><p>  Following detailed consideration of the Interim Report of the Review Group the Government has decided that new statutory provisions will be established to provide individual payments to people with severe disabilities who require additional income to address the costs of their mobility needs.  The Government has agreed that an inter-departmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, will now be asked to develop detailed proposals for the operation of the new scheme or schemes, including eligibility criteria and administrative arrangements, and should report back to Government by October.</p><p>  The Government has agreed that payments should temporarily continue to be made by the HSE to those persons currently in receipt of the Mobility Allowance for a further number of months, pending the commencement of new statutory provisions, on the basis that this would prevent hardship, and, on an interim basis, alleviate stress, anxiety and uncertainty among a vulnerable group in society.</p><p>  The existing position regarding the Motorised Transport Grant remains as before, i.e. the scheme remains closed.  The inter-departmental group will examine this issue as part of its considerations of how future statutory arrangements should operate.</p></reply>

This number is expected to rise to between 141,000 and 147,000 by 2041.  Given this increase in numbers, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to Develop a national Alzheimer's and other dementias' strategy by 2013.  A significant amount of preparatory work has already been completed.<b></b>A research review funded by the Atlantic Philanthropies to lay the foundations for the Strategy, titled <i>Creating Excellence in Dementia Care, A Research Review for Ireland's National Dementia Strategy</i> was published in January 2012.  A public consultation process to inform the development of the Strategy was conducted in 2012 and a report of same published on the Department's website in February 2013.</p><p>  A Working Group, representative of key stakeholders from the Department, the HSE, the medical profession and the community and voluntary sector has been established.  Representatives of other organisations/professional bodies etc. will be invited as needed to present to the Working Group either in person or in writing.  The first meeting of this Group took place in May.</p><p>  In taking account of the Goals and Objectives of the National Carers' Strategy and Ireland's recently published Health and Well-being Strategy and National Positive Ageing Strategy, the National Dementia Strategy will recognise that for those with dementia as well as for others, well-being is a multi-dimensional concept that is determined not only by health services but by a range of interconnected social, economic and environmental factors.  As indicated in the Programme for Government, the purpose of the Strategy will be </p><p>- to increase awareness</p><p>- ensure early diagnosis and intervention and </p><p>- ensure development of enhanced community based services.</p><p>  While the development of the Strategy is taking place during a period of very challenging financial circumstances and will therefore have to have due regard to the constraints imposed by the budgetary situation, it is intended that the National Dementia Strategy will be a transformative Strategy.  It will have a very practical focus, will be action oriented and will focus on what can be done to make a difference to the lives of people with dementia.  It will ensure that changes in work practices, processes and realignment of resources can deliver real results.  It is intended that a draft of the Strategy will be completed by the end of 2013. </p></reply>

Where necessary, care and treatment for such patients is mostly provided in the community through a variety of services including community mental health services, day hospitals, day centres and through home based treatment teams.  Many other patients requiring mental health services outside the acute setting are accommodated in a variety of low, medium and high support hostels.  There are approximately 2,790 beds in those settings.  However, the latter groups do not necessarily come from discharges from the acute services.</p><p>The number of patents discharged from psychiatric units and hospitals during the period 2006-2011 is set out below:</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of Discharges</th></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>20,098</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>20,498</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>20,603</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>20,213</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>19,614</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>18,968</td></tr></table></p><p>The data for 2012 is not yet available.</p><p>Significant progress has been made in closing the old traditional psychiatric hospitals and providing modern acute in-patient facilities in line with <i>A Vision for Change</i> .  Progress has also been made in providing appropriate alternative continuing care accommodation for those service users who require such accommodation.</p><p>There continues to be a reduction in the bed capacity in the older psychiatric hospitals with 394 beds at the start of 2013 compared to 1,352 beds in such premises at the end of 2009.  The HSE&rsquo;s Service Plan 2013 commits to continuing to rationalise adult in-patient and continuing care provision in line with <i>A Vision for Change</i>   and the reduction of a minimum of 102 acute in-patient beds by end 2013.  In addition, there has been considerable decline in the number of patients resident in Irish psychiatric units and hospitals over recent years.

The application is being considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed last year by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines.  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of pirfenidone and concluded that, at the submitted price, pirfenidone is not cost-effective for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The report is available on the NCPE's website (). The NCPE report is an important input to assist decision making and informs further discussions between the HSE and the manufacturer of the drug.</p><p>  The HSE has had negotiations with Intermune (the manufacturer of pirfenidone) in relation to the pricing of pirfenidone and is examining an offer made by Intermune. The offer will be assessed in the context of the procedures for the assessment of new medicines as per the 2012 agreement between IPHA, the HSE and the Department of Health. </p><p>  The HSE is carefully considering all the issues which arise in relation to the proposed benefits and costs of this medicine and expects to reach a decision in the near future.</p></reply>

Desired outcomes range from a return to full independence in social and work situations to a person requiring long-term support and care but with a higher level of independence than in the absence of neuro-rehabilitation.  Current services available include acute hospital services; the National Rehabilitation Hospital; multidisciplinary community services; long-term assisted living supports; and rehabilitative training services.  These services are provided directly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and several non-statutory organisations.</p><p>  The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE) have developed and published the &ldquo;National Policy and Strategy for the provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011 - 2015&rdquo;. In addition, the HSE is developing its Rehabilitation Medicine Programme within the Clinical Strategy and Programmes Directorate. The Report is the overarching policy on neuro-rehabilitation services and includes proposals for a framework for the future of neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland, including key elements such as guiding principles; implementation structure; methodology for implementation; and information and communication.</p><p>  The Report recognises that given the current economic climate, the focus in the short to medium term has to be on re-configuration of services, structures and resources and the enhancement of the skills and competencies required to meet the changing context.  The key priority areas, as identified in the HSE&rsquo;s National Operational Plan for 2013 are to map and develop Integrated Service Area level rehabilitation networks; implement the model of care for rehabilitation services within the networks with a focus on community rehabilitation.</p><p>  The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has been working in collaboration with the HSE's National Disability Unit as part of an expert Working Group planning for the implementation of the Report. The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has incorporated key elements of the Report into its own Model of Care and adopted the Strategy&rsquo;s recommendation of &ldquo;hub and spoke&rdquo; model for specialist rehabilitation services and is keen to progress with a comprehensive model for the continuation of such service into the community. This co-operation will continue in 2013.</p></reply>

Currently if a patient has a prescription specifying a branded medicine, they will receive that branded medicine from the pharmacist.  If a pharmacy does not have a particular medicine in stock the patient may request the pharmacy to order the medicine or alternatively seek the medicine in question from another pharmacy.</p><p>  The provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 relating to the substitution of interchangeable medicines and reference pricing are expected to be commenced shortly. The Act enables patients to opt for lower cost interchangeable medicines. In general terms, when a pharmacist is presented with a prescription for an interchangeable medicine, which is not the subject of a clinical exemption, the pharmacist is obliged to offer the patient the opportunity to agree to substituting the prescribed product with an interchangeable medicine which is in stock in the pharmacy and is of lower cost to the patient or the HSE, as the case may be. The patient may either accept the interchangeable medicine offered by the pharmacist or opt to receive the branded interchangeable medicine where prescribed. Alternatively, the patient may opt to go to a different pharmacy to receive a less expensive interchangeable medicine. </p><p>  The Act also allows the HSE to set a reference price for groups of interchangeable medicines. Medical card holders will only face an additional charge where a reference price has been set for a group of interchangeable medicines and the medicine dispensed is priced higher than the reference price and is not the subject of a clinical exemption. It is expected that all pharmacies supplying items to patients under the GMS and community drugs schemes will have products available at or lower than the reference price and therefore patients will not incur any unavoidable costs under this legislation. </p><p>  Under the Act, when the HSE sets a reference price for a group of interchangeable medicines, pharmacists must be given four weeks notice before the reference price takes effect. If a pharmacy does not have a medicine available at or below the reference price the patient may request the pharmacy to order a suitable medicine or alternatively seek a lower cost medicine from another pharmacy.</p></reply>
