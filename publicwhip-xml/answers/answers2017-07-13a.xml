Last year's report by the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC) on this area of inspection activity made a series of recommendations for improvements.  As a result of NOAC's review and my own Department's consideration of the matter, the Strategy for the Rental Sector specifically prioritises strengthening the inspection capacity of local authorities and increasing the number and frequency of inspections of rental properties.  </p>  <p>  Building on its considerable experience in implementing shared service approaches to service delivery in recent years, a shared services model for inspection and enforcement of the rental accommodation standards regulations will be developed by the local government sector. Procedures for a more efficient, standardised and transparent inspection and enforcement approach across all local authority areas will be introduced. Under the Rental Strategy, this is  targeted for completion by Q4 2017 and my Department is working with the local authorities, through the City and County Management Association, to develop this new and more effective inspection and enforcement system.  </p>  <p>  Specific ring-fenced funding for inspection and compliance activity will be identified from 2018 onwards and annual targets for both inspection and compliance will be agreed with local authorities. The objective set out in the Strategy is to increase inspection numbers incrementally each year so that, by 2021, 25% of all rental properties are inspected annually. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-13a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071300081#WRA00800"><p>The flexibility of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) as a social housing support is one of the scheme&rsquo;s key characteristics and was one of the primary benefits envisaged at the outset of the scheme. The new arrangements for movement between local authorities, introduced in April 2017, have increased equality of access by allowing households eligible for social housing support to avail of HAP in any local authority area, subject to the current Social Housing Eligibility Income Bands. Such flexibility  removes administrative barriers and delays, better utilises all private rental stock for social housing purposes and provides for maximum activation potential of HAP households by removing geographical barriers to employment, such as loss of housing support or loss of time on a transfer list. </p>  <p>  The Homeless Place Finder Service which operates in Dublin and Cork can also utilise HAP inter-authority movement, as they seek out potential properties suitable for households who have been identified as homeless. For example, in the case of the Dublin  Placefinder Service, because of the flexibility of HAP, the Service can support homeless households residing in emergency accommodation but who wish to have their long-term housing needs met in another local authority area, to find suitable accommodation supported by HAP. However, the rent limits that will apply to any HAP property, in respect of any household, will be those which apply in the local authority where the property is situated.  All local authorities facilitating inter-authority movement, including those assisting homeless households to exit homeless accommodation via a Place Finder Service, must consult with the new local authority in relation to the appropriate level of support that should be provided in order to ensure equity. </p>  <p>  HAP is an important and valuable tool in supporting all households, including homeless households, who need assistance with their long-term housing needs. </p></reply>

The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme, which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, .</p><p>The scheme is applicable to dwellings, which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave, established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave.  I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion.</p></reply>

However, I am currently examining the Home Choice Loan Scheme and am also considering how local authority mortgages can be better publicised to ensure that credit worthy households who may be unable to source adequate loan finance from commercial lenders but could be eligible for one of the local authority mortgages, are made aware of the opportunity available to them.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the critical issue of housing affordability and in this regard, the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland which has just commenced will be focussing in particular on the broad issue of housing affordability and access. </p>  <p>  In terms of housing affordability, a suite of measures have been taken to make housing construction viable at more affordable price points, which is important in bridging the affordability gap between price and the level of mortgage funding that a household can service. The measures taken include the &euro;226m local infrastructure housing activation fund; leveraging the value of State-owned lands to deliver a more affordable rental offering in Rent Pressure Zones; streamlined planning systems for housing developments; and other planning reforms to provide flexibility to deliver viable housing schemes and apartment developments in the right locations. </p>  <p>  On 27 April 2017, details of some 1,700 hectares of land in local authority and housing agency ownership were published on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map, with the potential to deliver 42,500 homes nationally.  All local authorities have been requested to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for the earliest possible development of their lands.  The final model for each site will be formulated in the context of the Plans but in practice, it will include proposals for social housing and housing at more affordable prices and rents.  I have asked that local authorities complete the preparation of their plans by 30 September.</p></reply>

It is intended that an agreement, with confirmed funding, will be entered into between the City Council , the receiver and my Department, prior to commencement of development, for a further 550 new homes, the majority of which will be housing earmarked for affordable rental, with the balance provided as social housing with a particular focus on housing for older people. </p>  <p>  While the progression of the Planning Scheme is ultimately a matter for Dublin City Council, I am committed to working with the Council to deliver these social and affordable units on what is a key site for the sustainable development of Dublin City.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-13a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071300081#WRA01800"><p>The cost of housing, and its affordability for a particular household, is a key issue and one that has been the subject of considerable focus in many countries. While there is no universally ideal price/rent to income ratio or minimum residual income requirement there is broad agreement that ideally households should be spending no more than a third of their income on housing costs over the longer term. </p>  <p>  In terms of housing more broadly, a suite of measures have been taken to make housing construction viable at more affordable price points, including the &euro;226m local infrastructure housing activation fund; leveraging the value of State-owned lands to deliver a more affordable rental offering in Rent Pressure Zones; streamlined planning systems for housing developments; and other planning reforms to provide flexibility to deliver viable housing schemes and apartment developments in the right locations.</p>  <p>  On 27 April, details of some 1,500 hectares of land in local authority and housing agency ownership were published on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map, with the potential to deliver 37,500 homes nationally. All local authorities have been requested to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for the earliest possible development of their lands.  The final model for each site will be formulated in the context of these Plans but, in practice, it will include proposals for social housing and housing at more affordable prices and rents.  </p>  <p>  In the case of LIHAF, the aim is to ensure that an affordability return is secured for the investment in public infrastructure involved. Again, with a wide range of funding being provided for very different sites, involving varying scales of housing delivery, it will be for each local authority to conclude an agreement with the housing providers involved on the particular approach to be taken to secure the affordability dividend in each individual case, taking account of the circulars issued by my Department. </p>  <p>  I have initiated a targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland, with an emphasis on strengthening the measures already in place and identifying new initiatives that add value and raise ambition.  As part of this review process, which I intend to conclude by September, I have asked my Department to focus in particular on the broad issue of housing affordability and how we can facilitate more households to access the housing of their choice.</p></reply>

All local authorities have been requested to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for the earliest possible development of their lands. I have asked that these Plans be prepared by 30 September 2017. </p>  <p>  In parallel, South Dublin County Council (SDCC) and Dublin City Council (DCC) have been progressing four major sites towards development.  In relation to the tenure mix, SDCC opted for a 70:30 private/social mix, while DCC opted for 50% private; 30% social; and 20% affordable. The development of these sites is, in the first instance, a matter for the Councils.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector, published in December 2016, the commitment to develop an affordable rental model, originally contained in Rebuilding Ireland, is now being progressed by local authorities, in Rent Pressure Zones, through leveraging the value of their land to deliver a more affordable rental offering. In this regard, Dublin City Council has developed a detailed proposal and my Department is currently considering it with the Council. </p>  <p>  In parallel, as part of the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland, my Department is examining the broader issue of housing affordability. Again, the specific proposal by Dublin City Council and the experience of South Dublin County Council will be factored into that review process and my Department will also be consulting more broadly with local authorities generally as part of the review process.</p></reply>

A Steering Group was convened to oversee the review.</p><p>The terms of reference of the Steering Group included the following: - </p><p>-  Have regard to the typical risk profile faced by residents, their visitors and fire service personnel in and about apartment developments and housing estates;</p><p>-  Take account of normal hazards and relevant safety management arrangements as well as typical passive and active safety features;</p><p>-  Outline general advice and guidance which can be used by owners/residents and their professional advisers, to ensure that an adequate level of safety is in place for persons in and about their development.  This may include making provision for - </p><p>-  appropriate or enhanced fire detection and alarm measures;</p><p>-  checking that appropriate escape routes from the premises are available, designed in accordance with current standards; </p><p>-  ensuring evacuation plans are rehearsed in each premises in the event of a fire incident.</p><p>-  Include a case study based on the Millfield estate at Newbridge, Co. Kildare.</p><p>The independent fire safety expert has completed his review and a report on the matter has been received by my Department from the Steering Group.

This contact covers all aspects of the Government's <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>, which is focused on increasing supply across all tenures, to achieve total housing output of at least 25,000 homes per year by 2020, effectively doubling the output of 12,600 homes recorded in 2015.</p><p>With particular regard to the needs of those on housing waiting lists, Rebuilding Ireland sets out the target of delivering 47,000 social housing units through build, refurbishment, acquisition and leasing over the period 2016 to 2021, alongside an accelerated roll-out of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Scheme to meet the needs of some 80,000 households. This activity is being supported through a significantly increased investment programme of &euro;5.35 billion, comprising &euro;4.5 billion in capital funding and &euro;844 million in support of programmes funded from current expenditure.  A further &euro;226 million is provided for the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund for investment in key enabling infrastructure to open up lands for early development. </p><p>The continuing, regular contact between my Department and the local authorities supports the advancement of social housing, for example through quarterly meetings that focus on resolving technical issues with projects and advancing them to site as soon possible. My Department has continuously urged all local authorities to bring forward projects as quickly as possible, given the significantly increased funding available to support their activity. While still at an early stage of implementation, there is already strong evidence that the focus on increasing and accelerating housing supply in Rebuilding Ireland is yielding results.  In 2016, the housing needs of over 19,000 households were met through a range of social housing programmes, supported by expenditure of over &euro;935 million.  A further &euro;1.3 billion has been provided for 2017 to support the accelerated delivery of social housing and the achievement of this year's target to meet the housing needs of over 21,000 households.  </p><p>The national roll out of the HAP scheme was completed on 1 March this year and HAP is now available to all eligible households.  There are currently more than 24,000 households being supported by the scheme, with the security of knowing that this support will continue even as their household income increases, subject to adjustment in their differential rent.</p><p>In the same vein, there are currently over 500 rapid delivery homes now advancing through the planning design, procurement and construction stages, and work is underway to ensure that a further 500 units are advanced in the coming months, bringing the number of units in the programme to 1,000 by year end. Several of these rapid delivery developments are now in the final stages of construction, showing clearly that this approach is being used successfully and increasingly, and an additional 500 units are targeted for delivery in 2018. The establishment of a framework of rapid delivery contractors by the Office of Government Procurement means that local authorities in the Greater Dublin Area and beyond can take advantage of this approach, allowing them to run quicker procurement competitions and advance rapid delivery projects to site more efficiently. </p><p>More broadly, housing construction trends are all showing strong positive growth, with planning permissions, housing development commencement notices and completions of new units, measured by the number of ESB connections, all registering substantial increases on last year. The work of promoting residential development on State lands saw the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map published in April 2017. The map is a vital initial step in the new strategic approach to State land management, which will be further developed through the forthcoming National Planning Framework, to be titled 'Ireland 2040: Our Plan'. The datasets published on the map include details of over 700 local authority and Housing Agency-owned sites, totalling some 1,700 hectares, as well as 30 sites (covering about 200 hectares) owned by State or semi-State bodies. The map is available to view on the Rebuilding Ireland website at: . </p><p>Opening up the supply of State land in this way, for social and mixed-tenure housing, is a critically important policy in addressing a situation where the pace of recovery in the housing development sector is slower than it needs to be to meet demand. In practical terms, the development of these sites will mean accelerating social housing delivery and securing more homes for sale and rent at lower and more affordable price points. In this regard, I welcome the fact that two of the Dublin local authorities have already brought forward four key, large-scale sites, capable of delivering 3,000 new homes, and I expect other local authorities to follow suit.</p><p>Providing affordable, quality and accessible housing is a top priority for the Government. I will be considering further initiatives and actions to address the issue of affordability in the context of the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland which my Department has now commenced.</p></reply>

The scale of the construction pipeline, as at end-Quarter 1 2017, represents a major escalation in the social housing build programme and more projects are being added on an ongoing basis, to ensure we deliver on the Rebuilding Ireland targets. </p><p>The need for the earliest possible delivery in respect of social housing is understood by all concerned, using the most appropriate mix of delivery mechanisms including construction, refurbishment, acquisition and leasing. In addition, the national roll out of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme was completed on 1 March 2017. There are currently more than 24,000 households being supported by the scheme, with the security of knowing that, subject to appropriate adjustment in their differential rent, they can continue to avail of support under the scheme as their household income increases.</p><p>Notwithstanding the progress being made, the Taoiseach signaled the Government's intention to carry out a focused review of Rebuilding Ireland as we approach the first 12 months of its implementation. This review is now underway, with an emphasis on strengthening the measures already in place and identifying new initiatives that add value.</p></reply>

The final model for each site, including the affordable rental element, will be the subject of careful consideration by the local authority concerned, including by the elected members, who are best placed to know and provide for the housing need in their area.  My Department is considering, in conjunction with local authorities, what national and/or local requirements should be specified in relation to eligibility.</p>  <p>  I am also considering further initiatives and actions to address the issue of affordability in the context of the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland which my Department has now commenced.</p></reply>

Individuals with a housing need who in the past were reluctant to avail of full time work as they would lose their Rent Supplement support, can now move to HAP, avail of full-time work and retain their housing support, with an adjustment in their differential rent.</p><p>HAP is available to all eligible households in all local authority areas across the State. HAP has been rolled out on a statutory phased basis since September 2014 with 7 local authorities delivering the scheme initially, 11 more authorities added in 2015, 10 added in 2016 and the final 3 Dublin authorities providing HAP from 1 March 2017. The phased nature of the HAP roll-out has allowed for significant learning in the operation of the scheme. In this way, new HAP authorities have benefited from the experience of those authorities where the scheme has been previously operational.  On average in 2017, 333 additional tenancies are being supported by HAP each week with just over 24,000 households currently having their housing needs met under the scheme and some 18,000 separate landlords and agents currently in receipt of monthly HAP payments. </p><p>As HAP is a social housing support and consequently households are not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list. With the completion of the HAP roll-out and the ending of the scheme&rsquo;s pilot phase, a Ministerial Direction was issued instructing local authorities to continue to offer HAP tenants access to other forms of social housing through the transfer list. </p><p>Since April, following the national rollout of the scheme, in cases where a tenant currently on a local authority waiting list wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area, such requests can now be facilitated under inter-authority movement. In order to maintain the equitable treatment of all housing applicants, inter-authority movement for HAP applicants is based on the current Social Housing Eligibility Income Bands, i.e. movement will only be facilitated across local authorities with Income Bands that are equal or higher; or where shared areas of choice are already operated.</p><p>A new HAP website, , was launched in Q1 2017 and provides prospective HAP tenants and landlords with the information that they need to better understand how HAP works.</p><p>I continue to keep the operation of HAP under review but I am currently satisfied with how the scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme committed to under Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

It is unsurprising, therefore, that it is the lack of housing supply and a competitive market that is widely accepted as being primarily responsible for driving the high levels of house price and rental inflation that we have seen in recent years. </p>  <p>  In order to directly influence and generate supply of new homes, the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan contains a suite of actions, such as the &euro;226m Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund; leveraging the value of State-owned lands to deliver a more affordable rental offering in Rent Pressure Zones; streamlined planning systems for housing developments; and other planning reforms to provide flexibility to deliver viable housing schemes and apartment developments in the right locations.  </p>  <p>  In addition, analysis of vacant dwellings data from Census 2016 provides strong evidence for targeted policies to maximise the number of vacant properties that can be brought back into use, especially in our cities and large towns where demand is greatest.</p>  <p>  Recent housing activity reports, available on www.rebuildingireland.ie, show that strong supply-side measures are beginning to have a positive impact, with all output indicators showing upward trends. However, it is crucial that we continue to focus on supply and particularly the supply of homes at more affordable price points.</p>  <p>  As part of the targeted review process for Rebuilding Ireland, I have asked my Department to focus in particular on the broad issues of housing supply and affordability for different market segments, building on the measures already being advanced under the Action Plan.</p></reply>

In this context, Pillar 5 of the Action Plan is specifically focused on &quot;Utilising Existing Housing Stock&quot;, with a key objective of ensuring that the existing vacant housing stock throughout the country and across all forms of tenure, in both the public and private sectors, is used to the optimum degree possible. In this regard, Action 5.1 of Rebuilding Ireland commits to the development of a National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy, informed by Census 2016 data. </p><p>To this end, the Housing Agency established a working group comprising senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself to inform the Strategy.  My Department has received the output from the work of this Group and is presently engaging with key Departments and Agencies to consider the analysis and agree on the recommended actions, prior to publication.  </p><p>I would like to see as much ambition as possible in bringing as many viable vacant properties back into use at an early stage.  I intend, as part of the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland, to explore what further actions can be taken and what new ideas we can bring to bear, in close liaison with Ministerial colleagues.  If budgetary measures are needed to reinforce the ambition, this may delay the publication of the Vacant Homes Strategy.  But this will not delay the commencement of important work at local level in gathering more accurate and up-to-date information on where vacant properties are and who owns them, so that we can facilitate the re-use of many vacant properties, particularly in our cities and towns.  </p><p>Ahead of finalisation of the Strategy, it is important to note that my Department has already introduced a number of significant measures to incentivise the increased use of vacant housing stock to help meet the needs of those in receipt of social housing assistance.  These initiatives include</p><p>-  the Repair and Leasing Scheme, which is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property,</p><p>-  the Buy and Renew Scheme, which allows local authorities and AHBs to approach owners of vacant, privately-owned houses in need of repair or remediation, with the option to either lease and repair, or to buy and repair, the dwelling, and</p><p>-  the &euro;70m Housing Agency Acquisitions Fund, to establish a revolving fund to acquire some 1,600 units from banks and investment companies over the period to 2020 for social housing use. </p><p>In relation to vacancy and existing social housing stock, my Department has introduced the Voids and Derelicts programmes to provide additional support to local authorities in remediating more seriously derelict social houses, and bring them back into use for social housing tenants.  Collectively, these two programmes have already seen the remediation of some 7,200 units between 2014 and 2016, at an estimated total cost of &euro;68 million.  This is on top of units completed by the local authorities themselves outside of the funding support from my Department. </p></reply>

This activity is being supported through a significantly increased investment programme of &euro;5.35 billion, while a further &euro;226 million is provided for the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund for investment in key enabling infrastructure to open up lands for early development.</p><p>I have not indicated any change in relation to the social housing targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland and I am confident that they will be met. While still at an early stage of implementation, there is already strong evidence that the focus on increasing and accelerating housing supply in Rebuilding Ireland is yielding results. In 2016, the housing needs of over 19,000 households were met through a range of housing programmes, supported by expenditure of over &euro;935 million.  A further &euro;1.3 billion has been provided for 2017 to support the accelerated delivery of social housing and the achievement of the 2017 target to meet the housing needs of over 21,000 households.  </p><p>Looking ahead, my Department has published Status Reports on Social Housing Construction Projects, the latest of which is available at the following link: .  The report provides details of over 600 social housing projects, involving the construction of over 10,000 new social homes across the 31 local authority areas.  The scale of the construction pipeline, as at end-Quarter 1 2017, represents a major escalation in the social housing build programme and more projects are being added on an ongoing basis, to ensure we deliver on the Rebuilding Ireland targets. </p></reply>

For this reason, the Government introduced the Rent Predictability Measure and established the system of Rent Pressure Zones in December 2016 to moderate the rise in rents in the parts of the country where rents are highest and rising.  In these areas, for a period of three years, rents can only rise by a maximum of 4% annually.  The practical effect of the measure is that for three years, rents for more than 186,000 households who currently rent their homes in these areas will be lower than they would have been if market rents had continued to apply.</p><p>Section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended by section 36 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016) sets out thresholds of rent level and rent price inflation, on the basis of which Rent Pressure Zones are designated and the Rent Predictability Measure limits on rent increases come into effect.  These are:</p><p>(i) The annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and </p><p>(ii) The average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent (the National Standardised Rent in the RTB&rsquo;s Rent Index Report) in the last quarter (&euro;987 per month).</p><p>When considering whether to propose a Local Electoral Area for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone, the Housing Agency, in consultation with the relevant local authority, assesses housing demand and supply, experiences in relation to the Rental Accommodation Scheme and Housing Assistance Payment Scheme, as well as trends in relation to general housing need and homelessness in the area.</p><p>In addition to the Rent Predictability Measure, the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 introduced a number of other provisions to enhance tenants&rsquo; security, including:</p><p>-  The abolition of a landlord&rsquo;s right, during the first 6 months of a further Part 4 tenancy, to end that tenancy for no stated ground;</p><p>-  The extension of the term of Part 4 tenancies from 4 to 6 years;</p><p>-  Where a landlord proposes to sell 10 or more units within a single development at the same time, the sale will be subject to the existing tenants remaining in situ, other than in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>My Department has initiated a review of the Rent Predictability Measure. At this stage, the measure has been in place for 6 months and data from the Residential Tenancies Board&rsquo;s Rent Index Report for Quarter 1 2017 is also available.  Using this latest data, it will be possible to ascertain the effectiveness of the Rent Predictability Measure and whether any changes need to be made.</p><p>As part of the review, my Department, last month, launched a public consultation on the Rent Predictability Measure and the system of Rent Pressure Zones.  The consultation allowed members of the public and interested parties to provide their opinions and suggestions on the functioning of the measure.  The 69 submissions received from the consultation process, which concluded on 30 June, will feed into the review of the measure.</p></reply>

These include the delivery of increased social housing supply through new-build, acquisition and refurbishment schemes and independent tenancies for homeless households in the private rented sector through housing supports such as the enhanced Housing Assistance Payment.  </p><p>As part of the response to the commitment contained in Rebuilding Ireland that, by mid-2017, commercial hotels and B&amp;amp;B's would only be used as emergency accommodation for homeless families in limited circumstances, housing authorities are delivering a number of family-focused, supported temporary accommodation facilities (Family hubs).  </p><p>Family hubs are an important first response for families who become homeless and who have no alternative other than commercial hotels. The hubs will provide more appropriate and suitable accommodation for families. They are not a long term housing solution, as families will move into houses and apartments that will be provided under social housing supports, as supply becomes available.  This type of emergency accommodation provides a secure and stable placement for families on an on-going basis unlike the insecurity of hotel accommodation especially during peak periods and holidays.</p><p>These custom-developed facilities will offer family living arrangements with a greater level of stability than is possible in hotel accommodation while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  Furthermore, such arrangements will facilitate more coordinated needs assessment and support planning including on-site access to required services, such as welfare, health, housing services, cooking and laundry facilities and appropriate family supports.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy's specific query, statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities, while my Department&rsquo;s role involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.  Notwithstanding this, I understand that the housing authorities concerned will be working hard to ensure the progression of homeless families into independent tenancies, as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

Proposals for individual solar farm developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, in the same manner as other proposed developments. Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development Act, each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned. Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.</p>  <p>  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department. Planning authorities must then make their own decisions based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning permission applications for solar farm developments. However, the matter will be kept under review, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, and his Department - which leads on renewable energy policy - in the context of the Government's White Paper on Energy Policy, published in December 2015, the development of a Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework, as well as the finalisation of a new support scheme for renewable electricity by that Department, expected in 2018.</p></reply>

When vacancies arose public bodies were to reallocate or reorganise work or staff accordingly. Any exceptions to this principle, which arose in very limited circumstances only, required prior sanction. </p>  <p>  My Department received a delegated sanction from the Department of Finance in August 2009 for implementation of this general moratorium on the filling of public sector posts across all local authorities. This was on condition that the overall staffing levels in the sector were reduced in line with the Employment Control Framework.</p>  <p>  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.  In this regard, it was a matter for each Chief Executive, in the first instance, to ensure that the moratorium was implemented while the appropriate service levels were maintained.  The use of agency recruitment and outsourcing was, and remains, a matter for each Chief Executive to consider.</p>  <p>  Local authorities undertook work force planning to identify how staff could be optimally deployed and to highlight gaps that needed to be filled. Local authorities re-deployed staff and re-allocated work to meet key needs. Where the gaps couldn't be filled, local authorities applied to my Department seeking sanction to recruit. </p>  <p>  My Department carefully operated its delegated sanction from the Department of Finance and later from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and worked very closely with local authorities to ensure that critical posts were filled while overall numbers were reduced. In considering sanction requests, public safety, maintaining key front line services and economic issues were given precedence as was the requirement to avoid increases in overall staffing levels. Contract posts were favoured as they allowed flexibility in this challenging period for Ireland's economy. In the very exceptional situation that a post was to be filled permanently all redeployment options, including redeployment from the broader public service, were fully exhausted before recruitment was permitted.</p>  <p>  My Department gathers quarterly data on staff numbers in local authorities. The data gathered does not provide detail in respect of the use of agency recruitment and outsourcing, and accordingly the information requested is not available in my Department.</p></reply>

The changes to the eligibility criteria came into effect on 27 March 2017.Since the introduction of the Mortgage to Rent (MTR) Scheme in 2012, a total of 3,694 cases have been submitted under the scheme to the end of June 2017.  22 of these are new applications received by the Housing Agency, under the revised eligibility criteria applicable since 27 March 2017.  </p><p>Changes to the scheme mean that certain steps of the MTR process are now required to be completed prior to the submission of a completed MTR application to the Housing Agency. The broadening of the eligibility criteria and streamlining of the administrative process were welcomed by all stakeholders, and I understand from the Housing Agency that the process changes have had an initial impact on the number of applications under the revised scheme. However, it will be several more months before an increase in the number of successful cases will be apparent given that the optimum timeframe for processing a case should reduce to 9 months following the implementation of the Review&rsquo;s actions. My Department and the Housing Agency are working with all stakeholders to ensure that the actions set out in the Review are being effectively implemented to benefit a greater number of households.</p><p>The Housing Agency publishes, on a quarterly basis, detailed statistical information on the operation of the MTR scheme. This information is available on the Agency's website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>The Review also concluded that the current financial model of the Mortgage to Rent scheme may not, in its current configuration, be capable of delivering the scale of successful cases that could benefit from the scheme over time. In order to test the operability of the alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency is working with a number of financial entities who have come forward with an interest in working with the Mortgage to Rent scheme to progress a number of pilot alternative long-term lease arrangements.  In advance of these pilots, a targeted market testing exercise was undertaken by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), to test the suitability of the proposed enhanced leasing arrangements to ascertain if they would be viable for a mortgage to rent cohort, taking account of the necessity to provide a long-term stable solution for eligible households.  The comments received from interested parties are being reviewed by my Department and the Housing Agency.</p><p>The next step is to issue a formal call for Expressions of Interest from institutions interested in taking part in the pilot operating models.  It is anticipated that the Housing Agency will manage the evaluation process on behalf of my Department and make recommendations on the make-up of the pilots.  The drafting of the content of the Expressions of Interest is currently underway. </p></reply>

This review is now underway, with an emphasis on strengthening the measures already in place and identifying new initiatives that add value and raise ambition across all five Pillars. As part of the review process, my Department will focus in particular on the broad issues of housing supply and affordability for different market segments, building on the measures already being advanced in the Action Plan.</p><p>One of the main elements under Pillar 3 for the acceleration of supply in private housing was the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), which is aimed at removing infrastructural blockages that were hindering development on otherwise suitable and strategically located sites. D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council received approval under LIHAF for funding of &euro;15.19 million for its Cherrywood proposal to provide public infrastructure that will support the delivery of 2,000 housing units by 2021, with potential for a further 6,000 homes in the longer term. The LIHAF-funded infrastructure will facilitate additional social housing of 200 housing units in Cherrywood in the short term through the 10% Part V social housing dividend, with a potential of up to a further 600 social housing units in the longer term as the site is fully built out. </p><p>In addition, the Council received approval under LIHAF for funding of &euro;4.16 million for its Woodbrook-Shanganagh proposal, together with a commitment from the National Transport Authority to fund the construction of a DART Station.  I understand the Draft Woodbrook-Shanganagh LAP, which was agreed by the Council at its July meeting, includes two parcels of land for residential development - Woodbrook, which is privately owned (c21.4ha), and Shanganagh Castle, which is owned by the Council (c.11.2ha). The Plan provides for the Woodbrook lands to deliver between 1,000 and c.1,320 homes, while the Shanganagh Castle lands will deliver between 360 and c.540 homes. I understand the Council is currently developing its plan to provide mixed-tenure housing on its own lands.</p><p>The LIHAF infrastructural works will open up both sites and the substantial additional supply of housing across the different tenures on these strategically located and well-serviced sites will help ease the pressure on the housing market generally as well as on rented accommodation.</p><p>The Council is currently engaging with the housing developers to conclude specific agreements in relation to finalising the timelines for delivery of the housing, in line with the provision of infrastructure, and the required cost reduction commitments.  My Department expects that final agreements will be in place by the end of July. </p></reply>

It provides that the Housing Agency, in consultation with housing authorities, may make a proposal to the Minister that an area should be considered as a Rent Pressure Zone. Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.</p><p>For an area to be designated a Rent Pressure Zone, it must satisfy the following criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended by section 36 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016):</p><p>(i) The annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and</p><p>(ii) The average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent (the National Standardised Rent in the RTB&rsquo;s Rent Index Report) in the last quarter (&euro;987 per month).</p><p>On 15 June, the RTB published the Rent Index Report in relation to Quarter 1 2017, which includes a summary of the data used as the criteria for designating Rent Pressure Zones in relation to all Local Electoral Areas in the country. This allows all interested parties to see exactly where their area stands in relation to average rent levels and increases and possible designation.  The data from the Rent Index Report relating to Gorey, County Wexford are detailed in the following table: <table><tr><th>Local Electoral   Area</th><th>Quarters &amp;gt; 7%</th><th>Average 2017 Q1 (&euro;)  </th></tr><tr><td>Gorey</td><td>4</td><td>748.83</td></tr></table></p><p>While in 4 of the last 6 quarters rent inflation in Gorey has been 7% or greater, the average monthly rent is &euro;748.83, which is below the average national standardised rent of &euro;987 per month. Therefore, the Local Electoral Area of Gorey does not meet the criteria for designation at this time. </p><p>The Housing Agency will continue to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation. Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones.</p><p>On 15 June 2017, my Department announced the launch of a public consultation on the review of the Rent Predictability Measure and the system of Rent Pressure Zones. The consultation has allowed members of the public and interested parties to provide their opinions and suggestions on the functioning of the measure.  The 69 submissions received from the consultation process, which concluded on 30 June, will feed into the review of the measure.</p></reply>

In particular, the Guidelines outline a range of densities appropriate to different location types, from lower densities at the edges of smaller towns through to densities in the range of a minimum of 50 dwellings per hectare in larger urban areas along public transport corridors.</p><p>However, the Guidelines do not set out specific policy advice in relation to height of buildings alone, in isolation from broader location, design and layout considerations nor would it be appropriate to do so, given variability in urban contexts and the inappropriateness of a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; height policy for very diverse urban areas. Rather, it is a matter for local authorities to ensure the appropriate application of the Guidelines in their statutory development plan and development management processes.</p><p>Permissible building heights in different parts of the Dublin City Council Area are set out in Chapter 16 of the Dublin City Development Plan 2016-2022, available at the following link: .  </p><p>My Department is currently at an advanced stage of completing a residential development cost review, which is due to be finalised later this month.

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme. To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum, have been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year and have been allocated a house under a local authority allocation scheme. </p><p>The requirement to pay water charges is a condition under the scheme and is reflected in legislation. Section 3(A)(9) of the Water Services Act 2014 (inserted by Section 48 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015) provides that a person who is a tenant of a dwelling let to him/her under the Housing Acts 1966 to 2014 and who proposes to purchase the dwelling shall before completion of the sale provide the local authority concerned with a certificate of discharge from Irish Water confirming that any charge under section 21 of the No. 2 Act 2013 in respect of the dwelling owed to Irish Water has been paid. The sale of the dwelling cannot proceed until a certificate of discharge in respect of the dwelling has been received from Irish Water. </p><p>The Oireachtas has approved the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services and I am committed to legislating on the recommendations.

Dublin, in particular, is suffering from a significant deficit in supply of new homes. </p>  <p>  This Fund is key to getting sites moving which would otherwise be inaccessible due to lack of necessary public infrastructure.  It is estimated that the targeted investment of &euro;226m will stimulate the early supply of 23,000 new dwellings by 2021 with potential for up to 69,000 units in the longer term, as the sites are fully built out.  Funds are being provided to local authorities to build roads, bridges and public amenities such as parks through a public procurement process, and this infrastructure will remain in public ownership and ultimately be for the benefit of housholds living in the vicinity of the infrastructure.</p>  <p>  The Fund has been allocated to over 34 projects of varying cost and scale, ranging from &euro;0.7m to build a road which will facilitate 200 houses to be built on one site in Co. Tipperary, to &euro;20m to build road and parks infrastructure in Adamstown, South Dublin, to get 1,000 houses started. </p>  <p>  Affordability was a factor in the criteria for the selection of the 34 projects which were approved but it was only one of a number of very important criteria such as strategic fit and the early release of significant scale of new homes.  In the vast majority of these projects, such as Adamstown, Kilkenny western environs, Mount Avenue, Dundalk, or Mungret, Limerick, it is anticipated that the housing facilitated by the infrastructure delivery will be pitched at affordable prices and a 10% social housing dividend under Part V will also be secured from each project.  Furthermore, State-owned lands will be used in 12 of the projects to facilitate additional social housing, or homes for particular vulnerable groups, such as older people, in accordance with the needs of the individual areas concerned.</p>  <p>  Across the Dublin sites, the prices are likely to be higher than the national average, due to market factors such as the land costs and construction costs. However, even in these cases, we have ensured that the State gets a return on its investment by requiring a cost reduction to benefit the private buyer, as well as accelerating large-scale supply which is urgently required. Conversely, setting unrealistic affordability requirements would likely impact on the commercial viability and fundability of the developments, and could delay or stall the developments which the Fund had been created to facilitate.</p>  <p>  I am also considering further initiatives and actions to address the issue of affordability in the context of the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland which my Department has now commenced.</p></reply>

Under the Act, planning authorities are required to establish a register of vacant sites in their areas, beginning on 1 January 2017, and to issue annual notices to owners of vacant sites by 1 June 2018 in respect of vacant sites on the register on 1 January 2018. The levy will be applied by planning authorities, commencing on 1 January 2019 in respect of sites which were vacant and on the vacant site register during the year 2018 and will subsequently be applied on an annual basis thereafter, as long as a site remains on the vacant site register in the preceding year.</p>  <p>  Planning authorities are empowered to apply an annual vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of vacant sites which exceed 0.5 hectares in area - with reduced or zero rates of levy applying in specific circumstances &ndash; and which, in the planning authority&rsquo;s opinion, were vacant or idle in the preceding year, in areas identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development. The 3% rate of vacant site levy is consistent with the rate applied to derelict sites under the Derelict Sites Act 1990 and is considered reasonable, without being over-punitive, for the purposes of incentivising the activation of such sites for residential or regeneration purposes. </p>  <p>  All levies due on an individual site will remain a charge on the land concerned until all outstanding levies due are paid. Accordingly, under the vacant site levy provisions, there will be a cumulative effect associated with not activating a site for development purposes for each year that a site remains vacant or idle.</p>  <p>  In addition, with regard to addressing the issue of the hoarding of residentially zoned land, a number of amendments to the provisions relating to the extension of duration of planning permissions have been tabled in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, which is currently at D&aacute;il Report Stage.  The amendments proposed are collectively aimed at tightening up the provisions in relation to the extension of duration of planning permissions and ensuring that extensions of duration, without commencing substantial development, will no longer be facilitated.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I have initiated a focused review of Rebuilding Ireland, which I will be aiming to conclude in September.

Inspection and enforcement are a matter for local authorities who, under the relevant legislation, are designated as Building Control and Fire Authorities in their respective functional areas and have extensive statutory powers of inspection and enforcement. Section 8(4) of the Building Control Act 1990 provides that a Building Control Authority may serve an Enforcement Notice requiring that such steps as are necessary to ensure compliance with the Building Regulations, including Part B &ndash; Fire Safety, be taken within a specified period. An Enforcement Notice may be served at any time up to five years from the completion of the Building Works. </p>  <p>  Under the Fire Services Acts of 1981 and 2003 local authorities are designated as fire authorities in their respective functional areas and have extensive statutory powers of inspection and enforcement. Section 20 of the Act provides that the appropriate fire authority may serve a Fire Safety Notice on the owner or occupier of any building which appears to the authority to be a potentially dangerous building. Section 20 of the Act provides that a Fire Safety Notice in relation to a building may prohibit the use of the building, or a specified part of the building, unless or until specified precautions are taken to the satisfaction of the fire authority.</p>  <p>  In response to the tragic fire in Grenfell Tower, the immediate focus of attention has been on life safety issues. In that context, I requested that each local authority, as a matter of urgency, review their multi-storey social housing units to ensure that all early warning systems, including alarm and detection systems and means of escape including corridors, stairways and emergency exits are in place and fully functional. </p>  <p>  In order to raise awareness amongst private landlords, including landlords of households in receipt of social housing supports and rental assistance, the Residential Tenancies Board has been asked to remind all landlords of their statutory responsibilities and obligations as landlords to ensure that their properties fully comply with fire safety requirements. The RTB placed a notice to this effect on its website and is writing individually to all registered landlords providing detailed information.</p>  <p>  A Building Control Management System (BCMS) alert was issued to all registered users of the BCMS to remind those involved in works to existing or new buildings of the need to remain vigilant in relation to compliance with the Building Regulations and in particular to Part B Fire Safety. The 57,000 registered users include builders, assigned certifiers, designers and owners. </p>  <p>  I have also tasked the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management with co-ordinating a high-level Task Force to lead Ireland&rsquo;s re-appraisal of fire safety in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire. The actions involved include the following:</p>  <p>  -  The preliminary survey of the use of cladding products on residential buildings over 18m (6 storeys) being undertaken by fire services in Dublin is to be extended to the rest of the country and to cover buildings in all categories over 18m in height. The results to be reported to my Department by 19 July in relation to residential buildings, and by 2 August in relation to other buildings.</p>  <p>  -  My Department is to meet with the local authority Chief Fire Officers in the coming weeks to review current activities and to plan for further fire safety initiatives in prioritised areas of action.</p>  <p>  -  Responsibility for fire safety in buildings of all kinds (other than dwellings) is placed by Section 18 (2) of the Fire Services Act 1981 on the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; of each building. In order to assist those in both the public and private sector who hold this responsibility, consideration is being given to the publication of a guide on  undertaking  Fire Safety Assessments as provided for in Section 18 (6)(a) of the Act. This will facilitate persons having control of buildings to demonstrate that they are complying with their statutory responsibilities.</p>  <p>  The Task Force will be the main vehicle to monitor the situation and arrange necessary steps.  This will include considering further information that emerges from the United Kingdom on factors contributing to the Grenfell Tower fire, which will inform regulatory arrangements for ensuring effective and balanced fire safety standards and approaches in this country.</p></reply>

The lands were designated for the purpose of strategic housing development, together with the necessary supporting social and physical infrastructure.  A Planning Scheme was subsequently prepared for a total of 1,400 housing units to be developed on the site.  This Planning Scheme was approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2004 and this remains in force as the development framework for the subject site. </p><p>While the lands have not been developed to date, this largely reflects the downturn in economic conditions since 2007 which impacted on housebuilding nationally. </p><p>While section 169(6) of the Planning &amp;amp; Development Act 2000 (as amended) provides that &lsquo;<i>The Government may revoke or amend an order</i>&rsquo; in relation to the designation of an SDZ, the suitability of the subject lands for new housing remains valid and accords with the development of Navan as an important regional growth centre and county town. I understand that Meath County Council are pursuing the development of the lands in question, as the designated Development Agency, with the objective of securing construction of the identified housing over a number of phases. </p><p>In relation to the appropriateness of the current provisions of the adopted Planning Scheme for Clonmagadden, relevant changes to the SDZ legislation were made in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2015. These changes specifically facilitate a streamlined procedure in relation to the making of amendments to a SDZ Planning Scheme, where they are considered necessary.  The procedure is intended to enable the adaptation of approved Planning Schemes to respond to changed context and circumstances prevailing.  </p><p>In view of this, I have no plans to rescind the Government Order. </p></reply>

This is in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, the SEA Directive.  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process. </p><p>It is envisaged that the SEA process will take approximately 9 months.In light of the SEA requirements, it is expected that the Guidelines will be finalised and come into effect in Q1 2018.  In the meantime, the current Guidelines remain in force.</p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.</p></reply>

The maximum net income eligibility thresholds range from &euro;25,000 for a single person to &euro;42,000 for a 3 adult, 4 child household. The figures vary, within that overall range, depending on the local authority area concerned. </p><p>Households currently living in local authority rented accommodation, voluntary/ co-operative accommodation or accommodation provided under current expenditure programmes (such as the Housing Assistance Payments Scheme) are not included in the total number.  It is important to note that households that are in receipt of Rent Supplement are included in the figure, as this is not classified as a housing support. </p><p>Under <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, &euro;5.35 billion has been committed with the target of 47,000 units for delivery over the period to 2021. In addition, over 80,000 households are targeted to be accommodated in the private housing market under the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme. This will ensure that those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their housing needs are supported.</p><p>The cost of housing, and its affordability for a particular household, is a key issue and one that has become increasingly significant. There has been a considerable amount of research undertaken in Ireland, the UK and further afield on this topic and, while there is no universally ideal price/rent to income ratio or minimum residual income requirement, there is broad agreement that ideally households should be spending no more than a third of their income on housing costs over the longer term. </p><p>I have initiated a targeted review of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, with an emphasis on strengthening the measures already in place and identifying new initiatives that add value and raise ambition.  As part of this review process, which I intend to conclude by September, I have asked my Department to focus in particular on the broad issue of housing affordability. </p></reply>

All local authorities have been requested to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans by 30 September 2017 for the earliest possible development of their lands.  </p><p>As set out in the <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>, published in December 2016, the commitment to develop an affordable rental model is now being progressed by local authorities in Rent Pressure Zones, through leveraging the value of their land. </p><p>In this regard, Dublin City Council and the Housing Agency, in partnership with D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, have developed detailed proposals for specific sites that they control in Dublin. My Department is currently working through those proposals with the project sponsors. </p><p>The final model for bringing forward public lands for housing, including an affordable rental element where appropriate, will be informed by the work on the initial pathfinder sites in the two local authority areas.

The allocation in 2017 is &euro;14.4m. The 2017 PRTLI allocation is being used to pay off an outstanding bill for PRTLI Cycle 5. As with previous cycles, there is a long lead time before the total spend and the administrative obligations associated with the funded projects are finalised.  There has been a longer repayment period for Cycle 5 than initially expected due to financial constraints during the course of this Cycle.

As part of the planning for a new Cycle of PRTLI, my Department is examining co-funding opportunities including from the private sector and from EU sources.  There will be more clarity on a successor to Cycle 5 when the Mid-term Review of the Capital Plan is concluded, and the funding envelope for this and other projects is finalised.</p></reply>

Determining which particular sites may be attractive to a client depends very much on the particular requirements of the company concerned.

No. 27 of 1995). Gift vouchers that are not financial services products are covered also by the provisions of the European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 484 of 2013). Gift cards that come within the definition of &ldquo;electronic money&rdquo; in the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011 are subject to the provisions of these Regulations unless the card can be used only to acquire goods or services in the premises of the card issuer or within a limited network of service providers or for a limited range of goods and services. The issuer of a gift card which comes within the definition of electronic money must, at the request of the electronic money holder, redeem the monetary value of the electronic money at par value at any time. Redemption may be subject to a fee in specified circumstances and any such fee must be proportionate and commensurate with the costs actually incurred by the issuer of the electronic money. </p>  <p>  My Department published the draft Scheme of a comprehensive Consumer Rights Bill for public consultation on 25 May 2015. In addition to Parts dealing with the consolidation and updating of the law on the supply of goods, digital content and services and on unfair contract terms, the draft Scheme contains a number of provisions for the regulation of gift vouchers, including a proposed ban on expiry dates in contracts for the supply of gift vouchers. The responses to the gift card provisions raised a substantial number of issues, including concerns expressed by businesses about the impact of a complete prohibition on expiry dates and the need for  clarity and certainty in respect of the regulation of gift cards that come within the scope of the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011. While the present proposal is for a ban on expiry dates for gift cards that do not come within the scope of the Electronic Money Regulations, I am willing to listen to other views and possible approaches, such as a requirement that gift cards remain valid for a set period such as five years.  </p>  <p>  While I am anxious to progress the Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill, I have to take account of current European Union legislative proposals for Directives on consumer contracts for the supply of digital content and consumer contracts for the online and other distance sale of goods. These proposals which were announced in May 2015 and published in December 2015 overlap very substantially with two of the main parts of the draft Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill. Discussions on the digital content proposal at working party level have proceeded rapidly with a general approach reached at the Justice and Home Affairs Council in June 2017. The proposal will now be considered in a trilogue with the European Parliament later this year. Discussion at Council level on the second proposal on online sales has only just commenced.</p>  <p>  In this situation, I have to consider the advisability of bringing forward a legislative proposal to the Oireachtas when a directly related and fully harmonised legislative proposal may be at an advanced stage of the European Union legislative process. The wisdom of introducing legislation in the Oireachtas in 2017, if large parts of that legislation would have to be repealed or substantially amended within a relatively short space of time, is obviously open to question. I will continue to review the progress of the two European Union proposals with a view to deciding the best course of action to take with regard to the Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill.  </p>  <p>  On the issue of unfair contract terms, EU legislation already exists in this area. The European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) (Amendment) Regulations 2013, which gave effect to the corresponding European Council Directive on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, applies to any term in a contract concluded between a seller of goods or supplier of services and a consumer which has not been individually negotiated. While these Regulations are enforced by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, ComReg  and the Central Bank, it is ultimately a matter for the Courts to determine whether a specific term of a contract is unfair having regard to the features of the contract and the particular provisions of the Regulations. </p></reply>

The Committee suggests the Law Reform Commission may be an appropriate body to undertake such a review.</p>  <p>  Since August 2012 when the current Director of Corporate Enforcement was appointed, there have been a number of organisational improvements in the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, with a view to streamlining investigations and making them more efficient.  These improvements include reorganising the structures of the Office; recruiting additional expertise, most notably five forensic accountants and a digital forensics specialist; fundamentally amending the investigative procedures used by the Office, with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na now taking the lead on all criminal investigations; and fostering a greater culture of risk management.</p>  <p>  The Companies Act 2014 consolidated, modernised and reformed the company law code. It seeks to ensure a balance between simplifying the day-to-day running of a business; the compliance duties of company officers and auditors aimed at protecting creditors and investors; and the corporate enforcement regime to ensure compliance. </p>  <p>  For the first time, all offences under company law have been streamlined under a new classification procedure which operates on the basis of four categories of offences, with Category 1 being the most serious, and carrying a maximum fine of &euro;500,000 and/or a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years. This brings a structure and consistency to the offence provisions throughout the legislation.</p>  <p>  The Act also introduced, for the first time in codified form, the various common law and statutory duties of directors, thereby making the law in this area more transparent and accessible.  The Act also provides for the Directors&rsquo; Compliance Statement. The relevant provisions apply to all public companies (except investment companies) and large limited companies.  It places an obligation on directors to make an annual statement in their Directors&rsquo; Report, acknowledging that they are responsible for securing the company&rsquo;s compliance with its &ldquo;relevant obligations&rdquo;. Failure to prepare a Directors&rsquo; Compliance Statement is an offence under the Act.</p>  <p>  In October 2013, the Government approved the content of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s Fourth Programme of Law Reform. Among the eleven different projects selected for inclusion in the Programme was the question of reform of corporate offences and regulatory enforcement.</p>  <p>  In January 2016, the Law Reform Commission produced a wide-ranging Issues Papers in which it outlined a range of issues touching on corporate criminality and regulatory enforcement and in respect of which it invited submissions and points of view from interested parties. A large volume of submissions was received from economic regulators, government agencies, law firms, private citizens and other stakeholders which will feed into its ongoing work on this project. </p>  <p>  The Law Reform Commission anticipates completing its examination of corporate offences and regulatory enforcement and publishing its recommendations in the form of a consultation paper prior to the end of 2017.</p>  <p>  As well as the work of the Law Reform Commission, the Company Law Review Group (CLRG), in accordance with its work programme for 2016 to 2018, is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of how company law is enforced in Ireland. Furthermore, it is examining whether there are any new mechanisms by which the existing enforcement regime might be refined and enhanced. I will carefully examine the report on its completion.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Taoiseach has requested my colleagues the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and me to prepare a package of measures in relation to 'white collar crime' to be presented to Cabinet by the end of September.</p></reply>

We are aiming to ensure the unemployment rate is within the 1% of the State average. </p><p>Sectors targeted as part of the plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agri-food, manufacturing/engineering and tourism, including active promotion of the tourism potential of the Lakelands Region, which includes Cavan and Monaghan. </p><p>The Local Authorities, enterprise agencies, and other key public and private sector stakeholders in Cavan and Monaghan have been strongly involved in, and are key drivers of, the NE/NW Action Plan.</p><p>The second progress report on the implementation of the Action Plan, covering the period to end 2016, has just been published and shows that good progress being made. Over 96% of the actions due to be completed or progressed by end-2016 were on track.</p><p>4,700 jobs were created in the Border since the regional Action Plans for Jobs initiative was launched in January 2015.</p><p>The unemployment rate in the region has fallen from 10.2% in Q1 2015 to 7.5% in Q1 2017. </p><p>Live register numbers have fallen in both counties Cavan and Monaghan by over 17% in the past 12 months.</p><p>The Enterprise Agencies are working hard to drive job creation in the region.</p><p>IDA North East Region consists of Counties Louth Cavan and Monaghan where 33 multinational companies operate, employing 4,914 people. In 2016, IDA client companies supported 1,203 jobs in Cavan and 137 jobs in Monaghan.</p><p>In 2016, Enterprise Ireland client companies supported 5,221 jobs in Cavan and 5,168 jobs in Monaghan.</p><p>Cavan LEO supported 208 clients in 2016, employing a total of 1,162 people in the county while Monaghan LEO supported 153 clients with a total of 903 employed.</p><p>I am very conscious of the challenges as a result of Brexit faced by companies operating in close proximity to the Border, many of which trade freely on both sides of the border.</p><p>Since the UK referendum, the State agencies under my remit &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA, LEOs and Inter Trade Ireland &ndash; have been active in supporting companies in assessing and addressing their exposure to Brexit.</p><p>EI&rsquo;s current &ldquo;Prepare for Brexit&rdquo; campaign includes a Brexit Scoreboard available to all companies to self-assess their preparedness for Brexit and generates a report suggesting appropriate responses.</p><p>For exporting companies, new resources were secured, including extra staffing, for EI and the LEOs in Budget 2017 to assist businesses to maintain and grow export markets.</p><p>Based on significant analysis and stakeholder consultation, my Department is currently working on further measures targeted at the needs of companies in the wider economy around working capital and business development.</p><p>To support regional enterprise development, additional funding of up to &euro;60m is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland over the next 4 years to support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.</p></reply>

There are currently 17 Agency clients based in County Wexford itself, employing a total of 2,620 people. Wexford experienced positive IDA-client jobs growth in 2016, with a net increase of 6% over 2015.  Companies currently located there include INDOS, United Chemical Technologies and CRI. The following table sets out further details of IDA client employment in Wexford from 2007 to 2016. </p><p>The IDA is targeting an increase of investment in Wexford and the South East of 30%-40% by 2019. To achieve this the Agency will continue to seek out investment from overseas companies and to draw attention of potential investors to the region's particular strengths. This includes the South East's accessibility, ports and its existing cluster of medical technology firms. The IDA will also continue to work closely with its clients there to help strengthen and potentially grow their respective workforces. </p><p>More broadly, progress is being made to grow employment in the region. Since 2012, the South East has had the fastest rate of jobs growth, in percentage terms, of any region in the country. I recognise, however, that more work remains to be done, particularly in reducing unemployment further. That is why my Department, together with all its Agencies, will continue its efforts to foster and support further enterprise and job creation in the South East and thereby boost its economic performance.</p><p><b>IDA Supported Companies in Wexford 2007 to 2016</b><table><tr><th></th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th></tr><tr><td>No of Companies</td><td>13</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>16</td><td>17</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Total Jobs</td><td>2,214</td><td>2,271</td><td>2,154</td><td>2,385</td><td>2,386</td><td>2,350</td><td>2,413</td><td>2,503</td><td>2,486</td><td>2,630</td></tr><tr><td>Gross Gains</td><td></td><td>126</td><td>10</td><td>285</td><td>111</td><td>100</td><td>149</td><td>196</td><td>101</td><td>171</td></tr><tr><td>Losses</td><td></td><td>-69</td><td>-127</td><td>-54</td><td>-110</td><td>-136</td><td>-86</td><td>-106</td><td>-118</td><td>-27</td></tr><tr><td>Net Change</td><td></td><td>57</td><td>-117</td><td>231</td><td>1</td><td>-36</td><td>63</td><td>90</td><td>-17</td><td>144</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-13a.218.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071300083#WRC05400"><p>My Department is fully aware of the issues that surround the existing Irish furniture fire safety regulations and is also conscious of the need to ensure that if replacement regulations are to be introduced, they must be effective and evidence-based, bearing in mind the tension between short term (in relation to flame retardant chemicals providing time to escape a fire and the impact on fire crews&rsquo; operations) and possible long term health considerations.</p>  <p>  In the area of furniture fire safety, there are no harmonised EU standards. The Irish standards and regulations were introduced to protect consumers by preventing the rapid spread of a fire started on or near furniture. These mirrored regulations and standards  introduced in the UK, which is particularly relevant given the cross-border trade in furniture on the island of Ireland and the presence of furniture manufacturers along the border area. The introduction of these regulations was fully supported by the emergency services.</p>  <p>  The UK has undertaken two consultations (in 2014 and 2016) on the suitability of the UK regulations but has yet to amend its regulations. The inquiry into the recent Grenfell Towers disaster, and the role of flame retardants, may influence the UK approach on this issue. In view of the similarity of the regulations in both jurisdictions, my Department has liaised very closely with the relevant department in the UK and continues to monitor the situation to keep abreast of developments in that jurisdiction. My Department also liaises, both formally and informally, with other stakeholders in Ireland on the issue.</p>  <p>  Having similar regulations in place on both sides of the border gives consumers clarity and certainty that uniform safety standards apply, while manufacturers have certainty that their products can be sold in both jurisdictions without going to the added expense of manufacturing furniture according to different standards and legislation. Any change in existing regulations, or replacement thereof, will have to provide a robust level of safety when it comes to furniture going on fire. Thus, if and when the UK introduces new regulations, it will be determined whether they could influence the revision of the Irish Regulations.</p>  <p>  More generally, in relation to product safety, the obligation to comply with the Regulations and the standard lies with the manufacturer. A furniture manufacturer must only place safe products on the market and compliance with the Irish standard is deemed to comply with that requirement. When it comes to investigating compliance with the Irish furniture fire Regulations, I understand that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) takes a risk-based analysis approach. Section 9 (5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the CCPC is independent in the performance of its functions. I, as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, have no direct function in such matters.</p></reply>

Information on the breakdown of such employment within individual local authorities is not available. In 2015, a total of 76,492 people were employed in Dublin by client companies of the Agency. This figure increased to 82,622 in 2016. Figures for the County for 2017 will be available early next year.</p><p>The following below outlines IDA Ireland supported jobs by county for 2016. These figures are compiled on an annual basis as part as the National Employment Survey which is produced later in the year. Figures for 2017 are not yet available. </p><p>IDA Ireland remains committed to increasing regional development. That is why the Agency has targeted a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each region outside of Dublin by the conclusion of its current strategy in 2019. Progress is being made towards that goal &ndash; in 2016 over half of all IDA Ireland supported jobs created were based outside of Dublin. </p><p>Site visits do represent an important tool in attracting investment and the IDA does its utmost to ensure that investors consider all potential locations. Determining which particular sites may be attractive to a client depends very much on the particular requirements of the company concerned. Factors that are habitually important to overseas investors include the suitability of local infrastructure, the proximity of transport hubs and the availability of skilled talent. It is often the case as well that multinational companies seek to base themselves as close as possible to businesses operating in the same industry. </p><p>The IDA always encourages clients to locate in areas that are most in need of investment. I am determined that this approach will continue so that the benefits of FDI are increasingly felt all across Ireland.

On 17 October 2016, in accordance with a Government Decision, the role of Operator was transferred to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).</p><p>SBCI has advised that, as of 30thJune, 2017, under the Schemes, 471 loans to the value of &euro;74,955,594 had been sanctioned by participating lenders under the scheme. It is estimated that these loans have created or sustained a total of 3,053 jobs in the Irish economy.</p><p>It is important to note that once the benefit of a credit guarantee is sanctioned and offered to a borrower under the Schemes, not all borrowers proceed to actually draw down the finance available.  A significant number of cases are listed as &lsquo;Pending&rsquo; by the participating lenders (the main banks to date), and the SBCI has indicated that it does not hold complete information on all such cases and, as a result, it is not possible to quantify accurately the drawdowns of loans considered under the scheme.</p><p>A breakdown of sanctioned loans over the past two and a half years is provided at A. below, and a breakdown by County is located at B. below. </p><p>Since the inception of Credit Guarantee Schemes in Quarter 4 of 2012, Quarterly Reports providing full details of the latest Scheme performance have always been published on my Department&rsquo;s website. I will shortly be receiving the performance Report for Quarter 2 of 2017 Report from SBCI and it will then be uploaded onto my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The new Credit Guarantee Scheme 2017, launched earlier this year by my colleague, Minister of State, Pat Breen. T.D., will be available shortly to our SMEs, once discussions currently underway between the SBCI and the three main banks have concluded.  It is alsopossible that other financial providers may join the scheme in time. I am confident that we will see a significant uptake in demand, given that the new Scheme will:</p><p>- permit me as Minister to take a higher level of risk on finance provided to SMEs;</p><p>- enable new financial providers to take part, and;</p><p>- allow for the provision of finance to SMEs via products other than bank loans, namely agreements on credit facilities, asset credit facilities and invoice financing facilities.</p><p><b>A.

A key change was the removal of a previous requirement for a micro-enterprise to have been refused a bank loan before recourse to this channel. </p><p>Microfinance Ireland is guided by its new Strategy &lsquo;The Way Forward&rsquo; 2017-2021.  At the centre of the new strategy is the strategic vision which provides for the need for Microfinance Ireland to create a value proposition by being the best in class micro-lender, creating and supporting jobs and fulfilling the borrowing requirements of microenterprises across Ireland.  The strategic vision also aims to exceed the strategic objective of the fund of supporting the creation of 7,700 jobs in Ireland. </p><p>The strategic vision will be delivered through Microfinance Ireland which will be:</p><p>- Strongly branded, recognisable and reputable</p><p>- Growing through a multi-partner/multi-channel relationship model</p><p>- Operationally effective</p><p>- With effective bad debt management for the target market.</p><p>This new strategy is already bearing fruit as Microfinance Ireland was recently awarded a certification of compliance with the European Code of Good Conduct for Microcredit Provision.  This certification confirms Microfinance Ireland&rsquo;s position as a best in class micro credit provider in Europe, being one of the first four institutions in Europe to qualify and the only organisation in Ireland to receive this award.</p><p>The current Board of Microfinance Ireland continues to monitor the risk appetite of the organisation in relation to the level of loan defaults. My Department is represented on that Board and, overall, I am satisfied with the level of engagement and performance of the Fund to date.</p><p>Table 1-Activity Levels of Microfinance Ireland <table><tr><th></th><th>End   March 2017</th><th>Q1   2017</th><th>2016   12 mths</th><th>2015   12 mths</th><th>2014   12 mths</th><th>2013   12 mths</th><th>2012   <br /><br />3   <br /><br />mths</th><th>Fund   to End Dec 2014</th><th>Fund   to End Dec 2015</th><th>Fund to End Dec 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Application   Nos</td><td>2,735</td><td>235</td><td>861</td><td>752</td><td>508</td><td>320</td><td>59</td><td>887</td><td>1,639</td><td>2,500</td></tr><tr><td>Applications   &euro;000</td><td>44,524</td><td>3,450</td><td>13,567</td><td>12,319</td><td>8,449</td><td>5,669</td><td>1,070</td><td>15,188</td><td>27,507</td><td>41,074</td></tr><tr><td>Approvals   Nos</td><td>1,249</td><td>82</td><td>397</td><td>357</td><td>274</td><td>127</td><td>12</td><td>413</td><td>770</td><td>1,167</td></tr><tr><td>Approvals   &euro;000</td><td>18,183</td><td>1,095</td><td>5,392</td><td>5,378</td><td>4,158</td><td>2,000</td><td>160</td><td>6,318</td><td>11,696</td><td>17,088</td></tr><tr><td>Drawdown   Nos</td><td>1,081</td><td>86</td><td>330</td><td>319</td><td>223</td><td>119</td><td>4</td><td>346</td><td>665</td><td>995</td></tr><tr><td>Drawdowns   &euro;000</td><td>15,362</td><td>1,158</td><td>4,284</td><td>4,744</td><td>3,277</td><td>1,847</td><td>52</td><td>5,176</td><td>9,920</td><td>14,204</td></tr><tr><td>Jobs(Nos)   Net</td><td>2,948</td><td>137</td><td>990</td><td>930</td><td>581</td><td>289</td><td>21</td><td>891</td><td>1,821</td><td>2,811</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Following the conclusion of an extensive and in-depth evaluation, the first call for expressions of interest under this Scheme concluded and commitments of &euro;109.5m were made to a number of funds in the technology and life science sectors. The successful funds have closed, completed fundraising and commenced investing in companies. To date five funds have closed, Atlantic Bridge III LP, Fountain Healthcare Partners Fund II, The Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund (ROI) II, ACT V Venture Fund and Seroba Life Sciences Fund III. An allocation has also been made to a new European Angel Fund.</p><p>In June 2015, a second call was announced for expressions of interest focused on early stage with a strategy of investing in Irish start-ups. The specific objective is to ensure there is sufficient seed capital in the Irish market to meet demand and to support company creation and commercialisation of research. The deadline for expressions of interest for this process was July 31<sup>st</sup>2015. Enterprise Ireland evaluated the expressions of interest received against the published criteria and made total commitments of &euro;65m to 7 fund managers. Four new funds have now been established, AIB Startup Accelerator II Fund, Frontline Venture Fund II, the University Bridge Fund and Suir Valley Ventures (est. 2017), all of which are active and currently seeking investment opportunities. All investment activity for 2016 is reported in Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Annual Seed and Venture Capital Report 2016 which is available on the Enterprise Ireland website.</p><p>A third call for expressions of interest was launched in March 2017.

The NPRF has now been reconstituted as the Irish Strategic Investment Fund. The dual mandate of the ISIF &ndash; investment return and Irish economic impact &ndash; represents a new &ldquo;double bottom line&rdquo; approach to investing and will require all transactions to generate both risk adjusted commercial returns and economic impact in Ireland.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland and ISIF have committed up to &euro;125m each to make commitments to international Venture Fund Managers.  These funds commit to establishing a presence in the Irish market and agree to invest, at a minimum, the equivalent of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s contribution, over the lifetime of the fund in Irish companies or companies with significant operations in Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland issued two open competitive calls for proposals. In order to receive an investment through Innovation Fund Ireland, venture capital fund managers must meet, at a minimum, the following criteria to be considered for investment:</p><p>- An established global profile and network with a reputation for market leadership in venture capital investment.</p><p>- A proven track record of raising funds and generating superior returns for investors.</p><p>- A capacity to access high potential international investment opportunities with an investment team capable of attracting world-class entrepreneurs.</p><p>- An intention to establish a new and substantial presence in the venture capital market in Ireland and a willingness to invest a meaningful proportion of their venture capital fund in Irish companies or companies with significant Irish operations. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland, alongside the ISIF/NPRF, have made commitments to four Venture Capital funds including Sofinnova, Highland Venture Capital Europe and Lightstone Ventures. Two of these funds have ceased investing in new opportunities (having met their commitments to invest in Ireland) while the remaining two funds are activity looking for opportunities.</p><p>Separately the NPRF/ISIF made a number of commitments to other funds including Polaris and DFJ Esprit.

NAMA fully expects to redeem all of its remaining &euro;500m senior debt by end-2017. NAMA also expects to redeem its subordinated debt of &euro;1.6 billion in March 2020 and to return a surplus to the State once its work is completed. In this regard, the 2016 Annual Report states that NAMA's continued strong performance since inception means that the NAMA Board expects to return a terminal surplus to the State &ndash; currently estimated at &euro;3 billion - upon completion of its work, subject to favourable market conditions prevailing.  </p><p>Finally, the most recent details on NAMA's remaining portfolio are available in the Agency's 2016 Annual Report and Financial Statements, published on 1 June 2017.  This is available on the NAMA website via: .</p><p>Page 46 of the report provides details on NAMA's outstanding portfolio. NAMA&rsquo;s carrying value of loans at end-2016 was &euro;3.9 billion.  I expect NAMA's Quarterly Report for Q1 2017, which will provide a further update on the portfolio, to be published in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The Fund has also recently announced an investment in Sam McCauley Chemists as its eighth transaction.</p><p>Better Capital Turnaround Fund </p><p>ISIF has advised that it was agreed not to extend the investment period of the Better Capital Turnaround Fund following its expiry in December 2014. In the context of improving market conditions, financial institutions and business owners experienced a much reduced need for restructuring capital investment into distressed businesses as compared with initial expectations. The Fund had been set up with a lifespan of two years, with the intention of investing in distressed firms but positive changes in the economy meant it did not complete any investments.</p><p>In addition to the foregoing, ISIF has committed to a number of initiatives to improve the delivery of funding to the SME sector, details of which are included below:</p><p>(i) BMS Finance Ireland which is a &euro;30 million fund providing debt finance to high-growth Irish SMEs for working capital, contract wins, capital expenditure, acquisitions and management buyouts. BMS Finance Ireland is also backed by other investors. </p><p>(ii) Causeway Capital Partners I LP is a &euro;50 million Dublin based private equity investment fund targeting fast-growing small and medium businesses in Ireland and Britain. ISIF is a cornerstone investor of the fund along with the European Investment Fund (EIF). To date, the company has completed significant investments in BB&rsquo;s Coffee and Muffins, Bizimply and Celtic Linen.</p><p>(iii) Milkflex Fund is a &euro;100 million fund which provides loans between &euro;25,000 to &euro;300,000 to dairy farmers in Ireland, who are suppliers to Glanbia Ingredients Ireland. </p><p>(iv) ISIF invested &euro;30 million in equity in Finance Ireland. Finance Ireland&rsquo;s overall strategic goal is to become Ireland&rsquo;s leading broad based non-bank lender, with a particular focus on the SME sector.  </p><p>(v) ISIF committed &euro;45 million to the Muzinich Pan-European Private Debt Fund in May 2017 which, in turn, is targeting investment of &euro;67.5 million in Irish SMEs.</p><p>Due to commercial sensitivities the ISIF does not report on economic impact at individual transaction level, but instead does so at the aggregate portfolio level. </p><p>The ISIF has published its Economic Impact Report for 2016. Key figures show that as at 31 December 2016: </p><p>- Approximately 22,000 jobs are supported directly and indirectly by ISIF investments </p><p>- 140 Irish companies and projects are benefitting from ISIF investments </p><p>- ISIF had committed &euro;2.6 billion to investments in Ireland.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the earliest date that properties acquired in the relevant period can qualify for the exemption will be 7 December 2018. The relief applies in respect the purchase of land and buildings in the State or in any European Economic Area country. It is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of the quantity of land or buildings that were acquired when the CGT exemption was in place and would now be able to benefit from the exemption.</p>  <p>  Any changes to the holding period would need careful consideration in terms of its potential impact on the property market generally and specifically on the supply of building land. Shortening the holding period could add complexity to the operation of the relief and could also contribute to uncertainty in the property market. It is difficult to estimate the cost of the specific change proposed by the Deputy as it would not be possible to determine in advance the extent to which sites may be disposed of if there was a change in the timing of the CGT exemption. The disposal of or retention of such sites may be driven by factors other than the rate of CGT such as specific business or operational decisions.</p></reply>

The spouse with income chargeable to Irish tax should give Revenue full details of the couple&rsquo;s total incomes (i.e. the income of both spouses including income not chargeable to Irish tax) after the end of the year of assessment. The case will then be reviewed on the basis of aggregation and any excess tax paid as a result of being taxed as a single individual will be repaid. </p>  <p>  Therefore, while the individual is treated as a single individual for tax purposes during the year of assessment, the full benefit of joint assessment is granted on review and no additional tax is suffered by the parties concerned.</p></reply>

Senior Department officials maintain an open dialogue with DG Comp as they progress their work.</p>  <p>  While it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on what is an ongoing DG Comp investigation, I would point out that NAMA lends money to willing NAMA debtors and receivers on commercial arms-length terms only where there is an expectation that such financing will enhance NAMA's recovery of the money owed to NAMA by its debtor.  </p>  <p>  To be clear, NAMA is lending money to existing NAMA debtors to allow the debtor to enhance the value of the collateral securing that debtor's original loan owed to NAMA in order to not only pay back the additional lending with interest but, importantly, to pay back a greater proportion of the total debt owed to NAMA.</p>  <p>  NAMA requires that the projected return resulting from the provision of additional funding must be the value maximising strategy for the asset and this is fully in accordance with Section 10 of the NAMA Act.  This means NAMA will facilitate the funding of development of only those sites that are commercially viable and where site development will deliver a better recovery than the sale of the undeveloped site.  </p>  <p>  In addition, where NAMA provides funding to facilitate development by its debtors or receivers, it is provided at appropriate market rates of interest. The clear intention of NAMA's residential funding initiative is to enhance the returns to NAMA over and above any other viable strategy, provide funding on market terms and ensure there is no impact on competition more generally.</p></reply>

This approach is in line with the normal commercial confidentiality principles applying to all private companies.</p><p>By the end of July 2017, Activate will have made site and working capital facility commitments to customers on 22 residential development sites. The ISIF&rsquo;s share of these commitments is &euro;216 million.</p><p>These 22 sites have an aggregate capacity for 3,661 homes. 13 of the sites are currently under development, with the remainder being progressed through the planning process.</p><p>As part of its commitments in Rebuilding Ireland, the NTMA and NAMA are currently undertaking a number of initiatives in relation to housing and the wider property sector: </p><p>- ISIF has total investment commitments to housing investment vehicles of &euro;404 million of which &euro;325 million in Activate Capital, &euro;25 million in the Ardstone Residential Partnership and &euro;54 million to student accommodation in DCU. </p><p>- In addition ISIF has committed &euro;125 million in total to more general real estate investment vehicles, including &euro;75 million to the Wilbur Ross Cardinal Commercial Real Estate Mezzanine Debt Fund and &euro;50 million to Quadrant Real Estate Advisors, both of which to date have completed some investment in housing. </p><p>- Through these ISIF-supported projects, a total of 8,400 housing units is expected to be delivered in the near term (a small portion of which has already been delivered).</p><p>In addition, ISIF's current near term pipeline of potential housing projects, including in the build-to-rent sector and off-campus student accommodation as well as a smaller project that may have the ability to deliver some affordable housing, indicates potential to deliver a further 8,700 units in total.</p><p>(i) ISIF-supported Fund for Housing</p><p>ISIF and the NTMA have made progress in examining the feasibility of establishing a new funding vehicle capable of delivering mixed-tenure residential developments in a way which is both off-balance sheet and commercially viable. </p><p>(ii) ISIF Enabling Infrastructure Fund</p><p>ISIF will support the delivery of housing-related enabling infrastructure in large scale priority development areas. Initial ISIF engagement with local authorities and private sector developers indicates that infrastructure financing requirements will be in the order of &euro;250 million.</p><p>(iii) NAMA related delivery</p><p>Acting within its commercial mandate NAMA will support the delivery of 20,000 additional residential units before the end of 2020. Some 90% of these residential units will be in the Greater Dublin Area, where the demand for housing is greatest. Approximately 75% of these units will be houses, primarily starter homes. The overall cost of the programme is expected to be &euro;4.5 billion. NAMA will utilise its own cash resources to fund this necessary expenditure. </p><p>(iv) Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF)</p><p>The Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund has been established to provide targeted investment in enabling local public infrastructure to unlock sites for large scale residential development from 2017 to 2019. </p><p>A total of &euro;226 million has been allocated from LIHAF, split on a 75:25 basis between Exchequer (&euro;170 million) and the local authorities (&euro;56 million) funding. Although this represents a slight (13%) overrun on the original &euro;200 million allocation. </p><p>The approved LIHAF projects are expected to deliver 22,830 units by 2021 and potentially deliver housing output of 69,240 in the long run. In Dublin, LIHAF is expected to support the delivery of up to 14,000 additional housing units by 2021 and potentially deliver over 37,000 units in the long run.  </p></reply>

Comprising representatives from the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and ICTR, the Group met throughout 2015 with the objective of providing options for the Minister of Finance&rsquo;s deliberation ahead of Budget 2016.</p>  <p>  The Report of the VAT on Charities Working Group was published in October 2015 as part of the Budget 2016 documentation, and set out the issues faced by Charities with regard to VAT and the options that could be used to address these issues.  The paper presents two possible options to reduce the VAT burden on charities, 1) the introduction of a Limited Sectorial Scheme similar to that in the UK, whereby a series of VAT refund orders are in place for targeted sectors or activities, and 2) a Danish-style Scheme whereby charities can reclaim VAT as a direct proportion to fundraised income up to a capped limit.</p>  <p>  On the basis of the report, the then Minister decided in Budget 2016 not to introduce a VAT refund scheme for charities as the charities sector already benefits from a range of Ministerial Refund Orders and special tax treatment across a number of tax heads. </p>  <p>  However, in the context of Budget 2017 Minister Noonan asked his officials to engage again with the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group with a view to reviewing the options published in the Report of the VAT on Charities Working Group. In this context, Department officials re-engaged with the newly formed Charities Institute Ireland (a merger of the ICTR and Fundraising Ireland) and met throughout 2016 and 2017 to discuss further the possible options of providing VAT relief to charities, with a view to reporting back to the Minister before Budget 2018.</p></reply>

The charitable donations scheme was removed from the scope of the high earners' restriction in recognition of the fact that donors no longer benefit from the tax relief associated with their donations. </p>  <p>  1. An annual donation limit of &euro;1 million per individual, for which a refund of income tax can be claimed by approved bodies, has been applied. </p>  <p>  These changes were made following a process of engagement between officials at the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners with representatives of the charities sector and the completion of a public consultation. The objectives of that process were threefold: (i) to simplify the operation of the existing regime, (ii) to reduce the administrative overheads on charities and on the Revenue Commissioners incurred in the operation of the scheme, and (iii) to ensure that any change would be Revenue neutral from the Exchequer perspective. The proposals for the changes were also recommended in the Report of the Forum on Philanthropy and Fundraising.</p>  <p>  I would not be in favour of the introduction of an additional regime, which would effectively reverse the changes set out above for wealthy donors, such that they could claim the tax relief on any qualifying large donations. In my view, real philanthropy should not be dependant on the receipt, by an individual, of a tax advantage. In fact the existing regime, whereby the approved body receives the benefit of grossed up tax relief, as well as the sum donated, should encourage real philanthropic donations, in recognition of the additional resources that are provided to such bodies.</p>  <p>  As regards the costing of the scheme suggested by the Deputy, for every &euro;1 million donated under such a scheme, the cost would be expected to be in the region of &euro;400,000. However, it is not possible to estimate whether donors would simply transfer donations made under the existing scheme to the one proposed. In addition, it is not possible to estimate the level of additional donations, if any, that might be made under such a scheme. Furthermore, consideration would need to be given as whether such a scheme would be subject to the high earners' restriction.</p></reply>

The Credit Institutions Resolution Fund (CIRF)</p>  <p>  The CIRF was established under Section 10(1) of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 (2011 Act). The Government contributed &euro;250m to the Fund in December 2011 to provide a source of funding for the resolution of financial instability in, or an imminent serious threat to the financial stability of an authorised credit institution, and in particular- </p>  <p>  - To reimburse the Minister for any provision of a financial incentive pursuant to section 46;</p>  <p>  - To provide funds for any payment required pursuant to section 37(1), 42(5), 48 or 98;</p>  <p>  - With written consent of the Minister, to provide capital for a bridge-bank; and</p>  <p>  - To meet the Bank's expenses in discharging its functions under this Act.</p>  <p>  The CIRF Levy commenced in October 2012 and levies collected from credit unions to date amount to &euro;36.8m. Approximately &euro;30m has been provided to support resolution actions in the credit union sector. </p>  <p>  2. The Stabilisation Fund</p>  <p>  In accordance with Part 4 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 credit unions contribute annually to a statutory Stabilisation Fund.  The Stabilisation Fund, contained within the Credit Union Fund, is available to all credit unions with a reserve ratio equal to or greater than 7.5% of the credit union&rsquo;s total assets and less than 10% and where the Central Bank assesses the credit union as viable. Stabilisation support will be provided to address short-term problems at credit unions that are viable but undercapitalised. Payment of an annual Stabilisation Levy commenced in 2015 (for a period commencing on 1 October 2014) and to date levies collected  amount to &euro;9.9m. There have been no drawdowns, to date, from the Stabilisation Fund. A review of the Stabilisation Levy will be carried out in 2017.</p>  <p>  3. The Credit Union Fund</p>  <p>  The Credit Union Fund was established under section 57 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 (2012 Act) for a number of purposes including the provision of stabilisation support, but primarily to provide a source of financial support for the restructuring of credit unions under the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo) and to meet the expenses of ReBo in discharging its functions. The Government provided &euro;250 million? to the Credit Union Fund specifically for restructuring under ReBo. The Restructuring Levy (ReBo Levy) is provided for under section 47 of the 2012 Act and commenced in 2014. To date levies collected amount to approximately &euro;9.4m. The Minister for Finance recently signed ReBo Levy Regulations for 2017 for a levy amount of &euro;1.6m which is due to issue to credit unions shortly. This will bring the total restructuring levy for the sector to &euro;11m, circa 50% of ReBo's total gross expenditure. Approximately &euro;22.6m has been drawn from the Credit Union Fund for restructuring purposes. ReBo concluded its restructuring work on 31 March 2017 and is currently being wound down.</p></reply>

These include loans; savings; account access by phone; account access by internet; third party payments (including EFT); ATM services; bureau de change; certain insurance services on an agency basis; group health insurance; bill payment; money transfers; standing orders; direct debits; financial counselling; PRSAs on an introduction basis and insurance on an introduction basis. </p>  <p>  Where a credit union wishes to provide services to its members, other than those services that are provided for under the 1997 Act, an application may be made to the Central Bank for approval to provide such additional services in accordance with the provisions set out in sections 48-51 of the 1997 Act.</p>  <p>  As set out in communications to the sector the Central Bank is, in principle, supportive of credit unions developing additional services and will consider proposals from credit unions on new additional services they wish to provide to members, where the credit union can demonstrate that:</p>  <p>-  the proposed additional service is supported by a robust business case;</p>  <p>-  the proposed additional service is not contrary to financial services legislation;</p>  <p>-  the board of directors has a sound appreciation of the nature of the additional service proposed and is fully informed of the strategic, governance, risk management, operational, financial and legal implications involved; and </p>  <p>-  systems and controls are in place to ensure any risks involved in the provision of the additional service are managed and mitigated. </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that in the last five years, 11 applications for additional services have been approved and no application has been declined. The majority of these applications have related to the Central Bank approved suite of additional services known as a Member Personal Current Account Service (MPCAS) under the Additional Services Framework set out in sections 48-52 of the Credit Union Act, 1997.  </p>  <p>  This service, provides for credit unions to offer debit cards, overdrafts and a full range of payment services within an appropriate risk framework.  </p>  <p>  Since the Central Bank approved the MPCAS suite of additional services there has been strong interest in this service and the Central Bank is currently processing a significant number of applications, which are at different stages of assessment but the majority are currently at an advanced stage. Details and application forms for the MPCAS service are available on the Central Bank website. </p>  <p>  I have been further informed by the Central Bank that the timescale from preliminary application stage to full approval depends on the quality of information provided. Where the application form has been fully completed and contains or includes all of the information requested, the Central Bank endeavours to turn around the application as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

As professional fees on construction are not included on this list, Member States are precluded from reducing the VAT rate on such services below the standard VAT rate. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that where VAT is chargeable on construction services supplied or on the sale of developed property, including residential property, the supplier can reclaim VAT on any professional fees incurred in respect of those activities so that such VAT would not be a cost to the supplier.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-13a.432.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071300087#WRG05300"><p>The 3% USC surcharge is payable on self-assessed income in excess of &euro;100,000.  When the USC was introduced in 2011 it was accompanied by a series of other reform measures designed to simplify the tax system and widen the tax base in order to raise the revenues required at that time.  </p>  <p>  One of these measures was the removal of the &euro;75,000 income ceiling for employees, above which PRSI was not payable.  This ceiling was removed for all employees in 2011, with the result that employees on incomes in excess of &euro;75,000 became liable to an additional 4% charge on that portion of their income. At the same time the PRSI rate for self-assessed income earners was increased from 3% to 4%.</p>  <p>  The 3% USC surcharge on non-PAYE income in excess of &euro;100,000 was introduced in tandem with the removal of the PRSI ceiling of &euro;75,000 as, in the absence of this measure, self-assessed high income earners would have benefitted when compared to their PAYE counterparts from the tax package introduced in Budget 2011.  On the basis of fairness, this could not have been countenanced at the time.</p>  <p>  With regard to equality of treatment, the Deputy will be aware that, while Employer PRSI contributions of 8.5% and 10.75% are payable in respect of employees, no similar contribution is payable by the self-employed. In addition, the self-employed also continue to benefit from a broader expense deduction regime than that available to employees. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s plans to reduce the income tax burden for all taxpayers, with a particular focus on low to middle income earners, were clearly stated in the Programme for Government published in May 2016.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government recognises that high personal tax rates in Ireland discourage work and jobs and have a negative impact on our international competitiveness. Therefore, it contains a commitment for a medium-term income tax reform plan that keeps the tax base broad, while reducing excessive tax rates for middle income earners, and limiting the benefit for high earners. We must appreciate the value of retaining the incentive to work, to enable those who work hard to provide for their families and generate further economic growth through employment and expenditure in the domestic economy.</p>  <p>  Preparations for Budget 2018 are now under way. As the Deputy will be aware, changes to one particular tax, such as USC, are not considered in isolation. They must be considered as part of the overall Budget process encompassing both revenue and expenditure measures and in the context of available resources. Any announcement in relation to changes to the income tax system, including USC, would normally be made as part of the Budget and I am not inclined to diverge from this practice.</p></reply>

In preparation for this discussion, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland who advised that livestock marts have significant exposure to injuries to employees and members of the public. This has resulted in claims occurring with a level of frequency which has led to a reduction in market capacity due to the hazardous nature of the risk. In response, insurers have developed active risk management programmes in order to try to reduce the level of accidents and injuries. In addition, I understand that insurers have been working with marts with a view to implementing improvements in management practices and facilities to reduce claims as this is the key area to manage claim costs.</p>  <p>  However, Insurance Ireland has advised that they are not aware of any recent major increases in the cost insurance for agricultural mart owners. However, if the Deputy is aware of a specific issue facing an individual mart owner, I recommend that he or the mart owner raise it with Insurance Ireland who I understand are happy to discuss the issue as part of their free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  Insurance Ireland can be contacted at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that in my role as  Minister for Finance I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to review individual cases nor to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in particular cases. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise the market and deal with factors contributing to the availability and cost of insurance.  In terms of measures being taken to tackle the cost of employer and public liability, the Deputy will be aware that this is being examined as part of the second phase of the Cost of Insurance Working Group. The Working Group is building upon the previous work done in the motor phase in order to determine how it can be applied in the employer and public liability insurance claims areas. The Working Group is also considering the impact of the cost of insurance on the competitiveness of particular business sectors, the impact of health and safety issues on the cost of insurance and other market issues. </p>  <p>  The Working Group has held extensive consultations with a range of stakeholders including the Irish Farmers Association, who provided a submission to the Working Group. This issue was not raised in their submission.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the final results of the second phase will take the form of an addendum to the existing Report. As with the first phase, the aim is for all relevant bodies and stakeholders to work together in order to deliver fairer premiums for businesses without unnecessary delay.  As it is likely that employer and public liability risks is a factor in the cost of insurance for marts, any recommendations emerging from this review should be of relevance to the mart sector.</p></reply>

For some transactions, exceptions to the open marketing policy may be required for legal or commercial reasons. In such cases, NAMA&rsquo;s approval is required. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the NAMA Board policy provides for four categories of exceptions to its policy of open marketing. </p>  <p>  One exceptions category relates to cases where specific written advice (either legal or professional) has been obtained by NAMA recommending that open marketing should not be pursued for commercial or legal reasons.  Included in this category are transactions involving defective security and transactions involving the sale of assets where there were legal impediments to open market sales.  These included cases involving existing ownership agreements and third parties with legal entitlements or pre-emption rights relating to the assets.  Assets are offered at the appraised market value confirmed by way of independent valuation report received by NAMA. Over the period 2010-2013, I am advised by NAMA that 27 transactions valued at &euro;74m fell into this category. </p>  <p>  A second exceptions category relates to cases where a government or State entity has approached NAMA to purchase an asset for legitimate reasons in the public interest.  NAMA's Business Plan, which was published in July 2010, stated that NAMA would engage proactively with Government departments, local authorities, State agencies and other appropriate bodies in relation to their possible need for land/properties.  This includes the sale of sites for the provision of primary and secondary schools, properties and sites sold to local authorities and to various Government departments and State agencies and sites identified by IDA Ireland as suitable for Foreign Direct Investment.  Derogations are applied in instances where the purchaser is an existing tenant or where an existing business is looking to expand into an adjoining NAMA-secured property or site.  Such derogations are dependent on achieving the current market value as determined by an independent valuation. Over the period 2010-2013, I am advised by NAMA that 17 transactions valued at &euro;27m fell into this category. </p>  <p>  A third exceptions category arises where NAMA, through NARPS, acquires assets for social housing purposes from NAMA debtors or receivers for onward leasing to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).  NAMA, through its special purpose vehicle NARPS, purchased properties from its debtors and receivers for onward long-term leasing to local authorities or AHBs.  In addition, AHBs directly purchased residential properties for social housing purposes. Such derogations are dependent on achieving the current market value as determined by independent market valuations. Over the period 2010-2013, I am advised by NAMA that 14 transactions valued at &euro;35m fell into this category.  </p>  <p>  A fourth exceptions category relates to cases where the asset is the subject of a compulsory purchase order (CPO) by a State body or local authority. Over the period 2010-2013, I am advised by NAMA that no transactions fell into this category.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, the most recent Central Bank update report on the Examination was published in March 2017 and it indicated that, as at end February 2017, 9,900 impacted customer accounts were identified by lenders.

While Ireland's economy is growing and debt is on a downward trajectory, the debt level is still comparably high and caution must be exercised due to the potential of roll-over risk should interest rates increase.  We are a small and very open economy in a world that has more risks than usual.  Compliance with the fiscal rules underpins the Government&rsquo;s objective of maintaining sound public finances.  Furthermore, any additional expenditure outside of the limits set by the expenditure benchmark could result in a deviation under the fiscal rules which, if the State does not take effective action within a relevant deadline, could result in the European Commission applying an interest bearing deposit.  Additionally, aside from financial penalties there could be a potential for adverse debt market outcomes and reduced confidence in the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  Currently NAMA expects to redeem 100% of its guaranteed senior debt by the end of 2017 and expects to redeem its subordinated debt in March 2020.  NAMA will focus on completing its ongoing deleveraging, its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes in the interim period to 2020.  NAMA's 2016 Annual Report which provides further insight into the Agency's expectations regarding these activities was laid before the Oireachtas on 1 June 2017 and is also available on NAMA's website via: https://www.nama.ie/about-us/publications/annual-reports/.  As the Deputy will be aware, it is through the successful completion of these objectives that NAMA currently projects a surplus in the region of &euro;3 bn to be returned to the State once it completes it work.</p>  <p>  As per section 60(2) of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA may use surplus funds to redeem and cancel its debt.  Surplus funds may only be returned to the Central Fund once NAMA's debt has been redeemed in full.</p>  <p>  As has been discussed with EUROSTAT, from an accounting perspective, once the senior debt, subordinated debt, and private investors have been repaid then NAMA (the Agency), which is in Government, would be the sole shareholder and, as such, NAMA (the SPV) would then become classified into the Government sector.  This is expected to occur in 2020, no later than the time at which the private shareholders have been fully compensated. At this point in time NAMA will have no debt.</p>  <p>  It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the fiscal rules.  It should further be noted that at this point, according to most recent estimates, there will be in the order of &euro;3.4 bn net fiscal space available to the Government. </p>  <p>  It has always been the Government's intention to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our debt and help reduce our debt servicing costs.  Given the uncertainty around the specific timing of or the amount that will be realised, such receipts have not been included our debt forecasts.  Debt reduction underpinned by the Government's lower gross general government debt target of 55 per cent of GDP, will increase the resilience of the public finances to deal with any potential shocks which may emerge.</p></reply>

It is a key Government strategy to support the growth of and investment in this important sector of the economy.  As the Deputy will be aware, there are already significant Government measures to support the financing needs of SMEs; these will be available to assist SMEs deal with the short&ndash;medium term effects of Brexit.  These supports include the SBCI, the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices and the Credit Review Office.  </p>  <p>  Advisory supports in relation to business planning, such as those provided by the Local Enterprise Offices and Enterprise Ireland, will be particularly important in assisting viable but vulnerable SMEs that may be adversely affected because of Brexit.  These supports will help raise awareness of both private market financial supports and existing State supports. </p>  <p>  The provision of State supported hedging products, or similar products aimed at subsidising an exchange rate, is prohibited under EU State Aid rules.  However, there are multiple financial providers active in the Irish market that can provide a comprehensive and competitive range of hedging and foreign exchange products to SMEs who require them. </p>  <p>  Viable Irish SMEs can access sustainable, flexible and appropriately priced finance through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).  The SBCI uses an on-lending model; this means it does not lend directly to SMEs, rather it rather it channels its funds though partner financial institutions, known as on-lenders.  The SBCI currently has eight on-lending partners, three bank and five non-bank.  To the end March 2017, the SBCI has lent &euro;657 million to over 15,000 SMEs supporting in excess of 67,000 jobs.  The majority of SBCI loans are used for investment purposes.  The SMEs who received SBCI finance are from a variety of business and economic sectors and are spread across every region of the country.  The SBCI is currently seeking to broaden its distribution capability and market coverage by adding new on-lenders and working to develop innovative products, thereby serving to meet the needs of Irish SMEs and drive competition in the SME finance market. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are working closely with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Enterprise Ireland to examine Brexit mitigation policy measures to assist SMEs to deal with the effects of Brexit.

They found that no single authority possessed a full 360 degree view of what was happening in the economy at any point in time.  This hindered a timely coordinated response which resulted in the banking crisis quickly escalating into a wider economic and fiscal crisis.</p>  <p>  Since the crisis there have been a significant number of measures taken to address the failures highlighted by the crisis.  These have been at an institutional, national, and EU level.  Both the Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland have undergone significant organisational change in terms of structure, culture and resources.  There has also been a large volume of new legislation introduced at a national and EU level to address the weaknesses highlighted by the crisis.</p>  <p>  The Banking Inquiry Report has twenty nine recommendations in total.  There are twenty four recommendations that fall within the scope of the Progress Report.  It should be noted that recommendations that relate to the Oireachtas are a matter for the Oireachtas and will not be addressed in the Progress Report, although they are listed for the information of Government and the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  This  Progress Report is almost finalised and in general, it acknowledges significant progress in respect of the recommendations.  Upon completion it is the intention to publish the report.  </p></reply>

Any legislative proposals in this regard would have to be careful to achieve an overall reduction in the cost of credit and ensure that it did not have unintended consequences in terms of financial exclusion.  </p><p>Under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, the Central Bank may refuse to grant a moneylenders licence if it is of the opinion that the cost of credit to be charged is excessive.  The rates currently charged by licensed moneylenders have remained largely unchanged since the Central Bank took over the regulation of the sector from the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs in 2003.  Since that time the Central Bank has not permitted any increase to the maximum APR charged within the sector nor has it licensed any moneylender to provide a &lsquo;pay-day loan&rsquo; service such as exist in other jurisdictions.  </p><p>The Central Bank&rsquo;s public register of licensed moneylenders is available on its website at  and lists the maximum permitted APR and associated cost of credit permitted for each licensed moneylender.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the Personal Microcredit Scheme, which is providing simple microloans to credit union members and helping to combat the use of moneylenders. </p><p>I understand that 103 credit unions are now in a position to offer the &lsquo;It Makes Sense Loan&rsquo; as they are fully set up to use the Household Budget Scheme operated by An Post.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that responsibility for addressing these recommendations is spread across the Central Bank and several Government Departments.  Therefore, I will confine my response to the issues that come under my direct responsibility, as Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  There have already been substantive legislative changes that directly address many of the recommendations and a number of them have been addressed through European changes in bank supervision and regulation, particularly through the introduction of Bank Recovery and Resolution powers.</p><p><b>Recommendation 3:</b>The issue of whether the Central Bank should have the power to put financial services firms into administration was subject to extensive consideration as part of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2013.  At that time, the Department had a number of concerns, including around the constitutionality of State interference in property rights, the issue of funding of administrators, and the potential costs to the State of such interventions.  The introduction of recovery and resolution regimes is a better approach to dealing with financial services firms in difficulties as they give a greater level of protection to taxpayers.  </p><p>The 2013 Act also enhanced the Central Bank's regulatory powers, strengthening its ability to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.  The Act provided the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis, and underpins the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice.  The 2013 Act also provided the Central Bank with powers to enable it to apply to the High Court for a restitution order against any person who has been unjustly enriched, or caused another person to suffer loss or detriment, as a result of committing a contravention of financial services legislation. </p><p><b>Recommendation 4:</b>This recommendation was addressed through the Oireachtas Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis. The Report of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is publically available.</p><p><b>Recommendation 5:</b>There have been a number of measures taken to address this recommendation including:</p><p>-  The Central Bank introduced resolution targets for banks for the restructuring of SME loans, which have been worked through and are evident in the significant fall in non-performing loans.</p><p>-  The Programme for Partnership Government places consumers at the centre of the Government&rsquo;s banking sector policies by fostering greater competition in credit provision through supporting non-bank credit providers, such as the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, and also reducing the State's ownership of the banking system.</p><p>-  The recently published Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) review of the residential mortgage market set out a number of short, medium and long term options to allow for greater competition from new entrants in the mortgage market, and could also encourage lenders to compete more vigorously on price, quality and innovation.</p><p>However, it is necessary to exercise caution in relation to the entirety of this recommendation, which proposed that the Central Bank should introduce measures whereby those banks that do not reach stipulated lending targets are subject to an appropriate sanction.  The State has borne, and is still bearing, the cost of excessive credit growth and the introduction of Central Bank sanctions would be inadvisable in terms of the perception that the Central Bank is driving credit growth.</p><p><b>Recommendation 6: </b>A comprehensive framework is in place to address mortgage arrears with the Central Bank reporting quarterly on the numbers of mortgages arrears and restructuring arrangements.  Furthermore, my predecessor wrote last year to the Governor of the Central Bank to request that a further assessment be undertaken of the range of available sustainable restructure solutions offered by banks and non-bank entities.  The subsequent report is published on the Department of Finance website. The assessment found a comprehensive range of available restructuring solutions being offered and noted considerable progress in addressing mortgage arrears since the peak.  The Central Bank noted further that there is strong evidence that both banks and non-banks look to exhaust available restructure options before moving to the legal process.  In addition, the Central Bank considered the range of restructures offered by banks to be broadly appropriate in balancing consumer protection imperatives, and maintaining a mortgage market for all borrowers, and a functioning banking system. </p><p><b>Recommendation 7:</b>As evidenced by recent Central Bank departures, the Bank has ensured appropriate cooling-off periods for staff leaving the bank for other employments. </p><p><b>Recommendation 8: </b>The issue of Oireachtas oversight on the Annual Performance Statement is addressed in Section 32(L)(6) of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended, which requires the Governor of the Central Bank (or a Head of Function/Deputy Governor), if requested by a Committee of the Oireachtas, to attend before the Committee, and provide that Committee with information relating to the Bank's performance statement. </p><p><b>Recommendation 9: </b>The peer reviews of the<b></b>Central Bank are published on completion and as set out above, the Governor of the Central Bank (or a Head of Function/Deputy Governor), may be requested by a Committee of the Oireachtas, to attend before the Committee. </p></reply>

As there is currently no such wealth tax in operation in Ireland, the Department understands that the Revenue Commissioners have no basis or requirement to compile the data needed to produce estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax.  Although an individual's assets and liabilities are declared to the Revenue in a number of specific circumstances (for example, after a death), this information is not a complete measure of assets and liabilities in the State, nor is it recorded in a manner that would allow analysis of the implications of an overarching wealth based tax. </p><p>However, in 2013 the Central Statistics Office conducted the first comprehensive survey of household wealth in Ireland (the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS)).  The survey provides information on the ownership and values of different types of assets and liabilities along with more general information on income, employment and household composition.  During 2016, my Department, jointly with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), conducted a research project into the distribution of wealth in Ireland and the potential implications of a wealth tax using the HFCS.  The research formed part of an on-going joint-research programme with the ESRI on the Macro-Economy and Taxation.  The research paper, available on the ESRI website (), presented results on the composition of wealth across both the wealth and income distributions in Ireland.  A number of wealth tax scenarios were then applied to the Irish data (wealth tax regimes from other jurisdictions and hypothetical scenarios).  In each case, the associated tax bases and revenue yields, the number of liable households across the income distribution, and the characteristics of the households affected are outlined. </p><p>The joint research paper noted that the revenue that could potentially be raised from any net wealth tax would depend crucially on the assets included and excluded from the base (e.g. household main residence, farms, businesses and pensions) and the threshold amount before which liability is incurred and the tax rate.  As such, the 2% and 5% rates cannot simply be multiplied by the net assets held by the categories of household specified by the Deputy.</p><p>The wealth tax scenario in the joint research paper that is closest to the various wealth tax arrangements outlined by the Deputy in her questions is the high threshold-no exemptions scenario as outlined in Table 5 of the Department of Finance/ESRI study.  This scenario has a personal threshold of &euro;1.0 million (doubled if married and a &euro;250,000 increase per child) and applies a 1% tax on net assets.  Given it is not identical to the scenarios outlined in the Deputy's question, care should be taken in interpreting the revenue estimates.  This scenario, given the distribution of household wealth in Ireland in 2013, is estimated to raise &euro;248 million as outlined in Table 8 of the Department of Finance/ESRI study.  The research notes that its tax revenue estimates are static; in other words, no behavioural response to the tax is modelled.  The estimate of &euro;248 million, therefore, is likely to be an upper estimate of the revenue that could be raised.</p><p>In order to estimate the yield from a tax with precise parameters, it would be necessary to seek the agreement of the CSO to revisit its original survey data for this specified purpose.  This would be a significant undertaking that would take considerable time and resources to complete.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the breakdown (being either PAYE income or Schedule D) is classified based on a taxpayer's primary income source.  Schedule D income includes both self-employed income and sources of unearned income including rental income, taxable under Schedule D Case V.  Data are not available to enable a breakdown of USC collected at the level of detail requested by the Deputy beyond that shown in the following table.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>PAYE   &euro;M</th><th>Schedule   D &euro;M</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>2,744</td><td>370</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>3,367</td><td>423</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>3,447</td><td>483</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>3,171</td><td>476</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>3,640</td><td>534</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>3,287</td><td>681</td></tr></table></p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, a significant USC package was introduced in Budget 2017, which will reduce the expected USC receipts in 2017 to approximately &euro;3,725 million. In relation to 2018, an indicative forecast on a no-policy-change basis would imply a projection in the order of &euro;4.0 billion in respect of USC (around &euro;3.5 billion and &euro;0.5 billion for USC PAYE and USC Schedule D respectively).  The &euro;4.0 billion includes the carryover effect from Budget 2017 measures.</p><p>On this basis, the estimated full year cost of abolishing the USC on PAYE income in 2018 is in the order of &euro;3.5 billion</p><p>Following clarification of the Deputy&rsquo;s question with regard to the abolition of the USC on single employee wages under &euro;100,000 in 2017, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated first and full year cost to the Exchequer from abolishing USC on all income under &euro;100,000, with USC at current rates as set out in Budget 2017 to apply on the portion of income above &euro;100,000 where relevant, is in the order of &euro;2,320 million and &euro;2,721 million respectively.  As USC is an individualised tax the total income of a jointly assessed couple is not relevant to the calculation of USC liabilities and therefore a cost for the abolition of USC on income of a couple earning less than &euro;150,000 cannot be provided. </p><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated first and full year cost to the Exchequer from abolishing USC for all incomes under &euro;100,000 and maintaining it as it is for those on over &euro;100,000, is in the order of &euro;1,894 million and &euro;2,199 million respectively.  It should be noted that this would create a significant step effect whereby an additional USC liability of &euro;5,189 would arise where income exceeds &euro;100,000.</p><p>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s request for a cost of abolishing USC in the following manner outlined by the Deputy: for all income under &euro;100,000; the maintenance of it as is for those between &euro;100,000 and &euro;150,000; introducing two new bands of USC of 10% for income between &euro;150,001 and &euro;200,000; and a 12% rate for all income over &euro;200,000, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the first and full year cost to the Exchequer is in the order of &euro;2,145 million and &euro;2,481 million respectively.  This estimate is premised on the retention of the 3% surcharge on self-employed income in excess of &euro;100,000.</p><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated first and full year cost to the Exchequer from abolishing USC for individuals earning under &euro;100,000, maintaining the current USC rates for those earning over &euro;100,000 and simultaneously introducing additional higher marginal rates of income tax for certain taxpayers in the manner outlined by the Deputy, i.e. earnings between &euro;100,000-&euro;140,000 at a 50% marginal rate, earnings between &euro;140,000-&euro;180,000 at a 55% marginal rate, earnings between &euro;180,000-&euro;250,000 at a 60% marginal rate and earnings above &euro;250,000 at 65% is in the order of &euro;695 million and &euro;619 million, respectively. </p><p>Where relevant, the figures provided in response to these questions are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2014, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.  They are estimated by reference to 2017 incomes and are provisional and may be revised.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-13a.566.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071300090#WRK04100"><p>I take it the Deputy is referring to proposals made by the IMF in 2010. </p><p>In its 2010 report to the G-20 the IMF suggested three forms of FAT. The IMF considered that the revenue potential of the various forms of FAT would differ across countries, depending on the relative size, profitability and wage structures of their financial sectors, and would be constrained by the need to apply low rates where the impact on competitiveness or the risk of avoidance were of concern. The IMF report indicated very broad orders of magnitude for the potential tax base of the suggested forms of FAT for the pre-crisis year 2006. </p><p>In respect of Ireland, the broad orders of magnitude estimated for the base were 8.4% of GDP, 5.7% of GDP and 1.8% of GDP respectively for the three different forms of FAT in 2010 but the base is likely to be different now. The potential yield would of course depend on the tax rate applied. In the absence of further detailed work it would not be possible to estimate the amount to be raised by a FAT. I am unaware of any state which has adopted the FAT as proposed by the IMF. </p><p>In Ireland we have a tax on financial transactions in the form of a Stamp Duty on transfers of shares in Irish incorporated companies. This currently stands at 1%. The yield from this charge was &euro;424.13 million in 2015 and &euro;391.94 million in 2016.  </p><p>The Financial Institutions Levy announced as part of Budget 2014 is a revenue raising measure which provides for a contribution from the banking sector to Ireland's economic recovery, with an estimated annual yield of &euro;150 million. </p><p>The entire banking system has been underpinned by the strong Government support provided both here and abroad and it is appropriate therefore that the banking sector should make a contribution to the State's economic recovery. Accordingly, my predecessor announced in Budget 2017 an extension of the levy out to 2021. This will bring in an additional &euro;750 million over the period, which is a very significant additional contribution to the Exchequer. </p><p>The levy was previously calculated on DIRT payments made in 2011. Following a review of the calculation methodology, the levy will now be based on DIRT payments made in a base year which will change every two years.</p><p>* 2015 will be the base year for 2017 and 2018,</p><p>* 2017 will be the base year for 2019 and 2020 </p><p>* 2019 will be the base year for 2021.  </p><p>The introduction of the rolling two-year series of base years has a twofold effect. Firstly, it ensures that financial institutions entering the market over the five further years for which the levy will apply will be subject to the levy and financial institutions exiting the market will cease to be subject to the levy. Secondly, it will help to correct, on an ongoing basis, any anomalies for individual institutions thrown up by prevailing market conditions, such as the interest rate offering, in any one year.</p><p>In order to maintain the annual yield from the levy at &euro;150 million, the rate at which the levy is charged will increase from 35% to 59% for 2017. This is because the assessable amount, DIRT payments in 2015, have reduced significantly since 2011. This new rate, combined with the new 2015 base year, will preserve the existing contribution of &euro;150 million paid annually by the affected financial institutions. That rate will be subject to review to ensure that the yield from the levy is not impacted from changes in interest rates and/or DIRT rates.</p></reply>

It is a non UCITS fund.  These vehicles are targeted at sophisticated private investors and institutional investors.  All investors in a QIAIF must make an initial subscription of &euro;100,000.  QIAIFs are generally used for riskier alternative investment strategies such as hedge funds, real estate funds and venture capital/equity funds.  The normal investment and borrowing restrictions generally imposed by the Central Bank on Irish funds aimed at smaller scale investors are relaxed for QIAIFs, recognising the ability of their investor group to bear a higher level of risk.  </p>  <p>  A REIT is a collective investment vehicle specifically designed to hold property.  It is a quoted company and must be listed on the main stock exchange of an EEA country.  In line with their company status they are subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts.  The requirement that they are listed on the main stock exchange of an EEA country, also means that they are also subject to the rules of the relevant stock exchange.  </p>  <p>  Finance Act 2016 provided for the introduction of a tax regime for Irish Real Estate Funds (&lsquo;IREFs&rsquo;).  The section was introduced to address the use of certain collective investment vehicles to invest in Irish property by non-resident investors.  The IREF regime provides for taxation of investment undertakings, where 25% of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets</p>  <p>As a result of these changes a QIAIF that has more than 25% of its value derived from Irish Real Estate assets will become an Irish Real estate Fund. This legislation is applied to profits from January 1 2017 and applies to all QIAIF&rsquo;s that meet this threshold regardless of their date of origination. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that data regarding the full impact of the Finance Act 2016 amendments will not be available until the first returns for IREFs are examined; these are due by 30 January 2018 for an accounting period ending on or before 30 June 2017 and by 30 June 2018 in connection with an accounting period ending between 1 July and 31 December 2017. </p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p><p>-  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p>-  be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>-  be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>-  be without one or both legs;</p><p>-  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>-  have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p><p>The criteria to qualify for the Scheme are necessarily precise and specific.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p><p>The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the fuel grant provided for members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;65 million in 2016.  This does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme. </p><p>I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities and that the relief has been maintained at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria.  While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

This meets on a quarterly basis.  It includes representatives from the Department of Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland (EI), InterTrade Ireland (ITI), the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), the Irish Business and Employers&rsquo; Confederation (IBEC), the Small Firms Association (SFA), the Construction Industry Federation (CIF), Chambers Ireland and the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association (ISME).  It is chaired at Minister of State level in line with the Programme for Government.  </p><p>The OGP will be considering appropriate refinements to enhance the significant measures already in place to support SME access.  These will take account of the lessons learned to date in the procurement reform programme as well as feedback received through the SME Advisory Group and regional briefings. </p></reply>

It is anticipated that the works will take approximately 52 weeks to complete.  &euro;850,000 has been expended to date on this project which is being carried out by the Office of Public Works (OPW) direct labour force.</p><p>In 2016, the OPW approved funding of &euro;511,200 under its Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection scheme to Meath County Council for projects at Ashbourne (&euro;450,000) and Woodtown, Co Meath.  The works at Ashbourne are progressing and being carried out by the OPW's direct labour force.  An important channel overflow structure has been completed which will have a significant impact on mitigating flooding.  The works at Woodtown are complete and funding for these has been fully drawn down.</p><p><i>Louth</i>: Works commenced in 2017 on the coastal flood relief scheme at Bellurgan and this is progressing well.  The estimated project budget for this work is &euro;0.750m and work is expected to be completed in quarter two 2018.  In addition, the OPW approved funding of &euro;14,400 under its Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection scheme to Louth County Council for a project at Rampark, Lordship, Co. Louth which has been completed with funding fully drawn down.  Also, under the Minor Works scheme, coastal protection works at Baltray have been funded and completed.</p><p>The OPW carries out its own programme of Arterial Drainage Maintenance on a total of 11,500km of river channel and approximately 730km of embankments nationally.  These maintenance works relate to arterial drainage schemes completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945, whose purpose was primarily to improve the drainage of agricultural lands.  The OPW has a statutory duty to maintain the completed schemes in proper repair and in an effective condition.  The annual maintenance programme typically involves some clearance of vegetation and removal of silt build-up on an average five-yearly cycle.  During 2016 maintenance works was carried out on approximately 4km of the Mornington channel and also the Northlands channel.</p><p>The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding, is the OPW's Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  It is the principal vehicle for implementing the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy.  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves, following extensive public consultation, the production of predictive flood mapping for 300 areas of significant flood risk nationally, the development and assessment of flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans which will include both structural and non-structural measures to address flood risk in those areas.  The assessments of flood risk in counties Louth and Meath are included in the East CFRAM study.</p><p>The draft plans are expected to be completed and submitted for approval by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the Autumn.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-13a.642.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1363" speakername="Kevin  Moran" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071300092#WRM01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 250 to 256, inclusive, and 258 together.</p><p><b>Home and Farm</b></p><p>On April 11 2017, the Government agreed the administrative arrangements for a Homeowners Voluntary Relocation Scheme for those primary residential properties that flooded during December 4 2015 to January 13 2016.  This is a national scheme of humanitarian assistance, targeting aid at those worst affected properties, for which there are no alternative feasible measures. </p><p>The first stage of the process has commenced with the OPW working with each of the Local Authorities, using their extensive and detailed local knowledge, to identify the homes that flooded during the event, those that may not benefit from a known or possible engineering solution.  These homeowners will be invited to meet with the OPW and others to discuss the details of the scheme that involves a survey of each property during the Second Stage.</p><p>In addition to the identification process underway with the Local Authorities, homeowners may also express an interest directly with the OPW, before July 28 2017, to be considered under the Scheme.  To date 36 expressions of interest have been received from homeowners in 13 different Local Authority areas.</p><p>Full details of the Homeowners Voluntary Relocation Scheme, including the eligibility criteria and how a homeowner may express an interest to be considered under the scheme, are available on the OPW website.</p><p>Initial funding of &euro;2m has been allocated this year and funding for future years will form part of the normal budgetary process.  Once the initial identifications of homes across all the Local Authority areas has been completed, the OPW will have a clearer indication of the number of homes covered by the scheme at Stage 1, above, and the indicative associated costs and timescale.</p><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has indicated that the administrative arrangements for the Voluntary Homeowners Relocation Scheme will help it, along with its own records of aid provided to farmers in response to these floods, identify those farmyard buildings worst affected by the flooding during Winter 2015/2016.  That department will contact and work with these individual farms to determine if there are any alternative remedial works to protect those farmyard buildings at risk.  This approach will inform the feasibility of any future once-off targeted scheme for Voluntary Farm Building Relocation.</p><p><b>Lake Levels and Shannon Group</b></p><p>The Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group met on six occasions in 2016 and on one occasion to date in 2017.  Information about the Group is available on the OPW website, www.opw.ie. </p><p>The Group took a decision in October 2016 to trial the lowering of the lake levels on Lough Allen, within the existing statutory framework, during the Winter 2016/2017 to help mitigate potential flood risk.  A protocol was finalised between ESB, Waterways Ireland and the OPW to lower the late Autumn and Winter minimum lake levels in Lough Allen by approximately 0.7 metres with the first reduction implemented in October 2016.  The Group has agreed that the trial will be repeated later this year, commencing in late Autumn.</p><p>The Group has published its Work Programme for 2017 and is available on the OPW website, www.opw.ie.  It is also developing a plan for strategic maintenance, to help reduce further deterioration of the River Shannon, and is considering the development of viable flood risk reduction measures in the Shannon Callows, as a further commitment to enhance co-ordinated activities by the relevant State Agencies.  These plans are taking into account the environmental, legal and resource implications involved.</p><p><b>Interdepartmental</b></p><p>The Interdepartmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group that I chair met four times in 2016.  Last November the Group presented for consideration and agreement by Government an interim report setting out progress on its work and making appropriate recommendations for consideration by Government at this time.  The report is available on the OPW website, www.opw.ie.  Progress continues to be made by sector leads on recommendations within the interim report and those policy areas identified that require further action.  The OPW remains in contact with sectoral representatives, who are members of the Group and I expect to convene a meeting of the Group in the near future, so that the Group&rsquo;s work is aligned with the outputs of the on the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme. </p><p><b>Flood Forecasting</b></p><p>A Steering Group to establish a National Flood Forecasting Service has met on eleven occasions to date, agreed a Terms of Reference and prepared and agreed an implementation plan comprising a number of phases, including an initial set-up phase and a development and trial phase.  Given the complexities involved in establishing, designing, developing and testing this new service, it is anticipated that it will take at least 5 years before it is fully operational and it is estimated it will require a staffing complement of 15 full-time posts. Met &Eacute;ireann has appointed one new staff member to date to lead the project.  Arrangements for further recruitment of additional specialist staff are well advanced.</p><p><b>IPP pilot</b></p><p>The Interdepartmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group is considering the potential costs and benefits associated with the introduction of an individual property protection scheme. </p><p>The Group is being informed by two different pilot projects, in Thomastown and Graiguenamanagh in County Kilkenny and Crossmolina in County Mayo.  The Co-ordination Group&rsquo;s work, when completed, will be submitted to Government for consideration in the context of the merits of the introduction by Government of any scheme to support individual property protection measures. </p><p>Both pilots are being funded through the OPW&rsquo;s Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  In respect of the Kilkenny pilot, the OPW is funding the costs of a research and feasibility study into the potential provision of individual property protection.  Kilkenny County Council is considering the consulting engineers&rsquo; preliminary report to help inform recommendations to the OPW on the next stages of the pilot. To date the council have drawn down some &euro;30,000 towards the cost of the study.  </p><p>In Crossmolina, consultants have undertaken surveys of individual properties to assess their suitability for floodgates and Mayo County Council has procured a contractor who is currently installing the defences at the relevant properties.  The OPW has provided &euro;109,000 in funding to date. </p><p><b>Riparian Guide</b></p><p>Work to develop guidance to clarify the rights and responsibilities of landowners in relation to the maintenance of any watercourse on or near their lands is at an advanced stage. It is expected that legal advice to help finalise the guide will be sought in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

This change was necessary to bring the method of remunerating such teachers into line with the European Union Working Time Directive, following a decision of the European Commission.  It is important to note that the overall remuneration of such teachers was not changed as a result of the Circular.</p></reply>

In restoring capitation payments, where schools have introduced these cost effective principles, they will receive a premium capitation payment. </p><p>I believe that full transparency in relation to the use of any voluntary contributions is important information for parents to have.  The Parent and Student Charter will require every school to set out a financial statement, which will include information on how any voluntary contributions are used.</p><p>This is part of a suite of measures I am introducing, including the School Admissions Bill which will reform information and procedures around the process of school enrolment, and the commencement of Fitness to Teach, which allow a complaint to be made about a registered teacher to the Teaching to Council for the first time.</p><p>Circular letter 32/2017 &lsquo;Measures to be adopted by schools to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs&rsquo; was published at the end of April and is available on my Departments website.</p><p>Following the implementation of the circular, school authorities will be required to adopt the following principles of cost-effective practice which will put a greater emphasis on reducing the cost of school uniforms and other costs:</p><p>-  All elements of a school uniform should be purchasable from various stores;</p><p>-  Only iron on or sew on crests should be used;</p><p>-  Wherever possible, generic rather than branded items should be specified (e.g. uniform, clothing, IT tablets, sports equipment etc.);</p><p>-  Provide parents with a list of all required items and indicate the likely costs of these required items at best value stores;</p><p>-  Provide a book rental scheme;</p><p>-  Phase out, between now and September 2018, the use of workbooks which cannot be reused;</p><p>-  Where an exclusive supply arrangement applies, it should be tendered for regularly and</p><p>-  The Board of Management in each school will have to review the cost of items which they require parents to purchase and to make this information available to the school community.</p><p>Schools will consult with parents on their views and ask for suggestions on cost reduction initiatives. Parents will be asked for their views about school uniform costs, and other costs, through a questionnaire.</p><p>As resources permit, it is my intention to reward schools that can provide evidence of having adopted the principles of cost-effective practice. It is intended that this could be done through some premium in capitation grants for schools.</p><p>The Action Plan for Education 2016-2019 outlines hundreds of actions to be implemented over the 3 year period 2016 to 2019. One of these actions aim to restore capitation funding over a three-year period as resources permit. It was not possible to provide additional funding in Budget 2017 in relation to capitation funding due to the many competing demands for the available funding. However, this commitment remains a priority for me to address as soon as possible during the lifetime of the Action Plan.</p><p>Circular 32/2017 recognises that schools may already have arrangements made for school uniforms and other school costs for September 2017. Therefore it is envisaged that it will be the school year 2018/2019 school year before schools can provide evidence of having adopted the principles of cost-effective practice. </p><p>When budgetary resources are available to provide an increase in capitation for schools, my Department will then consider the most appropriate mechanism to gather evidence on whether or not schools have adopted the principles of cost-effective practice.</p></reply>

An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided for this purpose.</p><p>The development of a new Regional Support Service within the NCSE, established in March 2017, will mean that schools will receive better and more integrated support in the future.  It will build on the existing good work and supports which the National Behaviour Support Service, the Special Education Support Service and Visiting Teacher Service currently provide to children and their families as well as to teachers and schools.</p><p>In addition, over 150 new Special Classes were sanctioned by the NCSE for the 2016/17 school year, while a further 160 special classes have now been approved for the coming school year, 2017/18, giving a total of 1,292 special classes, which is in comparison to 548 special classes in 2011.  125 special schools with over 1,400 teachers also provide specialist education for those pupils who need it.</p><p>In recent years, the NCSE has provided my Department with a number of policy advice papers on the provision of supports for children with special needs, all of which are available on the NCSE&rsquo;s website.  It is intended to bring into effect many improvements to the provision of special educational needs support, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.</p><p>As committed to in the Programme for a Partnership Government, the adequacy of the present policies and provision and their scope for improvement is being examined.</p><p>In response to a progress report from the NCSE on the comprehensive assessment it is undertaking of the SNA Scheme, I have requested the NCSE to establish a working group, comprising relevant stakeholders, to assist in proposing a better model for providing care supports so as to provide better outcomes for students with special educational needs who have additional care needs. </p><p>This Working Group will commence its work upon its appointment and the work will run in tandem with the completion of the Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme. It is intended that the reports of the Working group and of the Review will be completed in Spring 2018. </p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government also states that a new model of In-School Speech and Language Therapy will be established.  As Speech and Language Therapists are currently employed by the Health Service Executive (HSE), officials at my Department are engaging with colleagues in the Department of Health and the HSE to review the existing level of Speech and language therapy provision and to conduct an audit of services nationally.</p><p>The HSE has reviewed the provision of Speech and Language Therapy services and the report is currently being considered by the National Directors for Primary Care and for Social Care.  The review of existing services will guide the implementation of the Programme for Government commitment.</p><p>My Department has convened an Implementation Group, following the launch of the NCSE's Policy Advice on Autism in 2016, with representatives of the NCSE, NEPS, the Inspectorate and external representatives to ensure that the Report&rsquo;s recommendations are fully and appropriately considered and that a timetable for implementation is prepared.  </p><p>I can confirm that this Government will continue to ensure that the supports required, to ensure that all children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education, will be provided.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-13a.739.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071300094#WRO00400"><p>I can inform the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides educational psychology service to all primary and post primary schools through an assigned NEPS psychologist and in some cases through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are on the Department's website.  Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. </p>  <p>  NEPS service to school is focussed on early intervention and in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p>  <p>  In regard staffing levels within the NEPS service my Department has worked in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service during this academic year to replenish regional recruitment panels to allow the filling of some 11 vacancies within its staffing complement.  Additionally I was pleased to approve the expansion of those NEPS psychologist staffing number by a further 10 posts as part of this Government&rsquo;s commitments to the service under the Programme for Government.  Recruitment in this regard is proceeding apace and it is envisaged that the majority of these staff will be in place by the commencement of the coming academic year or shortly thereafter.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that I announced earlier this year that a new model for allocating Special Education Teaching Resources to mainstream primary and post primary schools will be introduced from September 2017. </p>  <p>  The revised allocation process replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.</p>  <p>  The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p>  <p>  The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. </p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support. </p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model, schools will be provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school&rsquo;s profile. </p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school. </p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.   </p>  <p>  Parents will no longer have to source or pay for assessments in order for their child to receive extra teaching support in school.  Schools will no longer have to wait for these assessments to give children the extra teaching support they need in schools.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the model means professionals can spend more time intervening and helping schools and children, as opposed to conducting assessments for resource teaching allocation purposes.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The policy of my Department is to ensure, as far as possible, that the Managerial Authorities of Primary and Post Primary schools give priority to unemployed registered teachers who are fully qualified when filling vacant teaching posts.  My Department has issued a number of Circulars addressing this issue in recent years.  Circular 31/2011 details a cascade of measures for the recruitment of teachers, prioritising registered teachers over retired registered teachers and unregistered people.  It states that each employer shall ensure that each person proposed for appointment to a teaching post for which salary grant is being sought must be registered with the Teaching Council and have qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the post for which he/she is to be employed.</p>  <p>  There is a requirement in the post primary redeployment schemes that all vacancies be notified to the Department for filling by redeployment in accordance with agreed arrangements.  The procedures and sequence for filling available teacher posts are outlined in Circulars 0059/2016 and 0049/2017.</p></reply>

The results of the 2015 Lifeskills Survey will be available shortly. </p>  <p>  My Department is active in the area of promotion of health and wellbeing in schools.  The issue of promoting healthy eating is addressed in schools through subjects such as Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), and Home Economics as well as in Physical Education.  The aim is to equip students with such skills and knowledge to enable them to make appropriate choices for healthy lifestyles.  </p>  <p>  Schools are strongly encouraged to have a formal healthy eating policy that has been developed in consultation with students and parents. </p>  <p>  Guidelines for developing a healthy eating policy are available for Primary and Post-Primary Schools, which have been developed by the Department of Health and HSE.  These are being revised and updated in light of the new Food Pyramid and National Healthy Eating Guidelines.</p>  <p>  My Department issued a circular to all post primary schools in September 2015 on the Promotion of Healthy Lifestyles in Post Primary Schools (Circular number 0051/2015) and to all primary schools in February 2016 on the Promotion of Healthy Lifestyles in Primary Schools (Circular number 0013/2016).  These circulars aim to support and strengthen schools&rsquo; efforts in developing in young people the skills and attitudes needed to make informed decisions about their health.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Education and Skills I do not have the authority to dictate to schools in this manner.  Schools are generally privately managed institutions which, although largely funded by the State, are relatively autonomous.</p>  <p>  Many post-primary schools have a number of food outlets, including school shops and vending machines.  My Department acknowledges that the sale of food and beverage products often represents a revenue stream for schools and it is not the intention to end this practice.  Rather the intention is to ensure that there is a greater proportion of healthier alternatives to some of the less healthy products that are currently on offer for sale in schools.  Boards of Management and Principals are encouraged to provide as far as possible that only healthy products are available for purchase on school premises. </p>  <p>  All of the proactive work done in schools complements the Government's Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013 - 2025 - Healthy Ireland. Schools can do so much but it is through working together, across Government departments, through families and communities that we can create an environment in which our young people have the knowledge, skills and resilience to choose to lead a healthy life.</p></reply>

My Department is not aware of any school where this is not the case.  Health and Safety issues such as the provision of drinking water are a matter for school authorities in the first instance, if a school authority has concerns about the quality of the drinking water on its premises, it should consult with its local authority and/or Irish Water for advice.  The school may also arrange for the water to be tested.  If any problems are identified through testing, or indeed, if there is a drinking water supply issue in a school, the school authority can let my Department know by submitting an Emergency Works Scheme application for funding to address the problems. </p></reply>

It is about enhancing the physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing of students.  Therefore, the area of learning will include Physical Education (PE), Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) and Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE).  Schools can include other areas in their provision for wellbeing, such as guidance. </p>  <p>  Guidelines on Wellbeing in Junior Cycle have been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and are available at www.juniorcycle.ie. Schools will use the guidelines in formulating their individual Wellbeing programmes from September.  Up to 400 hours will be available for learning in the area of Wellbeing over the Junior Cycle period, beginning with a minimum of 300 hours of timetabled engagement in 2017/18 and moving to the full complement of time as the new Junior Cycle is fully implemented in schools.</p>  <p>  A National Taskforce on Youth Mental Health has also been established, which will provide national leadership around youth mental health and wellbeing issues. </p>  <p>  Other supports available to schools in the area of student wellbeing are the 'Wellbeing in Post-primary Schools - Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention' (2013) and 'Wellbeing in Primary Schools - Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion' (2015).  They provide a Framework for schools to present, in an integrated way, the existing elements of good practice to promote positive mental health and direct them to new practices as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The curriculum at primary and senior cycle level also includes topics relating to student wellbeing.  The Social, Personal and Health Education curriculum provides particular opportunities to foster the personal development, health and wellbeing of the individual child.</p></reply>

It also involves accessing other supports such as educational psychology services.  Additionally, schools engage in a wide range of sport and cultural activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth.  The whole staff shares responsibility for general student wellbeing.  The Well-being in Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion (2015) provide a Framework for schools to present in an integrated way the existing elements of good practice to promote social and emotional learning, and mental health and direct then to new practices as appropriate.  They provide clear information for schools and for agencies supporting schools on how to address issues of social emotional learning.  The European wide HSE supported, Health Promoting School Process (HSP) is also outlined, and the Well-being Guidelines show how the HSP can be introduced to schools to complement existing good practice.  The Guidelines outline how schools support young people through early intervention and prevention, modelled on the NEPS Continuum of Support tiered approach.  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the systematic implementation of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines highlight the vital role schools play in providing a protective environment for young people which can counter risk factors.  Additionally having a whole school approach which fosters important links with the wider school community, and agencies which support schools, is key to successful implementation of the Guidelines.</p>  <p>  They provide information for schools on the supports services that are currently available.  Schools are advised to seek this support when developing the whole school approach.  It is important that this support is well coordinated and that schools are clear about the responsibilities of the support agencies.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines advise that in the event of pupils presenting with mental health difficulties which are above and beyond the school's capacity and ability to support, school authorities should identify and access the referral pathways for the various primary and secondary healthcare services in their particular area.  My Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is available to advise schools on the matter.  Referrals should, of course, be undertaken with Parental or Guardian consent and collaboration, except in an exceptional situation where there may be child protection issues.  In normal circumstances referral to Clinical Psychology Services and to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) is made through the student's G.P.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Action Plan for Education 2017 promotes wellbeing as one of its key goals.  The actions relating to wellbeing and mental health in the primary school sector include:</p>  <p>  - Delivery of a national programme to support all schools to implement the national Wellbeing in Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion (2015).</p>  <p>  - Increasing the capacity of NEPS: an enhanced educational psychological service to schools, through the appointment of an additional 10 educational psychologists.</p>  <p>  The focus of this additional support will be on extending the delivery of training to teachers in two specific evidence-informed programmes &ndash; the Incredible Years Teacher Programme and the Friends programme &ndash; the Friends programme, when delivered by trained teachers, reduces anxiety and promotes coping, resilience and school-connectedness in children and young people while the Incredible Years Teacher programme strengthens the social and emotional competence of primary school children whose teacher has completed the programme.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Data provided by the institutions to the HEA shows that Institute of Technology Carlow currently has 6,820 full and part time students and Waterford Institute of Technology has 7,792.  Information provided by the HEA from their student record system indicates that 43.2% of IT Carlow enrolments and 72.3% of Waterford IT enrolments are students from the South-East region.</p><p>The Technological University for the South East is an important project for the region and the Kelly report published in 2015 presents a compelling rationale for a new type of higher education institution to support a &ldquo;step-change&rdquo; in the economic and social development of the entire South-East region.  Funding is being provided through the Higher Education Authority to support the development of this project.</p><p>In terms of capital investment, I recently announced the provision of &euro;960k of capital investment for apprenticeships in the South East.  Additionally, the Department has committed to funding the purchase of a strategic site acquisition by Carlow IoT in Wexford.  Capital project proposals received from Higher Education Institutions in the South East are currently being assessed in light of competing demands and the limited capital budget for higher education.</p><p>The report also notes the role of Springboard+ and it is open to the institutions to submit proposals for consideration.  However, this is a competitive process and institutions are assessed on a range of issues.  I would also point out that online only courses have increased from 10% of places in 2011 to 15% in 2016 &ndash; giving access to courses from anywhere in the country.</p><p>While not referenced by the WIT academics in their report, the Education and Training Board sector is also providing significant opportunities for learners in the South-East.  Across full time, part-time and community education, within the FET sector this year, the following will be provided:-</p><p>Waterford Wexford &ndash; investment of &euro;46.4m &ndash; 19,206 planned beneficiaries</p><p>Carlow Kilkenny ETB &ndash; investment of &euro;17.3m &ndash; 9,225 planned beneficiaries</p><p>Tipperary &ndash; investment of &euro;16.9m &ndash; 10,739 beneficiaries</p><p>Information on FET programmes can now be accessed via the recently launched fetchcourses.ie website.</p><p>In addition, the report does not make any reference to the important work being undertaken by the Regional Skills Forum for the South East which involves IT Carlow, Waterford IT, LIT Tipperary, Tipperary ETB, Waterford/Wexford ETB, Kilkenny/Carlow ETB, Skillnets, IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Chambers of Commerce, Local Enterprise Offices, IBEC, Construction Industry Federation and Industry representatives including Unum Ireland.</p><p>Further information on upcoming events is available on .</p><p>For the first time in nine years, I have secured additional funding for the Higher Education sector.  This year an additional &euro;36.5 million will be made available to the sector with &euro;160 million additional over the next three years.  In addition, in Budget 2017, the Minister for Public Expenditure and I announced a policy review with the aim of designing and implementing a sustainable and predictable multi-annual funding model for higher and further education and training involving increased Employer and Exchequer contributions from 2018.  Work is ongoing by the Oireachtas Committee in relation to the Cassells report.  A review of the funding model for higher education (RGAM) is also being carried out and the new model is due to be in place for the 2018 budget allocation.  Completion of the review will underpin delivery across the sector and all regions and will enhance progression on the goals set out in the Action Plan for Education.</p></reply>

Provision is also made for early intervention for children with autism.</p><p>My Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting the work of schools in promoting positive mental health and wellbeing.  The process spans the curriculum in schools, whole school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional support for teachers.  It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally.</p><p>Professional development services are provided by my Department to support teachers in addressing and dealing with mental health issues.  These services provide support across a continuum: from whole-school and classroom level, to support for some children and support for a few children.  Continuing professional development is provided through:</p><p>- The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) which provides guidance for schools in managing and responding to critical incidents; and training in the delivery by teachers of programmes, including the Incredible Years programme, which aims to prevent and treat young children's behaviour problems and promote their social, emotional, and academic competence</p><p>- The Professional Development Service for Teachers provides professional development support to teachers and schools to develop and promote student health and wellbeing, including mental health, in the context of a positive health promoting school environment.  In 2016, there were 8,535 CPD engagements with teachers in this area through seminars, workshops and in school support.</p><p>- The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Regional Support Service will provide advice and support to schools on the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, providing in-school support for support teachers and continuing professional development for teachers.  It will also enhance the multi-disciplinary capacity of the education system through providing access to expert knowledge in areas such as autism, speech and language and challenging behavior.</p><p>Supports are also provided through the Association of Teachers&rsquo; Education Centres in Ireland (ATECI) summer courses, the Irish Primary Principals Network (IPPN), the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals (NAPD) and the Centre for School Leadership.</p><p>A key theme of my Department&rsquo;s 2017 Action Plan for Education is the support of wellbeing initiatives to ensure that mental resilience and personal wellbeing are integral parts of the education and training system.  Specifically, the Plan commits to the commencement of the roll-out of the Friends for Life programme and the Incredible Years Classroom Management programme to teachers in all DEIS schools.  NEPS will deliver both programmes commencing in the autumn.</p><p>It is planned that during the coming academic year, some 40 Friends programmes will be organised involving some 1,000 primary and post-primary teachers and 50 Incredible Years programmes will be offered to some 1,000 primary school teachers at the commencement of a three year roll-out of the training.</p></reply>

This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p><p>Enrolment in an ASD special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports.</p><p>Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that:</p><p>- S/he has ASD, and that</p><p>- S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>Special classes for students with ASD are staffed with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1 at primary level and 6:1.5 at post primary level.  Special Classes or students with Autism also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 SNAs for a class of 6 children.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes.</p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned.  The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.</p><p>Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of special classes by over 100% from 548 in 2011 to 1,152 across the country now, of which 887 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes.</p><p>The NCSE will establish an additional 145 ASD Special Classes for the 2017/18 school year increasing the number of ASD Special Classes to 1,032.</p><p>While it is not always possible to ensure that a special class placement will be available in the child&rsquo;s local school, the NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand.</p><p>With regard to Co. Wexford, the NCSE will establish 1 new ASD Early Intervention class, 3 new primary ASD classes and 2 new post-primary ASD classes for the 2017/18 school year bringing the number of ASD Special Classes available in Co. Wexford to 6 ASD Early Intervention, 23 ASD primary and 13 ASD post-primary for the 2017/18 school year.</p><p>My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.</p><p>During the passage of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill in the Select Committee last week I indicated that I intend, at Report Stage, to include in this Bill a provision that will provide, based on reports and advice from the NCSE, the Minister will have the power to require a school to open a special class or increase the number of special classes in schools identified by the NCSE.  Because this power will require a school to provide land or alter existing property I am of the view that the power should be with the Minister who can engage the patron or trustees and that there should be adequate safeguards to ensure people&rsquo;s rights are protected.</p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on www.ncse.ie in county order.</p></reply>

This figure takes into account the resulting reduction to my Department's Student Grant Scheme budget.</p>  <p>  With regard to funding towards tuition fees at undergraduate level, my Department provided funding of &euro;280m in the academic year 2015/16 under the free fees schemes.</p>  <p>  The cost to the State associated with the abolition of postgraduate fees is dependent on varying factors associated with type of study i.e. full-time or part-time, varying fees associated with different course types and higher fees for international students.</p>  <p>  However, based on the fact that in the academic year 2015/16, there were 11,975 EU students registered on postgraduate courses, and using the average cost of an EU postgraduate course, the estimated cost to the State of abolishing fees for EU postgraduate students would be &euro;83m.  It should also be noted that under my Department's Student Grant Scheme, funding of &euro;12m was provided for postgraduate tuition fees in 2015/16; taking this into account, the net additional cost to my Department would therefore be in the region of &euro;71m.</p></reply>

My officials, advisors and I have had regular engagement with all groups with an involvement in the issue of patronage, including the Catholic Church and other patron bodies, since I took up office. This includes interaction in relation to the plans to change the patronage of schools in line with the programme for government commitments as well as the previous patronage divesting process.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, following discussions on patronage divesting with education stakeholders and patron bodies in 2016, on the 30th January, 2017, I announced new plans aimed at providing more multi-denominational and non-denominational schools across the country, in line with the choices of parents, families and school communities and the Programme for Government commitment in this area. While these new structures are being introduced, my Department will continue to work with the main stakeholders to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified, in 2017 and beyond. </p>  <p>  In relation to school admissions, as the Deputy is aware I carried out a consultation process in relation to the role of denominational religion in the school admission process. The first step in this consultation process invited written submissions from the public, schools and interest groups between 24th January and 20th March 2017. The written consultation process attracted almost 1,000 responses from a combination of individuals, schools and stakeholder organisations, including those representing the Catholic Church.  Following the conclusion of the written consultation period, I held a public Forum on 29th May 2017 on the role of religion in primary school admissions, which was attended by over 120 individuals. </p>  <p>  This is a highly complex and difficult issue. There are no easy solutions to this problem, with difficulties in areas including constitutional law, administration of the schools system and protection of minority religious groups. </p>  <p>  I have and will continue to consult with people and groups, including the Catholic Church, who stand to be affected by any changes in this area. </p></reply>

Therefore, there will be a very substantial level of consultation of local communities in the process, both with the Education and Training Boards in the initial phase to establish evidence of demand by consulting pre-school parents and subsequently through the requirement for the existing patron to consult with local community and school interests in proposing to transfer patronage of an existing school to an alternative patron body.  </p>  <p>  In that process, the existing patron will also take into account proposals from all prospective multi-denominational patrons that wish to be considered. In the final instance, an application for a formal transfer of patronage will have to be made by the existing patron under the Education Act 1998, which will require my approval.   </p>  <p>  The process also allows for potential &ldquo;early movers&rdquo; &ndash; schools in respect of which a desire for patronage reassignment has been expressed in advance of the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process commencing. In cases such as the school referred to by the Deputy, individual &ldquo;early movers&rdquo; are being facilitated with immediate transfers to multi- or non-denominational patrons where the school community and the current patron have already opted voluntarily to do so. </p>  <p>  The Patron of the school referred to by the Deputy indicated that the decision to lease the property to Kerry ETB for the purposes of providing a community national school was made in consultation with and fully in line with the wishes of the local community.  </p>  <p>  A local meeting was held on the 2nd March, 2017, organised by a community group comprising parents/families of children from the local area who previously attended the school and attended by over 70 members of the local community. Following the meeting, the group formally requested the patron to allow the school to be made available as a community national school. </p>  <p>  I would point out that the previous model of divestment yielded only a very limited number of schools for transfer to multi-denominational patrons (10 since 2013).  I believe that the new schools reconfiguration for diversity process has the potential to significantly increase patron diversity in our school system with a target of reaching 400 multi-denominational and non-denominational schools by 2030.  </p>  <p>  While these new structures are being introduced, my Department will continue to work with the main stakeholders to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified, in 2017 and beyond.</p></reply>

It should be noted that SNA allocations are not made to individual children, but are made to schools to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs in the school.  </p><p>The level of SNA support allocated to schools can change from year to year, as students with care needs leave the school, as new students with care needs enrol, or as students develop more independent living skills as they get older and their care needs diminish over time.</p><p>In circumstances where a school, or parent, is unhappy with the allocation of SNA support which has been made, or considers the level of support allocated is not sufficient to meet the care needs of the pupils concerned, the school or parent, may appeal that decision via the NCSE appeals process.  Details of the NCSE appeals process is available at www.ncse.ie.</p><p>DES Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools and 0014/2017 for post primary schools were published on 7th March 2017 which set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.</p><p>The new Special Education Teaching allocation model provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on a school&rsquo;s educational profile. </p><p>This allocation will allow schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.</p><p>No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. Therefore the allocation for low incidence teaching support previously made for the child referred to in this question, will have been included in total profiled allocation for the school.</p><p>The school may continue to provide the additional teaching support in the same manner as previously or may revise the manner of the delivery of additional teaching support.</p><p>The new allocation model gives greater flexibility to schools in relation to the manner in which they use their resources. Schools may deploy special education teachers in a variety of ways in order to effectively meet pupils&rsquo; needs, for example, in-class support, small groups, team teaching or withdrawal.  </p><p>The provision of support for small groups of pupils, or use of in class support teaching for a number of pupils, as opposed to primarily one to one teaching, also means that qualifying pupils will often be able to receive more support than they otherwise would have done. </p><p>My Department recently published guidelines for schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under the new allocation model. These guidelines are available at  </p><p>The guidelines will support schools in how they identify pupils for additional teaching support and decide how much support to provide for pupils who need it.  </p><p>The guidelines also advise that effective communication and engagement with parents is an important part of moving towards a needs-based approach to the allocation of additional teaching resources and that this enhanced when parents are consulted in relation to their child&rsquo;s needs, support plan. </p><p>Where parents are concerned as to the manner in which their child will be supported under the new allocation model they should discuss with their child&rsquo;s class teacher, or the school Principal, the manner in which teaching support can be provided for their child next year. Such discussion may alleviate some of the concerns they may have regarding the manner in which teaching support can be provided in the coming school year.</p></reply>

In circumstances where children with special educational needs require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.  </p>  <p>  Special classes within mainstream schools are intended for children who, by virtue of their level of Special Educational Needs, cannot reasonably be educated in a mainstream class setting, but who can still attend their local school in a special class with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio and have access to Special Needs Assistant support. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where a need has been identified.  In considering Special Education provision, the NCSE takes into account existing supports in place in the area.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  Applications meeting the criteria are approved by the NCSE.   </p>  <p>  The NCSE continues to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas and has capacity to establish such new special classes where necessary, subject to the willingness of schools to open classes.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE welcomes expressions of interest from schools in opening special classes to meet the demand for special class provision.  In deciding on the location of a special class, SENOs take into account both the present and the future potential need for special class provision and they must be satisfied that the special class is sustainable and appropriately located.  SENOs liaise with relevant professionals in their area to arrive at an informed decision.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE has advised that the school in question expressed an interest to the SENO in relation to establishing a Specific Speech and Language Class (SSLI) and an ASD class in the school.  The SENO has written to the Principal on several occasions stating that the NCSE do not have any plans currently, to establish either an SSLI or an ASD class in the school.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the establishment of a Specific Speech and Language Unit class is contingent on the HSE providing Speech and Language Therapy support for the students in the class.  If the school has a commitment from the Health Service Executive to provide Speech and Language Therapy for the students in the class, the Principal should contact the local SENO for consideration in regard to the need for a SSLI class in the area, the suitability of the school as a location for a special class and sustainability of the class.</p></reply>

This information is available in the key statistics release at the following link: </p><p> </p><p>In addition, the &ldquo;Projections of Full-Time Enrolment Primary and Second Level (2017 - 2035)&rdquo; publication outlines my Department&rsquo;s projections up to 2035 and is available at the following link:  </p><p>My Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas. The GIS uses data from a  range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases. With this information, my  Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p><p>My Department's six year Capital Programme prioritises building projects to meet demographic demand. The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed.</p><p>In the case of new schools, my Department has published guidelines to assist in the identification and the assessment for suitability of new sites for schools where the procurement of a new site is required. The relevant guidelines are TGD-025 for Primary School site identification and TGD-027 for Post-Primary site identification. All technical guidelines are available on the Department of Education and Skills website. </p><p>These guidelines are not intended to be prescriptive and cover a number of technical criteria to be taken into account when appraising the suitability and development potential of a site for a new school relative to other available options. Both documents refer to guidelines for green space provision. However, in higher density urban developments the optimum site area may not be available and green space guidelines are subject to space availability. </p></reply>

These circulars aim to support and strengthen schools&rsquo; efforts in developing in young people the skills and attitudes needed to make informed decisions about their health.</p>  <p>  Schools are strongly encouraged to have a formal healthy eating policy that has been developed in consultation with students and parents. </p>  <p>  Guidelines are available to schools on developing a healthy eating policy in Post-Primary Schools, which have been developed by the Department of Health and HSE.  The healthy eating policy should outline how the school supports healthy eating practices through the promotion of healthy lunches and healthy snacks and other means.</p>  <p>  All of the proactive work done in schools complements the Government's Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013 - 2025 - Healthy Ireland. Schools can do so much but it is through working together, across Government departments, through families and communities that we can create an environment in which our young people have the knowledge, skills and resilience to choose to lead a healthy life.</p>  <p>  The provision of playspace, where site conditions and circumstances allow, is one of the issues considered in the architectural design of new schools and major extensions. The level of facilities, including playspace,  that can be provided in schools will therefore vary depending on the extent of classroom accommodation needed for the school. </p>  <p>   A suite of technical guidance documents is available on the Department's website (www.education.ie) to assist design teams in best practice design and development of projects and to encourage them to take a complete design team approach from project conception. These documents cover all aspects of the development of a building project for both internal and external works, including site assessments for new schools. </p>  <p>  The Physical Education curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary. Many primary schools have a general purpose room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the P.E. programme. A similar situation with sports halls and outdoor facilities applies at second level. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools. In the context of the Department's co-operation with local authorities in identifying suitable sites for new schools, the location of sporting facilities in the vicinity is one of a number of factors taken into account in the overall site appraisal process. </p>  <p>  The Department's design guidelines for schools include guidance in the provision of P.E. Halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts. The provision of playing pitches is not part of the specification for primary schools. However, in certain circumstances and where the site conditions allow, the project scope may include the levelling and grassing of an area which schools may decide to use for playing fields. At post primary level, an area may be developed as a practice playing field where site conditions and resources permit. In higher density urban developments the optimum site area may not be available and green space guidelines are subject to space availability.</p></reply>

This means that religion will not be used as a criteria in admissions to 80% of schools.</p><p>It is in the 20% other schools that this issue now needs to be addressed. </p><p>My preference is to remove the capacity for state-funded denominational primary schools, where they are oversubscribed, to use religion as a criteria in admissions process <b>except</b>, in three scenarios:</p><p>- where it would not otherwise be possible to maintain the ethos of the school;</p><p>- where the school is established by a minority religion, in order to ensure that students of that religion can find a school place in a school of that ethos;</p><p>- where the school is established by a minority religion, in order to admit a student of that religion who resides in a community consistently served by that school.</p><p>I have taken preliminary legal advice on my proposals prior to announcing them at the Oireachtas Committee and on that basis am confident to proceed.

The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p><p>Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of special classes by over 100% from 548 in 2011 to 1,152 across the country now, of which 887 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. </p><p>The NCSE will establish an additional 145 ASD Special Classes for the 2017/18 school year increasing the number of ASD Special Classes to 1,032.</p><p>Special classes for students with ASD are staffed with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1 at primary level and 6:1.5 at post primary level. Special Classes or students with Autism also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 SNAs for a class of 6 children. The average annual cost of teaching and SNA support in a post-primary level ASD class is approx. &euro;156K.</p><p>The following grants may be payable to newly established ASD Post Primary Special Classes</p><p>- Special class start-up grant - A grant of &euro;6,500 is available to cover the cost of furniture and general equipment. </p><p>- Specialised furniture/equipment grant: Available for individual students who require specialised furniture/equipment. </p><p>- Loose furniture and equipment: &euro;2,500 is available. </p><p>- Once off grant: &euro;7,000 is available for equipment for a multi-sensory room where this is included in the overall schedule of accommodation. </p><p>- ICT - a grant of &euro;5,000 is available per new primary classroom. </p><p>- Minor works grant: Funding is made available to all primary schools on the basis of a grant of &euro;5,500 plus &euro;18.50 per mainstream student and &euro;74 per student attending a special class in a mainstream school.</p><p>With regard to Capital Costs in the case of all new schools, it is general practice to include a Special Needs Unit (SNU) in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required. Typically, a two classroom SNU is provided in new primary schools and a two or four classroom unit is provided in new post primary schools.</p><p>In the case of existing schools, where a school is not in a position to accommodate a special class within its existing accommodation, it is open to the school to submit an application to the Department for capital funding to (i) re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class or (ii) to construct additional accommodation.</p><p>The cost of providing a special needs class / unit can vary depending on the accommodation solution approved and local circumstances relating to site conditions and planning permission requirements e.g. provision of new percolation system, parking and bus turning facilities etc. Costs of providing a SNU can range depending on whether it is a single SNU or a double unit with an additional 25%/30% cost depending on site/planning conditions etc. The cost of providing this accommodation is met from the Department&rsquo;s Additional Accommodation Scheme.</p></reply>

One of the criticisms of the last process was that it did not take sufficient account of local communities and local stakeholders. The ETBs, as statutory education authorities, present in every county, with representation from local groups on their boards, are ideally placed to carry out this process.  </p>  <p>  There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity.</p>  <p>  The protocols surrounding how the surveys will be carried out will be carefully designed by the Department of Education and Skills, and each ETB will submit a report to the Department showing the results of the surveys, including details of how the surveys were carried out in accordance with the protocols.  </p>  <p>  This new process for supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families is based around principles of transparency and cooperation. Therefore, there will be a very substantial level of consultation of local communities in the process, through the requirement for the existing patron to consult with local community and school interests in proposing to transfer patronage of an existing school to an alternative patron body.  In that process, the existing patron will also take into account proposals from all prospective multi-denominational patrons that wish to be considered. The reconfiguration process for primary school patronage will be open to application from all patrons offering multi-denominational or non-denominational school models.</p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge the voluntary nature of these transfers, given that the current patron is in most cases the owner of the land on which the school stands.  My Department will develop protocols on patronage transfer with existing patrons to ensure that school and local communities and prospective patrons are fully consulted before a decision is made.  I am confident that this process will respect the views of all parties - parents, local schools and communities and patrons.</p>  <p>  I would point out that the previous model of divestment yielded only a very limited number of schools for transfer to multi-denominational patrons (10 since 2013). I look forward to working constructively with all education stakeholders and patron bodies in this important endeavour and I would ask all parties to put aside sectional or self-interest in pursuing the national objective of providing greater diversity of school provision in line with the choices of parents, families and school communities.</p></reply>

It involved the introduction of Italian, Spanish, German and French for 5th and 6th classes. The MLPSI was a pilot scheme across 550 schools with an annual budget of approximately &euro;2.5m. It would not be possible to give an estimate of the cost of its reintroduction in 550 schools or its introduction across all primary schools due to the number of variables involved. </p>  <p>  The decision to end the MLPSI was taken in the context of a very challenging budgetary environment where difficult decisions had to be taken. A 2008 Report by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment recommended against a further expansion of the MLPSI, citing issues of curriculum overload and difficulties relating to the replicability of the model across the system.</p>  <p>  Consideration will be given to its reintroduction in the context of the review of the time and structure of the primary curriculum currently being carried out by the NCCA. The priority at primary level is to provide high-quality language learning in our two languages, Irish and English. A new Primary Language Curriculum, incorporating Irish and English, was introduced in classes from Junior Infants to 2nd class from September 2016. This curriculum aims to ensure that students acquire transferrable language skills which will assist them in learning Irish and English and additional languages at second level.  Work is currently underway in developing the Primary Language Curriculum for third to sixth class.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising a strategy on Foreign Languages in Education and this will be published shortly.

The Department continues to work to improve conditions for staff with disabilities and provide appropriate support including the use of assistive technologies and provision of care in the workplace and flexible working arrangements.    The Department&rsquo;s Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) continues to provide confidential support to staff with declared disabilities.  The DLO promotes the interests of staff with disabilities including through researching best practice on disability issues in conjunction with the Civil Service DLO Network.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to promote and support the employment of people with disabilities including through the WAM - Willing Able Mentoring- programme. This is a work placement programme which aims to promote access to the labour market for graduates with disabilities and build the capacity of employers to integrate disability into the mainstream workplace. </p>  <p>  My Department has also established a Management Board sub-Committee on Gender and Diversity which oversees the work of a Working Group on Equality and Diversity which aims to create an inclusive and diverse working environment that encourages a culture of respect and equality to the benefit of staff and the Department, and over time, to the benefit of those we serve. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to comply with any statutory Code of Practice and exceeds the target of 3% of employees with disabilities and in this regard the National Disability Authority (NDA) reports on compliance with this 3% target.  In its latest published report for the calendar year 2015, the NDA noted that in my Department, 3.5% of staff had a declared disability. In 2017 this number has risen to 3.65% of the Department&rsquo;s workforce. My Department reports annually on achievement of these obligations. </p>  <p>  Further specific steps undertaken include an installation of a new fire paging system for staff who are deaf or hard of hearing, provision of specialised National Council for the Blind Ireland (NCBI) assessments for staff as required and the provision of additional evacuation chairs in Departmental buildings. </p>  <p>  All staff in HQ have been offered workplace ergonomic assessments.  The recommendations arising from these assessments have been addressed.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding the challenge of the remaining issues to be resolved, I believe than an agreement can be reached &ndash; an agreement that would allow a power-sharing Executive to be formed on a sustainable basis.  All parties are committed to the successful operation of all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and everyone agrees that devolution is the best way to deliver for all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Governments can support and encourage but, in the final analysis, it is only the parties themselves that can make an agreement with each other.  All sides may now wish to reflect on how progress can best be made.  I have encouraged all parties to maintain dialogue with each other over the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  I will remain in regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland party leaders, in the weeks ahead.  The Government will spare no effort in fulfilling its solemn duty as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and this includes working to ensure the effective operation of all of its institutions.  We will continue to work to this end with the British Government to support and facilitate the parties in their efforts to reach agreement on formation of a new Executive.  The Government wishes to see this achieved as soon as possible.</p></reply>

I look forward to deepening this engagement in the weeks and months ahead.  My focus will be to hear perspectives and experience from across civic and civil society - both North and South - on how the Government can continue to support and achieve the full and effective implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements, including to address the difficult legacy of the past, through the establishment of the architecture provided for under the Stormont House Agreement.</p>  <p>  My Department will also continue to support the vital work of civil society on furthering peace and reconciliation through the Reconciliation Fund.  The Reconciliation Fund has been running since 1982, and was increased significantly in 1998, following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  As part of the 2014 Stormont House Agreement, the Government committed to guaranteeing the continued allocation of &euro;2.7 million annually to the Reconciliation Fund.  In the first round of 2017 funding, grants amounting to nearly &euro;1 million were allocated in support of 55 organisations.  The closing date for the second round of 2017 funding will be Tuesday 19 September and more details are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.   </p>  <p>  I look forward also to continuing, together with the Taoiseach, the Government&rsquo;s All Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit in the period ahead, with stakeholders North and South.  The All Island Civic Dialogue provides a vital platform, ensuring that civil society voices - North and South - are heard and taken account of as a central input to the Government&rsquo;s engagement as we participate in the EU-UK negotiations and deal with the all-island implications of Brexit.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government highlights this priority, with specific reference to implementation of the All-Party D&aacute;il motions relating to the Dublin Monaghan bombings.</p>  <p>  The 17 May marked the 43rd anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, which saw the biggest loss of life in a single day during the Troubles.  My predecessor Minister Flanagan participated on behalf of the Government in the commemoration ceremony that day and in addressing the commemoration ceremony, he reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s determination to continue - and to complete - our efforts to seek the truth of those awful events of 17 May 1974.</p>  <p>  The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings that was adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016 has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow.  </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  Following my own appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I raised the matter in person with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire at a meeting in Belfast last month.  I will remain actively engaged with the British Government on an ongoing basis on this matter, as will my officials.  </p>  <p>  In our discussions so far, I have advised Secretary of State Brokenshire that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin Monaghan atrocities.  I have also underlined to the Secretary of State that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and emphasised the urgent need for a response from the British Government.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to pursue this matter with the British Government, urging them to provide a satisfactory response to the motions that have been adopted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p></reply>

Ireland has consistently been in the vanguard of the move for multilateral nuclear disarmament since we joined the UN over sixty years ago.  We remain unwavering in our commitment to the NPT, to which Ireland has a historic connection as the first State invited to sign, in recognition of our efforts on this issue at the UN.  We view this new Treaty as strengthening the NPT and the shared, global vision of a world free from nuclear weapons.  Work on a number of options for legal pathways to multilateral nuclear disarmament, carried out by Ireland and our partners in the New Agenda Coalition (NAC), which was formed in 1998 to give renewed impetus to the NPT&rsquo;s disarmament provisions, has also been highly influential in informing the preparatory work on the new Treaty.</p>  <p>  This new Treaty complements the NPT, but it also implements it.  The NPT always envisaged further effective measures on nuclear disarmament and this new treaty represents one such effective measure.  This Treaty, through its core prohibitions on the Development, Testing, Production, Manufacture, Acquisition, Possession or Stockpiling of nuclear weapons, will establish an important global norm and will help us to continue to raise awareness of the risks posted by the continued existence of these weapons.  The Treaty honours the memory of the victims of nuclear weapons and the key role played by survivors in providing the living testimony which calls on us to ensure that these weapons are never used again.  It also provides pathways for the accession of those States possessing nuclear weapons, when they decide to join.</p>  <p>  The Treaty will be open for signature at the UN from 20 September 2017 and it is my intention that Ireland will sign the Treaty as soon as the necessary arrangements to do so are in place. </p></reply>

My Department works closely with the Department of the Taoiseach in regard to NSMC matters and the Taoiseach co-chairs the NSMC Plenary meetings with the Northern Ireland First Minister and deputy First Minister.</p>  <p>  However, in the absence of a Northern Ireland Executive and specifically a First and deputy First Minister the North South Ministerial Council cannot meet.</p>  <p>  As the formal means for bilateral discussions between the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, the NSMC has a crucial role to play in the Brexit discussions and the negotiations ahead.  The most recent NSMC Plenary meetings on 4th July 2016 in Dublin Castle and on 18 November 2016 in Armagh saw the Government and the Executive agree on a number of important common principles for dealing with Brexit on an all-island basis, scoping out the sectoral implications of Brexit for Ireland, North and South, and agreeing to work together to optimise North-South planning in the phases preceding and following Brexit.  It was agreed that this work would be taken forward through continuing bilateral discussions within the NSMC at sectoral level, as well as through a high-level working group comprising senior officials from the Government and from the Northern Ireland Executive Office.</p>  <p>  At the Plenary meeting of the NSMC on 18th November 2016 in Armagh the Council considered an update by a group of Senior Officials from relevant Departments, North and South, on the progress being made on implementing the commitments set out in Section E of the Fresh Start Agreement, to provide support and funding for North-South infrastructure projects.  The review is ongoing and a further report will be presented at a future Plenary meeting.  The Senior Officials have since met in February 2017 and again in early June to consider progress on all of the Section E commitments. </p>  <p>  The Council also received an update in relation to the North West Gateway Initiative.  Ministers welcomed the establishment by Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council of the North West Strategic Growth Partnership which will aim to work with central government North and South to ensure the North West region can reach its full potential.   </p>  <p>  The NSMC Plenary meeting was advised that Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council had finalised the necessary arrangements for oversight and delivery of the North West Strategic Growth Plan and the associated &euro;5m North West Development Fund  which was established under the Fresh Start Agreement.  I am pleased that the Irish Government has played a leading role in this regard &ndash; contributing &euro;2.5 million to the Fund.  The Inaugural meeting of the North West Strategic Partnership was subsequently held on 7 December 2016 and attended by senior officials from Departments, North and South, and I welcome that the second meeting of the Partnership was held in Letterkenny on 28 June 2017.  </p>  <p>  The Government remains engaged with the political parties in Northern Ireland.  I am hopeful that meetings of the North South Ministerial Council will soon recommence to enable further important engagement on progressing all-island cooperation in general and in particular addressing the challenges of Brexit.</p></reply>

However, waiting times have been markedly reduced over the past couple of years due to measures introduced by the Board and the Deputy will be glad to know that the Board&rsquo;s budget was increased by &euro;4.15m in 2017. </p><p>I know that the Board is extremely conscious of the fact that delays in service can lead to further difficulties not just for the client but also for children, the wider family and even the community as well as the courts system.  In relation to repossessions, the Deputy will be aware that insolvent persons seeking legal advice in relation to repossession proceedings may be able to avail of such advice through the Abhaile scheme.  A person admitted to the Abhaile scheme does not need to wait before they are seen by a solicitor for legal advice.  As part of the scheme a novel &ldquo;Duty Solicitor&rdquo; service is available at repossession lists at county registrars&rsquo; courts.  There is no waiting list for this service.  Certain matters are dealt with as priority matters which means they receive the next available appointment at the law centre.  Such matters include domestic violence, child abduction, child care, and asylum and related matters.  All other applications are placed on the waiting list. </p><p>An application for civil legal aid and advice can be made at any Legal Aid Board law centre.<font color="#000080">  </font>The Board does not maintain separate waiting lists for each category of case.  The following table sets out the waiting times for civil legal services as of the 1stJune 2017 by law centre.  I would highlight to the Deputy that, in law centres facing significant demand, the Legal Aid Board operates a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach, which involves giving an applicant a short consultation (45 minutes) for legal advice.  Those persons remain on the Board&rsquo;s waiting list if they require further legal services and the wait time for this is indicated by the second column. The majority of centres do not currently deem it necessary to operate the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach.</p><p><table><tr><th>Law Centre</th><th>Waiting time for 1st Consultation (no. weeks)</th><th>Waiting time for 2nd Consultation (no. weeks)</th></tr><tr><td>Athlone</td><td>15</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>16</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Castlebar</td><td>10</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>17</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Chancery Street</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td>19</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Popes Quay</td><td>17</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cork South Mall</td><td>25</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Dolphin House </td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk</td><td>16</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Ennis</td><td>26</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Finglas</td><td>9</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Galway Francis St</td><td>7</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Galway Seville House</td><td>7</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Jervis Street</td><td>4</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>23</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Letterkenny</td><td>18</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>5</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>36</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>14</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Montague Court</td><td>5</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Navan</td><td>29</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Nenagh</td><td>29</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Newbridge</td><td>11</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td>11</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>13</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Smithfield</td><td>13</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght</td><td>19</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Tralee</td><td>17</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Tullamore</td><td>4</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>14</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>16</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>15</td><td>0</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Therefore I can inform the Deputy that the information requested in relation to the total prison population; the number of prisoners, in tabular form, broken down by prison; the capacity of each prison within the State; the percentage occupation of each prison and the number of prisoners currently on temporary release broken down by prison is available on <i>www.irishprisons.ie </i></p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the type of offence which the person on temporary release was convicted of, is set out in the following table.</p><p><b>Table 1. Breakdown by Offence Group 12/07/2017</b><table><tr><th>Offence Group Description</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Homicide Offences</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Sexual Offences</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Attempts/Threat to Murder, Assaults, Harassments and Related Offences</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Dangerous or Negligent Acts</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Kidnapping and Related Offences</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Robbery, Extortion and Hijacking Offences</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Burglary and Related Offences</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Theft and Related Offences</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>Fraud, Deception and Related Offences</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Controlled Drug Offences</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Weapons and Explosives Offences</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Damage to Property and the Environment</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Public Order and Social Code Offences</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Road and Traffic Offences</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Offences against Government, Justice Procedures and Organisation of Crime</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Offences Not Elsewhere Classified</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>256</td></tr></table></p><p>On 12 July 2017, there were 256 prisoners (7%) on temporary release across the prison system.  This included 13 prisoners who were serving less than 3 months solely for the non-payment of a Court ordered fine and 178 prisoners who were on structured temporary release programmes such as the Community Return Programme or Community Support Scheme.  The legislative basis for making decisions on temporary release are fully set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003.</p><p>A prisoner may apply through the prison Governor for consideration for temporary release.  Their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession.  It is very important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive temporary release even if the recommendation made by the prison authorities and/or therapeutic services is to that effect.  Each application is considered on its individual merits and a number of factors are taken into account when making a decision on whether to grant temporary release.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2016-2018 and the Joint Prison Service/Probation Service Strategic Plan 2015-2017 includes working towards the objective of ensuring that all prisoners released early from custody are placed on appropriate structured programme of temporary release.</p><p>The Community Return Scheme is an initiative whereby carefully selected prisoners, serving sentences between 1 year and 8 years, can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work such as painting, gardening or graffiti removal in a supervised group setting.  The type of work involved is intended to assist the community and the scheme is involved with a large number of charitable organisations and local community groups.</p><p>In addition to Community Return, a Community Support Scheme has also been introduced to reduce recidivism rates of short term prisoners by arranging for additional support structures post release and by providing for a more structured form of temporary release.</p></reply>

This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves, 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013 to 638 as of 31 May 2017.  The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways - firstly some 200 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointment Service have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years.  With the plan to reach 15,000 Garda members well on track it was possible for the Commissioner and the Public Appointments Service to undertake a new recruitment campaign for Garda Reserves.  That is now in train and received a strong response.  This will, allowing for the selection process and necessary training of successful candidates, facilitate a start to be made on strengthening of the Reserve across every Garda Division, in the coming years. </p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out below, as provided by the Commissioner, the strength of the Garda Reserve in each Division from 31 May 2016 and 31 May 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available.</p><p><b>Garda Reserve Strength 31 May 2016 - 31 May 2017</b><table><tr><th>Division</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>DMR South Central </td><td>63</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>DMR North Central</td><td>52</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>DMR North </td><td>53</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>DMR East</td><td>18</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>DMR South</td><td>33</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>DMR West</td><td>44</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>29</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>31</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>26</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny/Carlow</td><td>31</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>59</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td>21</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Cork West </td><td>19</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>31</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>50</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>25</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan/Monaghan</td><td>15</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>26</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>37</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>8</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>29</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>38</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/Longford</td><td>11</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>18</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>27</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>29</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Laois/Offaly</td><td>23</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>24</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>870</td><td>638</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This very substantial investment in personnel is driven by our commitment to ensure all citizens have the reassurance of a visible, responsive and effective policing service.  The projected number of 4,000 civilians will effectively double the current figure and represents a medium-term target of a Garda organisation 20% comprised of civilians.  That will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently 14% comprised of civilians, more in line with international norms and ensure that trained Garda&iacute; are not engaging in administrative and technical duties which could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff.</p><p>The 20% target will be achieved through a twin-track approach of, firstly, a &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and, secondly, the redeployment of Garda&iacute; and backfilling by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.  In its 'Changing Policing in Ireland' report, the Garda Inspectorate has estimated that there may be up to 1,500 Garda&iacute; currently in such posts and the Government&rsquo;s plan aims to return as many of these Garda&iacute; as possible to front-line duties over the next five years.  With this in mind, the Garda Commissioner, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, has been requested to identify posts suitable for redeployment and to prepare a 5 year plan for reaching the 20% medium term target.</p><p>Funding for the recruitment of up to 500 civilians has been provided in Budget 2017 to facilitate the Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional level.  These appointments are intended to facilitate deeper civilianisation in the coming years.</p><p>To date, the Policing Authority (with the consent of the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform) has approved 137 of these positions including two new senior posts of Executive Director Strategy and Change Management and Executive Director Legal and Compliance.  The Government has also agreed in principle to the positions of a Chief Information Officer.  The majority of the positions sanctioned are in the areas of ICT, Human Resources, Governance and Strategy, Legal and Compliance, and Finance. 43 of the initial 137 sanctioned posts will go towards back filling vacancies created by the redeployment of Garda members to policing duties.  Garda management has indicated that some 163 of the total 500 civilians to be recruited this year will lead to redeployment opportunities.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>This level of commitment in the first year is very welcome and it is expected that the quantum of redeployments will increase in 2018 and beyond.</p><p>The Garda Commissioner has statutory responsibility for recruitment and is working with the Public Appointments Service to fill these sanctioned posts.  In addition there is ongoing engagement in accordance with the statutory framework between Garda management, the Policing Authority, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to sanctioning further posts to meet identified business needs across the organisation and draw down the funding that is available for up to 500 additional civilians this year.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p></reply>

At that time, Parts 1 and 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 were commenced to get the new Authority underway, particularly in terms of its nomination and appointment with the necessary motions of approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As part of the commencement of Part 2 of the 2015 Act, the Law Society, the Bar Council and the Honorable Society of the King's Inns furnished the Legal Services Regulatory Authority with copies of their professional codes as required within one month of the Authority's establishment under section 23(6)(a).  In December 2016 sections 118 to 120 of the 2015 Act were commenced to enable the conduct of public consultations and reports by the new Regulatory Authority within the statutory periods concerned.  These relate to Legal Partnerships (between solicitors and barristers or barristers and barristers - solicitors can already operate partnerships), Multi-Disciplinary Practices (where legal practitioners can provide their services together with other non-legal services providers) and certain restrictions on the work of barristers.  The Authority, for which initial office accommodation has been provided by my Department along with the secondment of an officer at Assistant Principal level, also appointed an Interim Chief Executive on 1 January 2016.  It is currently conducting a public recruitment campaign for a long-term Chief Executive.  The Authority has met seven times since its inaugural meeting on 26 October 2016 with its most recent meeting on 11 July 2017.  Funding support of &euro;1 million was provided to the new Authority by my Department in December 2016.  This is being done on a strictly recoupable basis as the Authority will be self-funding by levy with a similar allocation available to the Authority under my Department's Vote for this year. </p>  <p>  On 31 March 2017, the Regulatory Authority presented respective reports under sections 118 and 119 to the then Minister for Justice and Equality and these have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  These reports, which were completed under very tight statutory deadlines, are historical as the first formal outputs of the Authority in the discharge of its legislative functions.  They are also available along with minutes of meetings and other information on the web page of the new Regulatory Authority which is under development at www.LSRA.ie.  On 6 April 2017 the Authority commenced its public consultations process under section 120 of the Act about certain restrictions on the work of barristers - these arise with regard to the holding of clients monies and to the direct provision of services to a client in relation to contentious matters.  More recently, the Authority has submitted its first Annual Report which, under the relevant terms of the Act, covers its activities for the quarter since establishment on 1 October to the end of 2016 and this has also been laid before each House of the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  Alongside these developments, the working focus right now is on the managed roll-out of the Authority's remaining functions with the matching development of its organisational capacities and office and staffing resources.  This includes, under Part 10 of the 2015 Act, the introduction of a more transparent legal costs regime and the parallel transition, within the courts system, of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the Legal Costs Adjudicators; the establishment of a Roll of Practising Barristers under Part 9; the introduction of new regulations for the advertising of legal services under section 218 and the separate introduction, by my Department, of Pre-Action Protocols in medical negligence cases under Part 15 for which the relevant consultations by my Department are about to begin.  Following these steps, the key structural reforms of Part 6 of the Act relating to public complaints, professional conduct and the appointment of the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this month, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority completed its independent recruitment process for the appointment of a full-time Chief Executive.  I understand that the relevant practical arrangements are now in train and that the successful candidate will be announced and appointed by the Authority in September.  I can also confirm that representatives of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority have again met with senior officials of my Department on 10 July 2017 including by way of providing an update on work that is being done towards the phased sequencing and commencement of the remaining provisions of the Legal Services Act.  Today, I am also meeting the Chair of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, Dr. Don Thornhill.  As part of our discussions, we will review the work that has been done by the Authority during the nine months since its appointment in October including its appointment of an Interim Chief Executive and the public consultations and reports that it has been obliged to undertake within the strict deadlines that apply under the 2015 Act and have been outlined earlier in this Reply. </p>  <p>  The Chairperson and members of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, its Interim Chief Executive and my Department continue to work closely to ensure that we can successfully coordinate the identification of the necessary steps and commencements by the Department, and the delivery, by the Authority as the new independent statutory regulator, of the various remaining provisions concerned.  While it remains the intention that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority will come into substantive regulatory mode at the earliest opportunity, the phased start-up of its various functions will continue to need careful project management and the ongoing identification, in conjunction with the Authority, of the more specific delivery dates for the respective functions involved.  Indeed, I am aware that the Authority is giving strong priority to these aspects.  In light of this week's meetings and respecting the Authority's independence in the exercise of its functions, I am confident that this is something that will take place over the coming weeks and will be brought to fruition in conjunction with the appointment of the Authority's newly recruited full-time Chief Executive.</p></reply>

The Valuation Tribunal is an independent statutory body which hears appeals against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation on the valuation and revaluation of commercial properties for rating purposes under the Valuation Acts, 2001 to 2015.  The Valuation Office (and the associated Valuation Tribunal) came under the remit of my Department with effect from 1 January 2016.</p><p>Schedule 2 of the Valuation Act 2001 provides that the Minister &quot;shall from time to time as occasion requires appoint a member of the Tribunal to be chairperson&quot;.  As the term of appointment of the current Chairperson of the Valuation Tribunal will expire on 30 July 2017, it was deemed prudent to appoint an experienced serving member of the Tribunal as Chairperson.  It might be noted that this proposed appointment was recommended by the outgoing Chairperson in accordance with the provisions of the Guidelines on Appointments to State Boards.  The appointment of an experienced member of the Tribunal as Chairperson is particularly appropriate having regard to the anticipated impending extra workload for the Tribunal arising from the ongoing National Revaluation Programme and the establishment of a dedicated Revisions Unit in the Valuation Office. </p><p>The Chairperson Designate of the Valuation Tribunal, Ms Carol O'Farrell, who is a currently serving member, had an engagement with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality yesterday (12 July 2017) in advance of her proposed appointment as chairperson.  It is expected that Ms O'Farrell will serve as Chairperson of the Tribunal from 31 July 2017 until her current term as an ordinary member of the Tribunal expires on 20 June 2018. </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that it is anticipated that a number of vacancies as ordinary members of the Valuation Tribunal are expected to arise later in 2017 and these will be advertised for expressions of interest via <i>www.stateboards.ie</i></p></reply>

Registration of a judgment mortgage by the PRA operates to charge the debtor's estate or interest in the land and entitles the judgment mortgagee (that is, the creditor) to apply to court for an order under section 117 of the Act, or section 31 in the case of co-owned property.  A judgment mortgage remains valid until discharged and there is no need to re-register it in order to maintain its validity or enforceability.  </p>  <p>  In the case of an application under section 117, the court may make such order for enforcement of the judgment mortgage as the court thinks appropriate, including an order for sale of the land and distribution of the proceeds of sale.  In the case of co-owned property, section 30 of the 2009 Act provides that the registration of a judgment mortgage against the property of a joint tenant no longer severs the joint tenancy and if the joint tenancy remains unsevered, the judgment mortgage is extinguished on the death of the judgment debtor, that is,  a surviving joint tenant has no liability for debts of the deceased joint tenant against whose interest in the property the judgment mortgage was registered.  </p>  <p>  A judgment mortgagee (i.e.creditor) may apply to court for an order under section 31 to enforce a judgment mortgage in the case of co-owned land.  In dealing with such an application, the court may dismiss the application or, in light of the rights of all co-owners, make such order relating to the land as appears to the court to be just and equitable in the circumstances of the particular case.  The wider discretion available to the court in the case of co-owned land is intended to ensure that the interests of all co-owners are taken into account in a fair and equitable manner.  It should also be noted that subsection 5 of section 31 makes it clear that this section does not affect the court's jurisdiction under the Family Home Protection Act 1976.  </p>  <p>  As regards the rate of interest on judgment mortgages, I wish to inform the Deputy that the Courts Act 1981 (Interest on Judgment Debts) Order 2016 set the rate of interest on judgment debts at 2% with effect from 1 January 2017.</p></reply>

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  </p><p>This plan is progressing well.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves, 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013 to 638 as of 31 May 2017.  The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways - firstly, approximately 200 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointment Service have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full-time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years.  With the plan to reach 15,000 Garda members well on track it was possible for the Commissioner and the Public Appointments Service to undertake a new recruitment campaign for Garda Reserves.  That is now  in train and will, allowing for the selection process and necessary training of successful candidates, facilitate a start to be made on strengthening of the Reserve across every Garda Division, in the coming years.  </p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the table, as provided by the Commissioner, the strength of the Garda Reserve in the Wexford  Division from  2013 to the 31 May 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available.</p><p>Wexford Division Reserve Strength 2013 -2017*<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Numbers</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>2017*</td><td>20</td></tr></table>*As of 31 May 2017</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that, as of the 31 May 2017, there were 322 Garda together with 12 Garda Reserves and 37 civilians attached to the Cavan/Monaghan Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>This plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 26 of whom were assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan Division.  I am also informed that a further four hundred Garda recruits are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Cavan/Monaghan Division in the coming years.</p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

These combine annual reporting obligations with the undertaking of a more comprehensive review of this area that will be open to all stakeholders including, on the delivery side, universities and other third-level providers of legal professional education.</p>  <p>  The relevant provisions of section 13(2) of the 2015 Act, as commenced under S.I. No. 383 of 2016, provide that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority may, and where required by the Act, shall, keep under review and make recommendations to the Minister for Justice and Equality in respect of the admission requirements of the legal professions, that is to say both barristers and solicitors, under their respective bodies and the availability and quality of such education and training.  This will also take into account the curriculum arrangements for the provision of clinical legal education and the teaching of legal ethics, negotiation skills, alternative dispute resolution and advocacy and the methods by which, and the persons by whom, such education and training is provided.  It will also review the policies of the Law Society in relation to the admission of persons as solicitors in the State and those of the Bar Council and the Honorable Society of the King's Inns in relation to persons entitled to practice as barristers.</p>  <p>  Under section 33 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, when commenced, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority will also report, within four months of the end of each financial year, on admissions to the legal professions.  This report shall specify the number of persons admitted to each of the legal professions during the given year.  It will also contain an assessment as to whether or not, having regard for the demand for the services of practising solicitors and barristers and the need to ensure an adequate standard of education and training for persons admitted to practice, the number of persons so admitted in that year is consistent with the public interest in ensuring the availability of such services at a reasonable cost.  A copy of this report will be laid, by the Minister, before each House of the Oireachtas and will be published and sent by the Regulatory Authority to each of the legal professional bodies concerned.</p>  <p>  In addition to this annual reporting cycle, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has been given the specific task of preparing, with the support of a public consultation process, a comprehensive report in relation to the education and training (including ongoing training) arrangements in the State for legal practitioners, including the manner in which such education and training is provided.  This report is to be provided to the Minister within two years of the Authority's establishment day, 1 October 2016. Under the detailed parameters set out in section 34 of the 2015 Act as commenced under S.I. No. 383 of 2016, it will contain "a review of the existing arrangements relating to the education and training of legal practitioners" and make such recommendations as considered appropriate in relation to the arrangements that, in the opinion of the Authority, should be in place for the provision of such education and training.  This is also to include "the accreditation of bodies to provide such education and training and the reforms or amendments, whether administrative or legislative, that are required to facilitate those arrangements". </p>  <p>  In addition, Section 34 (3) (c) of the 2015 Act lays out the specific areas of recommendation that are to be dealt with under this review process.  These are to include, among other matters, the appropriate standards of education and training for legal professional qualifications; arrangements necessary to monitor those standards; the scope and content of the curriculum for the courses concerned; standards required for the award of legal professional qualifications, and, arrangements that would facilitate the minimisation of duplication and consequent expense incurred in the taking of overlapping examinations in legal subjects.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the question of diversity of access to the two legal professions and the induction, apprenticeship and other qualification procedures traditionally exercised by the  legal professional bodies concerned are among those comprehended by the in-depth review and reporting frameworks now provided under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.  The Government will, therefore, take account of any specific findings and recommendations that may arise in relation to the matters raised by the Deputy into account and consider the appropriate policy responses to be made. </p></reply>

This very substantial investment in personnel is driven by our commitment to ensure all citizens have the reassurance of a visible, responsive and effective policing service.  The projected number of 4,000 civilians will effectively double the current figure and represents a medium-term target of a Garda organisation 20% comprised of civilians.  That will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently 14% comprised of civilians, more in line with international norms and ensure that trained Garda&iacute; are not engaging in administrative and technical duties which could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff.</p><p>The 20% target will be achieved through a twin-track approach of, firstly, a &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and, secondly, the redeployment of Garda&iacute; and backfilling by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.  In its 'Changing Policing in Ireland' report, the Garda Inspectorate has estimated that there may be up to 1,500 Garda&iacute; currently in such posts and the Government&rsquo;s plan aims to return as many of these Garda&iacute; as possible to front-line duties over the next five years.  With this in mind, the Garda Commissioner, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, has been requested to identify posts suitable for redeployment and to prepare a 5 year plan for reaching the 20% medium term target.</p><p>Funding for the recruitment of up to 500 civilians has been provided in Budget 2017 to facilitate the Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional level.  These appointments are intended to facilitate deeper civilianisation in the coming years.</p><p>To date, the Policing Authority (with the consent of the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform) has approved 137 of these positions including two new senior posts of Executive Director Strategy and Change Management and Executive Director Legal and Compliance.  The Government has also agreed in principle to the positions of a Chief Information Officer.  The majority of the positions sanctioned are in the areas of ICT, human resources, governance and strategy, legal and compliance, and finance. 43 of the initial 137 sanctioned posts will go towards back filling vacancies created by the redeployment of Garda members to policing duties.  Garda management has indicated that some 163 of the total 500 civilians to be recruited this year will lead to redeployment opportunities.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>This level of commitment in the first year is very welcome and it is expected that the quantum of redeployments will increase in 2018 and beyond.</p><p>The Garda Commissioner has statutory responsibility for recruitment and is working with the Public Appointments Service to fill these sanctioned posts.  In addition there is ongoing engagement between Garda management, the Policing Authority, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to sanctioning further posts to meet identified business needs across the organisation and draw down the funding that is available for up to 500 additional civilians this year.</p></reply>

For this reason, I will commence the development of a National LGBTI Inclusion Strategy in the Autumn, with a public consultation process as part of scoping our the priorities to be addressed.  My view, at this stage, is that this Strategy will identify specific areas of society and policy (e.g., sports and health) areas in which difficulties are still seen as presenting for LGBTI people.  The key question here is not what more we need to do on legislation, but how do we work to change those negative attitudes, that still remain in some sections of society. </p>  <p>  The high level objective of the proposed Strategy has been tentatively stated as to bring about the necessary changes in society so that being LGBTI is unremarkable and that LGBTI people are valued throughout society.  Discussion will focus on (a) setting out the overall objective, (b) defining the necessary preconditions for achievement of that objective and, then (c) agreeing detailed actions necessary to achieve those preconditions.</p>  <p>  I have no formal deadline for the Strategy&rsquo;s completion, but this is expected to develop out of the examination and consideration of initial findings from the public consultation process.</p>  <p>  As you may know, in our current Programme for Government, we included a commitment to produce an LGBT+ Youth Strategy that is being developed separately by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I am advised that good progress is being made on that Strategy.</p>  <p>  With regard to the most recent ILGA Europe Rainbow Europe Map, while Ireland&rsquo;s overall percentage has dipped slightly to 52%,our overall ranking has improved by two places to 15th in the Rainbow Index.  Ireland, as you know, was the first country in the world to legalise marriage equality through a popular vote. Because Ireland has achieved so much in recent years in relation to marriage equality, gender recognition legislation and changes to our equality legislation, it is disappointing that we are not somewhat higher up the Rainbow Index rankings in terms of achievement.  A factor is that the Index's methodology focusses on progress in the previous year. Nevertheless, the Index is extremely useful in highlighting areas of law and policy which need to be addressed by Ireland in the coming years in relation to LGBTI issues.  In this regard, I can assure the Deputy that the Government is dedicated to continuing to make progress. </p></reply>

I am assured by the Commissioner that Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with the overall policing arrangements and operational strategies are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of resources and the best possible policing service is provided to the general public. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the total strength of the Garda Traffic Corps on the 31 May 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 663.  In addition, there is a Chief Superintendent and a Superintendent attached to the DMR Traffic Corps, and a Superintendent attached to the West and South East Region.  The other three Regions each have a Traffic Inspector.</p><p>The Commissioner has committed in her Policing Plan for 2017 to increase incrementally the number of personnel dedicated to traffic duties by 10% to support better outcomes in relation to road traffic enforcement.  It is envisaged that the planned increase will be achieved in the second part of this year as newly attested Garda&iacute; come on stream, freeing up resources for assignment to  traffic policing.</p><p>I am informed that a proposal in respect of the reconfiguration of the Traffic Corps is currently being developed.

The Government plans to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.

The Government has agreed that the vehicle for implementation of the agreed reforms is the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 (MRP). </p>  <p>  With more than 80 initiatives and 135 projects, the MRP will strengthen the service An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides and ensure that they can deal with emerging issues into the future.  Due to the scale of the MRP, a phased planning approach is essential.  Some initiatives will be implemented in the short to medium term, while others will be implemented over the lifetime of the Programme as they will require a number of years to implement fully.  Given the highly complex nature of the MRP, timelines for projects may move for a number of reasons including, for example, extended scope or procurement phase, unforeseen delays or changes to the strategic priorities of the organisation.  The Strategic Transformation Office (STO) has been established within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to oversee governance and delivery of the projects that form the MRP.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda mobility strategy, which aims to ensure that Garda members have remote access to information and technology, is progressing with the recent completion of the overall strategy document.  When fully implemented, access by members to real-time information on mobile devices, as well as enabling investigation teams to collect and share information digitally, will improve the effectiveness of the service provided to communities. </p>  <p>  The Enterprise Content Management project is intended to provide a single repository for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to securely store and manage content.  Key features of the solution include:</p>  <p>  - management and control of content for all offices across all levels (Regions/Divisions/Districts/Sub-District/Other Offices) of the organisation;</p>  <p>  - security controls will ensure audit ability and traceability of all content;</p>  <p>  - storage of all data types (e.g. documents, photos, video, audio, etc); and</p>  <p>  - ability to store, access and search across all content.</p>  <p>  I understand from the Garda authorities that this project will shortly go live in the Eastern Region in the Districts of Mullingar, Athlone and Naas following the completion of training in these areas.  The system will then be systematically rolled out nationwide.</p>  <p>  The Investigations Management System (IMS) is intended to standardise, digitise and support the management of all investigations arising from a PULSE incident.  The system will support the allocation and management of all jobs and allocation of roles and documentation relating to the running and completion of an investigation.  It will also maintain a full history of the chain of events for an investigation, information and evidence gathered and decisions made.  I am advised that work is progressing in relation to the IMS and that contacts are ongoing with relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

The Programme has been formed based on recommendations made in 44 reports, both internal and external, developed over the preceding 10 years as well as extended periods of consultation and workshops with senior leadership within the organisation.  The MRP aims to deliver on its objective through the realisation of a number of key outcomes described in detail throughout the chapters of the Programme launch document.  The Strategic Transformation Office (STO) has been established to oversee governance and delivery of the projects that form the MRP.</p>  <p>  With more than eighty (80) initiatives and 135 projects, the MRP will strengthen the service An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides and ensure that they can deal with any emerging issues into the future.  Due to the scale of the programme, a phased planning approach is essential; some initiatives will be implemented in the short to medium term, while others will require a number of years to implement fully.  Given the highly complex nature of the MRP, timelines for projects may move for a number of reasons including extended scope or procurement phase, unforeseen delays to risks or issues or changes to the strategic priorities of the organisation. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works closely with my Department and the DPP, Irish Prison Service and Probation Service to tackle crime and reduce reoffending rates.  I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will use Offender and Case Management programmes, in conjunction with the Courts, Probation Service, HSE and TUSLA, to manage prolific and high risk offenders in the community to reduce re- offending. </p>  <p>  The Offender Management initiative under the MRP is currently comprised of two projects, namely JARC and SAOR.</p>  <p>  - JARC is a Joint Agency Approach to Crime  where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prisons Service and the Probation Service work together to move repeat offenders away from crime.  The implementation of this project under the MRP will further develop and implement operational processes to manage nominated prolific offenders in co-operation with these agencies</p>  <p>  - SAOR is a Strategic Approach to Offender Recidivism which aims to reduce recidivism through the training of Case Managers for the organisation.  Successful implementation of this project will ensure the effective management and implementation of case managers and improved inter agency co-operation.</p>  <p>  The above programmes will continue to be rolled out throughout 2017.  The various programmes within JARC are in an evaluation process and it is expected that the various evaluations will be completed before the end of this year. </p></reply>

The triage model provides a tiered response and capability for computer forensic services on a regional basis, utilising locally-based and trained first-responders and cyber triage specialists.  The triage model also reduces demands on the central Bureau, while remaining under the supervision of the Detective Superintendent, Garda Cyber Crime Bureau.  To date two regional triage units have been established in the Southern and South-Eastern Regions, at Ballincollig and New Ross Garda Stations.  These triage units are the subject of review to inform and establish best practices and processes for the establishment of further such units in other Regions. </p>  <p>  Currently the number of staff allocated to the GCCB is 26 including 1 Superintendent, 1 Inspector, 6 Sergeants and 15 Garda&iacute;, with 1 Higher Executive Officer and 2 Executive Officers. </p></reply>

Copies are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.The Strategy is to be implemented in two phases. The key action in Phase one, as set out in the Implementation Programme, will be the preparation of a National Landscape Character Assessment (NLCA). My Department is currently preparing tender documentation for the NLCA. The NLCA will be an important tool to provide data and objective information required to evaluate the current state of the landscape and to underpin effective spatial planning and landscape-centred decision making. </p><p>I would note that the primary role of planning authorities and the consultative roles of other bodies and persons in decision-making relating to landscape issues will continue to be governed by the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended). One of the objectives of the National Landscape Strategy will be to assist in the achievement of greater consistency in decision making when dealing with issues of landscape via the landscape character assessment process, within City and County Development Plans, at local government level.</p><p>The second phase of the strategy under Action 3 is: &ldquo;Following completion of the National Landscape Character Assessment, statutory guidelines on local Landscape Character Assessments, following best international practice, and incorporating Historic Landscape Characterisation, and other appropriate assessment methodologies, will be prepared for Planning Authorities under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).&rdquo; The preparation and issuing of these statutory guidelines will be a joint action of my Department and that of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.</p><p>In relation to the specific Landscape Character Assessment referred to by the Deputy,  and its planning zoning, this is a matter for the relevant Local Authority and I have no function in that regard. </p></reply>

The Plan has now become the Burren National Park Management Plan and is in draft form for consideration by my officials. I intend also to produce a Management Plan for the Kerry Biosphere Reserve in the context of the recent UNESCO designation.  The Department&rsquo;s short term focus is on conservation objectives for Natura 2000 sites and as such there are no immediate plans to produce management plans for Ballycroy, Glenveagh, Connemara or Wicklow Mountains National Parks. My Department intends however to produce visitor and management plans for its National Parks on an on-going basis subject to the availability of resources.   In this context the Deputy will note that in February of this year the Taoiseach formally announced a Strategic Partnership with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department. One major output of this partnership will be a Tourism Interpretation Masterplan. Work has already commenced on this and the consultants are due to report in the last quarter or 2017. The partnership aims to achieve the shared goal of further developing quality visitor experiences at Ireland&rsquo;s 6 National Parks and Nature Reserves.</p></reply>

The programme provides funding for small scale infrastructural projects in disadvantaged rural areas that have experienced significant levels of de-population. Funding for the 2017 CL&Aacute;R programme was available this year under four separate Measures:</p><p>Measure 1:  Support for School and Community Safety Measures </p><p>Measure 2:  Play Areas </p><p>Measure 3:  Targeted Community Infrastructure </p><p>Measure 4:  First Responder Supports </p><p>Applications under Measures 1, 2 and 3 were submitted through the Local Authorities, while applications under Measure 4 were submitted from voluntary organisations involved in community-based response to emergency situations.  In total, more than 500 applications were received across the four Measures to the value of &euro;15 million.</p><p>In general, applications were assessed on the basis of their eligibility under the scheme criteria and on the quality of the documentation supporting their proposals.  Approximately 230 applications were approved for funding totalling &euro;7 million in recent weeks.  </p><p>With respect to the application referred to by the Deputy, insufficient documentary evidence was provided as required by the scheme criteria and the application was unsuccessful as a result.  Applicants were specifically required to provide the following documentation as part of the application process:</p><p>- an application by a School/Community organisation </p><p>- clear evidence of need </p><p>- full estimated costings </p><p>- evidence that all necessary permissions were in place</p><p>- evidence, where applicable, that ownership/lease was in place</p><p>- evidence that match funding was in place where relevant, and </p><p>- relevance to the LECP/other plan.</p><p>The group referred to by the Deputy provided a basic application outlining the proposed works, a rationale as to why the works were needed, and an estimate of costings. Evidence in respect of the other requirements outlined above was not provided.  </p><p>All funding available under the CL&Aacute;R programme in 2017 has now been allocated. There are no plans at present to allocate any further funding to CL&Aacute;R this year.</p></reply>

My Department has invested heavily in tackling this invasive species, the control of which is difficult, costly, and labour intensive. The management of the dynamic and aggressive Rhododendron <i>ponticum</i>is a long-standing on-going programme in the National Park. In the past, approximately 3,000 of the over 10,000 hectares in the Park were, to some extent, affected. My Department remains of the opinion that the existing management programme has made significant inroads into the problem with approx. 2,000 of the 3,000 hectares, involving some 40 different sites, under effective control.</p><p>The on-going programme of works, at this time, is comprised of four primary elements:</p><p>i.the initial clearance and follow-up maintenance work by contractors;</p><p>ii.  on-going maintenance work by volunteers and students;</p><p>iii. a Rhododendron eradication management contract; and,</p><p>iv.  on-going work by NPWS staff including co-ordination, research, and monitoring.</p><p>Since 2011, the Department has invested over &euro;700k to tackle rhododendron clearance in Killarney National Park and in 2016 the Department spent close to &euro;210k on clearance. An updated Strategic Rhododendron Management Plan has been finalised and the Department has issued a Request for Tender (RFT) inviting suitably qualified vendors for the term of four years to be included on the Department&rsquo;s <i>Rhododendron Ponticum </i>Eradication and/or Maintenance programme. &euro;240,000 has already been budgeted for Rhododendron clearance in Killarney National Park this year. </p><p>In addition, in 2016 my Department spent over &euro;2m in Killarney National Park (including Killarney House). This represents the largest apportionment of my Department&rsquo;s overall budget for National Parks and Reserves and reflects the commitment and the value that my Department places on the Park. </p></reply>

Its statutory remit is to assist and encourage the making of film in the State and the development of a film industry in Ireland.<font color="#2F2F2F"> </font>The Film Board supports writers, directors and production companies across these sectors by providing investment loans for the development, production and distribution of film, television and animation projects.  The Film Board also supports the Irish screen industries at major international markets and festivals, promotes inward investment, the use of Ireland as a location for international production and provides support for companies filming in Ireland. The Board liaises with IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland to maximise opportunities for the promotion of Ireland as a location for film productions as well as a tourism destination. Information on its funding scheme is available on the Irish Film Board website at<i>www.irishfilmboard.ie.</i></p><p>In Budget 2017, I secured an increase of &euro;2 million for the Irish Film Board, bringing the total allocation for 2017 to over &euro;16m. This increase in funding will allow the Board to invest more in Irish talent and follows on from a very successful year for the Irish film sector, particularly the indigenous film sector, in 2016. </p><p>The other primary mechanism through which the Government supports the film industry is Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 - the film tax relief scheme. My Department&rsquo;s investment in the film sector will also help to maximise the benefits brought about by the Government&rsquo;s enhancement of the Section 481 film tax credit system, including the decision to increase the cap for eligible expenditure on film projects to &euro;70 million, as announced as part of Budget 2016.</p><p>The twin approach of direct funding and tax expenditure measures maximises the benefits of Government&rsquo;s support to the audiovisual industry.</p><p>In addition to the supports outlined above the Creative Ireland Programme 2017 &ndash; 2022 which was announced in December 2016 is a cross-Government initiative to mainstream culture and creativity in the life of the nation and to promote individual, community and national well-being. </p><p>The objective of the fourth pillar of the Programme &ndash; establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production &ndash; is to elevate the creative industries including media, architecture, design, digital technology, fashion, food and crafts together on an all of government basis. The initial focus of the Creative Ireland programme this year is to undertake to develop an industry-wide, long-term plan for Ireland as a global hub for the production of Film, TV Drama and Animation by the end of 2017. This objective is also reflected in the Action Plan for Rural Ireland given the importance of the film industry to rural Ireland. </p><p>In this regard, my Department has commissioned an economic analysis of our screen based creative industries, in partnership with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. This study will examine the economic impact including employment and the potential of the Irish film, TV and animation sector. Following an open tender process, Olsberg SPI Ltd in association with Nordicity, was selected to conduct the study in November last year. The commissioning of the study was also a commitment in the Action Plan for Jobs 2016.  The recommendations of the economic study will inform the development of the plan envisaged under the Creative Ireland Programme and Action Plan for Rural Ireland.</p><p>On 5 May last, I hosted a very successful Media Production Workshop at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham which attracted attendance by representatives of the film, broadcast, animation and gaming industries. </p><p>The Deputy may also be interested to know that the Film Board and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland have jointly commissioned a report on the skills needs of the audio visual industry in Ireland. This report will be published shortly. My Department will consider recommendations contained in the report and working with stakeholders, will address any identified skills needs. </p><p>The outcomes of the economic study, the workshop held in Kilmainham and the report on the skills need of the industry will all input into the proposed Government plan for the audio visual industry in Ireland, which will be published in Autumn. </p><p>On a wider scale, the Government recognises the value of the film sector both nationally and regionally and as such, both the National and Regional Action Plans for Jobs has a number of Actions to further support the film sector.

For example, yesterday I unveiled the plans for the major &euro;10m capital investment plan for the National Library of Ireland&rsquo;s historic Kildare Street premises. The investment will be delivered as a phased programme of works in partnership with the Office of Public Works. Appropriately this investment programme is called "Reimagining the National Library", and will help transform the Library into a world class facility for the storage and display of our national collection, as well as enabling the Library to develop its capacity as a centre for research, culture, learning and tourism. </p>  <p>  The redevelopment is another significant investment by this Government in our National Cultural Institutions, following the opening in June of the magnificently restored historic wings at the National Gallery. Substantial upgrades are also getting underway at the National Concert Hall and the National Archives. </p>  <p>  This investment is also complemented by the &euro;9m capital investment scheme in arts and cultural centres which I announced earlier this year. </p>  <p>  The quality of our cultural facilities demonstrates in a very tangible way where our societal priorities lie and are crucial in terms of ensuring that Ireland is an attractive place to live, work, visit and invest and I am currently developing a capital investment programme for the culture and heritage sector as committed to under the Creative Ireland Programme. </p>  <p>  This programme will set out an overall capital strategy for the cultural and heritage sectors for the years ahead.</p></reply>

Applicants were required to provide evidence that they were a recognised part of an overall emergency response effort supported by the HSE or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.A total of &euro;1.21 million was approved to a range of organisations under the Emergency First Response measure of the CL&Aacute;R programme and the approvals included funding for defibrillators in some cases.

The closing date for receipt of applications under the scheme for this year was 30 June 2017.

The areas originally selected for inclusion in the programme were those which suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 1996 (with the exception of the Cooley Peninsula which was included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused in that area by Foot and Mouth disease). The average population loss in the original CL&Aacute;R regions over the period 1926 to 1996 was 50%.   In 2006, an analysis of the 2002 Census data was carried out by the National Institute for Spatial Analysis (NIRSA) in Maynooth University and the programme was extended to include areas with an average population loss of 35% per county between 1926 and 2002. Parts of five counties were added (Carlow, Kilkenny, Laois, Offaly, Wicklow), increasing the total number of counties covered by the programme at that stage from 18 to 23.  </p>  <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme was effectively closed to new applicants from 2010.  However, the Government re-launched the programme in the second half of 2016. </p>  <p>  The analysis which is required to assess, and potentially amend, the designation of CL&Aacute;R areas is time-consuming and significant. Given that the 2016 Census had taken place in April of last year, and the fact that detailed information in respect of that Census was expected to be available by mid-2017, it would not have been an effective or efficient use of resources to commence an analysis of the 2011 data for CL&Aacute;R purposes towards the end of 2016.  To do so would also have delayed the roll-out of the programme and would have prevented over 800 projects benefitting from funding in the last 12 months.</p>  <p>  However, it is my intention to review the CL&Aacute;R areas later this year, based on detailed 2016 Census small area data which is expected to be available shortly.</p></reply>

These commitments include supporting people with disabilities to maximise their potential, removing barriers which impact on access to services, education, work or health-care and providing supports at key transition points in their lives. The Programme for Government also recognises that persons with disabilities should have more control in accessing services and giving them greater independence and choice to better fit their needs.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government is just one component of the wider Government policy in supporting persons with disabilities and cannot be looked at in isolation and the House will be aware of the forthcoming National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, which will form a key part of driving Government policy in this area. The aim of the Strategy is to significantly improve the lives of people with disabilities in a practical sense, and also in creating the best possible opportunities to allow them to fulfil their potential.</p>  <p>  The Strategy is an all of Government approach and is broadly based around eight key themes including ensuring equality and choice, the provision of services, accommodation, health, employment, transport and education.  As Chair of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group, I have driven the preparation of the Strategy, including an extensive consultation process, and its recent finalisation, and I am pleased to inform the House that it is to be launched tomorrow.</p>  <p>  I can assure the House that the Government's commitments to improving the lives of persons with disability will not end with the publication of the Strategy, and I am committed to ensuring that the Strategy results in real and concrete change for the better for children and adults with disabilities.</p>  <p>  As it is not possible to compile the updates on each health-related disability action in the Programme for Government in the time available, I will revert to the Deputy with the information as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Tobacco Free Ireland, the Report of the Tobacco Policy Review was endorsed by Government and published in 2013. It set a target for Ireland to be tobacco free (smoking prevalence &lt;5%) by 2025. One of the recommendations in the report was to increase duty on roll-your-own tobacco products to reduce the differential in price between manufactured cigarettes and other tobacco products. In Budgets 2013 and 2015 the rate of duty applying to roll-your-own tobacco was increased proportionally more than for manufactured cigarettes, however, substantial differential still remains.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017 (11 October 2016) the rate of duty applying to manufactured cigarettes was set at &euro;288.22 per 1000 cigarettes plus 9.52% of the retail price or a minimum tax of &euro;325.11 per 1000 cigarettes. The rate of duty for roll-your&ndash;own tobacco was set at &euro;310.189 per kilogram.  A kilogram of roll-your-own tobacco would be expected to yield a minimum of 1,320 cigarettes, hence the approximate rate of duty applying to 1000 roll-your-own cigarettes is &euro;234.992, still substantially less that the rate of duty applying to manufactured cigarettes.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners ('Revenue') that while the minimum size of a roll-your-own packet that can be purchased has increased, the price per kilo to the consumer is not affected and it is not clear if the change will lead to increased demand for illicit supplies.  Ireland, like all countries with high tobacco prices is an attractive target for smuggling.  The priority for dealing with the smuggling of illicit tobacco products continues to be the effectiveness of enforcement action by Revenue.  Such action includes risk analysis and screening of cargo and postal products, cooperation at national and international level and effective use of detection technologies.  Revenue also targets the illicit trade at post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  The Government has also ensured through the Finance Acts over recent years that Revenue has the statutory powers necessary for undertaking its important work against the illegal tobacco trade, including enhanced powers of search and inspection for illicit products.  I am assured by Revenue that action against illegal activity involving tobacco products will continue to be a high priority.</p></reply>

Counselling and rehabilitation services provide care to those presenting with a gambling addiction through one to one counselling, financial advice and onward referral to other services and supports where appropriate, such as Gamblers Anonymous.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides funding to a number of voluntary sector providers who, in addition to treating drug and alcohol addictions, also treat gambling addiction.  However, it is not possible to identify the number of HSE funded beds that are allocated specifically for the treatment of gambling addiction.  According to the National Drug Treatment Reporting System, 208 cases were treated for gambling in Ireland in 2015, the latest year for which data is available.</p>  <p>  These addiction services are already covered in the HSE&rsquo;s 2017 service plan as part of primary care.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Minister for Justice and Equality that his department will proceed with gambling legislation at the earliest opportunity.  The preparation of a Gambling Control Bill continues on that basis.  However, it should be acknowledged that it will require some significant updating to take account of developments since 2013.  The preparation of legislation will be a major and complex undertaking.</p>  <p>  In relation to private health insurance providers, under the Minimum Benefit Regulations, 1996, all health insurance products that provide cover for in-patient hospital treatment must provide a certain minimum level of benefits.  The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure.</p>  <p>  Insurers are free to design and sell private health insurance plans, providing the plans comply with the minimum benefits regulations.  The Minister has no role to play in commercial decisions taken by health insurers when determining whether to provide cover for any particular procedure or treatment, beyond those specified in the regulations.</p></reply>

Periodic reviews of progress across the five pillars of the Strategy are carried out through the Oversight Forum on Drugs, which is chaired by the Minister with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy.</p><p>Prevention and Education programmes constitute a significant part of the Government's response to the drug problem, particularly among young persons.  Substance use education in schools is provided in the context of Social Personal and Health Education.  The Department of Education and Skills's Inspectorate continues to monitor the effectiveness of the implementation of substance use policies in schools through the whole-school evaluation process and the inspectorate system.  Local and Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Forces operate a range of education and prevention programmes, which aim to promote healthier lifestyle choices among young people and other vulnerable groups at risk of problem drug use.  In addition, young people at risk of drug misuse can access diversionary programmes, facilities and services and family support.</p><p>My Department does not routinely collect the information sought by the Deputy.  However, in line with the National Drugs Strategy, departments and agencies report on their annual expenditure attributable to drugs programmes to the Oversight Forum on Drugs.  Details of the expenditure from 2011 to 2015, as well as the allocation for 2016, is outlined in the table below.</p><p><b>Expenditure and Allocations attributable to Drugs Programmes</b><table><tr><th>Department/Agency</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th><div> </div></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>2011</td><td>2012</td><td>2013</td><td>2014</td><td>2015</td><td>2016</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Expenditure<br /><br />&euro;m</td><td>Expenditure <br /><br />&euro;m</td><td>Expenditure <br /><br />&euro;m</td><td>Expenditure<br /><br />&euro;m</td><td>Expenditure<br /><br />&euro;m</td><td>Allocation<br /><br />&euro;m</td></tr><tr><td>HSE Addiction Services</td><td></td><td>89.368</td><td></td><td>86.122</td><td>90.994</td><td>89.894</td></tr><tr><td>HSE Drugs Task Force Projects</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>21.57</td><td>22.592</td><td>22.924</td></tr><tr><td>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</td><td>45.014</td><td>45.85</td><td></td><td>43.00</td><td>43.000</td><td>45.000</td></tr><tr><td>Department of Children and Youth Affairs</td><td>24.987</td><td>22.73</td><td>20.31</td><td>19.548</td><td>19.548</td><td>20.037</td></tr><tr><td>Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality</td><td>18.681</td><td>18.58</td><td>18.553</td><td>18.762</td><td>19.363</td><td>21.572</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service</td><td>15.47</td><td></td><td>14.624</td><td>16.235</td><td>17.445</td><td>18.500</td></tr><tr><td>Department of Social Protection (previously F&Aacute;S areas)</td><td>15.634</td><td>11.859</td><td></td><td>14.063</td><td>13.900</td><td>14.167</td></tr><tr><td>Department of Health</td><td>33.554</td><td>32.376</td><td>30.524</td><td>8.28</td><td>7.323</td><td>6.995</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Prison Service</td><td>5.20</td><td>5.00</td><td></td><td>4.20</td><td>4.24</td><td>4.44</td></tr><tr><td>Department of Education and Skills</td><td>0.411</td><td></td><td>0.81</td><td>0.748</td><td>0.758</td><td>0.748</td></tr><tr><td>Department of Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>252.229</td><td>241.019</td><td>237.147</td><td>232.528</td><td>239.147</td><td>244.272</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The provision of transport to adults with a disability attending HSE-funded day services is not a core health service, and the HSE endeavours to ensure that all service users access public transport, including rural transport services, if possible.  This is in keeping with the principle of mainstreaming with a clear focus on ensuring persons with a disability have access to the normal range of services and participate in community life as far as possible.  In general, day service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the Free Travel Pass, so there should be no additional cost burden at an individual level.</p>  <p>  When a person cannot avail of a day service because they do not have transport to attend, some transport is provided by disability service providers on a case by case basis and as this relates to a service matter, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-13a.1508.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071300107#WRBB01600"><p><i>A Vision For Change,</i>our national Mental Health Policy, was introduced in 2006. Among its recommendations were that approximately 10,650 Mental Health Whole Time Equivalents were required to fully implement the policy.  The recommendations of <i>A Vision for Change</i>were based on the population figures of the 2002 census (3.9 million) and the total recommended staffing was 10,647. The 2016 population is 4.7 million, and the requirements for staffing should be adjusted to 12,760 for 2016 and a further 1.4% for 2017 totalling 12,778.</p><p>As of April 2017, the HSE Mental Health Division have 9,815 Mental Health Whole Time Equivalents. In addition, there are a further 1000 indirect Whole Time Equivalents staff providing services. There are also approximately 300 being recruited, with more than 700 posts approved and in development from Programme for Government funding. </p><p>The figure of 9,815 Mental Health Whole Time Equivalents, comparable to the 12,778 posts as outlined in adjusted <i>A Vision for Change</i>recommended figures, indicates a gap of 2,963. Using an average figure of &euro;66,000 per Whole Time Equivalent, the additional resources required to fill the gap would be &euro;195.6 million per annum.</p><p>Since 2012, around &euro;115 million has been added to the HSE Mental Health Budget, which totalled &euro;826 million in 2016. Budget 2017 made allowance for an additional &euro;35 million for services to be initiated in 2017. Recognising the time lag in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services, it is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with this increased allocation will be some &euro;15 million.  There will also be a further additional spend of &euro;9.5 million in mental health associated with increased pay rates.  With other minor adjustments, the total budget for mental health in 2017 will be &euro;853.1 million.</p><p>Recruitment to meet the needs of our mental health services is therefore underpinned by the increased Budget Allocations in the National Service Plans of recent years, which have progressed the implementation of A Vision For Change. A Vision for Change came to the end of its 10-year term in 2016 and preparations for a review and updating of policy have been underway since early last year.  In September 2016, an external evidence and expert review was commissioned from WRC Consultants as the first step in determining the parameters of a revision of A Vision for Change. This review was completed on 17 February 2017, and provides evidence to determine the policy direction for a revision of A Vision for Change, both in terms of international best practice and the experience of implementing A Vision for Change. An Oversight Committee will shortly be established to oversee the development of a new policy for mental health based on the outcome of the Expert Review.</p></reply>

A key requirement was that any mental health supports provided would be developed as part of an overall cohesive response to homelessness.  </p>  <p>  This funding was transferred to the HSE in 2016 to mainly fund Supported Temporary, and Long Term Accommodation across 5 different providers (&euro;1.5m million approximately), expansion of In-Reach services (primary care and mental health) to Supported Temporary Accommodation settings (&euro;330,000 approximately) and the expansion of health input into the Housing First Scheme.  The &euro;2 million provided in 2016 will continue to be provided in 2017 onwards to fund these additional services for homeless people with mental health and addiction needs.  </p>  <p>  The HSE National Service Plan 2017 sets out a commitment to improve health outcomes for the most vulnerable in society, including the homeless.  Amongst the priority actions for 2017 are to improve health outcomes for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness, particularly those with addiction and mental health needs, by providing key worker, case management, general practitioner (GP) and nursing services; and to implement the health actions set out in Rebuilding Ireland, Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, on a phased basis, in order to provide the most appropriate primary care and mental health services to those in homeless services and improve their ability to sustain a normal tenancy.</p></reply>

The completed HRB evidence review was published simultaneously on the Department of Health&rsquo;s and the HRB's websites on Wednesday 15 March 2017.  </p>  <p>  This evidence review examines the public funding mechanisms for AHR in different countries.  The review looks at the associated costs and benefits for the funder, provider and patient, the criteria for accessing the public funded service and the basis for these criteria in different jurisdictions.  The review does not indicate a recommendation or preference for a specific funding model; rather it outlines the pros and cons of such funding models, the different aspects of models in different jurisdictions, as well as the different rationales underpinning such funding models.  </p>  <p>  The HRB evidence review will be analysed by officials in my Department in the context of considering policy options for a potential public funding model for AHR treatment.  It should be noted that, any funding model that might ultimately be introduced would need to operate within the broader regulatory framework relating to AHR.  </p>  <p>  Work on the General Scheme of an AHR Bill is well-advanced in my Department and I consider this and the development of policy on public funding for AHR treatment to be a priority for 2017.  </p>  <p>  While IVF treatment is not currently provided by the Irish public health service, there is some support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme. In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the HSE.  Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and approved by the HSE &lsquo;High Tech Liaison Officers&rsquo;.  The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.  </p></reply>

Consultation is taking place with the Attorney General's Office and with other relevant Departments in relation to the provisions in the draft Scheme.  The draft General Scheme will be revised, where deemed necessary, in advance of being submitted for my approval.  </p>  <p>  Once the General Scheme has been completed, a Memo will be submitted to Government seeking approval to draft a Bill based on the General Scheme, as well as permission to publish the General Scheme submitted.  If the Government approves the General Scheme it will be submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health for pre-legislative scrutiny.  </p>  <p>  It is not possible at this time to give a definitive timeline for the completion of the draft Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.

The purpose of this Group was to report on the steps required to introduce, supervise, monitor, and review the wider availability and cost of buprenorphine products.</p>  <p>  The Group's Report in 2016 recommended the phased increased access to Buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine products for a cohort of patients in specific circumstances, subject to the required legislation and resourcing.</p>  <p>  Drafting of legislation is currently being finalised by my Department with technical support from the HSE.  It is expected that this legislation will be finalised in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In 2017 the HSE received additional funding of &euro;0.75 million to increase access to buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine products as an alternative treatment for the identified cohorts of patients for whom methadone treatment is not suitable.</p></reply>

The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders.</p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.</p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under <i>&lsquo;Transforming Lives&rsquo;,</i>the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions.  I welcome the fact that the needs of people moving from congregated settings will be fully taken into account during this process as the model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan.</p><p>At the end of December 2016, less than 2,600 people with a disability were living in congregated settings.  The HSE's 2017 National Service Plan has set a target of 223 to move from institutions in 2017.  This will  ensure that people are able to move out of congregated settings, and into their own homes in the community.  I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres.</p><p>As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on <i>&quot;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion&quot;,</i>I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is also a key building block in the eHealth agenda which is crucial to developing a modern integrated health service.<font color="#1F497D"> </font>Its introduction can also allow the managed improvement of data quality, which in turn can have an impact on patient access to health services.</p><p>On 30 May 2017, I signed the Health Identifiers Act 2014 (Commencement) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 236 of 2017) and the Health Identifiers Act 2014 (Health Services Providers) Regulations 2017 (S.I. No. 237 of 2017).  The main purpose of the Order and Regulations is to facilitate access to the National Individual Health Identifier Register by health services providers and other specified persons and their use of the IHI for the purposes permitted under the Act.  Access to the IHI Register and the use of the IHI is tightly regulated under the Health Identifiers Act 2014 and includes offences provisions.</p><p>As part of the initial phase-in of the Individual Health Identifier, IHI numbers have now been provided to 11 volunteer General Practitioners and an additional 11 further volunteer General Practitioners are scheduled to receive IHI numbers over the next number of weeks.  In addition to the 11 volunteer General Practitioners, the IHI is available in electronic referrals (eReferrals) transmitted from General Practitioners to Hospitals.</p><p>The phase-in plan (2017 to Q1 2018) for the Individual Health Identifier currently includes the provision of IHI numbers as a priority for the PCRS Schemes, the National Radiology System (NIMIS), the National Maternity and New Born Clinical Management System (MN-CMS), the National Laboratory System (MedLIS), the National Epilepsy Electronic Patient record system (Epilepsy EPR), the National Hepatitis C Register and the National Cancer Screening Service.  The IHI Programme is actively engaged in progressing the implementation of the IHI for each of these systems.  The IHI number is also planned to be provided into the first major hospital patient administration system by the end of this year. </p><p>An appropriate business application tool has been developed in the HSE to support the Individual Health Identifier Business Service in its current operational capacity.  Not only does this allow the Individual Health Identifier Business Service to operate, it will also inform the specification of requirements in advance of procuring a subsequent larger scale business application tool required to support the Individual Health Identifier Business Service in an expanded operating environment.  That Individual Health Identifier Business Service now in operation is currently staffed by project team resources with operational processes and procedures designed and implemented by the current business team.</p></reply>

Some of these factors are outside the control of the Health Service Executive. Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care infrastructure is subject to suitable locations being offered / provided / available, to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff. In addition the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to adequate financing.</p></reply>

The Office, launched in December 2016, is overseeing a programme of patient safety measures including progressing a programme of legislation.  This legislative programme will include provision for the open disclosure of patient safety incidents, through the Department of Justice and Equality's Civil Liability Amendment Bill 2017; the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill, which will provide for the mandatory reporting of serious incidents, and a Patient Safety Licensing Bill, which will introduce a regulatory regime for all hospitals as well as certain designated high risk activities. </p>  <p>  In particular, the General Scheme of the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill approved by Government in November 2015 provides for the extension of the Health Information and Quality Authority's (HIQA&rsquo;s) remit to the private sector, mandatory external reporting of Serious Reportable Events and measures to promote clinical audit.  The measures to support clinical audit and patient safety incident notifications in the Bill will help promote a culture of patient safety and build a health service which can identify, respond to and learn from error and monitor and commit to ongoing quality improvement through identifying opportunities for improvement.  The Bill has undergone pre-legislative scrutiny (PLS) with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  The PLS Report was forwarded to the Minister on 15 May and is currently being considered by the Department. </p>  <p>  In addition, HIQA and the Mental Health Commission have recently finalised new 'Standards on the Conduct of Reviews of Patient Safety Incidents' which expand on the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare.  This set of standards along with the mandatory reporting of serious reportable events provided for in the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill and provisions intended for open disclosure will provide a comprehensive patient-centred approach to preventing, managing and learning from incidents.  Finally, the Health Service Executive's (HSE's) Incident Management Framework is currently being revised and will guide staff in system analysis methodology and levels of investigation required to facilitate the learning from adverse events and the prevention of reoccurrence. </p></reply>

These commitments include supporting people with disabilities to maximise their potential, removing barriers which impact on access to services, education, work or health care and providing supports at key transition points in their lives.  The Programme for Government also recognises that persons with disabilities should have more control in accessing services and giving them greater independence and choice to better fit their needs. </p><p>Funding of &euro;1.69 billion was allocated by the Health Service Executive (HSE) for disability services in the 2017 National Service Plan.  The following table outlines the quantum of services to be provided.<table><tr><th>Disability Services Programme: &euro;1.69 billion in 2017</th><th>Quantum of Services</th></tr><tr><td>Residential Services</td><td>9,000 people</td></tr><tr><td>Day Services</td><td>Over 22,000 people</td></tr><tr><td>Respite Residential Support</td><td>182,500 overnights</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Assistant Services</td><td>1.4 million hours</td></tr><tr><td>Home Support Services</td><td>2.75 million hours</td></tr><tr><td>Move from institutions to homes in the community</td><td>223 people</td></tr></table></p><p>In addition, the HSE is committed to protecting front-line services for people with disabilities, with targeted improvement in priority areas:</p><p>- The establishment of a Task Force on Personalised Budgets;</p><p>- The allocation of an additional &euro;10 million in 2017 for the provision of services for 1,500 young people leaving school and rehabilitative training this year;</p><p>- The reconfiguration of residential services, supported by &euro;20 million in capital funding and to be further supported by the Service Reform Fund;</p><p>- Quality improvements to increase compliance with National Standards for Residential Centres for Children and Adults with Disabilities; and</p><p>- Over 2,700 inspections of residential centres for people with disabilities conducted by the Health Information Quality Authority since regulation began in November 2013.</p><p>The Programme for Government is just one component of the wider Government policy in supporting persons with disabilities.  The forthcoming National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, will also form a key part of driving Government policy in this area. The aim of the Strategy is to significantly improve the lives of people with disabilities in a practical sense and to create the best possible opportunities to allow them to fulfil their potential. </p><p>I can assure the House  that the Government's commitments to improving the lives of persons with disability will not end with the publication of the Strategy, and I am committed to ensuring that the Strategy results in real and concrete change for the better for children and adults with disabilities.</p></reply>

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  </p><p>In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services.  These plans have been published and their implementation is ongoing<font color="#001FE2">.  </font>The Inpatient / Daycase and Outpatient Plans<font color="#001FE2"> </font>focus on reducing the number of patients waiting 15 months or more for inpatient and daycase treatment or for an outpatient appointment by the end of October.  The Scoliosis Action Plan aims to ensure that no patient who requires scoliosis surgery will be waiting more than four months for surgery by the end of 2017.  Under these Plans, since early February, over 15,800 patients have come off the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List and nearly 57,000 patients have come off the Outpatient Waiting List.  </p><p>In addition, the NTPF is currently rolling out its Daycase Waiting List Initiative focused on those waiting longest for daycase treatment, with a view to ensuring that in excess of 2,000 patients waiting more than 18 months for a daycase procedure will have received an offer of an appointment for their procedure by the end of June<font color="#0000FF">.</font>The NTPF has advised that to date nearly 3000 patients files have been transferred to private hospitals under this Initiative, close to 900 patients have accepted an offer of treatment in a private hospital and around 400 patients have received their procedure.</p><p>Embedded in all NTPF Initiatives are procedures to report on the type, nature and cost of treatments commissioned, including controls to ensure quality patient treatment, value for money and efficient processes.  My Department has implemented a robust monitoring framework in this regard.</p><p>The NTPF submit regular reports to the Department of Health on the number of patients treated, referring hospitals, treating hospitals, and treatment specialty.  It may not be possible to make specific information on costs in relation to individual private hospitals available due to its commercial sensitivity however, the NTPF provide to the Department financial reports regarding the waiting list initiatives.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-13a.1999.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071300116#WRLL04300"><p>'A Vision for Change', published in 2006, set out a 10-year policy framework for Ireland's mental health services.  It recommended that interventions should be aimed at maximising recovery from mental illness, building on service user and social network resources to achieve meaningful integration and participation in community life. </p><p>The Government is committed to increasing the Mental Health budget annually, as shown by the substantial additional funding of some &euro;115m provided for mental health from 2012 to 2016.  While slower than originally anticipated, progress continues to be made in implementing the Report&rsquo;s recommendations.  The focus in the early years was on the closure of old psychiatric hospitals in favour of community service development.  The implementation of Vision has been given specific priority in recent years with the additional ring-fenced Government funding over the period 2012-17, specifically aimed at modernising mental health services in line with Vision and Programme for Government commitments.  A key focus has been approval of some 1,550 additional posts to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams; enhancing specialist community mental health and forensic services, increasing access to counselling and psychotherapy; and developing suicide prevention initiatives.  These posts are directly facilitating the policy of moving away from traditional institutional based care to a patient-centred, flexible and community based mental health service. Staff recruitment and retention has been a challenge for the HSE for various reasons, with approximately two thirds of these posts filled so far. Recruitment continues and the HSE has also prioritised specialist areas identified in <i>Vision,</i>which were underdeveloped in the past (eg. Eating Disorders, MHID, Forensics, Peri-natal MH). </p><p>The HSE National Service Plans in 2016 and 2017 highlight the broad range of ongoing reforms in mental health services.  Overall, service improvements in recent years have included the continued development of bespoke new facilities better suited to modern mental health care, the development of child and adolescent services, shorter episodes of in-patient care, the adoption of a recovery approach in the delivery of services and the involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health policy, service planning and delivery.  The improvement of services has been aided in large part by the establishment of the HSE Mental Health Division, which was set up in 2014, delivering on a key recommendation of <i>A Vision for Change.</i>This Division carries operational and financial authority and accountability for all mental health services nationally.</p><p>The Department of Health is currently advancing a review of <i>A Vision For Change.</i>Having commissioned an Expert Evidence Review (completed in February 2017), an Oversight Committee will shortly be established to begin the process of updating our mental health policy.</p></reply>

Those patients opting to be treated privately have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital in respect of the services that each provides.  The charges applied in respect of private care in a public hospital relate not only to accommodation costs but also costs associated with non-consultant hospital doctors, nursing staff, medicines, blood, medical and surgical supplies, radiology, diagnostics, operating theatres, laboratories, administration and support staff.</p>  <p>  The operational procedures for the management of patients' treatment preferences and the collection of private inpatient charges are a matter for the HSE in the first instance and I have asked the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this regard.  I am very anxious that the application of these necessary procedures is sensitive to the health status of patients whilst in hospital and wants to ensure that patients do not experience upset at such a difficult time. The Department is therefore working with the HSE to establish what processes are in place across the hospital system for implementing the law in this regard. The Department will work with the HSE to ensure that a consistent approach is taken in implementing the operational procedures and that a monitoring process is put in place.</p></reply>

Amongst the priority actions for 2017 are to improve health outcomes for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness, particularly those with addiction and mental health needs, by providing key worker, case management, general practitioner (GP) and nursing services; and to implement the health actions set out in Rebuilding Ireland, Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, on a phased basis, in order to provide the most appropriate primary care and mental health services to those in homeless services and improve their ability to sustain a normal tenancy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-13a.2152.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071300119#WROO03100"><p>Significant progress has been made on implementation of <i>A Vision for Change</i>, underpinned by the substantial additional funding provided by Government since 2012. The HSE budget for mental health services is over &euro;850m this year for mental health. All aspects of  adult and child and adolescent services are being developed, including acute and community based services, along with  forensic mental health services. Detailed service improvements are reflected each year in the HSE National Service Plans and the HSE Mental Health Division Operational Plans, available on the HSE website. </p><p>The HSE National Forensic Mental Health Service provides specialist forensic services to those referred from the Irish Prison Service, and the Youth Justice Service. It also provides consultation and advice to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Courts Service of Ireland. Every effort is made to ensure that forensics mental health care provision is in accordance with the recommendations of A Vision for Change, including legal considerations and person-centred and recovery-based approaches on an inter-agency basis.</p><p>In relation to Recommendation 15.1.1, all prisoners are medically assessed on committal to prison. This includes a mental health assessment which can be employed to develop an individual care plan. Where clinically indicated, the prisoner is referred to a forensic clinician who, subject to his/her findings, may make certain recommendations to the Governor for the care of the prisoner. Prisoners on release, are entitled to be referred to the HSE  mental health services in the normal way. </p><p>In regard to 15.1.2, the National Forensic Mental Health Service (NFMHS) at the Central Mental Hospital (CMH) at Dundrum provides a Mental Health Prison In-Reach and Court Diversion Service (PICLS) programme to the Irish Prison Service . The diversion system ensures as far as possible that those people presenting before the courts, or indeed at an earlier stage of the criminal justice system, where the infraction is a reflection of an underlying mental illness, are referred and treated appropriately. This approach has reduced the number of mentally ill people committed to prison, under sentence. An Interdepartmental Group is looking at what further improvements can be made on the issue of persons with mental illness and their interaction with the Criminal Justice System. </p><p>The recommendation reflected  in 15.1.3 refers to increasing community based forensic mental  health teams. Full multi-disciplinary teams are being developed for Castlerea, Limerick and Cork prisons.  <i></i></p><p>Planning permission for a new modern Forensic mental health facility in Portrane to replace the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, was granted in June 2015. Phase 1 of the project comprises of a new 120 bed hospital, as reflected in Recommendation 15.1.4, along with a new 10 bed Child and Adolescent Mental Health unit (Recommendation 15.1.6) and a new 10 bed Mental Health Intellectual Disability unit (Recommendation 15.1.7). Construction has recently commenced on site, to include a new 30 bed Intensive Care Rehabilitation Unit, with a view to the new facilities coming on-stream in early 2020. </p><p>In relation to 15.1.5 , there are a number of prison based multi-disciplinary groups that provide information and support in the area of mental health to prisoners. There are consultant-led forensic mental health in-reach teams in all the prisons in Ireland at present. The Irish Prison Service (IPS) is seeking to advance a robust system that would see integration and further development of services with statutory and voluntary partners. Mental health service provision in prisons must form part of the overall community response to this cohort of prisoners. Current arrangements with the Central Mental Hospital are a good example of collaborative working. In addition to healthcare input, the IPS Psychology Service provide ongoing evidence informed therapeutic approaches to those referred to the service who are suffering from mental health difficulties.</p><p>The implementation of Recommendations 15.1.8 and 15.1.9 are being progressed on a joint basis by the health and judicial systems. This involves, for example, the HSE National Forensic Mental Health service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service. The NFMHS provides regular training to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda training college at Templemore also delivers training as part of the training of all new Garda trainees. The Forensic service provides an advisory service to the Garda negotiation team, and has established links to local Garda&iacute;. Structured links to Divisional Garda&iacute; level are also being developed. Good progress has been made in recent years on the specific recommendations, arising from the significant additional funding given to mental health, including the modernisation of the NFMHS and by progressing the work of the Inter Departmental Group on those with mental health issues coming into contact with the criminal justice system.</p></reply>

This includes patients who were regraded from a voluntary patient to an involuntary patient. Every tribunal is made up of a chairperson, a consultant psychiatrist and a lay-person and adults receive free legal representation.</p><p>It is important to emphasise that Section 28 of the Mental Health Act 2001 obliges the consultant psychiatrist responsible for the patient to revoke an order where they become of the opinion that the patient is no longer suffering from a mental disorder as defined in the Act. However, even if an order is revoked before a Mental Health Tribunal, the patient is written to and offered a hearing and the patient's legal representative will advise them in relation to this. The Mental Health Commission has noted an increase in the uptake of Section 28 hearings in 2017, however, statistics on same have not yet been collated. I will ask the Mental Health Commission to collate these figures and I will pass them on to the Deputy when they are provided to me.</p></reply>

This report identified a number of  recommendations, which were directed at a variety of organisations. </p><p>In relation to the health sector, the report for example advocated a programme of appropriate training, provided on a regular basis, to staff in contact with people experiencing serious financial difficulty, and particularly highlighted the benefits of SafeTALK and ASIST training. This training continues to be available, with the National Office for Suicide Prevention involved in a range of training initiatives around suicide prevention and mental health promotion. The National Office for Suicide Prevention has responsibility for coordination of the national education and training plan associated with <i>Connecting for Life</i>, our national strategy to reduce suicide 2015-2020. As part of this, they are responsible for delivering awareness training programmes prioritising professionals and volunteers across community-based organisations; providing community-based organisations with guidelines, protocols and training on suicide prevention; and delivering training in suicide prevention to staff involved in the delivery of relevant services. Since 2004, over 70,000 adults have received free training in suicide prevention through the ASIST and SafeTALK programmes. SafeTALK training is suitable for everyone over 18 years of age who wants to help prevent suicide and become suicide alert, and is delivered on request. HSE Regional Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention can be contacted in relation to this or to find out more information about available training.</p><p>The report also suggests further awareness and information on mental health would be useful. There are a range of such initiatives in place, such as the publication of &lsquo;Concerned about Suicide&rsquo;, a suicide prevention leaflet, and mental health information and anti-stigma campaigns such as the 'Green Ribbon' and 'Little Things' campaigns. It also suggests the creation of a leaflet with basic information on mental health (including definitions/descriptions of different disorders) for the financial services sector. A separate Parliamentary Question the Deputy submitted today on this latter issue has been sent to the HSE for direct reply, as this is a specific operational matter.</p></reply>

This independent clinical review was completed by Dr Niall Herity, a highly respected, Belfast-based NHS cardiologist. I consider that Dr Herity's approach to the analysis and interpretation of the available evidence was independent, thorough and scientifically robust and took account of best international practice and guidance.  Accordingly, I have accepted Dr Herity's findings and recommendations in their entirety.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific query regarding the estimated construction and operation costs of a second catheterisation laboratory at University Hospital Waterford, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that, while Dr Herity found that the needs of the effective catchment population of UHW can be accommodated in a single cath lab, he recommended increased investment in cardiology services at the hospital.  Additional funding of  &euro;0.5m has been provided to UHW in 2017 which will enable the hospital to provide 2 additional cath lab sessions (8 hours) per week.   A procurement process is also in train for the provision of a temporary mobile cath lab at the hospital.

Alongside other recommendations, it advocated:</p>  <p>  - A holistic view of mental illness and an integrated multidisciplinary approach to addressing the biological, psychological and social factors that contribute to mental health problems;</p>  <p>  - A move away from traditional institutional-based care to a patient-centred, flexible and community based mental health service;</p>  <p>  - A person-centred treatment approach which addresses each of these elements through an integrated care plan, reflecting best practice, evolved and agreed with both service users and their carers.</p>  <p>   The HSE provides a comprehensive range of community-based mental health services, which include out-patient care: out-patient clinics (clients referred by GPs), day hospitals, day centres, home visits from the mental health team, referral to clinical psychological services, referral to addiction counselling services, access to social work or occupational therapy services and referral back to your GP for continuous care. In-patient care, often of short duration, is provided with a view of achieving recovery as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  Admissions to such units would be based on various factors such as professional assessment, the wishes of the person involved and their families, availability of services, etc. In addition, all approved residential mental health centres are subject to strict inspection criteria by the Mental Health Commission, that promote the highest possible standards of safety and quality care.

The increased investment in mental health services over the last number of years has helped to facilitate an increase in the number and staffing levels of both Adult, and Children &amp;amp; Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams.

Among its recommendations were that approximately 10,650 Mental Health Whole Time Equivalents were required to fully implement the policy.  The recommendations of <i>A Vision for Change</i>were based on the population figures of the 2002 census (3.9 million) and the total recommended staffing was 10,647.  The 2016 population is 4.7 million, and the requirements for staffing should be adjusted to 12,760 for 2016 and a further 1.4% for 2017 totalling 12,778.</p><p>As of April 2017, the HSE Mental Health Division have 9,815 Mental Health Whole Time Equivalents.  In addition, there are a further 1000 indirect Whole Time Equivalents staff providing services.  There are also approximately 300 being recruited, with more than 700 posts approved and in development from Programme for Government funding. </p><p>The figure of 9,815 Mental Health Whole Time Equivalents, comparable to the 12,778 posts as outlined in adjusted <i>A Vision for Change</i>recommended figures, indicates a gap of 2,963.  Using an average figure of &euro;66,000 per Whole Time Equivalent, the additional resources required to fill the gap would be &euro;195.6 million per annum.</p><p>Since 2012, around &euro;115 million has been added to the HSE Mental Health Budget, which totalled &euro;826 million in 2016.  Budget 2017 made allowance for an additional &euro;35 million for services to be initiated in 2017.  Recognising the time lag in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services, it is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with this increased allocation will be some &euro;15 million.  There will also be a further additional spend of &euro;9.5 million in mental health associated with increased pay rates.  With other minor adjustments, the total budget for mental health in 2017 will be &euro;853.1 million.</p><p>Recruitment to meet the needs of our mental health services is therefore underpinned by the increased Budget Allocations in the National Service Plans of recent years, which have progressed the implementation of A Vision For Change.  A Vision for Change came to the end of its 10-year term in 2016 and preparations for a review and updating of policy have been underway since early last year.  In September 2016, an external evidence and expert review was commissioned from WRC Consultants as the first step in determining the parameters of a revision of A Vision for Change.  This review was completed on 17 February 2017, and provides evidence to determine the policy direction for a revision of A Vision for Change, both in terms of international best practice and the experience of implementing A Vision for Change.  An Oversight Committee will shortly be established to oversee the development of a new policy for mental health based on the outcome of the Expert Review.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>The Scheme has a budget of &euro;940 million in 2017, providing support to just over 23,600 people by the end of the year with a waiting time for funding not expected to exceed four weeks this year.  This equates to an approximate cost of care of almost &euro;40,000 per person in 2017.  However, it should be noted that any estimation of the cost of universal free nursing home care would depend on a number of factors, including demand for long-term residential care at any particular point in time; changes in population health status; changes in the cost of care; possible new models of care of older people in the future; and the average length of stay of residents in long-term residential care facilities.  </p><p>It is also important to note that there are residents in long-term residential care facilities who are privately funding their own care i.e. they are not in receipt of state support under the NHSS.  </p><p>Furthermore, the NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p><p>-  Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;</p><p>-  Bed and board;</p><p>-  Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of everyday living;</p><p>-  Laundry service.</p><p>An estimated cost of services provided by nursing home providers and which are not covered under the NHSS basket of services is not available.</p><p>As such, it is not possible to provide an estimated annual cost of introducing universal free nursing home care.</p></reply>

All expectant mothers who are ordinarily resident in Ireland are eligible to avail of services under the scheme.  Women who choose to avail of these services are under the care of both a general practitioner of their choice and a hospital obstetrician.  Care can be obtained from any general practitioner who has a contract for the provision of services under the scheme.  The scheme provides for 12 ante-natal visits &ndash; six to the general practitioner and six to the chosen maternity unit/hospital in the case of a first pregnancy.  In subsequent pregnancies, there are seven visits to the general practitioner and five to the maternity unit/hospital.  There are also two post-natal visits to the general practitioner &ndash; at two weeks for the baby and at six weeks for mother and baby. </p>  <p>  Action 63 of The National Maternity Strategy &ndash; Creating a Better Future Together 2016-2026 commits the HSE to ensure "...a review of the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme is undertaken, and any necessary adaptations made, to reflect the new Model of Care proposed in this Strategy." </p>  <p>  As the questions relate to clinical issues, they have been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Discussions have been led by the Secretary General, and have, I am advised, been very constructive to date.  </p>  <p>  The discussions have also been very comprehensive and have taken somewhat longer than originally anticipated.  As the discussions are not yet concluded, the Deputy will appreciate that it would be premature for me to disclose any great detail at this stage.  However, I can confirm that it will be necessary to draw up a detailed legal agreement between the parties which will require further engagement with SVHG, NMH and the Department.  It is my intention to bring the terms of the proposed agreement, in due course, to Government prior to approval.</p>  <p>  With regard to the governance arrangements for the new hospital, the terms of the Mulvey agreement provide for the establishment of a new company - "The National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC (limited by shares)&rdquo;.  As that agreement was essentially a framework agreement, further work is required to define and clarify issues in the context of the establishment of the new DAC.  However it is clear, that the new company will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-13a.2468.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071300125#WRUU00700"><p>Ireland is not unique in the participation of voluntary organisations, including those with religious involvement, in the delivery of publicly funded healthcare.  However, it is proper that the frameworks within which service providers operate in delivering publicly funded health services are subject to on-going consideration.</p>  <p>  In recent years, the nature of the relationship between voluntary organisations and the State has been clarified in a number of ways.  The HSE operates a robust Governance Framework which governs grant-funding provided to all Non-Statutory Service Providers and provides for detailed service level agreements.  In the voluntary sector, it is required practice for public capital investment to be accompanied by a lien which protects the State's interest.  All public hospitals are inspected by HIQA and are subject to national clinical standards and guidelines. These arrangements and controls are what are paramount in ensuring high quality care and patient safety, robust operational and clinical governance, and value for State investments. </p>  <p>  I recognise that there are different and evolving views on the ownership and governance of publicly funded healthcare facilities.  The recent debate around the location of the National Maternity Hospital has generated increased discussions in recent months on these issues.  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that the Religious Sisters of Charity have announced they are relinquishing their ownership of, and involvement with, the St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group. I can assure the Deputy that the St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group has directly briefed my officials on this decision. </p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, I believe it is now timely to consider more broadly the role of voluntary organisations in the public healthcare system. I intend that this will be an inclusive process of consideration and will provide an opportunity for views from all interested parties. It is my intention to bring proposals to Government shortly. </p>  <p>  This process can be expected to raise a broad range of complex policy issues that will need to be addressed on into the future and therefore can, rightfully, be expected to take some time.</p></reply>

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE has extensive information concerning Lyme disease on its website <i>. </i></p><p>Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination. The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection. These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease. The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other similar bacteria, and certain other viral infections, including glandular fever.  In addition, blood samples from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results. Samples giving positive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests. Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity.  Using this two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme. </p><p>All clinical (and other) laboratories in Ireland must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the diagnostics they provide is maintained at the highest international level for human diagnostics. Some laboratories abroad do not use antibody tests like the EIA (screening ELISA test) and Western Blot and instead will use other types of tests, for example, testing for levels of a specific white blood cell (CD-57) or lymphocyte transformation tests (tests to measure how specific cells in a person's immune system respond when exposed to antigens against Borrelia burgdorferi - the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease).  These types of tests are not currently recommended by international groups for a number of reasons:</p><p>1.  There is not enough scientific evidence that they are suitable tests to diagnose Lyme disease;</p><p>2.  There is no standard method to perform and interpret these kind of tests; and</p><p>3.  Positive results in these kinds of tests may be due to other illnesses or conditions and not just Borrelia infection.</p><p>The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC, the Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland, the Irish Society of Clinical Microbiologists, the Irish Institute of Clinical Neuroscience and the Irish College of General Practitioners agreed a Consensus Statement on the Clinical Management of Lyme Borreliosis, which endorsed the previously referenced, internationally recognised set of guidelines (those of the IDSA) to Medical Practitioners to ensure a standardised approach to the diagnosis and management of Lyme disease in Ireland.  </p><p>The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency, an Environmental Health Officer and, very importantly, a representative from Tick Talk Ireland, the primary Support Group for Lyme disease in Ireland. </p><p>The initial work of the Lyme Borreliosis Sub-committee involved a survey of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, the development of Lyme borreliosis guidance for general practitioners, the publication of medical media articles to highlight diagnostics and laboratory methods relating to Lyme borreliosis available in Ireland. Material has been produced which is aimed both at the general public and General Practitioners.  </p><p>There is extensive information for the public and health professionals on the HPSC website. This information for the public includes:</p><p>-  Lyme Disease Frequently Asked Questions;</p><p>-  Laboratory testing for Lyme Disease: FAQs for general public; </p><p>-  Lyme Disease Illustrations; and</p><p>-  CDC's instructions on how to remove a tick.</p><p>There is significant support and information for health professionals on the HPSC website. These supports include a fact sheet on tick borne diseases, including Lyne Disease. This fact sheet gives information on clinical  the disease, transmission routes, prevention measures, diagnosis, and management and treatment. There is also an erythema migrans (EM) diagnostic tool to aid health professionals in the diagnosis of EM, which is frequently the earliest clinical manifestation of Lyme borreliosis. </p><p>The Deputy refers to guidelines issued by the Centre for Disease Control in the USA.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on guidelines used in other countries.</p></reply>

Critical to the success of this clinical programme is the consolidation and further development of close working relationships between the Emergency Department clinical team, mental health liaison staff and Community Mental Health teams and GP services. </p>  <p>  The objectives of this programme are to improve the assessment and management of all individuals who present to an Emergency Department with self-harm, reduce rates of repeated self-harm; improve access to appropriate interventions at times of personal crisis; ensure rapid and timely linkage to appropriate follow-up care, and optimise the experience of families and carers in trying to support those who present with self-harm.</p>  <p>  Following clinical assessment of a person who presents to an Emergency Department following self-harm, a decision with regard to ongoing treatment of the individual is required. This may indicate admission to a general hospital if physical care is required.  If significant mental health considerations are clinically identified, referral to mental health services in accordance with the criteria set out in the Mental Health Acts may be appropriate. </p>  <p>  Alternatively, the individual could be referred to appropriate primary care services and supports.  All such clinical decisions are set out in the Discharge and Management Plan &ndash; Emergency Care Plan developed with and given to the patient and family/friend (with consent).  </p>  <p>  In general, the HSE Service Plan, including that for Mental Health, stresses the need for more person-centred and responsive care. In addition, significant progress has been made in recent years to improve the infrastructure of health facilities including Emergency Departments.</p></reply>

Department policy has been informed by this Report and while considering it, the Department of Health has supported greater voluntary self-regulation of complementary therapy.

I recently concluded a public consultation on my proposal to regulate counsellors generally under the Act. On foot of the consultation process, I decided last month to proceed with the designation of two distinct professions, that of counsellor and psychotherapist.

The criteria that are checked on application forms relate mainly to the competencies and skills necessary to become a member of the Board.

Following the decision by the IFA to end their occupation of my Department's Headquarters in Dublin I, along with my Department Officials, met with the IFA on Wednesday 12 July to discuss all aspects of a support measure for those cereal growers worst affected by the 2016 harvest conditions.  These discussions are continuing with a further meeting planned. </p><p>However, as I stated at yesterday's meeting we must ensure that this measure covers as many as possible of those growers that need the help the most, and it must be done within the confines of the allocated budget.  While some growers undoubtedly lost more that others, both in terms of area but also as a proportion of their harvest, we have to be very mindful that more support for some farmers would mean less for others.  The final shape of the measure must find the correct balance in this regard. </p><p>I wish to confirm to the Deputy  my commitment and support to the Tillage sector through the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo; and last month I welcomed the release of preliminary information from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) regarding its uptake. </p><p>The banks advise that all of the remaining &euro;150m is committed and is in the process of being drawn down. I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers, including tillage farmers, to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.  I have met with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other access to finance issues relating to the agrifood sector.  I have asked the banks to respond positively to the demand that has been demonstrated by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.  Implementation of this Scheme is subject to the provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1408/2013 (de minimis aid in the agricultural production sector).  Support provided under the de minimis regulation complies with State Aid rules in the agriculture sector and does not require prior approval by the EU Commission.</p><p>As a further support to tillage farmers I also introduced the Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II which opened for online applications on 8 March 2017.  The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.  This Tillage Scheme is the latest of the Targeted Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  The Scheme is co-funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).  All applications must be made on-line, either by the farmer or by an adviser authorised to act on his or her behalf.  The closing date for applications under the first tranche of the new scheme was Friday 30 June 2017.  The second tranche is currently open.  There was a significant level of interest in investments under this measure with a total number of 490 applications received in the first tranche.  The GLAS scheme has seen a significant uptake, with measures such as green cover, minimum tillage and wild bird cover proving popular with the tillage sector.</p><p>As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, up to &euro;1.187 billion has been paid out under the Basic Payment Scheme to 124,222 farmers with payments ongoing.  Payments of &euro;202.4 million<b></b>have also been made to 94,605 applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme.</p></reply>

However, given the very significant potential implications for the Irish agrifood sector, I have made it very clear that our key asks from the negotiations are:</p>  <p>  -  continued unfettered access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures;</p>  <p>  -  to minimise the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries prohibit the UK market from engaging in trade agreements third countries, for example by having the EU and UK move forward in parallel on trade policy after Brexit; and</p>  <p>  -  in fisheries, we want to maintain current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal and protect Ireland&rsquo;s quota share for joint fish stocks. </p>  <p>  In the meantime I, my Department and our Agencies have been engaging in a process of analysis, consultation and engagement so that we are best placed to both influence the negotiations and also to deal with whatever outcome the negotiations present.</p>  <p>  I have already put in place measures to mitigate the short-term impacts arising from the fall in the value of sterling against the euro.  These include the &euro;150 million low interest agri-loan scheme and additional funding to Bord Bia to allow it to support businesses most severely impacted by these currency effects, including through its new Brexit Barometer service.</p>  <p>  From a longer-term perspective, my Department is continuing to deepen its analysis of the potential implications of Brexit arising from, for example, tariffs on trade, border controls and certification, and divergence in regulations and standards between the UK and the EU.  We have also intensified our consultations with the industry through the Stakeholder Consultative Committee and the All-Island Civic Dialogue process.  And we have engaged comprehensively with our Member State counterparts, with the Commission and with the Barnier Task Force in order to ensure that the implications for the agrifood sector are fully understood and remain at the top of the EU agenda. </p>  <p>  We have also been putting significant effort into our market diversification work with the aim of reducing our dependence on the UK market for agrifood exports.  For example, I have led trade missions recently to South East Asia, the Gulf region, and to the United States and Mexico in order to develop market opportunities, and further missions will be undertaken during the remainder of 2017.</p>  <p>  While I am still hopeful that the outcome of the negotiations will be positive for both the EU and the UK, I and my Department will continue to remain very focused on supporting the agrifood industry through the challenges ahead. </p></reply>

To the end of June there have been 3,672 loan drawdowns amounting to a total of &euro;117,308,197, an average loan amount of &euro;31,947. Some 59% of the loans are for terms of 4 years or more.  The SBCI have provided a regional rather than a county breakdown and it shows the amount drawn down in each region.  They have also provided a sectoral breakdown.</p><p>Normal bank lending criteria applies to the Scheme and the terms and conditions of each individual loan are agreed between the bank and the applicant according to the purpose of the loans and the circumstances of the farming enterprise.  The banks do not report specific information on refusals but have stated that it is in line with their normal loan refusal rates.</p><p>The banks advise that all of the remaining &euro;150m is committed and is in the process of being drawn down.  In line with the time limits imposed by the Regulation governing the EU contribution, it is expected that all of these loans will be drawn down by the end of September. The breakdown between the banks of the total &euro;150 million available is:</p><p>-  Bank of Ireland &euro;65 million</p><p>-  Allied Irish Bank &euro;60 million</p><p>-  Ulster Bank &euro;25 million.</p><p>The banks will be paid for the interest rate subsidy according to the various loan amounts and terms, although to date no payments have been made to the banks.</p><p>I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.  I have met with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other access to finance issues relating to the agrifood sector.  I have asked the banks to respond positively to the demand that has been demonstrated by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.</p><p>More detailed figures and analysis will be available once the Scheme has been fully drawn down and all reporting is finalised.</p><p>SBCI Agriculture Cashflow Support Scheme - end of June 2017</p><p>Summary of loan terms, numbers and size<table><tr><th>Loan Term</th><th>Totals<br /><br />&euro;</th><th>% of Funds</th><th>No. of Loans</th><th>Average Loan Size <br /><br />&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>1 year</td><td>30,370,916</td><td>26%</td><td>1,115</td><td>27,238</td></tr><tr><td>2 years</td><td>10,326,163</td><td>9%</td><td>508</td><td>20,327</td></tr><tr><td>3 years</td><td>7,786,651</td><td>7%</td><td>375</td><td>20,764</td></tr><tr><td>4 years</td><td>14,259,538</td><td>12%</td><td>453</td><td>31,478</td></tr><tr><td>5 years</td><td>32,337,715</td><td>27%</td><td>852</td><td>37,955</td></tr><tr><td>6 years</td><td>22,227,214</td><td>19%</td><td>369</td><td>60,236</td></tr><tr><td>TOTALS</td><td>117,308,196</td><td>100%</td><td>3,672</td><td>31,947</td></tr><tr><td>Summary</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt; 4 years</td><td>68,824,467</td><td>59%</td><td>1,674</td><td>43,223</td></tr><tr><td>2-3 years</td><td>18,112,814</td><td>15%</td><td>883</td><td>20,546</td></tr><tr><td>1 year</td><td>30,370,916</td><td>26%</td><td>1,115</td><td>27,238</td></tr></table></p><p>Summary by Sector<table><tr><th>Sector</th><th>Totals <br /><br />&euro;</th><th>% of funds</th><th>No. of Loans</th><th>Average Loan size <br /><br />&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Dairy</td><td>49,893,145</td><td>43%</td><td>1,358</td><td>36,740</td></tr><tr><td>Beef</td><td>48,653,826</td><td>41%</td><td>1,788</td><td>27,211</td></tr><tr><td>Sheep</td><td>2,597,000</td><td>2%</td><td>127</td><td>20,449</td></tr><tr><td>Pigs</td><td>1,509,000</td><td>1%</td><td>18</td><td>83,833</td></tr><tr><td>Tillage</td><td>7,739,465</td><td>7%</td><td>168</td><td>46,068</td></tr><tr><td>Horticulture</td><td>878,500</td><td>1%</td><td>11</td><td>79,864</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>6,037,261</td><td>5%</td><td>202</td><td>29,887</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>117,308,197</td><td>100%</td><td>3,672</td><td>31,947</td></tr><tr><td>Summary</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Livestock &amp;amp; Dairy</td><td>102,652,971</td><td>88%</td><td>3,291</td><td>168,234</td></tr><tr><td>Non-Livestock</td><td>14,655,226</td><td>12%</td><td>381</td><td>155,819</td></tr></table></p><p>Summary by Region<table><tr><th>Region</th><th>Totals<br /><br /> &euro;</th><th>% of Funds</th></tr><tr><td>IE011 - Border</td><td>16,849,850</td><td>14%</td></tr><tr><td>IE012 - Midland</td><td>13,187,568</td><td>11%</td></tr><tr><td>IE013 - West</td><td>13,208,528</td><td>11%</td></tr><tr><td>IE021 - Dublin</td><td>285,000</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>IE022 - Mid-East</td><td>10,116,286</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>IE023 - Mid-West</td><td>18,374,142</td><td>16%</td></tr><tr><td>IE024 - South-East (IE)</td><td>19,534,871</td><td>17%</td></tr><tr><td>IE025 - South-West (IE)</td><td>25,751,952</td><td>22%</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>117,308,196</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>Summary</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Border, Midlands and West</td><td>43,245,946</td><td>37%</td></tr><tr><td>Non-BMW</td><td>74,062,251</td><td>63%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations,  spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation,  human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectorial recommendations. </p>  <p>  The implementation process for any strategy is vital for its success. I chair the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC), with high level  representatives from all the relevant Departments and State agencies.  The committee reviews progress on detailed actions on a quarterly basis, in order to identify and solve problems quickly. Stakeholders regularly present to the committee meetings on their priorities for particular  sectors or themes and by the end of this year, the HLIC will have  reviewed in detail progress on the five cross-cutting themes and the  eleven individual sectors outlined in Food Wise 2025. </p>  <p>  In light of the UK vote to leave the EU, Brexit has been included as a standard  item on the agenda of each meeting of the HLIC. It is clear that driving the implementation of the Food Wise recommendations, particularly those related to market development, competitiveness and innovation, will  assume even greater importance in the light of the UK decision.</p>  <p>  I launched the second annual progress report of Food Wise 2025, Steps to Success 2017, on 5th July 2017. Steps to Success 2017 outlines what the Department and its agencies have achieved in year one and what they plan to achieve over the next 12 months.  </p>  <p>  Of the 368 actions that were due to commence by 2017 or are ongoing actions, there has been good progress to date:</p>  <p>  -  46% of the actions have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken.</p>  <p>  -  49% of the actions have commenced and are progressing. </p>  <p>  -  3% of the actions are at commencement stage with the expectation that they will be achieved in the timeframe associated with them.</p>  <p>  -  2% actions have not yet commenced.

The farmer experiencing the disease breakdown chooses a Valuer from this panel and my Department provides the Valuer with weekly guideline summary prices.   It is important that Valuers have access to up-to-date prices for use as a reference when valuing the current market value of animals. Under the terms of the TB Eradication Scheme, for purposes of livestock valuations of reactor animals &ldquo;Market Value&rdquo; is defined as the equivalent price which might reasonably have been obtained for the animal at the time of determination of compensation from a purchaser in an open market if the animal was not affected by TB or was not being removed as part of a depopulation under the disease eradication programme.</p>  <p>  The prices compiled for breeding stock, both pedigree and non-pedigree, are based on prices collected by my Department officials at premier, dispersal, reduction and other special sales throughout the country.  Each animal is evaluated individually and all of their details including age, breed, lactation number, pedigree, milk yield, overall merit (quality) etc, and their price is recorded and entered into a database to generate the weekly summary prices. Guideline prices for non-breeding/non pedigree beef stock are based on prices collected by Department Officials at 7 representative marts throughout the country (Bandon, Ennis, Kilkenny, Tullamore, Roscommon, Carnaross and Balla).  The main factors affecting the quality of these types of animals are conformation, breeding, growth rate and development for age and as in the case of breeding stock, the details are recorded into the database used to generate the weekly summary prices. </p>  <p>  An appeals process exists that provides for a second valuation to be conducted, by a different Valuer, where the first one is rejected by either the farmer or my Department.  In cases where this appeal valuation is itself rejected by either party the case may be referred to an independent Arbitration Panel for final ruling. The relatively small number of valuations appealed by farmers annually indicates that farmers are satisfied that they were getting the correct market value for their cattle.  In 2016, 3,958 individual valuations were carried out and of this only 59 (1.4%) were appealed by herdowners. </p>  <p>  My Department reserves the right to and indeed we are obliged to monitor the performance of these Valuers to ensure that all valuations carried out are in line with the prices for similar animals being offered in the market place. This is to ensure that both exchequer and EU funds are properly disbursed.   Officials of my Department refer to the Valuers Code of Practice to deal with the small number of Valuations which are non-compliant with the guidelines of the scheme. </p>  <p>  An EU audit of the financial transactions under the TB Eradication Programme found that the prices being paid for reactor animals were fair and were in fact, in line with market prices.  It should also be noted that for high merit animals the Valuer has discretion to value an animal above the guideline prices as long as the Valuer can justify and support the decision with sufficient documentary evidence. </p>  <p>  My Department is continuously evaluating the efficiencies of the scheme to ensure we offer the most accurate market price information.</p></reply>

Greencore, the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota, availed of this voluntary scheme, dismantled its facilities and ceased production in 2006. Ireland secured &euro;353million as part of the reform package of which &euro;220million went to beet growers, &euro;127million to Greencore and &euro;6million to machinery contractors.</p>  <p>  In 2011 my Department officials met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies into the possibility of establishing a new sugar and bioethanol production facility, using sugar beet, in this country. The figures published by the interested groups who are investigating the possibility of building a new facility, indicate that the overall capital costs involved could range from &euro;250million to &euro;400million, depending on what type of facility will be constructed. </p>  <p>  My Department officials have informed both groups at the time and many times since that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility in Ireland, would have to be a viable commercial proposition, and supported by a sufficiently robust business case in order to attract the funding from investors for the very substantial capital investment required. My Government colleague Minister Coveney informed both groups at the time that it was his job to look for agreement at EU level to allow for the growing of sugar beet for the manufacture of sugar, at the earliest possible date. </p>  <p>  In this connection, he secured agreement as part of the overall CAP reform package at the final EU Council of Agriculture Ministers, which he chaired in June 2013, to abolish all sugar quotas by 30 September 2017. This agreement removes, with effect from 1 October 2017, the current EU quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member State, wishing to re-establish a sugar industry. </p>  <p>  The current Programme for a Partnership Government makes clear that &ldquo;State enterprise bodies will be asked to examine any substantial business plans related to rebuilding the industry with a view to considering appropriate State supports&rdquo; It is now up to those interested parties to move the project forward and to garner sufficient commercial and financial support to turn their plans into a viable reality.</p></reply>

A note informing industry of the changes to export checks was issued on 27th March. The Department provides livestock marts with real-time data from the AIM system indicating whether or not the animal is eligible for EU export markets, and this takes into account the 30-day residency period requirement. It is the responsibility of the marts to display accurately the information provided to it by AIM.</p>  <p>  I called a meeting with live exporters earlier this year at which I stressed that my Department considers the live export sector to be of great importance, particularly given Brexit and the expansion of the dairy herd. At that meeting the 30-day residency period came up for discussion.  A small number of minor technical and other anomalies were highlighted by exporters when the pre-export check was modified and have since been addressed; the new arrangements are operating with minimal disruption.  The ongoing search for new third country markets is a priority for my Department and I welcome the fact that exports of live cattle to date in 2017 have increased by more than 40% compared to the same period last year.</p></reply>

This is because it could theoretically benefit supported generators/suppliers in Ireland by imposing a levy on all electricity supplied including that imported from another Member State, thereby discriminating in favour of generators/suppliers in one Member State, potentially distorting competition and affecting trade between Member States.</p>  <p>  Therefore a kWh charge is not possible under EU law in these circumstances whereas a flat charge based on the connection level is permitted.</p>  <p>  The European Commission has made similar ruling for the PSO levy in notification approvals in respect of the original PSO scheme (C (2001) 3265) and also in respect of renewable support schemes (C (2002) 2 and C (2002) 5).</p></reply>

To support the delivery of this ambition, my Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030.</p><p>In July 2015, my Department published the first Technology Review consultation on a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and over 800 submissions were received.  Following this, in December 2016, my Department appointed consultants to carry out an independent evidence based economic appraisal to underpin the proposed new RESS.  This appraisal is on going, and involves comparing the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies including Solar Photovoltaic (PV), both ground mounted and rooftop, Offshore Wind, Onshore Wind, Ocean Energy including Tidal and Wave technologies, and various Bioenergy technologies including Biomass Combustion, Biomass CHP, Anaerobic Digestion CHP, Sewage Gas, BioGas and Waste to Energy.</p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that some of these technologies are more market ready and cost effective than others, all technologies that are being appraised will remain open for consideration under a range of scenarios until a final decision on the scheme design is made.</p><p>The economic appraisal is being undertaken to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The appraisal also includes analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines. </p><p>It is important to note that the Energy and Environment State Aid Guidelines, applicable from 2014 to 2020, will significantly limit the design options for the proposed new RESS.  The guidelines indicate that all RES-E support levels must be set through competitive bidding processes and RES-E support should be set via a Feed in Premium payment as opposed to flat tariff structures that have been implemented in Ireland to date.</p><p>My Department will publish a final public consultation on the design principles of the new RESS this month.  Following the outcome of this public consultation, and before any new scheme is introduced, it will need to secure Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission.  Subject to this, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in 2018.</p><p>In terms of the costs associated with supporting renewable electricity technologies, the table below sets out the current Renewable Electricity Feed In Tariff (REFIT) rates for 2017. </p><p>Tariff per MWh (&euro;)<table><tr><th>REFIT 1</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>Large onshore wind (above 5MW)</td><td>69.72</td></tr><tr><td>Small onshore wind (equal to or less than 5MW)</td><td>72.167</td></tr><tr><td>Hydro</td><td>88.068</td></tr><tr><td>Biomass Landfill Gas</td><td>85.622</td></tr><tr><td>Other Biomass</td><td>88.068</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>REFIT 2</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>Large onshore wind (above 5MW)</td><td>69.72</td></tr><tr><td>Small onshore wind (equal to or less than 5MW)</td><td>72.137</td></tr><tr><td>Hydro</td><td>88.068</td></tr><tr><td>Biomass Landfill Gas</td><td>85.622</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>REFIT 3</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>Biomass Combustion</td><td>89.314</td></tr><tr><td>Biomass Combustion - Energy Crops</td><td>99.822</td></tr><tr><td>Large Biomass CHP (above 1500kW)</td><td>126.091</td></tr><tr><td>Small Biomass CHP (equal to or less than 1500kW)</td><td>147.106</td></tr><tr><td>Large AD Non CHP (above 500 kW)</td><td>105.076</td></tr><tr><td>Small AD Non CHP (equal to or less than 500 kW)</td><td>115.583</td></tr><tr><td>Large AD CHP (above 500kW)</td><td>136.598</td></tr><tr><td>Small AD CHP (equal to or less than 500kW)</td><td>157.613</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  </p>  <p>  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5 bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  </p>  <p>  There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4 m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. </p>  <p>  In April, eir signed an agreement with me committing them to follow through on their commercial plans to provide new high speed broadband infrastructure to 300,000 premises in rural areas.  eir has committed to doing this work over a 90 week period with an average of 500 premises passed per day.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website at www.dccae.gov.ie/documents/Commitment%20Agreement.pdf.  The decision by eir to invest in infrastructure to deploy high speed broadband services to an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland was taken by eir on commercial grounds.  Neither I nor the Department have a statutory authority to direct eir in this regard. </p>  <p>  The focus of the agreement is the delivery by eir of its commitment to roll out a high speed broadband network to over 300,000 premises.  The agreement includes quarterly milestones to be achieved by eir, which are subject to formal evaluation by my Department.  My Department has concluded that eir has met its target to pass 40,000 premises by the end of Quarter 1 of this year.  My Department understands that approximately 3,350 of these premises will be served by an eVDSL connection.  Initial indications are that eir has also met its Quarter 2 target. A formal evaluation of eir's Quarter 2 performance will be conducted by my Department shortly.</p></reply>

It shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly on implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017.  I intend to publish the second quarterly report shortly.</p><p>27 of the 31 local authorities have adopted revised development contribution schemes in compliance with the 2013 guidelines, which exempt telecommunications infrastructure from development contributions.  A further local authority is due to adopt its revised scheme shortly.  Of the remaining three, one scheme will be reviewed this year, and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government are following up on the two other schemes with the relevant local authorities.  The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will continue to engage with relevant Councils and monitor the reviews of schemes, recognising the role of the elected members in this matter.  <font color="#1F497D"> </font></p><p>The updates provided by operators on network features and functionality enhancements have been integrated into the Q1 and Q 2 reports.  As noted in the first quarterly progress report published in June, eir launched Wi-Fi calling in early 2017.  Since launch, the company have extended the supported device range of products.  In the last quarter there has been strong take-up of the service with customers successfully making 1 million Wi-Fi calls throughout Ireland.  eir will continue to extend the device capability range over the next few months and are conscious of the positive experience enhancement for customers to make calls where never possible before.  Operators will continue to report to the Taskforce Implementation Group on their ongoing work on introducing network features and functionality enhancements.  The Implementation Group will continue to monitor the situation closely during the bilateral engagement with action owners in Quarter 3. </p><p>Significant engagement has taken place with each of the mobile operators where they have presented the key issues preventing them from serving blackspots.  Each operator has proposed a series of initiatives and recommendations to help reduce the impact of blackspots both in rural and urban locations. The recommendations include:</p><p>-  Operator led solutions &ndash; introduction of new network functionality and features such as HD calling and Wi-Fi Calling;</p><p>-  Community and local authority led initiatives &ndash; to assist in the identification of suitable site locations or existing infrastructure; </p><p>-  Updating of the Exempted Development Regulations to allow new equipment be deployed on existing sites; and</p><p>-  Reducing site rental costs for State owned sites to use particular sites to alleviate blackspots.</p><p>A number of these initiatives are already being implemented through actions underway via the Taskforce Implementation Group.  In addition, the operators have shared a list of their top 5 blackspots in each county where assistance is needed to alleviate the issues.  This has resulted in a blackspots pilot exercise which is a significantly positive project, with collaboration and information sharing taking place between stakeholders at an unprecedented level.  Telecoms operators have committed to providing details of their network coverage to local authorities, my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development in order to identify and ascertain solutions to specific blackspots areas.  Both Departments will further refine recommendations to address the top 5 blackspots in specific counties and will review the effectiveness of the pilot exercise with a view to creating a formal blackspot engagement process with all local authorities.</p></reply>

Provisional data indicates that 6.6% of heat demand was derived from renewable sources in 2016.   My Department has undertaken a detailed economic assessment on the design and cost of the RHI for the industrial/commercial sector in Ireland. This analysis included a range of renewable energy technologies and focused on large commercial and industrial heat users in the non-Emissions Trading System (ETS).</p>  <p>  The final public consultation process on the design and implementation of the new RHI closed in March 2017 and 119 submissions were reviewed by my Department. All submissions to the RHI public consultation have been published on the Department's website at: www.dccae.ie. The findings from this public consultation are currently being evaluated to help inform final decisions in relation to the scheme.  At this stage, a number of important factors are still under consideration including overall costs, technologies to be supported and general design. </p>  <p>  It should be emphasised that the introduction of any scheme would be subject to Government approval and State Aid clearance from the European Commission.</p></reply>

These policies were scheduled to be reviewed in 2017. However, recognising the concerns of some stakeholders in relation to elements of the pike and wild brown trout policies, the Board of IFI decided to bring forward the review period for these policies and commence the process in 2016, focusing initially on the element of the management of pike in designated wild brown trout fisheries.</p>  <p>  A group, comprised of a range of representatives from all disciplines within IFI, was formed to undertake the review. A public consultation process was held in November 2016 through which almost 300 submissions were received. In January 2017, the review group met with representatives of a number of pike and trout angling organisations and associations.</p>  <p>  In May 2017, representatives from both pike and trout angling associations joined the review group for two information gathering meetings at which various scientists made presentations. </p>  <p>The review group adjourned after the 29   May meeting for the summer to provide time to review and assimilate the data and information provided during the two information gathering meetings.</p>  <p>  The presentations delivered at the meetings, along with minutes of the previous meetings and the public consultation submissions are published on the IFI website at the following link: www.fisheriesireland.ie/Public-Consultation/public-consultation-national-policy-review-management-of-pike-in-designated-wild-brown-trout-fisheries-3.html</p>  <p>  While the policy review is underway, the current IFI pike management practices continue. While this may be an area of concern for both the brown trout and pike angling communities, it would not be appropriate to make any recommendations on policy change in advance of the report from the review group. An initial draft of the report is expected to be available in the Autumn, however, IFI have advised that the report will not be finalised before the year end or early 2018. Decisions on any change in the management of pike and trout will be made as soon as possible thereafter.</p></reply>

Regulations 6 and 7 impose obligations on householders, which <i>inter alia</i>, require householders who avail of a household waste collection service, and are supplied with a food waste bin in line with the Regulations, to place food waste in the food waste bin. Alternatively, a householder may subject the food waste to a home composting process or bring the food to an appropriate authorised waste facility. A collector may also offer a service to collect garden and/or other suitable bio-waste in the food waste bin.  My Department has worked with the Composting and Anaerobic Digestion Association of Ireland to develop a website, , to provide the public with the information required to use the brown bin appropriately. This includes advice on the types of material which should and should not be in placed in a household brown bin and guidance on food waste prevention and home composting.The Seventh Schedule to the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2007, (S.I. 820 of 2007) as amended, requires kerbside household waste collectors to accept a minimum list of recyclable household waste materials.

At present, Solar Photovoltaic (PV), for electricity generation, is not supported under any of the existing renewable electricity support schemes operating in Ireland.  However, my Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contribution to EU-wide targets out to 2030. The design of the new scheme is underway, and includes an extensive independent economic appraisal. This appraisal involves comparing the cost of supporting Solar PV (both rooftop and ground mounted), offshore wind, onshore wind and a range of other commercial renewable technologies, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply. The assessment also includes analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.</p>  <p>  My Department will publish shortly a final public consultation on the design principles of the new RESS. Following the outcome of this public consultation, and before any new scheme is introduced, it will need to secure Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission. Subject to this, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in 2018.</p>  <p>  My stated position is that while solar has a role to play in Ireland&rsquo;s energy future, we cannot have a situation where a new support scheme leads to a disproportionate increase in people&rsquo;s electricity bills through the Public Service Obligation levy. In designing the new RESS, the cost implications for people and businesses will, therefore be a high priority and I will ensure that the new scheme is designed in a cost efficient manner.</p></reply>

Both reviews involved an examination of the latest scientific data and the conservation measures, the results of which were the subject of public consultation processes.Based on management advice from Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) and having considered all aspects of the 2015 review, the existing conservation measures remain in place up to mid-2018 at which time a further review is required.  IFI have been provided funding for a new collaborative research initiative involving IFI scientists and a number of former eel fishermen to further develop national knowledge of the species and its medium to longer term potential for recovery. This scientific fishery was commenced in 2016 and is expected to continue for three years to increase data and knowledge<font color="#FFFFFF"> </font>ahead of further review of eel management measures in 2018.</p><p>The latest advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) for 2016 (published in October 2015) is that &ldquo;the status of eel remains critical and that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution) affecting production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to &ndash; or kept as close to &ndash; zero as possible. There is no change in the status of the stock as being critically endangered&quot;.</p><p>While I recognise the difficulty facing eel fishermen, there is no property right attaching to public eel licences and the issue of compensation does not arise. Consideration is being given to the possibility of an eel hardship scheme within the 2018 Estimates process. However, such consideration will be against the background of competing requirements from all Departments as part of the Estimates process.

It is worth noting that the measure to phase out flat fees is not &lsquo;new&rsquo; for the more than half of kerbside household waste customers who are already on an incentivised pricing plan, i.e., a plan which contains a per lift or weight related fee. There are no plans at present to introduce maximum charges. However, I am establishing a pricing monitoring function that will provide monthly reports on pricing developments and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will be asked to report on the operation of the household waste collection market in order to inform the future development of national waste management policy before year end.</p></reply>

The most recent Waste Packaging Statistics for Ireland, published by the EPA in May 2016, show that Ireland has met and exceeded the overall packaging waste recovery rate and the recycling rate targets since they came into force.  Our recovery rate has gone from 70% in 2009 to 88% in 2013; and our recycling rate has gone from 65% in 2009 to 70% in 2013.  Specific material streams for 2013 are shown in the following table:<table><tr><th>Material</th><th>EU Recycling rate target</th><th>2013 recycling rate Ireland</th></tr><tr><td>Glass</td><td>60 % by weight</td><td>80%</td></tr><tr><td>Plastic</td><td>22.5% by weight, counting exclusively material that is recycled back into plastics</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>Paper &amp;amp; Board</td><td>60% by weight</td><td>79%</td></tr><tr><td>Metals</td><td>50% by weight</td><td>79%</td></tr><tr><td>Wood</td><td>15% by weight</td><td>82%</td></tr></table></p><p>Repak is the approved producer responsibility compliance scheme for packaging in Ireland and it is tasked with meeting recovery and recycling targets established under the EU Packaging Directive.  Repak members pay fees based on the amount of packaging they place on the market and this incentivises them to reduce packaging. </p><p>A lot of work has been done by Repak members to prevent and minimise the amount of packaging they require. With the assistance of the EPA, Repak&rsquo;s Prevent and Save initiative funded under the National Waste Prevention Programme, has worked with Irish business to reduce packaging and to promote packaging improvements across industry. Under the initiative, specialist packaging technologists look for ways to optimise the packaging used and to minimise any resulting packaging waste. Further information can be found on www.repak.ie/preventandsave.</p><p>Furthermore, as Minister, I have advanced a range of initiatives to reduce Ireland's food waste, including the expansion of the Stop Food Waste campaign, the launch of a Food Waste Charter, the establishment of an Action Group on Food Waste Prevention in the Retail Sector, imposing a requirement on industry for the nationwide roll-out of &quot;brown bins&quot; for food/organic waste management to all communities with a population of 500 people, and the organising of an awareness and educational media campaign to help households to use their 'brown bins' and reduce their food waste.</p></reply>

In this regard, the European Union submitted an NDC committing to a reduction of at least 40% in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, which will be met through reductions of 43% in the Emission Trading System (ETS) and 30% in the non-ETS sector compared with 2005 levels. </p>  <p>  Ireland will contribute to the Paris Agreement via the NDC tabled by the EU on behalf of its Member States.  The specific details of Ireland's contribution to the overall 30% reduction in the non-ETS sector, as well as the contributions to be made by other Member States, is currently being negotiated between the EU and its Member States in the context of the European Commission's Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) Proposal which was published in July 2016.  Targets have been proposed for Member States based on GDP per capita and the cost-effectiveness of domestic emissions reductions within individual Member States, with the starting point based on average emissions over the period 2016 to 2018.  In the case of Ireland a target of 39% has been proposed, which has been adjusted downwards to 30% to reflect the cost-effectiveness of measures within the Irish economy.  </p>  <p>  The Commission proposal recognises different Member States' circumstances and the need to provide flexibility to reduce emissions as cost-effectively as possible in the context of the overall EU target.  Ireland has been actively engaged in negotiations in the Council of Ministers, and is working to ensure that these core principles are maintained in the final outcome to the negotiations.  At the Environment Council meeting of Monday 19 June, my EU counterparts and I reviewed progress to date and emphasised the need to prioritise a successful conclusion to these negotiations which retains a high environmental ambition for the EU, but provides each Member State the capacity to contribute to that ambition in a cost-effective and fair manner.</p>  <p>  The incoming Estonian Presidency has indicated a desire to reach agreement in the Council, allowing negotiations with the European Parliament to commence during its term.</p></reply>

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005. This will be Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the overall EU objective to reduce its emissions by the order of 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.  Ireland&rsquo;s target is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated to EU Member States under this 2009 Decision, which is shared only with Denmark and Luxembourg.</p>  <p>  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's 2020 targets could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020.  The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself.  In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Mitigation Plan, which I expect to publish shortly, will set out what Ireland is doing, and is planning to do, to further the national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, 2015.  This first Plan will not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050, but it will begin the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. </p>  <p>  The National Mitigation Plan has been prepared, having regard to the provisions set out in the 2015 Act, in close collaboration with all relevant Government Departments and, in particular, with the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport; Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government; and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  As well as being supported by a range of technical, economic and environmental inputs, the National Mitigation Plan has also been informed by the submissions received during a public consultation in March and April 2017.  The Plan will become a living document accessible on my Department's website, and will be updated on an on-going basis as analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate further cost-effective sectoral mitigation options. </p>  <p>  The National Mitigation Plan presents detailed information on the costs and emissions reduction potential for measures already in place, and measures under consideration, within the responsibility of my own Department as well as those within the remit of the relevant sectoral Departments.</p>  <p>  While responsibility for the mid-term capital review is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and this review is ongoing, I have advised the Government, arising from the analysis presented in the National Mitigation Plan, of the scale of the required investments in the years ahead in order to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions.  I and other Ministers will continue to engage with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of the mid-term capital review with a view to ensuring that the investment requirements arising from Ireland&rsquo;s climate action policy objectives are appropriately reflected in the outcome of the review.</p></reply>

Negotiations on how this should translate into efforts by individual Member States are ongoing.</p>  <p>  As I have previously outlined, the option for Member States to account for wetland management in the context of these proposals reflects the absence of global experience in the tracking and reporting of climate mitigation measures associated with wetlands. Ireland presently accounts for mitigation action associated with wetlands falling within currently-reported land types and continues to carry out research which will support the understanding of carbon stock changes associated with peatlands and agricultural soils.  This will feed into the development of a more robust inventory and underpin future accounting for mitigation action associated with wetlands.  I envisage that work on this will be taken forward in the context of the National Mitigation Plan.</p></reply>

Tourism into Ireland has benefitted from initiatives such as the visa waiver scheme and the British Irish Visa Scheme. In respect of Brexit, one of the priorities from a tourism perspective is that joint visa arrangements with the UK are maintained.  My Department has emphasised the importance of maintaining the existing arrangements at various formal inter-departmental groups and groups that include stakeholders from outside the public service.  The visa arrangements matter has been discussed at the External Trade Council, the Cabinet Committee on Brexit, the Brexit Economy and Trade Work Group, the Brexit Common Travel Area Work Group as well as the Brexit Tourism Work Group.  Officials from my Department and officials from the Department of Justice and Equality attend these fora.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, eligibility for travel visas is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality. My officials are in regular contact with that Department in respect of visas from a tourism perspective. For example, on July 11th, officials from my Department and Tourism Ireland attended a working group meeting on visas at the Department of Justice and Equality, with particular emphasis on visa arrangements for China. Further meetings of this Working Group are planned to discuss issues in respect of visas.</p></reply>

The approach will, amongst things, ensure that the relevant interactions with the existing legislative framework under the 2013 Act for small public service vehicles (taxis, hackneys and limousines), are properly integrated; the definition of 'rickshaw' will encompass all known types of rickshaw, in particular the most prevalent type of rickshaw in operation which has an electric motor which provides assistance to the person pedalling the rickshaw, and the principles and policies will be set out in primary legislation as to the matters which the NTA may provide for in regulations, thereby giving the NTA the necessary powers to regulate.</p>  <p>  To inform the detailed drafting process I have also tasked the NTA with conducting a public consultation, as the views of key stakeholders and the public will be important in devising an appropriate regulatory regime for rickshaws. The consultation will, amongst other things, seek to elicit information on existing rickshaw operators in relation to the scale and type of operations and users experience of rickshaws including fares charged and issues they have experienced, as well as operators'/drivers' and the public's views on how operators/drivers and vehicles should be regulated. The NTA intends to initiate the consultation process  this month. Early consultation on proposals to legislate will mean that feedback can be used constructively and a broad consensus secured.</p>  <p>  I share the concerns which have been raised about the need for regulation of rickshaws and it is my intention to progress the drafting of the Heads of a Bill without delay.</p></reply>

The status of the port, and whether its current status potentially inhibits its development, was most recently considered in a strategic review, commissioned by my Department, and carried out by by Indecon economic consultants.   Their report concluded that the creation of an independent port authority would be extremely difficult given the Port's complex legal structure. Instead, it was recommended that the Port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated. </p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest. The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port; however, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.</p>  <p>  Following that assessment my Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter. That advice identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal and those issues remain under consideration by my Department.</p></reply>

On the 26th of September 2016, I met with the Administrator of the Civil Aviation Administration of China and signed a new Memorandum of Understanding between our two countries to further assist with the facilitation of future services. The Department, the Irish Embassy in Beijing and various agencies (daa/Tourism Ireland) have all been working to achieve this goal. However, any decision to operate services between Ireland and China will ultimately be a commercial decision for airlines. In the broader context of furthering connectivity with the "east", the European Commission is in the process of negotiating a comprehensive air services agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , which encompasses ten South East Asian countries: Brunei, Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Officials from my Department will be engaged in these negotiations via the Aviation Working Group of the European Council. While my Department endeavours to facilitate services and enhance connectivity by means of providing the appropriate bilateral/multilateral frameworks under which air operations would be conducted, any decision to operate services between Ireland and Asia would be a commercial one for the airlines themselves.   The Deputy will be aware that Qatar Airways recently commenced a new daily service between Dublin and Doha. Alongside the existing services operated by Etihad and Emirates to Abu Dhabi and Dubai and by Turkish Airlines to Istanbul this adds to the connectivity options through these relatively new but increasingly important aviation hubs.</p></reply>

The NTA's 'Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035' proposes implementation of the DART Expansion Programme involving electrification of the Northern line as far as Drogheda, the Kildare Line to Hazelhatch, the Sligo line to Maynooth in the west and to the M3 Parkway and construction of the DART Underground tunnel.  The Government decided in September 2015 that the original proposal for the tunnel should be redesigned to provide a lower cost solution and work is underway on that at present.</p>  <p>  Funding for some elements of the DART Expansion Programme is included in the Government's Capital Plan including funding for the extension of the DART to Balbriggan; for design and planning to progress for expansion of DART services to Maynooth and Hazelhatch; and for work on the redesign of the tunnel.</p></reply>

The status of the port, and whether its current status potentially inhibits its developments, was most recently considered in a strategic review, commissioned by my Department, and carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants.</p>  <p>  Their report concluded that the creation of an independent port authority would be extremely difficult given the Port's complex legal structure. Instead, it was recommended that the Port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated.</p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest. The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port; however, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.</p>  <p>  Following that assessment my Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter. That advice identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal and those issues remain under consideration by my Department.</p></reply>

Clarity on ownership of routes and agreement on access is also very important in this regard.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that I recently launched a public consultation process to inform the development of my Department's new Strategy for the future development of greenways.  A public consultation paper is available on my Department's website <i>www.dttas.ie/public-transport/publications/english/greenways.</i></p><p>All interested parties are invited to make submissions by 14 July, 2017 and I would welcome views as part of this process.</p></reply>

Maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority over the next period and the bulk of the roads capital budget, approximately &euro;4.4 billion, is earmarked for such essential work with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already underway. In this context it was not possible to include a range of projects in the Plan (including the N2 Clontibret to the Border scheme) given the overall funding envelope available.</p>  <p>  The Capital Review is now underway and a number of local authorities (including Monaghan County Council) have made submissions to my Department outlining the case for funding for roads and my Department is making a strong case for additional funding, including the development of a project pipeline for road schemes.  While there is a strong case for additional funding for the transport sector, there are a multitude of possible national, regional and local projects around the country, the cost of which far exceed available funding and unfortunately, this means that only a limited number can be considered.</p>  <p>  The final decisions on allocations are, however, matters for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and Government as a whole.</p>  <p>  Concerning the A5 scheme, the planning and implementation of the A5 project is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland authorities.  The Stormont House Agreement and Implementation Plan - A Fresh Start - sets out the Government's commitment to contribute &pound;75million to ensure that Phase 1 of the project (Newbuildings to north of Strabane) can commence as soon as the necessary planning process in the North has been concluded.</p></reply>

Though not unexpected, given the welcome return to economic growth in Ireland and the corresponding rise in transport needs, it nevertheless confirms that Ireland's greenhouse emissions continue to track broader trends in the economy and serves to underline the difficult decisions ahead of us as we try to reduce emissions in line with our international commitments.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a collective emissions reduction target for each year between 2013 and 2020 under the 2009 EU Effort Sharing Decision with the ultimate goal of emission reductions of 20% below their level in 2005 by 2020.  Ireland's target is one of the most demanding; only shared with those in Denmark and Luxembourg.  The projected shortfall to our national targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland's 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis.</p>  <p>  The EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy demand from renewable sources by 2020.  Ireland is committed to achieving this national target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has calculated that 9.1% of Ireland's overall energy requirements in 2015 were met from renewable sources and 5.7% of transport energy demand.</p>  <p>  My Department aims to meet our sectoral renewable energy targets for transport mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a contribution.  As the Deputy may be aware, an increase to the current biofuel obligation rate is envisaged and a public consultation on future incremental increases is expected to take place later this year.</p></reply>

It is clear, however, that Transport has an important role to play in reducing the national emissions profile.</p><p>The legislative framework governing the EU's 2020 emissions reductions targets includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets, including provisions to bank any excess allowances to future years and to trade allowances between Member States.  Using our banked emissions from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emission reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2018.  However, our cumulative emissions are expected to exceed targets for 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances.  While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis will be required to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required.</p><p>The EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy demand from renewable sources by 2020.  Ireland is committed to achieving this national target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has calculated that 9.1% of Ireland's overall energy requirements in 2015 were met from renewable sources and 5.7% of transport energy demand.  The SEAI analysis also estimated that this avoided over &euro;286 million of fossil fuel imports.  Similar to most other Member States, Ireland has sought to increase renewable energy in the transport sector primarily through the use of sustainable biofuels alongside a contribution arising from electric vehicles.</p><p>In a document entitled <i>Ireland&rsquo;s Energy Targets &ndash; Progress, Ambition and Impacts </i>(published in April 2016) the SEAI estimated that the cost to Ireland of not meeting our overall renewable energy targets may be in the range of &euro;65 million to &euro;130 million for each percentage point Ireland falls short of the overall 16% renewable energy target.</p></reply>

The rules for all the Department&rsquo;s childcare schemes are clearly published to ensure transparency and consistent application.  An essential component of the scheme&rsquo;s rules is an eligibility date to ensure that the scheme can be administered and budgeted for in an appropriate manner.</p>  <p>  Parents may request an  exemption from ECCE eligibility criteria under limited circumstances from the Department; specifically where a diagnosed special need exists.

This funding is provided at the end of the year and reimburses the HSE for the services which it provides on Tusla's behalf. </p>  <p>  Ensuring the mental health and well-being of children and young people is critical to reducing risk factors and strengthening resilience factors in their lives.  Indeed, it is crucial in supporting children and young people in realising all of the 5 National Outcomes as set out in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware a range of services exist across policy domains which support child counselling and related interventions.  These range from psychological and psychosocial supports in the Health Service Executive, National Educational Psychology Services, Tusla and more broadly in and across the community and voluntary sector.</p>  <p>  Under Section 8 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013, Tusla has specific responsibility for &ldquo;services relating to the psychological welfare of children and their families&rdquo;.  To advance considerations on this highly important issue I have recently requested an update from Tusla relating to a range of issues on this matter.</p>  <p>  My officials will consider this information and will work with Tusla in advancing matters.  An initial meeting between my Department, the Department of Health, the HSE and Tusla will examine service provision relating to the psychological welfare of children and their families.  In advancing these developments I fully intend to ensure that the needs of children and young people, and the development of optimum responses in this area, are central to considerations.</p>  <p>  Child counselling services are already available via a number of family resource centres around the country.  Each family resource centre prioritises the services it wishes to provide based on the demands of its community.  Funding is made available on an annual basis through Tusla's Counselling Grants Scheme, and many centres have developed a counselling and support service for children and young people through this mechanism.</p></reply>

Both community and private providers can sign up for the latter whereas only community providers can sign up for the former.  The forerunner of the Community Childcare Scheme Plus was the Community Childcare Scheme private which was introduced from March 2016 to bring private providers into the Community Childcare Scheme.  It is this expansion in 2016, I presume the Deputy is referring to.  The last grant agreements ran from Sept 16 to Aug 17. </p>  <p>  In total, 914 community providers signed the grant agreement for the Community Childcare Scheme for the 16/17 and 1,320 signed for the Community Childcare Scheme Plus programme.

The Deputy may be aware that the new NDIS for the period 2017-2020 is to be launched later this week and I am strongly supportive of that Strategy.  <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, </i>the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People includes a number of commitments across a range of Government Departments and agencies aimed at improving outcomes for children and young people with disabilities.  I am confident that the key actions under each theme and objective of the new NDIS, which will identify the lead Department and timeframe for implementation, will deliver on these commitments. </p><p>Under the theme of Joined Up Services, my Department will work with the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE to consider how best to facilitate smooth transitions into, within and out of education. </p><p>My Department will take a lead role to under the theme of Education to ensure the full implementation of the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM).  AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting.  Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience, ensuring that every eligible child can fully participate in the ECCE programme and reap the benefits of quality early years care and education.  AIM was introduced in June 2016 and has provided targeted support to children with a disability in accessing the ECCE programme in over 3000 instances since then.  Funding of &euro;32.42m has been provided for AIM in 2017. </p><p>The NDIS also commits to the development and implementation of effective national joint working protocols between Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), disability services and education to ensure that children and young people with disabilities can access CAMHS services. </p><p>I have previously outlined to the House the work being done by Tusla to improve interagency working governing children in care and aftercare, and access to disability services.  Tusla and the HSE agreed a protocol which will operate to ensure good collaboration between Tusla and the HSE.  It will provide clarity for those tasked with ensuring that appropriate services are provided by the relevant agency to the children and young people who need them.  Over the past year there has been intensive and productive engagement at official and at Ministerial level to establish the protocol. </p><p>In relation to  young people transitioning from State care into adult disability services, Tusla has agreed to meet the required expenditure outlay for such young people &ndash; even though they are no longer in the care of the State &ndash; until the end of 2017.  Thereafter all such young people, and indeed future cohorts of children in State care moving into adult services, will transfer to an appropriate HSE-funded service upon turning 18.</p><p>My Department operates in accordance with the Disability Act 2005 and the Code of Practice for the Employment of People with a Disability in the Irish Civil Service to promote and support the employment of persons with disabilities.  The Disability Liaison Officer in my Department works with staff who have identified a disability to ensure that they are provided with all necessary supports to enable them to integrate and work to their full capacity.  The Department also has an Access Officer who is responsible for providing or arranging for and co-ordinating the provision of assistance and guidance to persons with disabilities in accessing the Department's services.  Details of the Access Officer are available on the Department's website. </p></reply>

When ECCE was expanded as a result of Budget 2016, it enabled all children to attend ECCE from the age of three, entering at one of three entry points after their third birthday, September, January or April, and remain there until they started in primary school, with the exception that they could not be more than 5 years and 6 months when they finished ECCE in June.

These include:</p><p>-  A new universal subsidy will be available for all children aged between 6 months and 3 years of age (or until they are eligible for ECCE e.g. 3 years 3 months) in registered childcare.  This will amount to as much as &euro;80 a month or &euro;1,040 per year for children in full time childcare.</p><p>-  Subsidies provided under existing childcare schemes, specifically the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Schemes will be increased significantly, in some cases by as much as 50%.</p><p>I would note to the Deputy that as these schemes are entirely demand led, any figures can only be estimated and would be based on the number of potential beneficiaries and the level of service they will avail of.  The estimated number of beneficiaries by scheme is set out in the following table for the 17/18 programme year:<table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>Expected number of beneficiaries</th></tr><tr><td>Targeted CCS bands (current)</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>Targeted CCS bands (additional)</td><td>5,000</td></tr><tr><td>TEC (current)</td><td>7,000</td></tr><tr><td>Universal CCS</td><td>33,000</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>70,000</td></tr></table></p><p>The cost of these provisions will be within the envelope previously allocated to the Affordable Childcare Scheme, a figure of &euro;150m for 2018. </p></reply>

The final implementation report on this strategy will be published later this year.  Key actions relevant to data development and collection in my own Department under the Strategy include:</p><p>-  The publication of biennial <i>State of the Nation's Children Report (SONC) </i>which presents a wide range of disaggregated administrative, survey and Census data on children and on factors relevant to children&rsquo;s lives.  The recently published 2016 report is the sixth in this biennial series.</p><p>-  The development of the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures (BOBF) Indicator Set (arising from a review of national indicator sets on children&rsquo;s lives).  This indicator set has been developed by my Department to track the progress of children and young people aged 0-24 across the five outcomes outlined in Better Outcomes Brighter Futures (BOBF), the whole of government policy on children and young people.  A report on the indicator set, containing over 110 indicators and related aggregate data, will be published in Autumn 2017.  The development of a disaggregated data set for each indicator is also underway and will be published subsequently.</p><p>-  My Departments ongoing commitment to and management of the Growing Up in Ireland Study: The National Longitudinal Study of Children in Ireland. Since 2006 GUI has been tracking the development of almost 20,000 children across two nationally representative cohorts of children.  So far over 45 reports have been published by the GUI research team at the ESRI and Trinity College Dublin using the GUI data. GUI data is also used frequently by DCYA to inform policy development and service provision. </p><p>A dedicated Statistician post has recently been filled within the Research and Evaluation Unit of my Department and with a second post to support ongoing data and statistical requirements recently sanctioned.  A Departmental data needs analysis is currently under way, the results of which will contribute to the development of a proposal and project plan to support the implementation of a centralised departmental approach to the storage and management of data for monitoring, planning and evaluation purposes.  The information collected will serve the following key purposes:</p><p>-  Inform the development of a centralised approach to the storage and management of DCYA and DCYA relevant data for analytic purposes.</p><p>-  Serve the action from the Open Data Strategy that commits Government Departments to conduct an audit of their datasets.</p><p>-  Help assess any needs arising following the impending introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p><p>-  Provide information on how DCYA data is positioned in relation to the National Data Infrastructure, which involves the use of permanent unique identifiers on public data sources so as to enable linkage of data sets. </p><p>This will be the first phase towards fulfilment of Output 33 of the Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy, i.e. &ldquo;a statistical data reporting system developed to support the work of the Department and its stakeholders&rdquo;.  It will also contribute to Government Commitment G57 of BOBF, by disaggregating data and indicators &ldquo;by important demographic characteristics to allow for improved evidence-based policy-making, implementation and monitoring, and in the delivery of service&quot;.</p><p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency has recently announced the establishment of a new project, Outcomes for Children, National Data &amp;amp; Information Hub.  Tusla requires optimum data management, utilising reliable data tools to ensure effective planning services for children.  The project will ensure that Tusla can better fulfil its responsibilities by establishing state of the art data platforms through which it can plan its services.</p><p>The project will involve the building of an interactive area based geo mapping system to provide information for policy makers, service providers, Tusla management, practitioners, information managers and local communities so that planning and delivery of services are informed by the best available data.  </p><p>It is being co funded between my Department and Tusla under the Quality and Capacity Building Initiative (QCBI) and is being piloted with eleven Children and Young People's Services Committees (CYPSC) this year, with the aim of rolling it out across all CYPSC areas in subsequent years. </p><p>This project is a prime example of collaboration between different statutory bodies and stakeholders, and my Department is providing its full support to both Tusla and the CYPSC as they continue to improve the well being and outcomes for children in Ireland.</p><p>I have referred your question to Tusla to provide information on other steps taken to develop data collection within Tusla, for direct reply  </p></reply>

Of these, 293 (5%) did not have an allocated social worker.  It is important to note that if a child has not been allocated a social worker, their needs are reviewed regularly by the principal social worker.  Tusla does not collate a breakdown of  children in foster care awaiting allocation of a social worker by wait time or priority level. </p><p>I can tell the Deputy that  there were 5,948 open cases awaiting allocation nationally at the end of April.  An open case is one which is assessed as needing a dedicated (allocated) social work service.</p><p>Of these, 903 were designated as high priority, 3,607 as medium priority and 1,438 as low priority.</p><p>The following table displays waiting times for the allocation of a social worker for the  open cases awaiting allocation at the end of April 2017:</p><p>Table 1 *  </p><p>No of open cases by length of time awaiting allocation<table><tr><th>&amp;lt;1 week</th><th>377</th></tr><tr><td>1-2 weeks</td><td>307</td></tr><tr><td>2-3 weeks</td><td>464</td></tr><tr><td>3-4 weeks</td><td>426</td></tr><tr><td>1-2 months</td><td>1,082</td></tr><tr><td>2-3 months</td><td>677</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt; 3 months</td><td>2,615</td></tr></table></p><p>*Data as per the last day of April 2017. </p><p>Addressing the number of children who are awaiting the allocation of a social worker is a priority for me. I secured additional funding for the purpose of addressing this issue in 2017, and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is now in the second year of a 3-year plan to provide for the allocation of a dedicated social worker to all children who need one.  The Deputy should note that all urgent and emergency cases notified to Tusla are dealt with immediately.  Urgent and emergency cases could involve cases of abandonment, allegations of physical and sexual abuse, parental ill health leading to the need for an immediate placement, or threat to the safety or life of a child by a third party.</p><p>My Department will continue to closely monitor progress in this regard.  I attach a high priority to tackling this matter and I will continue to engage directly with the Tusla Board and senior management team, over the course of the year,  to review progress.</p></reply>

In line with these recommendations, the Agency has recently appointed an ICT Director with the responsibility to progress the development and implementation of the Tusla ICT Strategy. </p>  <p>  Tusla's ICT Directorate is currently revising its ICT Strategy in order to take advantage of emerging ICT innovations as well as opportunities presented from recent Government digital initiatives such as the &lsquo;Build to Share&rsquo; programme.  The strategy and associated implementation plan is scheduled to be finalised in the coming months.</p>  <p>  Tusla's current ICT focus is on the development of the National Child Care Information System (NCCIS), which will ensure that every social work department has a user-friendly technology solution to record the case history of every child, who is the subject of a child protection or welfare concern, from the point of initial referral to case closure. Significant progress has been made on the development of NCCIS software and roll out to Tusla areas over the past 12 months.  Tusla intends to roll out the system nationally between now and mid-2018.</p>  <p>  While Tusla currently has a small internal ICT team, it works in conjunction with the Health Service Executive (HSE), which provides the majority of its ICT service requirements.  The ICT Directorate has worked closely with the HSE, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) and ICT industry leaders to develop a vision and strategy to transform and position ICT in Tusla.  Tusla plans to deliver on the guiding principle of providing services which are secure, integrated, innovative and consistent.  The aim throughout is to maintain a high quality ICT system that puts children first and serves the needs of all Tusla stakeholders.</p></reply>

As such, it is not possible to provide a breakdown of funding paid in respect of "non-contact time" prior to 2017.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the preceding, to take account of the additional administrative burden on childcare providers as the result of significant changes to the childcare schemes in 2016-17, including the expansion of the ECCE scheme to include three intake points, contractual changes and the coming into force of the Childcare Regulations, I provided some &euro;14.5m in 2017 to be drawn down as a "non-contact time" payment for providers, equivalent to seven days' funding.

This funding will ensure that said regulatory changes do not hinder service delivery or the availability of childcare places. </p><p>The principles, procedures and management of funding provided from public money are set out in the Public Spending Code.  The Public Spending Code consolidates and updates existing appraisal and evaluation requirements and guidelines, with the aim of promoting value for money and ensuring the optimal use of limited exchequer resources.  In keeping with these aims and in order to avail of the funding specified, each of the participating providers was invited to engage in a proscribed and standardised application process.  The Department remains committed to assessing all complete applications equally, without prejudice to additional communications or representations made.</p><p>As a part of the application process, services were required to furnish the Department with certain documentation and information; allowing for an assessment appropriate to the payment of any public funds.  Such documentation was designed so as not to add an administrative burden to the Early Years providers.  Additionally, the Department provided a checklist of these requirements in order to provide services with further support and clarity regarding the materials necessary to progress their application.  The checklist was distributed by the City/County Childcare Committees (CCCs) to early years providers in their respective areas, in respect of the issue at hand, this checklist was provided to Cork CCC on 4 April 2017.</p><p>The speed of the application and payment process remains dependent on the services in question submitting appropriate documentation, as outlined within the checklist of requirements.  Furthermore, to ensure the best possible outcome for each service, once the documentation is received it is subsequently reviewed for consistency.  At this stage, if an issue arises in terms of the clarity of information provided, additional information may be sought from the individual groups through the respective CCC.  Once this has occurred, the Strand B Submission is finalised.  To date, six services from across the country have fully returned the necessary documentation and information in respect of their application for CE Sustainability funding, and their Strand B Submissions have been finalised.  Of these six services, the Department has approved one and expects to finalise its assessment of the remaining five imminently.  However, of the six Cork-based services to have applied for CE sustainability funding, none have fully returned the required information and documentation as at time of writing (11/07/2017).  The Department is unable to fairly assess partial applications, and therefore the primary delay in the provision of the payment to these services remains the absence of documentation previously requested.  <b></b></p><p>The Department has delegated the collation of relevant documentation and information in respect of the application process to the local CCCs.  Therefore, the first point of contact for any further queries on this matter should be with the Cork City Childcare Committee.  However, the Department and the CCCs remain available to provide any assistance they can in respect of the application process, and will be directly in contact with the services in question with regards to re-iterating the requirements of the application process.</p><p>The Department views as an ongoing priority both the assessment of completed applications and the subsequent payment of providers who have engaged-with and satisfied this assessment process.</p></reply>

This Counselling Grants Scheme is for a total of &euro;245,900 annually and currently there are only 64 grantees nationwide benefitting from it.  With over 4,000 schools in Ireland 64 grantees means that less than 2% of schools are in receipt of support from this scheme currently.</p>  <p>  I have decided that until an alternative methodology for provision of counselling can be established, the grant should stay in place in its current format.  Any increase to Tusla Education Welfare Service will have to be considered in the context of the estimates process for Budget 2018.</p></reply>

The ABC Programme commenced in 2013 and was designed as a time-bound, co-funding agreement in the amount of &euro;29.7 million to 2017.

Eight of these are based in Dublin: CDI Tallaght, Preparing for Life; Youngballymun, Clondalkin Blueskies Initiative, Better Finglas, Dublin Docklands and East Inner City (NCI); Grangegorman and Ballyfermot. The remaining five sites are located in Cork; Louth; Wicklow, Limerick and the Midlands (Laois/Offaly and Longford/Westmeath).

This extension brings the existing programme closer in line with the expected timeline for delivery of the national evaluation report in 2018. We will utilise the learning from the programme and the findings from the national evaluation to inform the design of prevention and early intervention initiatives that comprehend the Programme for Government Commitments, in order to achieve our shared goal of improving the lives of children and families throughout Ireland.</p></reply>

The main purpose of these changes is to broaden the availability of CE to a greater number of people on the live register, to standardise eligibility and other conditions regarding the length of time a person can participate on the programme and to promote progression outcomes.</p><p>The changes will see the general qualifying age for CE, for those on the live register, reduced from 25 to 21 years. It will also now be easier for previous participants who have exhausted their CE entitlement to requalify, as participation prior to the year 2007 will be disregarded. While participants between 21 and 55 years can avail of one year on the programme, this can be extended on approval by the Department by up to 2 more years, if they are working towards a major award/industry recognised equivalent to support their progression to employment.  CE participants age 55 and over can now avail of up to 3 consecutive years on a scheme. </p><p>All participants will be given access to training and development and supported with addressing any barriers to employment they may have so as to enhance and maximise their progression opportunities. </p><p>There will be an overall lifetime limit of 6 years from 2007 (or 7 years if on a disability payment). </p><p>Following consultation workshops with CE stakeholders throughout the country during May and early June, these changes came into effect from Monday 3rd July 2017. </p><p>Further changes which will be progressed over the coming months include the roll-out of the &lsquo;two strand approach&rsquo; of activation and social inclusion in terms of how CE places are categorised.

This compared to a rate of 12.7%, or 152,000 children, the year before. The 2015 results show that consistent poverty among children fell by 1.2 percentage points in 2015, equating to a fall of 13,000 on the child poverty target. </p><p>These figures relate to the situation after the impact of social transfers is taken into account. The Central Statistics Office does not report the percentage of children under 18 years of age that live in consistent poverty before social transfers.</p><p>The Government set a child poverty target in 2014 in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the national policy framework for children and young people 2014-2020 (BOBF).  The target was to reduce the number of children in consistent poverty by over 70,000 between 2011 and 2020.  From the revised outcome for 2015, meeting this target would now require lifting over 102,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020. </p><p>In support of the child poverty target in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the Government is implementing a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty, building on the life-cycle approach adopted in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion, 2007-2016.A range of government departments and other stakeholders are involved in implementing this approach.</p></reply>

The BTEA scheme has been amended in recent years to ensure that the conditions are in line with the qualifying payment. BTEA participants with eligibility based on jobseekers, transitional jobseekers or one parent family payments who engage in part-time work will be assessed in accordance with their primary payment.  This measure ensures that only participants who continue to satisfy the means test of their primary payment will continue to receive income support under the BTEA and that resources are directed at those most in need of assistance.</p>  <p>  The BTEA was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third-level education system.  The student universal support Ireland (SUSI) grant, payable by the Department of Education and Skills, represents the primary support for persons pursuing education. </p>  <p>  A new &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance will be made available to BTEA  participants with children from the next academic year in September. This will help parents, including lone parents, to return to education. Additionally the age-related payments will no longer apply to participants of the BTEA and, as a result, students who have a reduced payment on their primary scheme payment will now benefit from the maximum rate of payment from the new academic year.</p>  <p>  Overall, the priority for my Department is that the BTEA scheme will be focused, targeted and suitable for the needs of jobseekers and on the future skills needs of the economy.  It is only in that context that changes to BTEA will be considered. I have no plans to change the current rules for the Allowance. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through Pathways to Work to ensure that as many of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register.</p><p>The Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy continues to prioritise actions for the newly unemployed and also includes a range of measures for the long-term unemployed. This includes the payment-by-results services of JobPath to engage more systematically with the long-term unemployed; providing targeted wage subsidies under JobsPlus; and reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on employment and training programmes. </p><p>The unemployment rate in the South East is still relatively high at 9.3% (Q1 2017) as compared with the national average of 6.7%; data on the official unemployment rate are not available at the sub-regional level. In relation to &lsquo;blackspots&rsquo; with a high concentration of unemployment, as identified in the Census, it is important to recognise that DSP services through Intreo are focused on unemployed individuals rather than on areas. This means, nonetheless, that those areas where unemployed individuals are most concentrated will also be the areas that receive a greater share of DSP income support payments and activation and employment services. </p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs 2017 includes actions aimed at stimulating regional growth, including the progression, monitoring and support of the eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs, which through public and private sector collaboration seek to build on existing strengths and assets and identify opportunities within each region, and realise the national Action Plan&rsquo;s regional employment targets. </p><p>The South East Action Plan for Jobs is the key policy response for supporting employment growth in the South East region.</p><p>The Key Targets for the SE RAPJ are as follows:</p><p>-  Increase employment in the region by 10%-15% over the period to 2020. This will see the creation of 25,000 new jobs in the region.</p><p>-  Increase the number of IDA investments in the region by 30-40% up to 2019. This will result in a minimum of 44 additional projects for the region by 2019.</p><p>-  Achieve an increase of at least 25% in the number of start-ups in the region, and a 25% improvement in the survival rate of new businesses.</p><p>-  Increase jobs in export-led sectors by 20% across the region by 2020.</p><p>-  Increase the value of agri-food exports by 85% by 2025.</p><p>-  Develop the South East as a key destination as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East experiences, to achieve a target to grow overseas tourism numbers by an extra 300,000 with 5,000 associated jobs being created.</p><p>-  Establishing a new Regional Skills Forum to ensure closer collaboration between employers and the education system in identifying and meeting the skills needs of the region and promoting the range of roles and career paths available in the region.</p><p>-  Developing Smart Specialisms as new sources of growth in the South East, in particular where the region has both a research base and an enterprise base that can exploit emerging technologies from that research.</p><p>Progress Reports on the SE RAPJ are being published twice yearly.</p><p>-  The first progress report for the South East Region was published last December and the second Report was published on 26 June. Both reports show that good progress is being made in the implementation of the Action Plan.</p><p>-  As a result of a focused collaborative approach and a range of reforms delivered in the region over recent years, the unemployment rate in the South East has fallen from 12.8% in 2015 to 9.3% by Q1 2017.</p><p>-  12,400 jobs were created in the South East from the start of 2015 to Q1 2017.</p><p>I am confident that the range of measures outlined, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in unemployment both nationally, regionally, and in the blackspot areas.</p></reply>

Private sector companies offer online vacancy services, but at a cost.  My Department&rsquo;s service is fee-free and supports employers to find suitable candidates across a wide range of industry sectors.  Unlike commercial services, JobsIreland is integrated with the European-wide EURES service and is also used to support public employment schemes, such as Community Employment.</p>  <p>  The new JobsIreland also represents a key step in the ongoing development of the State&rsquo;s Intreo employment service.  The service greatly improves the ability of employers and jobseekers to offer and find employment using the latest technology in a cost effective manner.  It is also being integrated with the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service and will be of benefit to case workers as they support jobseekers in their efforts to find employment.  A JobsIreland service has been available since the 1990s and was originally provided on a website operated by F&Aacute;S.  When my Department took over responsibility for the public employment service it was clear that the website did not provide the range of functionality offered by public employment services in other European countries.</p>  <p>  For example, while the old website enabled jobseekers to search for job opportunities based on job type, location and salary, employers could not search for suitable jobseekers - they had to rely on candidates finding and applying for the jobs that they were offering from among the many thousands hosted on the website.  In effect, it operated as an online &lsquo;notice board&rsquo; rather than an online recruitment tool.  In addition, the site itself operated on old technology which was obsolescent.</p>  <p>  Accordingly the Department decided to tender for the provision of a new multi-functional service.  Tendering procedures were fully compliant with Public Procurement Guidelines. Following an open procurement process via etenders and OJEU, conducted in compliance with public procurement guidelines, the Department selected an Irish vendor to design, build and operate the service.  The contract was awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender submitted in response to the requirements set out in the Request for Tender, for a fee of &euro;3.36m to be paid over an initial period of five and a half years to the end of 2021 with an option to extend the contract at the end of this period at a reduced rate.  My Department is satisfied that it represented the best value for money and entered into a contract with BDO on the 18th September 2015.</p>  <p>  The new service enables employers and jobseekers to search for each other using competencies and skillsets as well as the traditional job type classifications.  It also operates in the background to automatically match candidate CVs to job specifications posted by employers and notify both the candidates and the employers when a match is found. Employers and candidates can communicate with each other using system messaging.</p>  <p>  It was intended that the first phase of the enhanced JobsIreland service would be introduced on 18th July 2016.  As preparation for the switchover, the old service had to be suspended - to facilitate, among other things, the migration of data to the new system.  During this time some user access and system performance issues were identified and it was considered prudent to undertake remedial work so as to mitigate the risk of problems appearing in the live environment.  The start date for the new service was therefore deferred to 28th July 2016. </p>  <p>  Regrettably, this meant that the service was offline for a short period. During that time, employers who wished to post job advertisements were asked to contact staff in the National Contact Centre, who took details from them to facilitate publication as soon as the new service went live.</p>  <p>  Some employers didn&rsquo;t understand why they had to re-register as users on the new site when they were already registered on the old site.  Re-registration on the new site was necessary to ensure that an employer could avail of the full service offered by the website.  Previously the old system captured very &lsquo;light&rsquo; employer details (essentially name and address).  Additional information is required in order to validate jobs and employers as real jobs/employers and to match employers with potential candidates, including, for example, industry sector, Company Registration Office and VAT registration numbers.  This also provided the opportunity to refresh the employer register and eliminate duplicate entries that have built up over the past twenty years.  Similarly job details and skill/competency requirements have to be specified in greater detail if job and candidate matching is to be effective.  </p>  <p>  My Department worked to minimise the impact of the registration process.  In cases where an employer had a live vacancy advertised on the old system, officials contacted them and made arrangements to have them registered in order for that vacancy to transfer and be successfully associated with the new, more complete entry.  </p>  <p>  The service is being implemented on phased basis which means that there has been some service disruption - implementation of a complex new website in a live environment will inevitably lead to some service disruption.  The phased implementation is designed to enable new features to be added while minimising disruption. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that the level of disruption experienced during the implementation of the new service was greater than anticipated, particularly during the July &ndash; November period of 2016, the Department is satisfied that the system is now operating satisfactorily and is providing a much broader and relevant set of functionality to users than was available on the old system.  The improved performance is reflected in the fact that there are now over 10,000 jobs advertised on the site &ndash; this is the highest level recorded in recent years.</p>  <p>  The price and payment schedule for the service has been adjusted to reflect the initial difficulties experienced and the vendor has agreed to extend the service period to compensate for the delays that resulted from these service issues.</p>  <p>  My Department has a National Contact Centre which provides employers and jobseekers who use the JobsIreland website with information, advice and support.  Anyone needing assistance can contact the Centre by email at jobsireland@welfare.ie or by phone on 1890 800 024 (between 9.00am and 5.00pm Monday to Friday). </p>  <p>  At the time of the site launch in Summer 2016, many customers experienced difficulty in accessing the service; the level of customer enquiries and complaints increased significantly in August 2016 and remained high for the rest of the year, averaging 200 per week.  Additional staff was assigned to manage this level of enquiry and to support users in accessing the JobsIreland service.  From December 2016 the number of customer enquiries, including complaints, has reduced significantly and has averaged 20 per week for the year to date.  This level of query is not considered excessive for a service that is hosting 10,000 job vacancies.  There have been 8 official complaints.</p></reply>

Where evidence of non-compliance or deliberate misclassification of employment status is detected, it is addressed as part of normal enforcement of the income tax and social welfare codes by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection. In addition, where details of specific cases are supplied to the Department, the Scope insurability section will investigate and determine the employment status of the persons concerned in line with legislation and the Code of practice for determining employment or self-employment of individuals.   My Department adjudicates in the region of 1,000 insurability decisions every year. </p>  <p>  An interdepartmental working group, comprising officials from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, has been examining the emergence of new forms of employment arrangements, which are sometimes called &lsquo;disguised employment&rsquo;. These includes arrangements i) where an individual, who would otherwise be an employee, establishes a company to provide their services employment and ii) where an individual, who is dependent on and under the control of a single employer in the same manner as an employee, is classified as self-employed. </p>  <p>  The working group sought the views of interested parties and stakeholders through a public consultation. The consultation received 23 submissions from interested parties, including employers, trade unions, professional bodies and individuals.  The working group is preparing a report which will present the views of these organisations and individuals, together with an analysis of the issues arising.  I understand that the working group is currently finalising the report.</p>  <p>  I look forward to seeing the report and I will then consider, along with my colleague the Minister for Finance, what changes, if any, might be required.</p></reply>

We are extremely sorry for any worry or concern this may cause to parents/guardians of children with additional care needs.  At present it is taking 20 weeks on average to finalise an application.  Applications are processed in date of receipt order.  There are a number of factors that have contributed to the extended time required to process claims;</p>  <p>  First, there is a significant increase in the volume of applications being received.  The numbers applying for DCA have increased significantly since 2009, when the Department took over administration of the scheme from the HSE.  The year on year increase in volumes over recent years has consistently been in the 15-20% range due to an increase in population and more awareness of the scheme.  Over 1,000 claims were received in May, along with a further 700 in June; whereas the average would have been 400 per month a few years ago.</p>  <p>  Secondly, following a High Court ruling in 2016, there is now a need for the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors to provide the deciding officer with a more detailed opinion on the child&rsquo;s eligibility for the scheme and for the deciding officer in turn to provide more detailed reasons for their decision when communicating this to the customer.  These factors have resulted in the time taken to finalise applications increasing significantly and as a result the numbers being processed have reduced and the timescale to finalise each application has increased.</p>  <p>  Corrective actions are being taken, with additional deciding officers assigned to work on the scheme. Once these deciding officers become fully operational, the increase in claim processing capacity should allow for an improvement in processing times.</p>  <p>  An application for DCA was received from this gentleman on the 17th of February 2017.

To date, almost 4,500 people have commenced their engagement period with the service in Tipperary. </p>  <p>  In relation to the number of participants to find employment, it is important to note that jobseekers may be supported through the service for up to 30 months - under the service jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months.</p>  <p>  It will therefore take time to accumulate a sufficient number of clients (who have completed their engagement period with the service) for complete and robust outcome data to be available.  With this in mind, it is intended that an econometric evaluation of the service will commence at the end of 2017.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The General Registry (GRO) comes within the remit of my Department.  The Registrar General (An t&Aacute;rd Chlaraitheoir) has specific statutory functions in this regard. Responsibility for local registration services is assigned to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for the administration of the system of civil registration in the State which is done through the Superintendent Registrars and Registrars each registration area.</p>  <p>  I understand that in this case the position is as follows;</p>  <p>  The birth in question occurred on 2 June 2017.  Section 30 of the Civil Registration Act 2004, as amended, provides that the chief officer of the hospital or other institution in which a child is born shall notify the Superintendent Registrar of the occurrence of births in the hospital or institution.  In this case, the notification was received by the Superintendent Registrar on 5 July 2017.  Section 30 does not specify any time limit for the notification of births by a hospital.  I understand that local registrar will shortly be in touch with the mother asking her to contact the office to make an appointment to attend at the registrar&rsquo;s office to register the birth of her child.</p>  <p>  In terms of providing financial assistance, the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme in my Department can make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure or an urgent needs payment (UNP) to people who would not normally qualify for SWA but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources where no alternative is available. </p>  <p>  Any persons who consider that they have an entitlement to an ENP or UNP should contact the Community Welfare Service of the Department at their local Intreo centre.</p></reply>

The contributions must have been paid on one of the spouse/civil partners&rsquo; social insurance records and all must have been made before the death of the spouse/civil partner.</p>  <p>  The legal context governing relationships such as marriage is broader than the social protection system.  Where that context changes, the social welfare code is examined for appropriate changes, e.g., the scheme was introduced for widows on 1st January 1936; it was extended to widowers on 28th October 1994 in light of gender equality issues that had not been considered in the 1930s; and extended to surviving civil partners from 1st January 2011 following the introduction of civil partnership.</p>  <p>  Entering into a marriage or civil partnership is a legal act, which confers both rights and obligations on both parties, which do not exist in a legal sense between co-habiting couples.  Widows, widowers and surviving civil partners, who become bereaved, therefore, in addition to their personal loss, also lose someone who had legal duties towards them.  In some cases those legal duties were, in part, financial in nature, and the social welfare code recognises that potential loss by providing a pension to them, subject to certain conditions. </p>  <p>  At this time, there are no plans to extend the eligibility for the scheme.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It also provided for the extension of entitlement to invalidity pension and treatment benefit to the self-employed and for a new pre-activation programme for young people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  Under the CES an interdepartmental &ldquo;Make Work Pay&rdquo; group was established and its report, published earlier this year, included a number of recommendations designed to assist people with disabilities achieve their employment ambitions. In launching the report, the Government announced that people with a long-term disability payment who move off the payment to get a job will retain their free travel pass for a period of five years.  The Government has also decided to accept the report&rsquo;s recommendation to dispense with the requirement that work be of a &lsquo;rehabilitative nature&rsquo; for the disability allowance earnings disregard.  This means that a report from a doctor is no longer required before commencing work and that the focus is on capacity rather than incapacity.  Other recommendations relate to extending the principle of &ldquo;early intervention&rdquo; to disability allowance and other disability payments.  The Government has promised a period of consultation with persons with disabilities on these recommendations in particular.  The Department of Social Protection has started this process of consultation with the disability sector. </p>  <p>  Also under the CES, the Department has in recent years rolled out its full Intreo service to people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service on a voluntary basis. In such cases, people with disabilities who present at an Intreo Centre will be offered an interview by an employment support officer with a view to agreeing a suitable action plan.  Progress in implementing actions under the Strategy is regularly reported by the Department to the Comprehensive Employment Strategy Implementation Group.  The Chair of this Group, Mr Fergus Finlay, presented his first progress report in March 2017.  The report notes the work advanced by the Department to build the capacity of its Intreo service to better support persons with disabilities who want to pursue further education, training or work opportunities and the progress being made in upskilling staff to better support claimants with disabilities.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, my Department has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as flooding.</p><p>The purpose of the humanitarian assistance scheme is to prevent hardship by providing income-tested financial support to people whose homes are damaged from flooding and severe weather events and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair. </p><p>Expenditure under the scheme for the period from 2010 to 2016 is some &euro;5 million and a yearly breakdown of this expenditure is provided in the attached tabular statement.  Expenditure to date in 2017 is &euro;120,500.  There was expenditure of over &euro;2.05 million to assist householders affected following the flooding in the 2015/16 winter, which was the wettest winter ever recorded in Ireland.</p><p>Following a severe weather event staff, in my Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service, closely monitor the situation on the ground and engage with the relevant local authorities and other agencies to ensure supports are provided to those affected as swiftly as possible.  Emergency income support payments to cover essential items such as food, clothing and personal items are quickly issued in the immediate aftermath of the event.  Financial supports towards the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items may take longer as it is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes will become known.  The longer term financial support covers necessary remedial works and can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring and painting.  It could take several months before this stage of the response is completed and final payments issue.  Statistics are not maintained on the average waiting times for payment.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Tabular Statement</b></p><p>Expenditure under the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme 2010 &ndash; 2016<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Outturn - &euro;000</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>1,045</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>714</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>118</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>1,189</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>233</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>1,682</td></tr></table></p></reply>

If measures are not taken to address this low rate of coverage, many future retirees will experience unwanted reductions in their living standards when they reach retirement.  Therefore, I both welcome and support the outcome of the Citizen&rsquo;s Assembly deliberations regarding retirement income which saw 87% of eligible voters agreeing that the Government should introduce some form of mandatory pension scheme to supplement the State pension.  </p><p>To this end, I have previously confirmed that it is my intention to publish and commence the implementation of an Action Plan for the reform of pensions over the coming months.  As well as a range of other reform measures, this Action Plan will set out proposals for a transition from the current and purely voluntary supplementary pension system to one which will automatically enrol eligible employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  This reform, where the saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out, will encourage long term saving and asset accumulation amongst those who may otherwise suffer a reduction in living standards at retirement and will increase the wellbeing, financial security, and independence of future retirees.</p><p>Following the publication of this Action Plan and in order to guide future Government decisions, it is intended that the detailed evidence building and consultation required to deliver automatic enrolment will be undertaken over an initial project planning phase.  This work is needed to inform fundamental choices regarding the preferred operational structure and organisational governance for the new system as well as design elements such as the required contributions, financial incentives and target membership.  Correctly positioning/designing each of these will be critical to the success of any system.  </p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Initial consultations have taken place with Irish sectorial interests and international experts in this field.  </font>Whilst there is also much to learn by looking at the strengths and weaknesses apparent in aspects of other countries&rsquo; pension systems, any solution must be tailored to fit the Irish situation.  <font color="#2F2F2F">Therefore, as work progresses, I will ensure that extensive efforts are made to build </font>consensus across political, business and civil society lines and to consider the manner in which such a system would be best delivered.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is defined as requiring from another person, continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions or continuous supervision in order to avoid danger to him or herself, and being likely to require that level of care for at least twelve months.</p>  <p>  The evidence, including a medical report, submitted in support of the application for CA for the mother of the person concerned was examined and the deciding officer decided that this evidence was insufficient to show that the requirement for full-time care and attention was satisfied.</p>  <p>  There was no medical evidence submitted in support of the application for CA for the father of the person concerned.  On 14 February 2017 a medical report was issued to be completed by a medical practitioner in respect of him.  To date it has not been returned.</p>  <p>  It is also a condition for receipt of CA that the carer provides full-time care and attention.  A person can be considered to be providing full-time care and attention where they are engaged in employment, self-employment or on training courses outside  the home for a maximum of 15 hours per week, provided that they can show to the satisfaction of a deciding officer that adequate care has been provided for  the care recipient in their absence.</p>  <p>  The person concerned was requested on 27 February 2017 to provide evidence to show that she was working outside the home for less than 15 hours per week.  The required documents and evidence were not provided, which meant the deciding officer could not determine if the condition regarding the provision of full time care and attention was satisfied.</p>  <p>  For these reasons, the applications for CA were disallowed.</p>  <p>  The person concerned was notified on 29 March 2017 of the disallowances, the reasons for them and of her right of review and appeal.</p>  <p>  My department were notified on 13 June 2017 that the person concerned had appealed this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).  A submission in support of the decision is being prepared and will shortly be forwarded along with the file to the SWAO for determination.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The savings arising from the initial reduction and subsequent discontinuance of the telephone allowance meant that my Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.  My Department will spend approximately &euro;232 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 427,000 customers.</p>  <p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew.  At the end of September 2013 there were almost 396,000 receiving the telephone allowance compared to approximately 316,000 people in 2007.  This was an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum.</p>  <p>  The value of the telephone allowance before it was discontinued was &euro;9.50 per month (equivalent to &euro;114 per annum).  Therefore, the cost of restoring the allowance at this level in 2018 might be estimated at approximately &euro;50 million per annum, although the precise figure would depend on a number of factors.</p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and strives to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years was given.  This increased the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, there was a further increase in the rate of State pensions by &euro;5, which has increased the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory) to &euro;238.30.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, over the past two Budgets, the maximum weekly rate for State Pensions has increased by &euro;8 per week.  The value of these increases is well in excess of the value of the telephone allowance previously provided.</p>  <p>  Any decision to restore the telephone allowance would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  In the previous two Budgets, the Government has concentrated resources on increasing the rate of the pension, rather than on the Household Benefits package.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to around 627,000 families in respect of some 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of over &euro;2 billion in 2017.</p><p>Between 2000 and 2009, there were significant increases in Child Benefit payments and during that period overall expenditure on Child Benefit grew from &euro;638 million to approximately &euro;2.5 billion per year.  This reflected a policy focus on targeting additional resources towards the provision of universal child income supports.</p><p>Between 2009 and 2013 a number of reductions in the rates of Child Benefit were made.</p><p>Budget 2009 provided for the reduction of the maximum age for which Child Benefit is paid and from 2010 Child Benefit was no longer paid in respect of those aged 18.</p><p>In both 2015 and 2016 the monthly Child Benefit rate increased by &euro;5 and it is now paid at a standard rate of &euro;140 per month for each child.</p><p>Given the numerous changes made to Child Benefit since 2008 it is not possible to cost with accuracy reversing all cuts and changes to the scheme since 2008.</p><p>However, taking the lowest rate payable in 2008, of &euro;166 per child per month, and applying that to the number of children in respect of whom Child Benefit is currently paid would result in an additional cost of around &euro;374 million.  Were the higher rates paid in respect of families with three or more children also to be restored, were the upper age limit to be increased to 19 as it was in 2008 and were the grants paid at birth on all multiple births to be reintroduced this would result in a significantly higher figure, which is not currently possible to accurately cost. </p></reply>

Firstly, by reversing the amendments made to the OFP scheme, this would likely result in a substantial cohort of lone parents that are currently not in receipt of a social welfare payment becoming eligible and therefore moving onto a social welfare payment.  As members of this cohort are not currently in receipt of any social welfare payment, the Department currently has no visibility of them and therefore, it would be impossible to estimate the numbers involved.</p>  <p>  Secondly, this proposal may incentivise some customers to move from alternative payments such as Jobseekers Allowance (JA), the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment (JST) and the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) back onto the OFP. It would not be possible for the Department to estimate the magnitude of this flow between schemes.</p>  <p>  Finally, reversing the changes to the OFP would also increase the incidence of dual payments of OFP and the Family Income Supplement (FIS), which would lead to significant but unquantifiable reductions in FIS payments for some lone parents. </p>  <p>  These unknown factors are critical to providing a reliable costing.  The Department is therefore not in a position to provide the costing requested. </p></reply>

Maternity leave is only available to the mother and paternity leave is only available to the relevant parent as designated by the mother. Currently there is no provision for the sharing of maternity or paternity leave.   Any decision to change the current leave arrangements to allow for the sharing of leave would be the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  My Department has responsibility for the payment of maternity and paternity benefit as provided for in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended).  With the introduction of two weeks of paid paternity leave in addition to 26 weeks of paid maternity leave there are potentially 28 weeks of paid support available to parents.   The scheme envisaged by the Deputy would represent an additional 44 weeks of paid leave for parents.</p>  <p>  Based on current rates of &euro;235 per week, the estimated cost of extending the duration of maternity benefit is approximately &euro;10.3 million for each extra week and the estimated cost of extending the duration of paternity benefit is approximately &euro;5.5 million for each extra week.</p>  <p>  These estimates are based on the current take-up for each of the schemes and an assumption that were the duration of these schemes extended the current cohort of recipients of each scheme would avail of the additional weeks of payment.  Furthermore, these estimates are subject to change over the coming months in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients for 2017.  It should also be noted that there are also costs to the Exchequer as these estimates do not include the costs of salary top-ups for public/civil servants.</p>  <p>  Maternity leave policies in EU Member States are governed by the 1992 Pregnant Workers Directive, which sets the minimum period for maternity leave at 14 weeks, with 2 weeks&rsquo; compulsory leave before and/or after confinement and an adequate allowance subject to national legislation.  As such, there is a minimum compulsory maternity leave which must be taken by the woman.</p>  <p>  It is only leave over and above this minimum which could be potentially shared by parents.    </p>  <p>  It is not possible to accurately estimate the cost of shared maternity and paternity leave for 18 months as the level of take-up of such a scheme is unknown.    There are a number of factors that determine the take up of any new scheme such as this including, parental choice, whether the father or relevant parent has sufficient PRSI contributions, whether they are self-employed and can take the time off from their business and if an employee, whether or not their employer would top up their wages for some or all of the leave.</p></reply>

The at-risk-of-poverty rate was 34.8% with the basic deprivation rate at 53.2%. </p>  <p>  Neither Eurostat nor the OECD reports on consistent poverty, at-risk-of-poverty or basic deprivation measures based on principal economic status.  However, in the European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), disability is based on the concept of global activity limitation.  This is defined as a &ldquo;limitation in activities people usually do because of health problems for at least the past six months&rdquo; but it does not differentiate between those in employment and those not in employment.  The latest EU-SILC data available shows that the severe material deprivation rate for people (aged 16 years and over) who are limited in their normal activities due to a health problem was 14.9% in Ireland in 2015, as compared to the EU average of 11.3%.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the national figures, given the continuing economic recovery throughout 2016 and measures introduced in Budgets 2016 and 2017, it is reasonable to expect future figures to show improvements.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the economic recovery is experienced in all regions and by all families, households and individuals. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to increasing the employment opportunities for people with a disability.  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities adopts a cross-government approach that brings together various measures, to be taken by different Departments and State agencies, in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on the employment of people with disabilities.  The six strategic priorities are to: build skills, capacity and independence; provide bridges and supports into work; make work pay; promote job retention and re-entry into work; provide co-ordinated and seamless support; and engage employers.  These priorities are incorporated into the Pathways to Work Strategy and this ensures that there is an integrated focus on supports that enable people with disabilities to participate in employment where they have the capacity to do so.</p>  <p>  My Department provides a range of specific income, activation and employment supports for people with a disability.  For instance, the partial capacity benefit scheme enables recipients of invalidity pension and illness benefit to take-up employment, on a voluntary basis, while continuing to receive income support.  The Department manages a supported employment service (EmployAbility) which provides a dedicated job-coaching service for people with disabilities.  Intreo services are also available to provide employment support services for people with disabilities who wish to engage with the service on a voluntary basis.  There is also a focus on supports available to employers who employ people with disabilities such as the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Workplace Equipment Adaption Grant Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for addressing poverty and social exclusion is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The Plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty.  The Department will review the Plan this year, as it reaches the end of its current term, with a view to developing an updated plan for future periods.  The Department will also review the national social target for poverty reduction. This review will be undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

The estimated spend on FIS this year is approximately &euro;422 million.</p><p>There has been a steady growth both in the number of families supported by FIS over recent years and associated expenditure, with numbers in receipt of FIS rising from around 32,000 families with more than 73,000 children in 2012 to just over 57,000 families and over 126,000 children by the end of June 2017.  </p><p>A number of factors have led to the increase in take-up including an increased awareness campaign by the Department of Social Protection, a substantial increase in the numbers in employment, demographic factors and increases in the FIS thresholds in 2016.  </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s information strategy has promoted the benefits of FIS and increased overall awareness of the scheme.  Some of the increase in FIS numbers is also due to transfers from the One-Parent Family Payment arising from the reduction of the age threshold of the youngest child to 7 years, which occurred over the past four years.</p><p>Substantial improvements in customer service and processing times for FIS customers have also significantly contributed to the increased numbers of FIS recipients.</p><p>The Department avails of every opportunity in its engagement with employers and jobseekers to build awareness of the availability of FIS and how this payment may benefit potential employees with children, a number of recent examples are outlined below.</p><p>- The Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.welfare.ie </i>has full information on the FIS scheme and provides typical family scenarios to aid understanding and provide comparisons.  This information is also available in all the Department local offices, CICs and information offices.</p><p>- In addition a series of road-shows were held around the country designed to inform employers about the wide range of employment support services provided by the Department, including FIS.</p><p>- Case Officers in each locality will specifically use FIS as an incentive to move people from the long-term Live Register to employment.</p><p>- The Department&rsquo;s Benefit of Work ready reckoner gives an indication of the difference between a person&rsquo;s potential in-work payment, including FIS, and current out-of-work payments.</p><p>- The Department also launched a poster advertisement campaign in its Intreo centres and local offices nationwide during 2015.</p><p>- The Department has also been in touch with Trade Unions representing in excess of 260,000 employees (in both the Public and Private Sector) and provided them with an article on FIS for inclusion in their publications for members.  This article explains in detail the qualification conditions for the scheme and gives relevant supporting examples of families that could qualify.</p><p>- FIS was also publicised as part of jobs week which ran from the 28<sup>th</sup>September 2015 to 2<sup>nd</sup>October 2015.</p><p>The increasing numbers of families in receipt of FIS is testament to the effectiveness of the Department&rsquo;s information strategy for the scheme and the significant improvements in customer service and processing times for FIS customers.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Both schemes provide significant support to individuals so that they can work up to 3 days a week and still retain access to a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  </p>  <p>  The current days based system can provide significant income supports to jobseekers who are casually employed or working part-time.  For instance an individual can earn a little over &euro;19,760 per year and still retain a small jobseeker's allowance payment, while the equivalent threshold for an individual with a qualified adult is almost &euro;33,975 if they are both working.</p>  <p>  If there was a change from a days based to an hours based system, the design would have to take account of earnings.  Furthermore, if an hour&rsquo;s based system were introduced, existing casual jobseekers could lose out if their current hours worked over three days, exceeded the new hours threshold, thereby creating a disincentive to work longer. </p>  <p>  In addition, to the two jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes my Department&rsquo;s main in-work support is the family income supplement (FIS), which  targets families with children on low incomes and who work at least 19 hrs per week.  </p>  <p>  The back to work family dividend (BTWFD) scheme allows JA or JB recipients who have been jobseekers for 12 months or recipients of the one-parent family payment to retain their full increase for qualified children (IQC) for the first year in employment, tapering to 50% in the second year. </p>  <p>  Where a long term unemployed jobseeker is offered employment of more than 3 days but less than 24 hours a week, they may be eligible for the part-time job incentive scheme.  Under this scheme they can receive a weekly payment of &euro;119 per week if they are single or &euro;193.90 if they have an adult dependent.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently analysing incentives to work in the social welfare system for jobseekers with children with a view to developing the Working Family Payment.   </p>  <p>  Based on an analysis of current incomes, benefits, and taxes, ESRI research shows that people are better off in work than on welfare.  In particular, it demonstrates that more than eight out of ten unemployed jobseekers would see their income increase by at least forty per cent upon taking up employment. Fewer than three per cent would, in the short-term, be financially better off not in work. </p>  <p>  The risk of facing weak financial incentives to work is higher for unemployed persons with a spouse and children, as the income support goal of the welfare system means that they tend to have higher welfare payments.  However, even among that group, less than one in fifteen would be financially better off not working. With the introduction of the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) scheme, that figure drops to one in twenty.</p>  <p>  The combination of schemes available provides considerable income support for individuals who have part time employment by allowing them retain access to a social welfare payment.    </p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, long term unemployment continues to fall.  The most recent data show that unemployment has fallen from a peak of 15% in 2012 to 6.3% in June 2017.</p></reply>

Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, the unemployment rate has fallen rapidly since it peaked at 15.1% in Q1 2012.  The most recent figure is 6.8% in Q1 2017, and unemployment has fallen by more than half in every region of the country over this period.  A strong downward trend continues.  </p>  <p>  In Q2 2016, the unemployment rate as measured by the QNHS was 8.6%.  The Census of Population 2016 Summary Results - Part 2, published on 15 June 2017 (based on Census night 24th April 2016) provided an alternative measure of unemployment levels and indicated an unemployment rate of 12.7%.</p>  <p>  The main difference in the unemployment rate between the two sources arises as the classifications used in the measurement of unemployment differ for both. </p>  <p>  In the QNHS, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) classification is used and defines employment, unemployment and the inactive population.  Unemployment is defined as persons who, in the week before the survey, were without work and available for work within the next two weeks, and had taken specific steps, in the preceding four weeks, to find work.</p>  <p>  The Census uses the Principal Economic Status (PES) classification to establish the labour force situation of the respondent.  The PES classification is based on how respondents would describe their present principal status including a status of being unemployed.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these differences, a strength of the census-based data on employment and unemployment is the provision of data for small geographic areas, and analysis on the comparisons between areas.  Based on this, the latest census report has identified the 79 District Electoral Divisions (DEDs) with the highest levels of unemployment as &ldquo;unemployment blackspots&rdquo;.  The DEDs involved vary greatly in population size (ranging from about 490 to about 8,400) and other characteristics.  They are, however, predominantly the DEDs  of highest unemployment within larger urban areas; over half of the blackspots, and over half of the population resident in blackspots, is in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.</p>  <p>  Government policy to reduce unemployment is twofold.  First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through Pathways to Work to ensure that as many of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2017 includes actions aimed at stimulating regional growth, including the progression, monitoring and support of the eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs, which through public and private sector collaboration seek to build on existing strengths and assets and identify opportunities within each region, and realise the national Action Plan&rsquo;s regional employment targets. </p>  <p>  As an example of measures to support the regional jobs agenda, additional funds will be made available through the enterprise development agencies out to 2020.  In this context, a competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund 2017-2020 was launched in May 2017, providing funding of up to &euro;60 million to co-finance the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  This regional competitive fund will support the ambition, goals and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.  In addition, additional funding of &euro;150m is being made available to the IDA to support its Regional Property Programme and drive job creation in the multi-national sector.</p>  <p>  The Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy continues to prioritise actions for the newly unemployed and also includes a range of measures for the long-term unemployed.  This includes the payment-by-results services of JobPath to engage more systematically with the long-term unemployed; providing targeted wage subsidies under JobsPlus; and reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on employment and training programmes. </p>  <p>  In relation to &lsquo;blackspots&rsquo; with a high concentration of unemployment, it is important to recognise that DSP services through Intreo are focused on unemployed individuals rather than on areas.  This means, nonetheless, that those areas where unemployed individuals are most concentrated will also be the areas that receive a greater share of DSP income support payments and activation and employment services. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Census shows that the concentration of unemployment in &lsquo;blackspots&rsquo; is related to issues such as low educational attainment; housing tenure; and other markers of disadvantage.  Where there is a high spatial concentration of blackspots, such as in Limerick, there are overarching strategies in place. For example, the Limerick Regeneration Plan includes a range of measures to address the multitude of issues present in these areas.  More generally, measures are in place across a range of policy fields, such as education and childcare, to focus enhanced support on areas of identified disadvantage.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the range of measures outlined, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in unemployment both nationally and in the blackspot areas.</p></reply>

Under the Act, planning authorities are required to establish a register of vacant sites in their areas, beginning on 1 January 2017, and to issue annual notices to owners of vacant sites by 1 June 2018 in respect of vacant sites on the register on 1 January 2018.  The levy will be applied by planning authorities, commencing on 1 January 2019 in respect of sites which were vacant and on the vacant site register during the year 2018 and will subsequently be applied on an annual basis thereafter, as long as a site remains on the vacant site register in the preceding year.</p>  <p>  Planning authorities are empowered to apply an annual vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of vacant sites, exceeding 0.5 hectares in area - with reduced or zero rates of levy applying in specific circumstances &ndash; which, in the planning authority&rsquo;s opinion, were vacant or idle in the preceding year, in areas identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development.  The 3% rate of vacant site levy is consistent with the rate applied to derelict sites under the Derelict Sites Act 1990 and is considered a reasonable initial step in incentivising the activation of such sites for residential or regeneration purposes. </p>  <p>  All levies due on an individual site will remain a charge on the land concerned until all outstanding levies due are paid.  Accordingly, under the vacant site levy provisions, there will be a cumulative effect associated with not activating a site for development purposes for each year that a site remains vacant or idle.</p>  <p>  Planning authorities are presently engaging in the necessary preparatory work, prior to the application of the levy with effect from January 2019 in respect of sites identified on the register in 2018.  As required under the Act, this includes the identification of specific vacant sites for entry on the register as well as the registered owners of the sites in question along with undertaking a site valuation.  Vacant site registers were established in January 2017 by planning authorities and the registers will be populated as the preparatory work progresses during the year.</p>  <p>  The proceeds of the levy raised on vacant sites will be used by planning authorities for the provision of housing and urban regeneration development in the local area in which vacant sites are located.

The application was advertised in the Southern Star and was available for inspection at a local Garda Station for a period of 21 days.  No submissions were received from members of the public. </p>  <p>  In line with usual procedures, the application was also circulated to various bodies for their views and input.  Submissions were received from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Underwater Archaeology Unit of the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Marine Survey Office, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board, the Central Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute. </p>  <p>  The EIA Directive applies to a wide range of public and private projects.  It is a mandatory requirement for project types listed in Annex I of the Directive, e.g., the construction of motorways and airports or the construction of installations for the disposal of hazardous waste.  For project types listed in Annex II, it is up to the consenting authority to determine if an EIS is required by carrying out EIA screening based on criteria set out in the Directive.  Examples of Annex II projects include intensive fish farming, reclamation of land from the sea, extractive mining, fossil fuel storage or metal processing.  An EIA may also be required where the thresholds set out in the Directive are not met (sub-threshold EIA) or where the project or activity is proposed to be carried out in a Natura 2000 site.  </p>  <p>  If the consenting authority determines that the EIA Directive applies to a project it requires that an applicant must prepare and submit an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), following which the consent authority would carry out EIA.  In the case referred to, the proposed project is not within a Natura 2000 site, it is not of a class set out in Annex I of the Directive nor does it fall into Annex II; therefore, an EIS is not required.  I should however point out that the Marine Licence Vetting Committee considered all material pertaining to the application and concluded that subject to compliance with specific conditions the proposed harvesting was not likely to have a significant negative impact on the marine environment.</p></reply>

This can be seen, for example, in the social housing construction programme, details of which are now published quarterly, with the latest report, as at end Quarter 1 2017, available at the following link: <i><font color="#2F2F2F">http://rebuildingireland.ie/news/social-housing-construction-projects-report-2017/. </font></i>Within the details of the over 600 social housing projects, involving the construction of over 10,000 new social homes, are details of the projects that the local authorities in the Greater Dublin Area are advancing.  These include projects that are in design, planning or being tendered, those on site and some that are recently completed.</p><p>Acquisitions of new and second hand houses and apartments for those on the waiting lists is also part of the early response to the housing challenge and almost 2,000 such acquisitions were made nationally in 2016.  More are being undertaken this year and the Greater Dublin Area is prominent in this activity.  Further information in this regard is available at the following link: <i>. </i></p><p>Local authorities in the Greater Dublin Area are also utilising long-term leasing opportunities with private owners.  In 2016, there were 1,832 new social homes provided in this way by the four Dublin local authorities, 177 in Kildare, 154 in Meath and 36 in Wicklow.</p><p>The rapid delivery programme is now progressing well and my Department is working with a broad range of local authorities, in the Greater Dublin Area and beyond, on using this approach where suitable.  There are currently over 500 rapid delivery homes advancing through the planning design, procurement and construction stages, and work is underway to ensure that a further 500 units are advanced in the coming months, bringing the number of units in the programme to 1,000 by year end.  An additional 500 units are targeted for delivery in 2018.  The establishment of a framework of rapid delivery contractors by the Office of Government Procurement means that local authorities in the Greater Dublin Area and beyond can take advantage of this approach, allowing them to run quicker procurement competitions and advance rapid delivery projects to site more efficiently. </p><p>The publication in April 2017 of the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map will promote residential development on State lands as part of a new strategic approach to State land management.  Opening up the supply of State land in this way, for social and mixed-tenure housing, is a critically important policy in addressing a situation where the pace of recovery in the housing development sector is slower than it needs to be to meet demand.  In practical terms, the development of these sites will mean accelerating social housing delivery and securing more homes for sale and rent at more affordable price points.  Two of the Dublin local authorities have already brought forward four key, large-scale sites, capable of delivering 3,000 new homes, and I expect other local authorities to follow suit.</p></reply>

Critically, &euro;5.35 billion in exchequer investment has been secured to support its implementation and to deliver 47,000 social housing units through build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing, over the period to 2021.  </p><p>This level of national funding to implement Rebuilding Ireland's targets means that funding is available to Kildare County Council, and to other local authorities, to advance their housing delivery.  Evidence of this can be seen in the Status Report on Social Housing Construction Projects, the latest of which is available at the following link: <i>http://rebuildingireland.ie/news/social-housing-construction-projects-report-2017/. </i>It includes 17 construction projects of various scale in County Kildare, delivering 301 new social homes.  These projects are at various stages of advancement andthere has been no funding delay. </p><p>In tandem with the construction programme, all local authorities have been undertaking the targeted acquisition of properties and from January 2016 to date, over &euro;30 million has been provided to Kildare County Council to purchase over 180 new social homes.  The local authority has also benefitted from funding to return vacant and derelict social housing to use, with 95 such units supported through an investment of &euro;1.65 million from 2014-16. </p><p>Kildare County Council has 307 further social homes supplied, as at end of Q2 2017, under my Department's Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme.  The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is currently meeting the housing needs of some 1,200 households in Kildare, with an additional 16 households being supported each week.  From January 2016 to date, funding in excess of &euro;9.9 million was recouped to Kildare under the Rental Accommodation Scheme.  Kildare County Council also has a target to deliver 31 new social homes as part of the national 2017 target of 800 units under the Repair and Leasing Scheme. </p><p>I am keen that Kildare County Council brings forward and advances social housing projects as speedily as possible and I have assured all local authorities that funding is in place to support their activity in this regard in 2017 and beyond.  </p></reply>

Nevertheless, I will be giving further consideration to housing supply and affordability issues in the context of the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland which my Department has now commenced and which I hope to conclude in September.</p></reply>

The high proportion of overall national house-building taking place in rural areas points to the degree to which indigenous communities in rural areas are being facilitated in meeting their housing needs in those rural areas, with a degree of overspill development from cities and towns as well.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s 2005 Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing are designed to ensure that planning authorities strike a balance between managing the future of rural areas from a development perspective and at the same time enabling housing requirements of rural communities to be met.  The Guidelines set out how planning authorities should frame their development plan policies for the different types of rural areas which may exist within the development plan area, which range from rural areas close to cities and towns at risk of overspill development and remoter areas with low levels of development pressure and consistent patterns of population decline.  The Guidelines also set out policy advice on issues such as access to appropriate wastewater treatment facilities, potential impacts of the development on groundwater, landscape, natural and cultural heritage and addressing road safety issues (e.g. frontage onto national roads).</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that a sufficiently flexible and robust policy framework is in place to ensure that rural communities can meet their housing needs.</p>  <p>  I also recognise that the major shortfalls in housing provision are in our larger cities and towns and that it is in and around these key locations that we must particularly focus our efforts to boost supply, as outlined in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to avoid driving unsustainable overspill development in rural areas as a result of undersupply in urban locations.</p></reply>

My Department does not hold specific information in relation to the impact of the taxation measure cited.</p>  <p>  In terms of vacant sites more generally, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 introduced a new measure, the vacant site levy, which is aimed at incentivising the development of vacant, under-utilised sites in urban areas.  Under the Act, planning authorities are required to establish a register of vacant sites in their areas, beginning on 1 January 2017, and to issue annual notices to owners of vacant sites by 1 June 2018 in respect of vacant sites on the register on 1 January 2018.  The levy will be applied by planning authorities, commencing on 1 January 2019 in respect of sites which were vacant and on the vacant site register during the year 2018 and will subsequently be applied on an annual basis thereafter, as long as a site remains on the vacant site register in the preceding year.</p>  <p>  Planning authorities are empowered to apply an annual vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of vacant sites, exceeding 0.5 hectares in area - with reduced or zero rates of levy applying in specific circumstances &ndash; which, in the planning authority&rsquo;s opinion, were vacant or idle in the preceding year, in areas identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development.  The 3% rate of vacant site levy is consistent with the rate applied to derelict sites under the Derelict Sites Act 1990 and is considered a reasonable initial step in incentivising the activation of such sites for residential or regeneration purposes. </p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that all levies due on an individual site will remain a charge on the land concerned until all outstanding levies due are paid.  Accordingly, under the vacant site levy provisions, there will be a cumulative effect associated with not activating a site for development purposes for each year that a site remains vacant or idle.</p>  <p>  Planning authorities are presently engaging in the necessary preparatory work, prior to the application of the levy with effect from January 2019 in respect of sites identified on the register in 2018.  As required under the Act, this includes the identification of specific vacant sites for entry on the register as well as the registered owners of the sites in question along with undertaking a site valuation.  Vacant site registers were established in January 2017 by planning authorities and the registers will be populated as the preparatory work progresses during the year.  </p>  <p>  With regard to addressing the issue of the hoarding of residentially zoned land, I have tabled a number of amendments to the provisions relating to the extension of duration of planning permissions in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, which is currently at D&aacute;il Report Stage.  The amendments proposed are collectively aimed at tightening up the provisions in relation to the extension of duration of planning permissions and ensuring that extensions of duration, without commencing substantial development, will no longer be facilitated.</p></reply>

The core strategy must demonstrate consistency with the National Spatial Strategy and Regional Planning Guidelines (to be replaced in due course by the National Planning Framework and Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies), with a particular focus on alignment with regionally agreed settlement hierarchies and population and housing targets.  </p>  <p>  In addition, Section 94 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) provides that a planning authority must include a housing strategy in its development plan for the purpose of ensuring that the proper planning and sustainable development of the area provides for the housing of the existing and future population of the area, in the manner set out in the strategy.  As well as having regard to the social housing assessment now to be prepared annually under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the purpose of which is to capture the total number of households qualified for social housing support across the country whose social housing need is not being met, in order to better understand the level of need for such support, the housing strategy must take into account:</p>  <p>  (a) the existing need and the likely future need for social housing,</p>  <p>  (b) the need to ensure that housing is available for persons who have different levels of income,</p>  <p>  (c) the need to ensure that a mixture of house types and sizes is developed to reasonably match the requirements of the different categories of households, as may be determined by the planning authority, and including the special requirements of elderly persons and persons with disabilities, and</p>  <p>  (d) the need to counteract undue segregation in housing between persons of different social backgrounds.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, a more strategic approach to the assessment of and provision for additional housing requirements in support of long-term planning aims is also being developed as part of the forthcoming National Planning Framework.</p></reply>

Local authorities were also requested to consider the use of lands in their ownership for such projects and were invited to put forward proposals to my Department for consideration in that regard.</p>  <p>  The circular also provided clarity on the planning issues related to such BTR development schemes including on appropriate housing types and locations, management arrangements, Part V requirements, amenities, car parking, etc. Specific amendments were also made in the circular to the Design Standards for New Apartment Guidelines (2015) issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-16 in order to provide greater certainty for the consideration of such developments by planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, a &euro;35m investment in major infrastructure works was launched at Cherrywood, Dublin, representing a first step towards the delivery of over 1,300 new build-to-rent homes on this key Dublin site, that will supply 8,000 new homes in total when fully complete.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector, the commitment to affordable rental is now focused on kick-starting supply in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) by using publicly-owned lands. It is intended that lands held by local authorities in RPZs will be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to getting affordable rental developments underway.  Two local authorities have made important early progress in this regard &ndash; South Dublin County Council and Dublin City Council have recently brought sites to the market for development as part of a joint venture with private investors. </p>  <p>  My Department is also chairing a working group on Construction Costs to provide a strong evidential basis for consideration of any policy issues that may need to be addressed in relation to housing viability, including in relation to &lsquo;build to rent&rsquo; apartment developments.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is participating in a working group on the tax treatment of the private rental sector, set up under the Rental Strategy and chaired by the Department of Finance.  The Working Group has recently completed a public consultation and is expected to report to the Minister of Finance by the end of July on potential changes to the tax and fiscal treatment of the rental sector aimed at increasing supply.</p></reply>

This proposal is also incorporated in Action 6 of the <i>Action Plan for Rural Development</i>, launched in January 2017.  My Department is presently progressing the drafting of the necessary revisions to the planning regulations to give effect to this action and it is intended that the new regulations, which will require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, will be made as soon as possible in the Autumn. </p><p>My Department is also working with Dublin City Council in the context of the Living City Initiative, to explore the potential for further streamlining of the approach to re-developing and re-utilising vacant properties.  Dublin City Council has examined approximately 11,000 rateable units in its functional area.  From a visual analysis in a sample number of streets, the City Council has estimated that there may be approximately 4,000 vacant units above commercial premises that could potentially be converted into residential use in its functional area.  This kind of detailed analysis will be crucial in determining the scale and scope for prioritising the targeting of vacant properties that could quickly be brought back into use.</p></reply>

They set out the Government&rsquo;s broad framework for the delivery of housing for people with disabilities and were developed as part of a coherent framework in conjunction with the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy and Congregated Settings Report.  The partnership approach adopted under the Strategy recognises that the provision of suitable housing is only one element in supporting people with disabilities to live fully inclusive lives. Building on the<i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>commitment to meet the housing needs of people with disabilities, the NHSPWD has been extended to 2020 to continue to deliver on its aims. </p><p>Implementation of identified actions in the NHSPWD is being driven primarily by the Housing Agency by means of a dedicated sub-group comprising representatives from my Department, the Health Service Executive (HSE), Department of Health, local authorities, the Irish Council for Social Housing and various disability representative organisations.  The Housing subgroup, established in 2012, is continuing work in 2017 under the extended timeframe, to progress a range of priority actions.  An Implementation Monitoring Group (IMG) was established in 2012 to monitor and report on progress. The IMG is chaired by a senior official of my Department and comprises representatives from relevant Government Departments, agencies and disability organisations.  The IMG met most recently on 28 April 2017 and a further meeting is scheduled for October.  Three progress reports on implementation covering the period September 2012 to December 2016 have been published by the IMG to date.  These comprehensive reports are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>Progress on implementation of the NHSPWD will continue to be monitored and reported on by the IMG. </p><p>Some landmark measures in particular have been achieved that will contribute significantly to improving the lives of people with disabilities.  These include the establishment of Housing and Disability Steering Groups (HDSGs) in all housing authorities in 2016 to achieve a coordinated and integrated approach to meeting the housing needs of people with a disability at local level.  The HDSGs are chaired by Directors of Housing Services and include HSE and disability organisations.  Each HDSG has prepared a local Strategic Plan for its own City/County area, to develop specific local strategies to meet identified and emerging need over the next five years.  These Plans, along with the annual <i>Summary of Social Housing Assessments</i>, will allow local authorities to plan more strategically for the housing needs of people with a disability and will support the delivery of accommodation using all appropriate housing supply mechanisms. </p><p>Another key measure commenced last year is a review by the Housing Agency of the <i>National Guidelines for the Assessment and Allocation Process for Housing Provision for People with a Disability,</i>which have been operational in housing authorities since 2014.  This significant body of work involved wide ranging consultation and engagement with relevant stakeholders and the revised Guidelines, when finalised, will take account of experience to date.  As such, they should prove to be a practical and useful resource for people with disabilities, housing authorities, practitioners and all relevant stakeholders.  I understand that the revised Guidelines will be submitted to my Department shortly for consideration and they will be issued to local authorities as soon as possible thereafter.  </p><p>In regard to financial supports, my Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) funds up to 100% of project costs advanced by local authorities to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to provide accommodation for people with specific categories of need, including people with disabilities.  A provision of &euro;66 million is available for the scheme this year.</p><p>My Department also provides funding under three separate schemes for necessary adaptations, repairs or improvement works to the houses of people with disabilities and older people in order to make their accommodation more suitable for their needs, and to facilitate the continued occupancy of their own home for as long as possible.  The 2017 funding allocation of &euro;59.8m represents an increase of some 6% on the funding provided in 2016, and is targeted to reach 10,000 homes.  There is a strong social benefit accruing from this funding in terms of supporting older people, and people with a disability, to continue to live independently in their own homes and therefore, in line with the <i>Programme for Partnership Government,</i>further consideration will be given to increasing this funding over the coming years.</p></reply>

As Minister, I am empowered to grant approved status to housing bodies for this purpose. AHBs are independent, not-for-profit organisations.  They provide affordable rented housing for people who cannot afford to pay private sector rents or buy their own homes, or for particular groups, such as older people or homeless people.  AHBs also include housing co-operatives, which are housing organisations controlled by their members/tenants who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. </p><p>To date, there are 547 bodies with approved status. The register of AHBs can be found on my Department's website at:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>In 2014, my Department established an interim Regulation Committee for the AHB Sector under the auspices of the Housing Agency, which, supported by a Regulation Office based within the Agency, oversees implementation of the voluntary regulation code (VRC) for AHBs.  At present, 245 AHBs have signed up to the VRC. </p><p>My Department does not hold figures on the total number of dwellings provided by AHBs.  However, in its 2015 Annual Report, the Regulation Office stated that the 203 AHBs, which at that time had signed up to the VRC, had a total portfolio of 26,904 dwellings and estimated that this constituted more than 90% of the total estimated housing stock in the sector.  The final figures for the 2016 Annual Report are not yet available but are likely to show an increase of around 15% in the number of registered bodies with a proportionately smaller increase in the number of dwellings, as the newer registrations mostly comprise smaller AHBs.</p><p>Rebuilding Ireland targets the delivery of 47,000 social housing units in the period to 2021. It is estimated that AHBs have the capacity to contribute around a third of these 47,000 new social housing units using a range of delivery methods, including construction, acquisitions and leasing.</p><p>Significant progress has been made by the AHB sector over the last number of years, including the delivery of 1,169 units across both capital and leasing schemes in 2016 alone.  A strong pipeline of new social housing supply is also evident in the latest Rebuilding Ireland Social Housing Construction Status Report, which is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: </p><p><i>http://rebuildingireland.ie/news/social-housing-construction-projects-report-2017/ . </i></p><p>The Report provides details of 607 social housing schemes and 10,072 associated units at various stages of development, including 249 AHB projects, with 4,209 associated units.</p></reply>

It is estimated that AHBs have the capacity to contribute around a third of the 47,000 new social housing units that are targeted over the period to 2021.</p><p>The housing delivery capacity of AHBs will need to expand greatly and they will require significantly increased external investment.  AHBs that have statutorily regulated standards of governance and management capacity will be better able to access private or loan finance. </p><p>The proposed Housing (Regulation of Approved Housing Bodies) Bill and the underlying policy, which was formulated in consultation with the sector, intends to establish a statutory Regulator to oversee the effective governance, financial management and performance of voluntary and co-operative housing bodies.  The Bill aims to safeguard public and private investment in the social housing provision sector, to rationalise and enable increased supply from the voluntary and co-operative housing sector and to ensure that the assets built through investments in the sector are managed sustainably.  The statutory regulatory framework will provide further assurances to investors, tenants, the Government and to the sector itself that social housing providers operate in a well-regulated and stable environment. </p><p>My Department is working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to finalise the text of the Bill for publication as soon as possible.  I had hoped that the Bill would be published during this current D&aacute;il session.  However, the complex nature of some of the issues related to transitioning from voluntary to statutory regulation has required additional time.  Nothwithstanding this, I expect the Bill to be published in time for early consideration in the Autumn Oireachtas Session.  Until such time  as the legislation is enacted and the statutory system of regulation is put in place, the interim regulatory arrangements in operation since 2014 will remain in place.</p></reply>

In relation to Part V, planning authorities have been informed that they should prioritise the acquisition of social houses on site when making Part V agreements. Funding to support the delivery of Part V units is available from my Department.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the housing affordability pressures faced by many households, particularly in certain parts of the country.  It is for this reason that the overarching objective of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness is to increase the supply of new homes to 25,000 per annum by 2020.  In particular, the aim is to increase the supply of high quality homes at more affordable price points as quickly as possible, in areas where demand is greatest.  </p>  <p>  As set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector, published in December 2016, the commitment to develop an affordable rental model, originally contained in Rebuilding Ireland, is now being progressed by local authorities in Rent Pressure Zones.  In this regard, Dublin City Council and the Housing Agency, in partnership with D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, have developed detailed proposals for specific sites they control in Dublin.  My Department is currently working through those proposals with the project sponsors. </p>  <p>  On 27 April, details of some 1,700 hectares of land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership were published on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map, with the potential to deliver some 42,500 homes nationally.  All local authorities have been requested to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for their lands by 30 September 2017.  The final model for bringing forward public lands for housing, including an affordable rental element where appropriate, will be informed by the outcome of the consideration of the initial pathfinder sites. </p>  <p>  In parallel, as part of the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland, my Department is examining the broader issue of housing affordability.  Again, the outcome of the consideration of the specific proposals referred to above will be factored into that review process and my Department will also be consulting more broadly with local authorities generally.</p></reply>

There are currently more than 24,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP and some 18,000 separate landlords and agents currently in receipt of monthly HAP payments.</p><p>Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme increased from &euro;57 million in 2016 to &euro;152.7 million for 2017.  This increase is in order to meet the continuing costs of existing HAP households, and the costs of supporting an additional 15,000 households to be supported by HAP in 2017.  The HAP scheme is funded through a combination of Exchequer monies and tenant differential rents collected in respect of HAP tenancies.</p><p>HAP is a demand led social housing support; in order to be eligible for HAP support, a household must first qualify for social housing support and be placed on a housing list.  A housing authority must carry out an assessment to establish whether the household meets specified statutory eligibility requirements and has a housing need. </p><p>The Summary of Social Housing Assessments 2016 publication brings together information provided by local authorities on households in their functional area qualified for social housing support whose social housing need is not being met.  This report shows that 91,600 households were assessed as qualified for housing support as on 21 September 2016; the report is available at the following weblink:<i>. </i></p><p>A breakdown of the number of households supported by HAP in each local authority area at the end of Quarter 1 2017 is available on my Department's website <i>http://www.housing.gov.ie/housing/social-housing/social-and-affordble/overall-social-housing-provision. </i></p><p>In relation to the number of households in receipt of HAP in which one or more householder is working, my Department does not collate this data. </p><p>I continue to keep the operation of HAP under review but I am currently satisfied with how the scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme committed to under Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>Under the Planning and Development Act, each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned.  Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, <i>inter alia,</i>objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.</p><p>In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department.

However, the matter will be kept under review, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, who has lead responsibility for renewable energy policy, in the context of the Government's <i>White Paper on Energy Policy</i>, published in December 2015, the development of a Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework, as well as the finalisation of a new support scheme for renewable electricity by that Department, expected in 2018.</p></reply>

Working with Dublin City Council, AIB and industry professionals, &Oacute; Cualann are delivering  new 2-, 3- and 4-bed, A2 rated, top quality homes in Dublin with sales prices ranging from &euro;140,000 to &euro;220,000.  The &Oacute; Cualann project demonstrates what can be achieved when Approved Housing Bodies, local authorities, industry professionals and banks are prepared to work together in a co-ordinated, collaborative and proactive way.</p><p>Given the housing affordability pressures faced by many households, particularly in certain parts of the country, the supply of affordable housing is a top priority for the Government.  It is for this reason that the overarching objective of <i>Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>is to increase the supply of new homes to 25,000 per annum by 2020, with a particular emphasis on homes at more affordable price points, in areas where demand is greatest.  </p><p>On 27 April, details of some 1,700 hectares of land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership were published on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map.  This land bank has the potential to deliver some 42,500 homes nationally.  All local authorities have been requested to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for their lands and my Department has highlighted this project to local authorities in that context.</p><p>As set out in the <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>, published in December 2016, the commitment to develop an affordable rental model is now to be progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones.  Lands held by local authorities in such zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, and in particular targeting middle-income households, in mixed-tenure developments.  This is intended to allow the rental units to be made available at below market prices without the need for ongoing rental subsidies.  Accordingly, the provision of &euro;10 million earmarked for the affordable rental scheme is being redirected to support additional activity under other housing programmes within my Department.</p><p>In this regard, Dublin City Council and the Housing Agency, in partnership with D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, have developed detailed proposals for specific sites they control in Dublin.  My Department is currently working through those proposals with the project sponsors.  The final model for bringing forward public lands for housing, including an affordable rental element where appropriate, will be informed by the outcome of the consideration of the initial pathfinder sites. </p><p>In parallel, as part of the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland, my Department is examining the broader issue of housing affordability.  Again, the outcome of the consideration of the specific proposals referred to above will be factored into that review process and my Department will also be consulting more broadly with local authorities generally.</p></reply>

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a body under the aegis of that Department, provides guidance on assessment of potential climate change impacts of a development as part of its <i>Guidelines on Information to be contained in Environmental Impact Statement</i>(EIS) and associated <i>Advice Notes on Current Practice in the Preparation of EIS</i>(2003).

These thresholds also apply in the case where a change or extension to a project listed in Part 2 of Schedule 5 would result in an increase in size greater than 25 per cent of the appropriate threshold.</p><p>In this regard, my Department issued <i>Guidelines for Planning Authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la on carrying out Environmental Impact Assessment</i>in March 2013, the purpose of which was to provide practical guidance on procedural issues, arising from the requirement to carry out an EIA in relevant cases.

Furthermore, subsection (17)(g) of section 48 of the 2000 Act specifically allows local authorities to levy development contributions to fund infrastructure such as the provision of school sites.  Section 49(1) and subsection (7)(d) of section 48 of the Act of 2000 also provide for the adoption of supplementary development contribution schemes by a local authority, whereby contributions can be levied, if necessary, to fund the provision of new schools and ancillary infrastructure. </p>  <p>  The purpose of Part V is that developers should contribute a portion of the &ldquo;planning gain&rdquo; associated with the zoning of the land and the grant of planning permission towards the provision of social and/or affordable housing, in the interests primarily of greater social integration.  Planning authorities have been advised that they should prioritise the provision of social houses on individual development sites when making Part V agreements.  The provision of schools is a separate issue, which is not in my view appropriate to the specific Part V provisions.</p>  <p>  I have no plans at present to amend the legislation in this regard.  I consider there is sufficient flexibility provided under the 2000 Act as outlined above for the levying of development contributions towards school sites, schools and ancillary infrastructure, and this is a matter for each planning authority to consider in the context of their statutory planning functions. </p></reply>

Section 5 of these Guidelines offer advice as regards the structure and content of local area plans and sets out a range of policies that can be put in place to promote and facilitate active and healthy living patterns for local communities.</p><p>These include: </p><p>-  promoting walking, cycling as modes of transport; </p><p>-  accessibility to public open spaces, recreational and sports facilities; </p><p>-  proximity of new development to sustainable travel modes; </p><p>-  provision of play areas; and </p><p>-  careful consideration of the appropriateness of the location of fast food outlets in the vicinity of schools and parks.</p><p>A practical effect of these Guidelines with regard to fast-food outlets is that consideration can be given to the appropriateness of their location in the vicinity of schools and parks, for example in newly developing areas, while at the same time taking into account wider land use considerations.  However, with regard to the many schools located in or near town centres, restriction of fast-food outlets in these kinds of situations needs to be carefully considered on a case by case basis, in view of the mix of existing uses typically found in central areas.</p><p>In addition, planning policy with regard to the location of fast-food outlets needs to be considered also within the wider policy context of practical steps that can be taken to more widely promote and facilitate active and healthy living patterns by enhancing scope for activities such as walking, cycling and sports and active leisure pursuits and their associated facilities.</p><p>At present, I have no plans to introduce any specific legislation in relation to fast food restaurants near schools.

The income limits under the 1999 Scheme were revised on a number of occasions and in 2010 the annual income limit for a single income household was &euro;40,000, while the annual limit for a two income household was &euro;100,000.</p>  <p>  Applicants for affordable housing under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 satisfied the income eligibility requirement if the mortgage repayments for suitable accommodation available in the market would exceed 35% of their net income.  </p>  <p>  In 2011, the Government announced the standing down of Affordable Housing schemes.  In relation to Part V, planning authorities have been informed that they should prioritise the acquisition of social houses on-site when making Part V agreements.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the housing affordability pressures in certain areas.  Fundamentally, it is the under-supply, across all tenures of housing, that is widely accepted as being primarily responsible for driving the high levels of house price and rental inflation we have seen in recent years.  The Government has made housing a top priority and, through the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan, has a framework in place to deliver an increase and acceleration in the supply of high quality social and affordable homes, to buy or rent,  particularly in the major urban areas where demand is greatest.  </p>  <p>  The overarching objective of Rebuilding Ireland is to increase overall housing supply to 25,000 homes per year by 2020.  In order to directly influence and generate supply of new homes, Rebuilding Ireland contains a suite of actions that will increase housing construction and refurbishment.  Under Pillar 2 of the Action Plan, 47,000 new social housing units will be delivered by 2021, supported by &euro;5.35 billion in Exchequer funding.  Of these, 26,000 units will be provided through direct construction and refurbishment.  Significant progress has been made in increasing the build programmes of local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies and there are now over 10,000 new homes in the social housing construction pipeline.</p>  <p>  Pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland contains a set of actions targeted at increasing private housing supply.  The &euro;226m Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund has now been fully allocated and will fund key enabling infrastructure to open up 34 sites across 15 local authorities.  The LIHAF funding has the capacity to encourage the supply of 23,000 new homes by 2021.</p>  <p>  Also under Pillar 3, the State land bank is being actively targeted for the provision of new homes in the immediate term.  In April, the Rebuilding Ireland Map was published, containing details of over 2,000 hectares of land in public ownership, with the potential to deliver some 50,000 new homes nationally.  In practical terms, the development of these public lands will involve accelerating social housing delivery and securing more homes for sale and rent at lower and more affordable price points. </p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland also commits to the introduction of an affordable rental scheme to enhance the provision of affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  As set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector, this commitment is now to be progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones.  Lands held by local authorities in such zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, and in particular targeting middle-income households, in mixed-tenure developments.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a focussed review of Rebuilding Ireland is now underway, with an emphasis on strengthening the measures already in place and identifying new initiatives that add value and raise ambition.  As part of the review process, my Department will focus in particular on the broad issues of housing supply and affordability for different market segments, building on the measures already being advanced. </p></reply>

It states that promotion to the rank of Corporal may be authorised by the Adjutant General when the individual concerned has given long and loyal service and is considered unsuitable because of age to undergo a Potential NCOs course (members who are over 50 years of age will be considered).  It further states that all cases should be kept under review and arrangements should be made to recommend the promotion to the Adjutant General in sufficient time to allow the member to avail of the higher rate of pension and gratuity appropriate to the rank of Corporal.</p>  <p>  Whilst this provision still remains in place, there is no basic criteria specified for such meritorious promotions.  With the advent of modern, competency based promotion systems now implemented in the Defence Forces which take account of a person&rsquo;s previous performance, meritorious based promotion seems at odds with this fair and equitable system.  To that end, the issue of  personnel continuing to be promoted outside of the recognised and objective promotion schemes in place is currently under review by officials in my Department. </p></reply>

This report is a follow up to the first phase of the Climate Study and it further explores the issues raised in the original survey.  The Focus Groups engaged in the study were conducted towards the latter end of last year and early this year.  The comments quoted therein cover a wide range of issues relating to human resources management including, amongst others, pay and conditions (particularly pay for the lowest paid members of the Defence Forces), vacancies, recruitment and retention, promotion systems, performance management, leadership, culture, stress and work-life balance. </p>  <p>  The Deputy has asked a range of questions relating to specific comments within the report.  As advised by the University of Limerick, their findings and recommendations are interconnected and caution should apply to reading any one particular finding in isolation.  In this context, I have addressed the questions in the round in line with the holistic approach being taken in response to the Study.</p>  <p>  Public Service pay is based on collective agreements negotiated with public service trade unions and representative associations.  Since the survey was carried out, PDFORRA has signed up to the Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA), resulting in increases in pay/salary for all their members.  In addition, recent adjustments to salary scales will significantly benefit general service recruits and privates who joined the Defence Forces since January 2013 (increases of between 8% and 24% depending on the scale point). Further benefits are provided for under the extended LRA.  The  extended LRA proposals are under consideration by the Representative Associations.</p>  <p>  I believe that we now have the processes in place to deliver a more effective, energetic and sustainable Defence Forces with a positive outlook into the future.  Delivering on that positive environment and outlook is my objective, together with my Department and the Chief of Staff.</p>  <p>  I was briefed on the Report at the end of June and directed that the IMG Oversight Group be briefed.  I am due to meet the Representative Associations on 13 July 2017 to discuss the issues raised in the report.  It is then my intention to consider publication of the report.  The broad range of HR issues raised in the study   will be further explored by senior management. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware there is a significant ongoing programme of HR development within the Defence Organisation.  This study was intended to inform that work.</p>  <p>  I have instructed both civil and military management to bring forward proposals in respect of retaining specialists, providing for re-entry and where appropriate, direct entry and I expect to be in receipt of those shortly.  The Public Service Pay Commission will further examine the issue of retention of specialist personnel in accordance with the provisions of the recent Pay Agreement.</p>  <p>  I believe that this process has provided an opportunity for members of the Defence Forces including the Representative Associations to express their views and inform consideration of HR policy.  This is to be welcomed.   </p></reply>
