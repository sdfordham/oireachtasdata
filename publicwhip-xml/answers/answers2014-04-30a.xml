I would find it totally unacceptable if any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were to engage in any discriminatory profiling, whether based on race, ethnic origin or otherwise, and I am quite sure that the Garda Commissioner shares my view in this matter.</p><p>In fact, I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not as an institution engage in discriminatory profiling, and specifically that it does not engage in data gathering or data mining based upon discriminatory profiling in respect of race, colour, language, religion, nationality, national or ethnic origin, ethnicity or membership of the traveller community.  I am also advised that, in this regard, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has adopted the definition of racial profiling used by the European Commission on Racism and Intolerance, namely the <i>&quot;use by the police, with no objective and reasonable justification, of grounds such as race, colour, language, religion, nationality or national or ethnic origin, in control, surveillance or investigation activities&quot;.</i>I am also informed that the importance of adhering to best practice in this area is reinforced throughout the range of human rights training provided through Garda training programmes.  I regard it as of the utmost importance that such training is widely provided to Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>It is very important that these clear principles are respected at an individual level in day-to-day policing.  We all understand that Garda&iacute; are often required to assess situations, draw conclusions and take action under pressure based on the available information.  However, it is very important to ensure that no element of stereotyping or prejudice consciously or unconsciously informs their decisions, and that lessons are continuously learned in policing what is now a multi-cultural society. </p><p>I should also say that an area where racial identity and the law comes into particular focus is immigration control.  I believe however that it is perfectly possible to operate an effective system of immigration control without resorting to discriminatory ethnic profiling but relying instead on good intelligence and the professional judgment and experience of our Garda&iacute; and immigration officers, and indeed this has been demonstrated to be the case.</p><p>In this connection, as the Deputy will be aware, the Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, was appointed by me to carry out an independent Inquiry, under Section 42 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, into the circumstances surrounding two children from two different Roma families being taken temporarily into care in October 2013.  Ms Logan has now submitted her report to me and, subject to certain requisite legal matters being addressed, this report will be published.  I am not in a position to comment on this report prior to its publication, but this will provide an opportunity for us to discuss these issues again. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-30a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000050#WRA01100"><p>The functions and powers of Joint Policing Committees (JPCs) are set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides for a Committee in each local authority area.  The Act provides that JPCs operate under guidelines issued by the Minister for Justice and Equality after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. </p><p>JPCs are a partnership process involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the elected national and local representatives for the area, with the participation of the community and voluntary sector and local authority officials.   The essential role of the Committees is to advise and make recommendations to local Garda management and to the local authority in relation to relevant local issues.  While anti-social behaviour is certainly addressed by JPCs, I would like to clarify that JPCs are not an additional administrative or operational entity and that the implementation of policing strategy in an area remains a matter for the Garda&iacute;.  Likewise, JPCs do not supplant the proper role of local authorities in carrying out their functions.  However, JPCs do have an important role in supporting collaborative actions between local stakeholders and this promotes a more efficient and co-ordinated approach to addressing policing and crime prevention issues in the area in question.</p><p>In so far as the resources for community policing are concerned, as the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the deployment of Garda resources.  I can assure him, however, that Garda management keep that deployment under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  Each Garda District and Divisional Officer also configures their policing response to local conditions to ensure that an appropriate policing service is continuously delivered to the local area and there is extensive engagement with the community on issues of concern as and where they arise. </p><p>I should also note that, as the Deputy may be aware, I initiated the review of the operation of Joint Policing Committees in the context of the commitment in the Programme for Government to build on existing community policing partnerships.  My Department, together with the Garda authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has examined the feedback obtained during the review process, as well as related issues arising from the broader process of local government reform.  I can advise the Deputy that recommendations concerning revisions to the JPC guidelines are at an advanced stage of preparation.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-30a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000050#WRA01300"><p>The Data Protection Commissioner published a data protection audit report in March this year in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na covering the period 2011 to October 2013.  It includes a number of detailed recommendations made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na arising from the audit along with the responses of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The full report is available on the website of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at www.garda.ie. </p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must of course take its obligations under the Data Protection legislation very seriously.  I am pleased to note that the main finding of the report was that the majority of the areas examined demonstrated a professional police force operating in compliance with data protection legislation.  I am advised that the implementation of many of the recommendations in the report was already well advanced or completed by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the end of the audit, and that an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na intend to implement any outstanding recommendations as soon as possible, subject to any necessary changes to legislation.</p><p>  A central focus of the audit was the PULSE system.  The report expressed concerns in relation to the oversight of access by individual members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to records of individuals and the related risk of disclosure outside of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While this is of course a matter for concern, it should be borne in mind that a number of Garda&iacute; have been subject to discipline for inappropriate access to PULSE within the period under review, and the Data Protection Commissioner has acknowledged that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have taken steps to counter any future inappropriate access to PULSE.</p><p>  I am further advised that the Garda Professional Standards Unit has also worked with the Garda IT Centre to develop a report that will allow District Officers to review checks that are carried out by members under their control and in particular the reasons being recorded on the PULSE system for these checks.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to work closely with the Data Protection Commissioner to ensure its delivery of best practice in data protection.</p></reply>

I am anxious not to say or do anything which could be seen as in any way trespassing upon this independent inquiry, so I am constrained in what I can say, especially as neither the Verrimus nor the RITS  reports have been published and both are among the documents being examined by the inquiry.</p><p>  In my letter to the Committee of 11 March 2014 I provided information on the main issues identified by RITS.  In a subsequent letter to the Committee on 7 April, 2014 I further explained that to go beyond this would, I believe, effectively require making public the report and the expert opinion, or at least key elements of them, at a time when these confidential documents form a critical part of the material under inquiry by Judge Cooke.  As indicated in that letter, I would suggest that, in circumstances where the report of Judge Cooke is expected shortly, it would be best at this stage to await his findings.</p></reply>

Other incidents involve the perpetrators attempting to coerce payment for a fictitious liability, or pressurising householders to reveal personal financial information.  Older or vulnerable persons are often targeted by these offenders.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is proactive in highlighting this type of offending through widely circulated crime prevention information leaflets, at community meetings, and using local media and the national Crimecall programme.  One measure of particular note is the Bogus Caller Card Initiative, which was developed as part of the Garda Older Persons Strategy.  This initiative provides the householder with printed Caller Cards to give to callers offering a service from door to door, requesting them to leave their contact details so that they can get back to them if they require that service. The initiative is intended to empower the older person to take control of these situations and discourage bogus callers.</p><p>  All incidents of this nature are taken very seriously by the Garda&iacute; and anyone who feels they have been the victim of such an offence is encouraged to report it, even where they may feel some sense of embarrassment at having been victimised in this way.  Similarly, anyone who becomes aware that bogus traders appear to be operating in an area should bring it to Garda attention.  Clearly, information of this nature is of great assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in putting in place appropriate operational responses, and in alerting the community to the risks presented.  In this regard the Garda&iacute; work closely with local organisations, notably Community Alert and Neighbourhood watch, to disseminate information about this type of offending and raise awareness about the practical steps householders can take to protect themselves.</p></reply>

The full report is available on its website: www.isi.gov.ie.  These statistics will be updated on a quarterly basis.</p><p>With regard to the number of approved arrangements there were forty four (44) Debt Relief Notices; seven (7) Debt Settlement Arrangements and four (4) Personal Insolvency Arrangements agreed as at 31<sup>st</sup>March.  The total number of insolvency applications up to 31<sup>st</sup>March was five hundred and twenty three (523).</p><p>Since its establishment the ISI has overseen the introduction of the debt relief solutions introduced by the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  As a result, insolvent debtors now have viable options available to them to deal with their indebtedness. While the numbers of insolvency arrangements in place are lower than expected, it is clear that the availability of these options has encouraged creditors and debtors to reach settlements through informal arrangements.</p><p>The number of new cases which have entered the ISI&rsquo;s system since the beginning of the year and feedback received by the ISI from Personal Insolvency Practitioners and Approved Intermediaries suggest that the uptake of formal insolvency arrangements will increase significantly in future.</p><p>The development by the ISI of protocols between creditors and practitioners covering Debt Settlement Arrangements and Personal Insolvency Arrangements are expected to assist in that regard.</p></reply>

The Bill will create a range of offences relating to information systems and data, including illegally accessing a system, interference with systems or data and illegal interception of data.</p><p>  The Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation and I would hope to publish it in the autumn. Enactment of this legislation will also be the last legislative measure necessary to enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.</p><p>  With regard to the investigation of cybercrime, I am informed that the strategy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard focuses on prevention, detection and training.</p><p>  The Computer Crime Investigation Unit (CCIU) of the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation is the primary Garda unit responsible for investigating computer crime in Ireland. The Unit also provides expert assistance to Senior Investigating Officers and Investigation Teams tasked with the investigation of this type of criminality on a District and Divisional basis.</p><p>  Members of the CCIU also provide warnings to the public in relation to various types of cybercrime, including Computer viruses, Denial-of-service attacks, Malware, Fraud and identity theft and Phishing scams.  The CCIU is also represented on the Irish Payment Card Service Organisation and the Irish Banking Federation High Tech Crime Forum.</p><p>  A member of the CCIU is on full time secondment with Ireland's Computer Emergency Response Team. The role of the Response Team, which was established under the auspices of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources as part of a series of initiatives to deal with the general issue of cybersecurity, is to prepare and manage cyber incidents in conjunction with relevant stakeholders.</p><p>  I can also inform the Deputy that members of the CCIU continue to be trained in the techniques necessary to counter cybercrime including in the area of cyber forensic examination.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also regularly liaise with Interpol, Europol and the European Centre for Cyber Crime which was established in 2013 under the auspices of Europol.</p><p>  Within my own Department, the Office for Internet Safety has oversight of Hotline.ie, the confidential service that receives reports of suspected illegal content on the internet and, where appropriate, arranges to have such content removed.</p><p>  Finally, the Deputy may also be interested to know that Ireland also participates in the Global Alliance Against Child Sexual Abuse Online which provides for shared policy targets, operational goals and specific actions identified by the participating countries.</p></reply>

This figure does not include the three members of the Commission or members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on secondment with GSOC.</p><p>  As with the Public Service generally, GSOC has been subject to staffing constraints, and has had to prioritise work and manage resources with maximum efficiency.  However, there are a number of developments currently under way which will have to be taken into account in this regard.</p><p>  At my request, and following a decision by Government, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is reviewing the effectiveness of the provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and Regulations made under the Act insofar as they relate to the oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the powers and remit of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.</p><p>  It is also the case that the Government has agreed that an appropriate amendment be made to the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 to enable GSOC to be prescribed under that Bill as a body to which disclosures may be made by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  More generally, the Government at its meeting on 25 March 2014 reiterated its commitment to the reform of Garda oversight and accountability, which will include the establishment of an independent Garda authority appropriate to Ireland&rsquo;s needs and which will maintain appropriate democratic accountability to the Oireachtas.  A new Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform has been established to oversee the development of proposals for this new authority, and other associated reforms to the policing and justice system.  The Cabinet Committee is chaired by the Taoiseach and its membership includes the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and myself as Minister for Justice and Equality.  This Committee will make formal proposals to the Government for its consideration and final approval.</p><p>  I acknowledge that changes to the remit of the Ombudsman Commission arising from these developments may require a review of the adequacy of the resources available to GSOC.  Obviously this will be dependent on the exact nature of any changes that are agreed.  When a clearer picture is known this will be the subject of discussions with GSOC and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

At that meeting the Group raised with me a number of issues of concern it has with regard to events surrounding the Omagh bombing.  The Group also presented me with a copy of a document it has compiled setting out these concerns in support of its call for a public inquiry into various matters surrounding the Omagh bombing.</p><p>  I have been in the process of finalising a detailed consideration of the matters which have been raised insofar as they relate to this State and to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, given the detailed and sensitive nature of the material contained in the document, that consideration could not be expected to be concluded quickly and it has required some time for the matters raised to be given full consideration.</p><p>  However, as the Deputy will be aware, earlier this month a man was arrested in Northern Ireland and has been charged with the 29 murders caused by the bomb at Omagh.  In these circumstances, I believe it is appropriate and the safest course of action to postpone finalising my consideration of the matters raised by the Omagh Group until the prosecution process in Northern Ireland has been completed.  We all share a desire for those persons who carried out the terrorist bombing at Omagh to be made amenable to the courts for their abominable actions and I believe we must all be careful to ensure that we do not do or say anything that could in any way be interpreted to interfere with that process.</p><p>  I have communicated this view directly to the Omagh Group.  It is, of course, understandable that the Group wishes to receive a response to its concerns and I remain anxious to ensure that can take place as soon as is prudent.</p></reply>

The core mandate of UNAMID is the protection of civilians and is also responsible for contributing to security for humanitarian assistance, monitoring and verifying implementation of agreements, assisting an inclusive political process, contributing to the promotion of human rights and the rule of law.  Last year the mandate of UNAMID was extended until August 2014. Ireland does not contribute personnel to UNAMID.  UNAMID is one of the largest UN missions currently deployed with over 19,000 peacekeepers. Since its deployment, 191 mission personnel have been killed, with the last recorded casualty in December 2013.  Earlier this month the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2148 which expressed deep concern at the considerable deterioration of the security situation in Darfur during 2013. I share these concerns and I strongly condemn the attacks against UNAMID. I fully support the Security Council&rsquo;s call on the Government of Sudan to investigate these attacks and bring the perpetrators to justice.</p><p>  The situation in Sudan and Darfur is monitored on an ongoing basis by the EU, the UN and other international partners. Ireland is working closely with our EU partners and others to ensure that, in addition to a focus on the political and security situation, priority is given by the international community to the vital issues of human rights and humanitarian access to people and communities affected by the conflict and the tension in the region. </p><p>  I commend the work of the African Union and United Nations in Darfur and reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s full support for the UNAMID mission.</p></reply>

When I met with Colombia&rsquo;s President last year, human rights issues featured prominently in our discussion.  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns are also raised regularly with Colombian authorities by officials of my Department.We continue to work closely with our partners in the EU to monitor and to support the progressive improvement of the human rights situation in Colombia, including through the provision of development assistance.  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns regarding human rights were also raised at the level of the United Nations during the 2013 Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review of Colombia.</p><p>  A number of positive developments have been noted by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and others. These include the peace process with its agenda covering critical areas including rural development and political participation, the role of the National Ombudsman&rsquo;s Office and the Victim&rsquo;s and Land Restitution Law and other land initiatives to address vulnerability and promote positive social change.</p><p>  However, there remain issues of serious concern such as the protection of human rights defenders, weaknesses in the justice system and reports of violations of human rights.</p><p>  I agree with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights that many human rights violations that are linked to the internal armed conflict could end or be greatly reduced if progress in the peace negotiations leads to well conceived and implemented peace accords.  A peace agreement and an end to hostilities would create significant opportunities for resources across society to be directed towards building a stable and equitable Colombia.</p><p>  The peace process underway is therefore of great significance.  I commend all those that are working constructively in the process and hope that their efforts will bring an end to a long conflict in Colombia that has caused much suffering.</p></reply>

Serious questions have been raised in relation to this case, including Mr. Gangadharan&rsquo;s claim that his confession, the only evidence produced by the prosecution at the trial, was given under duress. As I understand an appeal process was launched last November and this is currently ongoing. Both the Irish Government and the EU have consistently held a strong and principled position against the death penalty in all cases and under all circumstances, and we continue to seek its universal and permanent abolition. This view is only accentuated in any case where there are questions as to whether international standards of fair trial have been met. I strongly stress the cruel and irreversible nature of capital punishment, with no credible evidence that it deters crime. Ireland has consistently called on all states to immediately adopt a moratorium on executions, with a view to eventual abolition, most recently at a high level panel on the issue at the 25th session of the UN Human Rights Council in March 2014. The 2013 EU country human rights strategy for the UAE, which Ireland developed in conjunction with other EU Member States, also prioritises support for abolition of the death penalty.  In a welcome development at the end of January, the President of the United Arab Emirates, His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, ordered a stay on executions in the UAE, though it is not clear if this only applies to those convicted of murder. EU High Representative Catherine Ashton welcomed this move in a statement on 7 February, in which she expressed her hope that it will constitute a first step towards a definitive moratorium on the use of the death penalty in the UAE. I strongly endorse HR Ashton&rsquo;s call that the stay on executions will include all those sentenced to the death penalty in the UAE.  The Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi, in cooperation with other EU Member States, regularly raises human rights issues in their contacts and dialogue with the UAE authorities. This includes with regard to both the death penalty and the situation and treatment of migrant workers in the UAE. Officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and in the Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi will continue to follow closely developments with regard to human rights issues in the UAE, including with regard to use of the death penalty and the specific case of Mr. Gangadharan, and will endeavour to make representations to the UAE authorities at every appropriate opportunity.</p></reply>

The Government, along with our partners at the EU and UN, condemns all forms of external support to destabilising forces active in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  The focus by all sides must be on finding a durable solution to the ongoing crisis in the DRC and the region.  It is imperative that regional Governments, including the Government of Rwanda, cooperate with the United Nations and play a positive role in searching for peace and stability. In this regard, I note that Rwanda is one of the signatories of the Framework Agreement for Peace, Security and Cooperation in the Great Lakes Region which was signed in the presence of the UN Secretary General in Addis Ababa on 24 February 2013.  Ireland is supporting former President Mary Robinson in her important role, as Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General for the Great Lakes region of Africa, to coordinate and assess the implementation of national and regional commitments under the Framework Agreement.  In December 2013, Ireland contributed &euro;300,000 to the UN Trust Fund in support of the Office of the Special Envoy.  We are also actively considering support for the Women&rsquo;s Platform for the peace process in the Great Lakes Region which is under the guidance of Special Envoy Robinson.</p><p>  Since 2009, Ireland has provided &euro;44.6 million in response to the crisis in the DRC.  In 2013 alone, Ireland provided over &euro;5.5 million in humanitarian funding to the DRC - &euro;3.8 million was provided to the Common Humanitarian Fund for the DRC, while the remaining &euro;1.8 million was allocated to NGO partners.</p></reply>

Applications from first time applicants are currently take 10/11 working days.  The attraction and popularity of the Passport Express service is reflected on the fact that to date 141,000 Irish citizens have applied through Passport Express representing an 11% increase in demand over 2013 and 15% over 2012.  This increase in demand can be partly explained by two sharp peaks so far in 2014 as a result of naturalisation ceremonies in January and March, when approximately 8,000 new Irish citizens largely applied for their passports within a relatively short period of time.  This has adversely impacted on the finite resources available to the Passport Service over a number of weeks in terms of the processing time for passport applications.  There is no doubt that this stretch on resources served to delay the delivery of passport services for a number customers.  This delay in the delivery of services is regretted.</p><p>  However, the delivery of all passport services is conditional on the available resources at the time of application and must be cognisant of the legal requirements of the Passports Act 2008 and related regulations.  In this regard, it is not possible to provide an absolute guarantee in terms of the delivery of any passport service.  Nonetheless, the ten working day turnaround period for Passport Express applications is a daily business goal by which the Passport Services vigorously works to and is the standard of performance by which it reports to the general public each week on the Department&rsquo;s website www.passport.ie.</p><p>  I should also explain that the charge for adults submitting applications through Passport Express can be broken down into two components: &euro;80 paid to the State, which is the standard cost for a passport application and &euro;9 to An Post to cover the cost of the receiving applications, the traceability systems and guaranteed postal delivery element.</p><p>  There has been no increase in the cost of the standard fee for a passport since 2009.  The An Post element increased from &euro;8.50 to &euro;9 in 2012, after a long period unchanged, to reflect more general increases in the cost of postal delivery.</p><p>  I believe that the Passport Express service continues to represent excellent value for money and do not see any scope for price reductions at this time.</p></reply>

As the number of fatalities surpasses an estimated 150,000 people, there are now over 9.3 million people within Syria who are in need of immediate life-saving support, with a further 2.7 million Syrian refugees requiring assistance in neighbouring countries.  Ireland has been to the fore in international efforts to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people, and is one of the most generous contributors to the international humanitarian response on a per capita basis. In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees, at the Second International Humanitarian Pledging Conference which took place in Kuwait on January 15th, I announced Ireland&rsquo;s pledge of &euro;12 million in humanitarian assistance for 2014. This pledge brings Ireland&rsquo;s overall funding commitment for the period 2011 to 2014 to &euro;26.011 million, of which over &euro;20 million has been disbursed to date. Funds have been provided to a range of established UN partners as well as to Irish NGOs operational in Syria and the region.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-30a.117.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000052#WRC03100"><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that combating the illegal tobacco trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for them. Their work against this illegal activity includes a range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible. This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country.</p><p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>  There is extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market. In addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud office, OLAF, in the ongoing programmes at international level to tackle the illicit trade.</p><p>  Legislative action has been taken over recent years to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners have the requisite powers to respond effectively to the problem of the illegal tobacco trade. The Finance Act 2012 clarified the legal basis for Revenue officers to open and examine the contents of postal and courier packets that are reasonably believed to contain untaxed excise products. The Finance Act 2013 introduced new offences and forfeiture measures relating to the illicit production of tobacco, including offences of involvement with illicit tobacco production, knowingly dealing in or delivering any illicit tobacco product and keeping materials and equipment for the purposes of illicit production. Provision was made also for the forfeiture of any equipment or materials, including unmanufactured tobacco, used for illicit production. That Act also strengthened the offence provisions relating to the sale or delivery of unstamped tobacco products. The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 provided that a person suspected of an offence of dealing in, or with, unstamped tobacco products must provide information to a Revenue Officer or a Garda and may be required to present any tobacco product concerned for examination, and makes provision for search by a Revenue Officer or Garda of any bag or other receptacle that he or she reasonably believes to contain tobacco products that are concerned in the offence.</p><p>  As well as those changes to primary law Ireland, in accordance with EU Directive 2008/118/EU, introduced a quantitative restriction, with effect from 1 January 2014, on the number of cigarettes that may be brought into the State for personal use by individuals travelling from Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. The Excise Duty on Cigarettes (Quantitative Restrictions) Order 2013 (S.I. No. 553 of 2013) provides that the number of tax-paid cigarettes that may be brought into Ireland for personal use by individuals travelling from those Member States, without payment of further excise duty in Ireland, is restricted to 300. Anyone with cigarettes in excess of that quantity must declare them to a Revenue Officer and pay the appropriate excise duty. This restriction will remain in place until 31 December 2017 or until such time as the particular Member State has achieved the required EU minimum tax levels, whichever is the earlier.</p><p>  I am advised that the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the proposed standardised packaging of tobacco products will not damage their work to tackle the illicit tobacco trade. Revenue relies on the tax stamp to identify tax paid tobacco products, and the standardised packaging legislation will accommodate the stamp. The tax stamp contains a range of features designed to minimise the risk of counterfeiting.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners will maintain their commitment to acting against all stages of the supply chain for illicit tobacco products and will continue to make every effort to ensure that those involved in the illicit trade are brought to account before the courts for their criminal activities. A new multi-annual strategy for dealing with the problem is being drawn up, and the Revenue Commissioners are consulting with key stakeholders in preparing this document.</p></reply>

The House was also informed that the Chief State Solicitor was the solicitor on record acting for all State defendants and that the case was being vigorously defended. I am advised that the High Court, on the application of the State defendants, made an Order in July 2013 dismissing the Plaintiff's claim on the grounds that it was frivolous and vexatious and disclosed no cause of action against the Defendants. This decision is under appeal to the Supreme Court.</p><p>  I am also advised that another person is challenging the constitutionality of the Local Property Tax. This challenge is at an early stage and has not yet been set down for hearing in the High Court.</p><p>  Section 156 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that where the &euro;100 Household Charge for 2012 had not been paid by 1 July 2013 the arrears amount is increased to &euro;200 and is treated as Local Property Tax (LPT). I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the obligation of a liable person to pay the &euro;200 arrears is not impacted by whether the person is in the process of challenging the legality or the constitutionality of LPT/household charge in the courts. Accordingly, the existence of legal proceedings before the Courts does not prevent the collection of such arrears and where a liable person has not paid these arrears, payment will be pursued, where necessary, using the range of collection/enforcement powers at Revenue's disposal which include, mandatory deduction at source from salary, various occupational pensions or from certain Government payments.</p></reply>

The home regulator must then provide the host regulator with a certificate attesting that the insurer covers the EU Solvency Capital Requirement, as well as the nature of the business which the insurer intends to undertake. The insurer may start to pursue business from the date that the certificate is communicated to the host regulator, in this case the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p>Setanta Insurance Company Limited (&quot;Setanta&quot;) is a Maltese incorporated company which was both authorised and prudentially supervised by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). Setanta was regulated at EU regulatory level in accordance with a directive known as Solvency I which currently places requirements on the amount of regulatory capital European insurance companies must hold against unforeseen events. I understand that Setanta met its EU regulatory obligations and under EU law is therefore entitled to trade across EU borders.  Following negotiations that were completed at European level in November, 2013, a new regime known as Solvency II will commence on 1 January 2016, which will further strengthen the EU regulatory framework. The Solvency II EU Directive sets out new, stronger EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection.  The new regime will also ensure greater cooperation between supervisors.</p><p>On 16 April, 2014, Setanta Insurance Company Ltd (&quot;Setanta&quot;) determined that the company was insolvent. This means that Setanta does not have sufficient funds to be able to honour its full obligations towards claimants, policyholders and other creditors. It is expected that Setanta will be formally placed into liquidation by the Malta Financial Services Authority in the coming days.  Policyholders can expect to be given two months cancellation notification (in accordance with the Central Bank of Ireland's Consumer Protection Code 2012) during which period cover will remain in force.  While policies will remain valid until the required notice period has been served, it is important to be clear that the amounts due under any claims may not be fully recoverable in all circumstances. In this light, it is important to note that the Central Bank of Ireland has advised all Setanta policyholders to arrange for alternative cover without delay.</p><p>The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (&quot;MIBI&quot;) have indicated that they intend to accept all third party claims in connection to Setanta policies. MIBI is a non-profit-making organisation which was established by Agreement between the Government and those companies underwriting motor insurance in Ireland. The principal role of MIBI is to compensate innocent victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles.</p><p>First party claims on personal insurance policies will be payable from the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) once Setanta is formally placed into liquidation.  Claimants will be eligible for 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser. Under Section 3.6 of the Insurance Amendment Act 1964 (as amended) first party claims by a body corporate or unincorporated body are not covered by the ICF.</p><p>The refund of premiums for commercial and personal insurance policies is not covered by the ICF or MIBI. A portion of the premium refunds may, however, be available upon completion of the Setanta liquidation.</p><p>Until otherwise advised those policyholders which have been affected by the collapse should continue to contact to Setanta Insurance Services Limited at 0818 255 255 (if calling from outside Ireland +353 1 897 6300) or on .</p></reply>

Ireland, like other smaller member states, is geographically and historically a peripheral country in Europe. A competitive corporate tax rate is a tool to address the economic limitations that come with being a peripheral country, as compared to larger core countries. Ireland's corporation tax rate plays an important role in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland and thereby increasing employment here.</p><p>As to how successful we are at getting this balance right, the Deputy may wish to note that the revenue generated by Corporation Tax in Ireland is broadly line with the EU average.  In 2013 we collected just over &euro;4.2bn which is 11.3% of overall Exchequer tax revenue and equivalent to 2.6% of Gross Domestic Product ('GDP').</p><p>Any increase in the 12.5% rate could unfortunately result in a behavioural change on the part of taxpayers and potentially have a negative impact on economic growth as a result.  In relation to the &quot;tipping point&quot; referred to by the Deputy, I would draw attention to an OECD multi-country study &quot;Tax Effects on Foreign Direct Investment - Recent Evidence &amp;amp; Policy Analysis&quot;, which found that a 1% increase in the corporate tax rate reduces inward investment by 3.7% on average.  On this basis, it would take only a 2.5% increase in the rate (to 15%) to decrease Ireland's inward investment by nearly 10%. This assumes the average applies across the board but in fact the effect is likely to be more extreme for Ireland.  In another report by the OECD, &quot;Tax Policy Reform and Economic Growth&quot;, corporate taxes were identified as the tax which are most harmful to economic growth prospects.   These are just examples of the types of international reports my Department has identified as relevant when looking at the relationship between tax, foreign direct investment and job creation.</p><p>Further, it is worth saying that the certainty around the rate of Irish corporation tax is one of its biggest strengths, and it would be difficult to justify an increase in the context of Ireland's stated position that we will not change our corporation tax strategy. Even a marginal change in the rate of corporation tax would undermine both our long held stance on this issue and the certainty of business, domestic and international, in our resolve to maintain that position.</p><p>As I said at Budget time, the 12.5% is settled policy and the Government remains 100% committed to this rate.</p><p>(2008) OECD Tax Policy Studies No. 17</p><p>(2010) OECD Tax Policy Studies No. 20 </p></reply>

The total number of claims received by Revenue at that date in respect of 2013 is 2,849 and the total value of these claims is &euro;9,472,859. To date, 1,670 of these claims have been processed resulting in the repayment or offset of &euro;6,218,409. The remaining &euro;3,254,450 is being processed through the recently developed automated system and will be repaid/offset in the coming days.</p><p>  The processes for the scheme are designed to address the risk of widespread abuse of the scheme and to ensure that claimants meet the scheme's qualifying conditions. These requirements are necessary to enable Revenue to manage repayments to qualifying transport operators while controlling the risk of fraud.</p><p>  As part of the scheme's risk control framework, provision was made for certain restrictions on the means by which the auto-diesel concerned may be purchased. Purchases in bulk must be made from a licensed mineral oil trader, and delivered, in a quantity exceeding 2,000 litres, to a premises or place that is under the control of that qualifying road transport operator. Purchases by means of a fuel card, approved by Revenue for the purpose of the scheme, also qualify for repayment and there is no minimum requirement on purchases made in this way. A fuel card will be approved where Revenue is satisfied that the fuel card provider will supply it with the information required about purchases of auto-diesel by means of that card. Fuel cards are widely available and are usable across the road network and there are a number of fuel card providers who can supply suitable fuel cards to road transport operators and fuel retailers.</p><p>  Bulk purchases from licensed mineral oil traders can be verified by reference to the monthly electronic returns that the oil traders are required to make to Revenue. These returns form part of the supply chain controls introduced by Revenue to tackle the problem of illicit fuel, prior to the introduction of the diesel rebate scheme. The return provides an electronic record of the purchases, stock movements and sales of mineral oil each month by licensed mineral oil traders, by oil product type, including bulk sales to customers exceeding 2000 litres. This information can be used to verify electronically claims for bulk purchases under the diesel rebate scheme. A reduction in the minimum bulk purchase requirement for the diesel rebate scheme would require a corresponding reduction in the minimum threshold for purchases to be reported by mineral oil traders in their monthly returns, greatly increasing the number of transactions to be reported in these returns and the related administrative burden on the mineral oil traders.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the requirements for the scheme achieve the right balance between making the scheme available to compliant transport operators and allowing Revenue to manage effectively the risk of fraud and I have no plans to change them.</p></reply>

As a direct consequence of the non engagement, Revenue issued an instruction to her employer on 16 September 2013 to commence deductions from her salary in respect of the outstanding LPT liability. The instruction was subsequently revoked on 15 October 2013 on foot of Question 44090 and the Property Register was amended to reflect the correct ownership of the property.</p><p>  From examining the person's 2013 P60 records it appears that the employer did not activate the deduction before receiving the revocation notice of 16 October. On that basis Revenue did not make any refund to the person. The person was subsequently contacted directly by a member of the LPT team who explained the situation to her and asked her to submit confirmation of any deductions made in respect of LPT by her employer.</p><p>  Revenue has assured me that as soon as it receives the required confirmation it will investigate the matter without delay and will refund or offset any money identified as owing to the person.</p></reply>

The objective of the review is focused solely on determining whether the banks have enough provisions against their loans and capital. Irish banks have just undergone such an exercise, their second in less than three years, which led to a substantial increase in their loan loss provisions at year end. As I have stated previously, I do not anticipate any capital issues for the Irish banks arising from the Comprehensive Assessment.</p></reply>

The scheme does not apply to sales of petrol.   In order to address the risk of widespread abuse of the scheme, provision was made for certain restrictions on the means by which the auto-diesel concerned may be purchased. Purchases in bulk must be made from a licensed mineral oil trader, and delivered, in a quantity exceeding 2,000 litres, to a premises or place that is under the control of that qualifying road transport operator. </p><p>  Bulk purchases from licensed mineral oil traders can be verified by reference to the monthly electronic returns that the oil traders are required to make to Revenue. These returns form part of the supply chain controls introduced by Revenue to tackle the problem of illicit fuel, prior to the introduction of the diesel rebate scheme. The return provides an electronic record of the purchases, stock movements and sales of mineral oil each month by licenced mineral oil traders, by oil product type, including bulk sales to customers exceeding 2000 litres. This information can be used to verify electronically claims for bulk purchases under the diesel rebate scheme. A reduction in the minimum bulk purchase requirement for the diesel rebate scheme would require a corresponding reduction in the minimum threshold for purchases to be reported by mineral oil traders in their monthly returns, greatly increasing the number of transactions to be reported in these returns and the related administrative burden on the mineral oil traders.</p><p>  Purchases by means of a fuel card, approved by Revenue for the purpose of the scheme, also qualify for repayment and there is no minimum requirement on purchases made in this way. A fuel card will be approved where Revenue is satisfied that the fuel card provider will supply it with the information required about purchases of auto-diesel by means of that card. Fuel cards are widely available and are usable across the road network and there are a number of fuel card providers who can supply suitable fuel cards to road transport operators and fuel retailers.</p><p>  The current purchasing arrangements under the scheme are necessary to enable Revenue to manage repayments to qualifying transport operators while controlling the risk of fraud. I am satisfied that the purchasing arrangements achieve the right balance between making the scheme available to compliant transport operators and allowing Revenue to manage effectively the risk of fraud and I do not plan to change these arrangements.   </p></reply>

Autism assistance dogs are primarily trained to act to improve the behaviour of the child by promoting calmness and acting as a safety aid.  These dogs act as a constant companion for the child and in certain circumstances can enhance the child's social skills and interaction with their family and peers. </p><p>  While the companionship, improved calmness and other such benefits are well testified, a medical basis that would bring such effects under the health legislation does not exist, and to allow relief for health expenses in this context would inevitably lead to calls for similar treatments, therapies or pet companions in other areas of disability to qualify for relief.</p></reply>

Accordingly any chargeable gain made on a disposal of land is subject to capital gains tax. Roll-over relief has not been available in respect of any disposals of chargeable assets made on or after 4 December 2002.</p><p>A chargeable gain is the difference between the sale price (net of incidental costs  incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the sale   e.g., solicitors costs, auctioneers costs, advertising costs) and the purchase price (including the incidental costs  incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the acquisition   e.g. solicitor's  fees, auctioneer's fees, stamp duty).  If the land was owned prior to 6 April 1974, the market value of the land as at 6 April 1974 is substituted for the purchase price and incidental costs of acquisition.   Any costs of a capital nature incurred in enhancing the land are allowable as a deduction in computing a chargeable gain. Where the land was owned at 6 April 1974 only  costs of a capital nature incurred since that date in enhancing the land are allowable as a deduction ( as any market value figure at 6 April 1974 would reflect any such costs incurred before that date). </p><p>If the land was purchased on or before 31 December 2002, the purchase price and incidental costs of acquisition are adjusted by an indexation factor to take account of the impact of inflation from the year  of acquisition (or 6 April 1974, where the asset was acquired prior to that date)  to 31 December 2002. In the case of development land, indexation relief is confined to the current use value of the land.</p><p>Retirement relief or farm restructuring relief are available to farmers who satisfy the requirements governing these reliefs. However I understand that the individual in respect of whom this question is asked is not a farmer and would not therefore qualify for these particular reliefs.</p><p>The first &euro;1,270 of any capital gain made by an individual in any year is not chargeable to capital gains tax. The current rate of capital gains tax on any chargeable gain is 33%. </p><p>Detailed information on all aspects of capital gains tax (including allowable deductions, indexation relief factors and the method of calculation of a capital gain), is available in Revenue's Guide to Capital Gains Tax, leaflet CGT1, on the Revenue website, . </p></reply>

In recognition of these cost pressures, a number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents. These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free childcare places to qualifying F&Aacute;S and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school. Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided. </p><p>The Department of Social Protection provides financial support to families on low pay by way of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and to one-parent families through the one-parent family payment. </p><p>In addition, a Single Person Child Carer tax credit of &euro;1650 is provided as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000. This credit and band is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated. The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and<b></b>increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year.<b></b>To claim the Single Person Child Carer Credit a claimant must not be married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting.</p><p>The Universal Social Charge (USC) was introduced in Budget 2011 to replace the Income Levy and Health Levy. It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base with very few exemptions. </p><p>In Budget 2012 I announced that those earning less than &euro;10,036 would no longer be subject to the Universal Social Charge. This in itself has removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge and is of particular benefit to the low paid.</p><p>I have no plans to introduce tax relief to assist parents with the cost of childcare. As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. As the Deputy will also appreciate, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current budgetary constraints. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

This means that Setanta does not have sufficient funds to be able to honour its full obligations towards claimants, policyholders and other creditors. It is expected that Setanta will be formally placed into liquidation by the Malta Financial Services Authority in the coming days.   Policyholders can expect to be given two months cancellation notification (in accordance with the Central Bank of Ireland's Consumer Protection Code 2012) during which period cover will remain in force.  While policies will remain valid until the required notice period has been served, it is important to be clear that the amounts due under any claims may not be fully recoverable in all circumstances. In this light, it is important to note that the Central Bank of Ireland has advised all Setanta policyholders to arrange for alternative cover without delay. </p><p>The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (&quot;MIBI&quot;) have indicated that they intend to accept all third party claims in connection to Setanta policies. MIBI is a non-profit-making organisation which was established by Agreement between the Government and those companies underwriting motor insurance in Ireland. The principal role of MIBI is to compensate innocent victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles. </p><p>First party claims on personal insurance policies will be payable from the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) once Setanta is formally placed into liquidation.  Claimants will be eligible for 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser. Under Section 3.6 of the Insurance Amendment Act 1964 (as amended) first party claims by a body corporate or unincorporated body are not covered by the ICF. </p><p>The refund of premiums for commercial and personal insurance policies is not covered by the ICF or MIBI. A portion of the premium refunds may, however, be available upon completion of the Setanta liquidation. </p><p>Until otherwise advised those customers which have been affected by the collapse should continue to contact to Setanta Insurance Services Limited at 0818 255 255 (if calling from outside Ireland +353 1 897 6300) or on support@setantainsurance.com.</p></reply>

Where, in the Central Bank's opinion, the state of the Fund is such that financial support should be provided for it, it determines an appropriate contribution to be paid to it by each insurer calculated as a percentage, not exceeding 2% of the aggregate of the gross premiums paid to that insurer in respect of policies issued in respect of risks in the State. The levy is already at the 2% maximum level provided for under the legislation. </p><p>Because the ICF is not pre-funded, there is a provision in the 1964 Insurance Act which allows the Minister for Finance to provide the necessary monies in the form of a repayable loan where there are insufficient funds available.  </p><p>The balance of the Insurance Compensation Fund as at the 25<sup>th</sup>April 2014 was &euro;31,199,821.20.

A higher rate of USC of 10% was introduced for the self-employed in respect of income in excess of &euro;100,000 and an additional 1 percentage point was added to the self-employed PRSI rate.  This restored the self-employed top marginal tax rate to 55%, (41% income tax, 7% USC, an additional 3% USC on income over &euro;100,000 and 4% PRSI), which is where they were in 2010 and ensured that high earning self-employed income earners did not actually make a gain from Budget 2011 in comparison to all other taxpayers.</p><p>  I should point out that the 10% rate of USC only applies to income over &euro;100,000. Self-employed individuals with income of less than &euro;100,000 and PAYE employees pay tax, USC and PRSI at the same marginal rate of 52%.</p><p>  However, the Deputy is undoubtedly aware that the previous Government, when they introduced the Universal Social Charge, legislated for the cessation of the additional 3% self-employed rate as well as the removal of exemption from the 7% rate for those on medical cards who have an aggregate income below &euro;60,000 from 1 January 2015.  </p><p>  As these changes are provided for in the current legislation it follows that my officials would have factored this into the forecasts contained in the recent Stability Programme Update April 2014. However, any decisions regarding the extension of the relevant provisions will be taken in the context of my deliberations for Budget 2015. </p></reply>

Eurostat figures show that Ireland's energy dependency rate stood at 85 per cent in 2012, the fourth highest in the EU and over 30 percentage points higher than the EU average of 53 per cent. This dependency leaves Ireland vulnerable to energy price shocks in relative terms. An increase in energy prices above the baseline assumption would, inter alia, reduce household discretionary income by pushing up domestic energy prices. It would also lead to a deterioration in the terms of trade (the ratio of export prices to import prices) which would have a negative impact on Ireland's international competitiveness.</p><p>  If oil prices were to rise significantly higher than the Department's baseline assumption this would also negatively impact on growth in our main trading partners and would therefore lead to a fall in demand for Irish exports internationally. In this regard the Sensitivity Analysis chapter in the recently published Ireland's Stability Programme April 2014 Update (tinyurl.com/spu14), may prove informative. As part of this analysis a quantitative estimate of the impact of a 1 per cent variation in world output on Irish output was prepared (this can be found on page 26). The analysis suggests that such a shock would decrease Irish GDP by around 1 per cent by 2018, due to the openness of the Irish economy. It should be remembered that, at the margin, these estimates are broadly symmetrical so any unanticipated decline in energy prices would be likely to result in a net positive impact for the Irish economy.</p><p>  While there is little Ireland can do in the short term to counter the impact of an increase in the price of oil,  the Department of  Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has set out ambitious targets to 2020 for increasing the contribution of renewable sources of energy which are  aimed at optimising energy efficiency in Ireland. </p></reply>

In addition, certain other incentives were introduced in order to encourage an increase in the supply of childcare places.  </p><p>At that time, tax relief for childcare costs was considered but not introduced, as it would only have been of benefit to those in the tax net and would most likely have been absorbed by childcare providers in the form of higher prices. Analysis showed that a standard rated childcare costs allowance of &euro;4,000 per annum would cost the Exchequer &euro;64 million per annum and would have resulted in a reduced liability to income tax of only &euro;15 per week for those availing of it. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the early childcare supplement has since been abolished as the measure was very costly, poorly targeted and possibly led to increased charges. In its stead, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school, was introduced. </p><p>In my view the concerns raised in the 2005 analysis regarding tax relief for childcare costs are still valid. This is particularly the case considering the major changes in the economy that have occurred in the intervening period. Furthermore, I would have concerns about basing any analysis of the cost of making childcare tax deductible on data provided in reports that were compiled nine years ago. </p><p>Notwithstanding the absence of tax relief for childcare costs, the Government acknowledges the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children.  For this reason a number of support measures are available. </p><p>These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free childcare places to qualifying F&Aacute;S and VEC trainees and the ECCE programme as mentioned above. Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided. </p><p>The Department of Social Protection provides financial support to families on low pay by way of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and to one-parent families through the one-parent family payment. </p><p>In addition, a Single Person Child Carer tax credit of &euro;1650 is provided as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000. This credit and band is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated. The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and<b></b>increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year.<b></b>To claim the Single Person Child Carer Credit a claimant must not be married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting.</p><p>The Universal Social Charge (USC) was introduced in Budget 2011 to replace the Income Levy and Health Levy. It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base with very few exemptions. </p><p>In Budget 2012 I announced that those earning less than &euro;10,036 would no longer be subject to the Universal Social Charge. This in itself has removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge and is of particular benefit to the low paid.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. As the Deputy will also appreciate, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current budgetary constraints. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>
