    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-14a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018021400069#WRA00800"><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is already tasked with producing annual projections of greenhouse gas emissions for Ireland, in collaboration with relevant State and other bodies.</p>  <p>  A key input to these projections are annual forecasts of energy use, prepared each year by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).</p>  <p>  The 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) established binding annual greenhouse gas emissions targets for EU Member States for the period 2013 to 2020.  These targets cover sectors of the economy that fall outside the scope of the EU Emissions Trading System, including transport, buildings, agriculture and waste management.  For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005, which was jointly the most demanding reduction target allocated to EU Member States under this Decision.</p>  <p>  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published by the EPA in April 2017, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's 2020 targets could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020.  The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis.</p>  <p>  Concerning renewable energy, the EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy demand from renewable sources by 2020.  Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter transport target also being legally binding. Meeting the 16% target remains challenging.</p>  <p>  SEAI has reported that, in 2016, overall energy use increased by 3.7%, while the economy grew by 5.1%.  9.5% of Ireland's overall energy requirements in 2016 were met from renewable sources.  As regards Ireland&rsquo;s renewable electricity target, renewable electricity accounted for 27.2% of total consumption by end 2016.  The SEAI's most recent forecast of Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with its renewable energy targets (December 2017) is that Ireland will achieve between 13.2% and 15.4% of its 16% renewable energy target by 2020, indicating that Ireland should be between 82% to 96%  of the way to its target.</p>  <p>  Ireland will contribute to the Paris Agreement via the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) tabled by the EU on behalf of its Member States, which commits to a reduction of at least 40% in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels.  This will be met through reductions of 43% in the Emission Trading System (ETS) and 30% in the non-ETS sector compared with 2005 levels.</p>  <p>  Ireland's contribution to the overall 30% reduction in the non-ETS sector by 2030, as well as the contributions to be made by other Member States, will be established in the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) proposal, which will replace the current Effort Sharing Decision.  In December 2017, the European Parliament and the Council reached a provisional agreement on the ESR proposal and I expect that this agreement to be shortly formally endorsed by both the European Parliament and Council.  The final agreement sets a target of a 30% reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s 2005 emissions by 2030, with a starting point of May 2019, based on average emissions over the period 2016 to 2018. </p></reply>

I would encourage Angling Clubs and Community Groups to continue to avail of funding supports from IFI.</p><p><font color="#333333">In addition, Donegal Angling Tourism Alliance, enabled by a strategic alliance with IFI, has been instrumental in progressing the marketing of angling in Donegal.  The many initiatives achieved by Donegal Angling Tourism Alliance with IFI support include the launch of Clodha Wheelyboat, a wheelchair accessible flat deck boat at Rooskey Lough in Donegal and the Donegal Angling Holidays project funded by the 'LEADER' programme.</font></p><p>The Deputy will be pleased to know that the much envied accolade of catching the first spring salmon of the year went to an angler fishing in the North West on the River Drowes, County Leitrim, in January.  As is traditional, the first fish was the centre of attention at a charity tasting event which this year benefited the North West Hospice. </p><p>I propose to circulate with the Official Record the funding awards in the North West under both the Development and Sponsorship programmes.</p></reply>

This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p>  <p>  Part of that commercial investment is eir&rsquo;s ongoing rural deployment of high speed broadband to 300,000 premises.  That deployment is targeting a deliverable of circa 40,000 premises per quarter for this year.  Based on that rate of deployment building the NBP high speed network would take approximately three years. </p>  <p>  It is a reality of any infrastructure rollout of this scale that there will be those isolated and harder to reach premises and areas which will take longer than this to pass.  This is an unavoidable fact. However, it is my firm resolve that the occupants of these premises will not wait any longer than necessary to receive the service they need. </p>  <p>  The actions and measures I have initiated through the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce will facilitate as efficient a rollout as possible as well as assisting any ongoing commercial investments.</p>  <p>  Working with the Broadband Officers in each Local Authority and with the Department of Rural and Community Development, my Department has identified Strategic Community Points across all counties where services can be connected at an early stage after award of the NBP contract.  As fibre connections to villages and communities continue to improve, so to will public wifi which provides people with greater accessibility to better services. </p></reply>

Of these, around 2,300 premises in Roscommon and 10,800 premises in Galway have been passed as part of eir's on-going rural deployment of Fibre to the Home and can access a high speed broadband service of up to 1000Mbps.</p>  <p>  Just over 24,000 premises in County Roscommon and some 57,000 in County Galway do not currently have access to a high speed broadband service.  The Government's National Broadband Plan will deliver this service to every single one of these premises via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p>  <p>  6,000 premises in Roscommon will receive a high speed broadband service through eir's rural deployment before the end of this year, while the remaining 18,000 will be served via the planned State led intervention.  In County Galway 18,000 will be served through eir's deployment while 39,000 come under the State intervention. </p>  <p>  Other operators are delivering on commercial investment in these counties. SIRO, the Vodafone-ESB joint venture, are currently delivering fibre services in 2 Galway towns, Castlebar and Westport, with plans to roll out fibre services to Roscommon town and Cortober in County Roscommon.</p>  <p>  As I outlined in my reply to an earlier question in the House today, my Department's procurement process to engage the company to roll out the high speed network in the intervention area is at an advanced stage.  When this process reaches a satisfactory conclusion for Government, a contract will be awarded and the network rollout will commence.   </p>  <p>  Delivering high speed broadband to every citizen in Roscommon, Galway and indeed every other county remains my firm commitment and that of the Government.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-14a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018021400069#WRA02400"><p>On 20 July 2016, the European Commission presented a legislative proposal, the "Effort Sharing Regulation" (ESR), setting out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for Member States for the period 2021 to 2030.  The targets cover sectors of the economy that fall outside the scope of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).  These sectors, including the built-environment, transport and agriculture, account for almost 55% of total EU-28 emissions and 71% of Irish emissions.  The proposal is the successor to the Effort Sharing Decision, which established national emissions targets for Member States in the non-ETS sectors between 2013 and 2020.</p>  <p>  For the ESR, targets have been proposed for Member States based on GDP per capita and the cost-effectiveness of domestic emissions reductions within individual Member States.  The final agreement sets a target of 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 for Ireland.  Mitigation options built into the ESR agreement include land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), and the possibility to transfer credits from the EU ETS.</p>  <p>  The ESR was provisionally agreed on 21 December 2017 by the Council and the European Parliament, and following final approval and formal adoption by the Council, it will enter into force.</p>  <p>  During the ESR negotiations, I emphasised the need to prioritise a successful conclusion which retains a high environmental ambition for the EU, but provides each Member State with the capacity to contribute to that ambition in a cost-effective and fair manner.  I am satisfied that the provisional agreed text provides appropriate recognition of different Member State circumstances, and the need to provide flexibility to reduce emissions as cost-effectively as possible in the context of the overall EU target.</p>  <p>  In terms of emissions, the EPA develops national projections on an annual basis, in collaboration with relevant State and other bodies.  In addition to this, they also produce emission projections for each sector.</p>  <p>  The latest EPA projections were published in April 2017.  Greenhouse gas emissions were projected to 2035 using two scenarios: a &lsquo;With Existing Measures&rsquo; scenario and a &lsquo;With Additional Measures&rsquo; scenario.  The With Existing Measures scenario assumes that no additional policies and measures, beyond those already in place by the end of 2015, are implemented.  The With Additional Measures scenario assumes implementation of the With Existing Measures scenario in addition to further implementation of Government renewable and energy efficiency targets for 2020, as set out in the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) and the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP). </p>  <p>  Emissions from Agriculture are projected to reduce by 2.4% between 2020 and 2035 under both scenarios.  For 2035, it is estimated that fertiliser nitrogen use will reduce from 401,000 tonnes in 2020 to 395,000 tonnes in 2035.  The beef herd is forecasted to contract by 11% between 2020 and 2035 from 5.6 million to 4.9 million.  These agriculture emissions projections are based on data from Teagasc&rsquo;s FAPRI-Ireland model which were provided to the EPA in December 2015.</p>  <p>  In terms of addressing the significant challenge to reduce emissions, I published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Mitigation Plan last July. It provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A key objective of the Plan is to prepare for the emissions targets that Ireland will take on for 2030.  The Plan sets out over 70 individual mitigation measures and 106 related actions to reduce emissions in the four sectors with the most significant contribution to national emissions (Electricity Generation; the Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use). Action across all sectors will be paramount to building the foundations for Ireland&rsquo;s low carbon transformation, considering the cross-cutting nature of the climate challenge.</p>  <p>  The National Mitigation Plan highlights a number of measures that are already contributing to emission reductions in the agriculture sector, including: the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP); Knowledge Transfer Programme; Green, Low Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS); Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II); Organic Farming Scheme; Smart Farming Programme; Business, Environment and Technology through Training Extension and Research (BETTER) Farms Programme.</p>  <p>  Although the Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve either Ireland&rsquo;s proposed 2030 target or the 2050 transition objective, it begins the process of developing medium-to-long-term policy options so as to achieve progressive emissions reductions in each of the four key sectors, and to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the National Mitigation Plan is a living document that will be updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.

This will be achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p><p>In April 2017, I signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide High speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  eir has committed to completing this rollout by the end of this year.  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at <i><i>.</i></i>A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dccae.gov.ie.</i></p><p>Quarterly updates on eir's rural deployment are published on this website. Although deployment figures for Q4 2017 have not yet been verified by my Department&rsquo;s teams, I understand eir has passed a total of 121,000 premises of the 300,000 identified premises to date.  </p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  One company, eir, publicly withdrew from the procurement process on 30 January, citing &quot;commercial, regulatory and governance issues&quot;.  While this is regrettable, it is a commercial decision for eir to make.  The specialist NBP procurement team will continue to engage intensively with all relevant stakeholders, including the enet/sse consortium, to ensure the earliest possible achievement of the Government&rsquo;s objective of providing reliable high quality, high speed broadband to all premises in Ireland.  When the procurement process reaches a satisfactory conclusion for Government, a contract will be awarded and the network rollout will commence.</p><p>Delivering high speed broadband to citizens across Ireland remains a firm commitment of mine and this Government.</p><p>In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal which compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies including Solar PV at various scales including Utility (farm scale) to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply. The assessment included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.</p>  <p>  The new scheme will be defined by a series of renewable electricity auctions, where the most cost effective projects within an auction structure will receive financial support in the form of a premium, in addition to the price they receive from the market.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the very strong level of interest in solar PV in Ireland and the most recent data available to me indicates that at present, there are 621 solar applications at the distribution level and 37 solar applications at the transmission level, at various stages in the grid connection application process. These applications amount to 4,398 Megawatts and 2,135 Megawatts respectively or 6,533Megawatts in total.</p>  <p>  It is widely recognised that solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has become more cost competitive for electricity generation over the last few years, not only compared with other renewables but also compared with conventional forms of generation. Furthermore, a recent report by the the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA 2017) forecasts that solar PV costs will continue to fall by a further 50% out to 2020. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the level of solar applicants seeking connection to the grid and acknowledging that solar PV does have a role to play in Ireland&rsquo;s energy future, the cost effectiveness of the new scheme is a key policy objective.  I cannot stand over a scenario whereby electricity customers are locked into higher prices now for renewable energy as renewable technology costs fall. While increasing diversity of the renewable energy mix is one of several policy objectives the new RESS is trying to deliver, falling technology costs by themselves may lead to increased diversity of the renewable portfolio over the medium term.</p>  <p>  Following on from the recent RESS public consultation and review, a final design proposal will be brought to Government for approval in the coming months, including the overall costs and technologies to be supported. A formal application for State Aid clearance from the European Commission will then commence.</p>  <p>  At this stage no final decisions have been made as regards which technologies will be supported under the new RESS. </p></reply>

The scale and complexity of this challenge demands a coordinated approach at both national and international levels. Ireland is committed to concerted multilateral action to tackle climate change through the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with an ambition of 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Agreement is designed to meet this objective through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by all parties to the agreement.</p>  <p>  Ireland will contribute to the achievement of these objectives through the NDC submitted by the European Union on behalf of its Member States, committing to a reduction of at least 40% in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. </p>  <p>  In the context of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to and solidarity with our developing country partners, I was pleased to be able to announce last November in Bonn that Ireland will join the NDC Partnership, an initiative which represents a highly practical approach to sharing capacity and policy insights with our developing country partners towards meeting their commitments under the Paris Agreement. </p>  <p>  Ireland made a commitment in 2015 to provide at least &euro;175 million in public funding on climate action between 2016 and 2020, and reported a total of &euro;52.7 million in funding in 2016. The majority of this funding supports adaptation and mitigation action in developing countries, largely in sub-Saharan Africa, through the Official Development Assistance budget of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. My Department made contributions of &euro;4.5 million over 2016 and 2017, supporting the Green Climate Fund, the NDC Partnership, and a number of other international climate initiatives.</p></reply>

This shows the impact of the sector to be much more significant than initially perceived with wider societal impacts and potential for future expansion.</p>  <p>  GSI is working to support and expand the geoscience sector and its regional impact in a number of ways. The on-going work of the GSI is supported by exchequer funding through my Department's Vote with a total of &euro;12.6 million provided in the Vote in 2018.</p>  <p>  GSI manage the Tellus programme, which is carrying out national airborne sensing and ground sampling to produce updated geological and chemical maps. The outputs from this programme, which is now completed over more than half the country, help to update GSI&rsquo;s geological mapping and also supports areas such as environmental planning, agricultural planning, plant and animal health and the national Radon Control Strategy. Updated Tellus data is also used by the mineral exploration industry and attracts foreign direct investment and spending in rural areas.</p>  <p>  Groundwater mapping, being carried out nationally at GSI, supports the protection of Drinking Water and compliance with EU Directives. This involves working closely with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes to map and protect their groundwater supplies as part of a multiannual programme. The work also defines groundwater supplies that can be used to support future regional development.</p>  <p>  In terms of business development, GSI manages the Geoscience Ireland business cluster, which works with Enterprise Ireland to help win work overseas and secure jobs for Irish companies in this sector. The majority of these companies are located outside of Dublin and are headquartered throughout the country. Since 2012, Geoscience Ireland companies have collectively added a net 754 jobs up to end 2017. </p>  <p>  Geotourism is supported through the promotion and development of UNESCO Global Geoparks and geotourism projects. This includes technical and financial support for the three Unesco Global Geoparks in counties Waterford, Clare and Cavan and various proposed geopark projects in counties Galway and Mayo. In addition, GSI is carrying out a national programme of county audits of geoheritage sites, which helps underpin and protect the sites located within Geoparks. </p></reply>

I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services and make specific investments in particular locations. The ComReg consumer helpline is accessible at consumerline@comreg.ie and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding ComReg&rsquo;s independence, I recognise the frustration felt by Irish consumers where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect. Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contains 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits. The Implementation Group I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. This includes ComReg, who attend as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in their role as the independent Regulator. </p>  <p>  I published the third Taskforce Quarterly Progress Report in November 2017, which demonstrates that good progress has been made in delivering the actions. I plan to publish an Annual Report shortly. This Report will give an update on progress made on each of the 40 actions and will evidence the continuing progress, together with the sustained level of engagement between action owners and industry. The Annual Report will also contain a work programme for 2018, with new actions identified that will lead to improvements for consumers across Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce&rsquo;s achievements to date include:</p>  <p>  - Revisions to Exempted Development Regulations to facilitate prompt roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure and to prepare Ireland for the roll-out of 5G mobile technology;</p>  <p>  - Funding of all local authorities to assign a Broadband Officer;</p>  <p>  - Close cooperation with local authorities to develop local digital strategies and to identify approximately 320 high speed Strategic Community Access Hubs to be connected at an early juncture after award of the NBP contract;</p>  <p>  - ComReg&rsquo;s development of a testing regime to check mobile handset performance which will inform consumers in choosing products and network services. ComReg will also develop a new network coverage map. </p>  <p>  - Most local authorities applying waivers in respect of development contributions for telecoms development. </p>  <p>  - Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has constructed 80km of ducting on the M7/M8 corridor and 14km on the N25 in Cork, with more following in the coming months to help expedite infrastructure roll-out. TII is also reviewing the cost of duct access for telecoms. </p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of telecommunications services, particularly in rural areas.</p></reply>

The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal. This appraisal compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies, at various scales, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply. A public consultation on the new Scheme, which closed in November 2017, resulted in over 1,250 responses and analysis of these is almost complete.</p>  <p>  Following on from the RESS public consultation and review, a final design proposal will be brought to Government for approval in the coming months, including the overall costs and technologies to be supported. Subsequent to a Government decision, a formal application for State Aid clearance from the European Commission will commence. The new scheme is expected to open in 2019. </p>  <p>  At this stage no final decisions have been made as regards which technologies will be supported under the new RESS. </p></reply>

Measures to progressively decarbonise electricity generation and to promote the electrification of heat and transport will be central to the achievement of national transition objectives.  Investment in renewable energy technologies must be complemented by the development of appropriate levels of energy interconnection to cater for growing demand and to diversify our sources of supply. </p>  <p>  Delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the National Broadband Plan will ensure that the opportunities presented by the digital transformation are available to every community in Ireland.  Fast, secure, high capacity digital connectivity will underpin balanced regional development, allow new businesses and services to emerge and increase Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and attractiveness as a place to live and do business.  In a similar way, An Post, in its strategic plan, is embracing the opportunities presented by the digital agenda and harnessing its existing strengths such as its nationwide reach, trusted brand and the relationship with communities to develop new products and services.  Further opportunities will be available to the post office network, as the  step change in digital connectivity is extended across the country to villages and rural areas.</p>  <p>  During the lifetime of the National Development Plan, capacity will continue to be built in sustainable waste management and resource efficiency, including recycling, waste to energy, landfill and landfill remediation. Such investments, along with support measures to prevent food waste, will be critical to environmental and economic well-being for a growing population, and to achieving EU circular economy and climate objectives.</p></reply>

Today 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband.  By the end of this year that number will rise to nearly 8 out of 10 premises and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises or 90% of premises will have access to a high speed broadband service. This will be achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. One company, eir, publicly withdrew from the procurement process last month. The specialist NBP procurement team will continue to engage intensively with all relevant stakeholders, including the sse/enet consortium, to ensure the earliest possible achievement of the Government&rsquo;s objective of providing reliable high quality, high speed broadband to all premises in Ireland.</p><p>The procurement<font color="#212121"> process, which is a very robust process with strong risk management throughout, reached an advanced stage</font>prior to eir&rsquo;s withdrawal<font color="#212121">. &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; submitted by two bidders on 26th September 2017 had already been evaluated by the NBP specialist team and detailed feedback had been delivered. This means that the process has had the benefit of strong competitive tension up until now, which will help inform the NBP procurement team in ensuring that value for money is achieved at final tender stage. The NBP procurement team also have the benefit and will use comparative costings from similar projects in other Member States together with advice from ComReg, the sectoral regulator with responsibility for the cost of access to the eir pole and duct infrastructure, where relevant to the final bid.</font></p><p><font color="#212121">The final contract which will result from the NBP procurement process will ultimately be subject to Government approval on the level of subsidy to be provided once a final bid has been received. This subsidy must also be independently reviewed as providing value for money by the National Development Finance Agency as is required for all Government Capital Projects with a value of more than &euro;20 million. The contract will also be subject to audit and review provisions to ensure that any potential over recovery of State Aid post contract by the bidder can be recovered by the State; this is also a requirement under the European Commission State Aid Guidelines for Broadband being followed by the Department.</font></p></reply>

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter transport target also being legally binding.</p>  <p>  While good progress has been made to date, with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) advising that 9.5% of Ireland's overall energy requirements in 2016 were met from renewable sources, meeting the 16% target remains challenging. The SEAI's most recent assessment is that Ireland will achieve between 13.2% and 15.4% of its 16% renewable energy target by 2020, indicating that Ireland should be between 82% to 96% towards its target.</p>  <p>  The Renewable Energy Directive provides a comprehensive framework for Member States to work towards achieving individual and EU renewable energy targets, including mechanisms for countries to work together such as statistical transfers, which allow Member States to meet their targets by purchasing credits from Member States that overachieve on their renewable targets.</p>  <p>  In the absence of an established market  mechanism, estimates of the cost of using  instruments such as statistical transfers are necessarily  tentative. Work undertaken by the SEAI in 2016  indicated that the cost to Ireland of not meeting our overall renewable energy targets may be in the range of &euro;65 million to &euro;130 million for each percentage point Ireland falls short of the overall 16% renewable energy target.  Costs per percentage point for statistical transfers could be below the lower end of the range suggested by SEAI but this will depend on market conditions when and if purchases are made.  Present indications &ndash; based on trades agreed by Luxembourg late last year - are that the costs per percentage point for statistical transfers could be below the lower end of the range suggested by SEAI.</p>  <p>  While the focus of my Department remains firmly on meeting our 2020 target and on implementation of renewable energy measures, including a new  Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and a new Support Scheme for Renewal Heat (SSRH), contingency planning has commenced to explore the potential extent, mechanisms and cost of addressing our target within the framework of the Directive.</p>  <p>  Any requirement for statistical transfers to meet compliance would be undertaken against a background of discussions by the Irish authorities with the EU Commission and relevant Member States. As any purchases arising would be made over a period, the costs to the Exchequer of acquiring statistical transfers to meet any potential shortfall would be spread over a period of more than one year and in any event the cumulative costs would not be known until 2021, the deadline for completion of all purchases.</p></reply>

The Framework sets out the context to ensure Local Authorities, regions and key sectors can assess the key risks and vulnerabilities of climate change, implement climate resilience actions and ensure climate adaptation considerations are mainstreamed into all local, regional and national policy making. </p>  <p>  Under the Framework, seven Government Departments (or Agencies, where appropriate) with responsibility for the twelve priority sectors identified in the Framework are required to prepare sectoral adaptation plans in line with the requirements of Sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Climate Act and the policies laid out in the Framework. The Framework does not identify specific locations or propose adaptation measures or projects in relation to sectors. Respecting the principle of subsidiarity, detailed adaptation measures will be developed across sectors and Local Government, in accordance with the Framework.</p>  <p>  Under Section 6(1) of the Climate Act, within three months of the Framework being laid before the Oireachtas, the Government must then request relevant Ministers to submit to the Government their sectoral adaptation plans within a specified period. The specified period, or deadline, for submission of plans to Government has yet to be finalised and will need to balance the need for urgent action with the need to allow sectors sufficient time to prepare plans that are fully in line with the requirements of the Framework and the Climate Act, while also accounting for mandatory consultation and Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment processes. The deadline selected will not preclude sectors from completing sectoral plans before the chosen deadline, if they are in a position to do so, and indeed this is desirable to ensure plans are submitted to Government for approval as soon as is practical. I will be bringing a Memorandum to Government shortly so as initiate the process for the preparation of sectoral plans.</p>  <p>  It should, however, also be noted that under the non-statutory 2012 National Climate Change Adaptation Framework which has now been superseded by the National Adaptation Framework, four draft sectoral plans covering five sectors have already been developed, including for flood risk management, agriculture and forestry, transport, and the electricity and gas networks. These plans will be reviewed and updated in line with the requirements of the new National Adaptation Framework. </p></reply>

Two reports published by the regulator last year concluded that Irish energy markets are competitive, with the most recently available EU comparable electricity and gas supplier switching data also pointing towards a competitive Irish market. The CRU is an independent statutory body, and solely accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions.</p><p>The regulation of retail market prices for electricity in Ireland ended in 2011 and for gas prices in 2014. The Government has no statutory function in the monitoring or setting of electricity prices, with the main thrust of Government policy on energy costs focused on the competitive market and supports for energy efficiency. Government policy has supported competition to drive down prices, and data from approved price comparison sites (and ) shows that consumers can make significant savings by switching energy suppliers. </p><p>Consistent with European energy policy, the electricity and gas markets in Ireland are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. The position of successive Governments has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses, in terms of suppliers, products and prices. Competition exerts downward pressure on suppliers&rsquo; prices.</p><p>Section 10A of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, as amended, sets out the procedure under which the Minister may give &ldquo;general policy directions&rdquo;. The legislation sets out details on the tasks and inter-alia timelines, consultation requirements with the independent regulator and Oireachtas, and identifies restrictions on the areas where such directions may not be given. </p><p>Energy markets in Ireland operate within a European regulatory regime in which member states must guarantee the independence of National Regulatory Authorities, which are expressively forbidden from taking direct instructions from government, or any public body, when carrying out their regulatory tasks. The regime also restricts policy directions in the form of general policy guidelines in certain areas that are prescribed regulatory duties and powers in the EU Third Energy Package, specifically in Directive 2009/72/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity.  A policy direction in this matter is therefore not being considered. </p></reply>

It has delivered an efficient, cost reflective, competitive market, while assuring security of supply and integrating significant volumes of renewable electricity into the generation mix.</p>  <p>  As a result of the common EU policy of delivering the Internal Energy Market and Energy Union and following European legislation aimed at harmonising cross-border trade in electricity, the SEM will have to change how it operates. The development of the associated new wholesale market rules is a Regulator-led project, with oversight by my Department and the Department for the Economy Northern Ireland (DfE) to ensure legal and policy compliance. The Integrated-Single Electricity Market (I-SEM) project, to design and implement the new rules, has been underway since 2012.  Legislation was amended in Ireland and Northern Ireland to allow the Regulators make the necessary changes to the electricity market rules. The new market will go live in 2018. </p>  <p>  The benefits will include more competitive wholesale electricity prices for consumers through more efficient market trading; efficient dispatch of interconnection to other markets; and increased security of supply for Ireland.</p>  <p>  As regards the all island gas market, the Common Arrangements for Gas (CAG) project commenced in 2008 between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  It aimed to harmonise technical operations of the gas transmission networks in both jurisdictions. The project was superseded by EU internal gas market developments that require the implementation of binding EU-wide gas network codes in Member States, including Ireland and Northern Ireland. These EU network codes are the EU rules for cross-border gas trading.</p></reply>

The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal. This appraisal compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies, at various scales including micro-generation, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply. A public consultation on the new Scheme, which closed in November 2017, resulted in over 1,250 responses and analysis of these is almost complete.</p>  <p>  A cornerstone of the new scheme will be the provision of pathways for increased community based ownership and participation in and benefit from renewable electricity projects in line with the 2015 Energy White Paper. Communities and citizens are effectively being designed into the fabric of the new scheme and the SEAI in conjunction with my Department have recently completed a comprehensive assessment of polices and support measures to underpin and deliver this ambition.   </p>  <p>  One of the highest ranking community measures proposes a separate &lsquo;community-led&rsquo; category for projects that are initiated or majority owned by individuals or groups within the local community. We also need to address measures to support citizens and community groups, who may wish to develop their own project or participate in a developer-led project, overcome legal, financial and technical barriers to renewable electricity generation. This ambition is now being mirrored across the EU as part of the recast Renewable Energy Directive, which will establish the rights, entitlements and obligations of renewable self-consumers and renewable energy communities.</p>  <p>  Micro generation was also appraised as part of the RESS economic assessment and the analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before a support scheme for micro generation can be developed. Notwithstanding this, I am committed to further exploring opportunities for supporting micro generation and in October 2017 my Department and the SEAI hosted a workshop on micro generation at which a number of these challenges were discussed with relevant stakeholders. On foot of this workshop and further engagement with the micro generation industry, I have asked the SEAI to conduct a short study to assess the likely demand for and impact of micro generation, among the public.  It is my intention to launch a grant aided pilot scheme this summer for solar PV micro generation initially targeted at self-consumption and for domestic properties. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with the micro generation sector and the SEAI to better understand how to validate and further develop these policies in a fair and cost effective manner. </p>  <p>  It is also worth pointing out the SEAI&rsquo;s Better Energy Communities scheme currently supports micro generation vis-&agrave;-vis grant aiding a portion of costs associated with a solar PV installation.</p></reply>

In this space, where it is not in my power to place an outright ban on non-compostable items, such as disposable cups, I am looking at other means of curbing their use.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware I recently announced that I am considering introducing a levy on disposable coffee cups in an attempt to effect environmental behavioural change and incentivise individuals to use their own cups on the go.  While the policy in this regard is at a very early stage in the process, a levy such as this has proved very successful in the past in curbing the use of plastic bags.</p>  <p>  In addition, I strongly welcome the European Commission adopting a strategy on plastics, on 16 January 2018, as part of our transition to a more circular economy. It will protect the environment from plastic pollution whilst fostering growth and innovation, turning a challenge into a positive agenda for Europe. Under the new plans, all plastic packaging on the EU market will be recyclable by 2030, the consumption of single-use plastics will be reduced and the intentional use of microplastics will be restricted. I will shortly be bringing this strategy to the attention of all Government departments and asking them to consider how they might contribute to meeting these ambitious goals. </p></reply>

The scheme is being delivered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the Health Service Executive.</p>  <p>  The scheme is being piloted in Community Healthcare Organisation 7 and is open to people aged 55 and over or 12 and under who are living with chronic respiratory conditions in households that are in receipt of the Fuel Allowance or the One-Parent Family Payment. Further, eligible applicants must be living in one of the pilot scheme areas - Dublin 8, 10, 12, 22 or 24.</p>  <p>  As a pilot scheme that is 100% Exchequer funded, the resources available to the scheme are limited, and so it has targeted eligibility requirements in relation to medical and income needs. As well as needing to meet the medical, age and home location criteria, participation is limited to those deemed to be living in or at risk of energy poverty. To determine this with complete accuracy SEAI would need to know the condition of a person's home, including its energy efficiency level and heating system, that person's family circumstances and their household income level. However, it would not be practical or efficient for SEAI to perform this assessment for each applicant to the scheme. Therefore this is instead determined through the use of proxy indicators, principally the National Fuel Allowance. These proxy indicators provide an acceptable approximation that allows SEAI to identify that people are in or at risk of energy poverty without having to resort to a cumbersome, expensive and intrusive administrative regime.</p>  <p>  An independent research project is underway to assess the impact the scheme is having. At the conclusion of the scheme, and with independent evidence on its effectiveness, the potential for a wider rollout, including extension of any application criteria will be considered.</p></reply>

The draft bioenergy Plan is being updated to reflect these and other policy developments. The updated plan along with a Strategic Environmental Assessment and NATURA Impact Statement is currently under development and will be published for public consultation.</p>  <p>  The production of biogas and biomethane from anaerobic digestion has significant potential in Ireland.  Biogas can be utilised to generate electricity and in the heat sector.  Biomethane, produced by removing impurities from biogas, can be used as a substitute for natural gas and can be injected directly into the gas network or used as a transport fuel.  In addition to being a source of renewable energy, it can also provide an outlet for farm wastes.  </p>  <p>  An assessment of the costs and benefits of biogas and biomethane was undertaken by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and published. This formed part of the detailed economic assessment on the design and cost of the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat.  </p>  <p>  Operational support for anaerobic digestion heating systems will form part of the first phase of the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat.  Other technologies and methods of support are under consideration for subsequent phases of the scheme, including biomethane grid injection. In this regard, my Department continues to examine how best to support biomethane production. This included a stakeholder workshop to examine potential support options with industry stakeholders held last month.</p></reply>

Since the formation of the National Cyber Security Centre in my Department in 2011 and the publication of the National Cyber Security Strategy, my Department has been working on a series of measures to further protect critical national infrastructure in addition to the existing work of the National Cyber Security Centre.</p>  <p>  Some of these measures flow from the European Union Directive on Network and Information Security, and will involve applying binding security requirements on a selection of key infrastructure providers and certain online service providers. My Department informed those infrastructure operators likely to be formally designated of their status in September 2017, and published the draft set of security requirements for these infrastructure operators for public consultation in November. These operators span a wide range of areas, including the energy, healthcare, transport, and telecommunications sectors. </p>  <p>  In addition to critical national infrastructure, the Directive also requires that States apply a new regulatory regime to Digital Service Providers (DSPs). These will include cloud computing providers, search engines providers and providers of online market places. Critically, the State will have responsibility for dealing with the security of services provided across the European Union by multinational companies that have their European headquarters located in Ireland. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently giving priority to the process of transposing this Directive into national law in advance of the transposition deadline of May 2018.  I have asked my officials to arrange for the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment to have an opportunity to examine the draft legislation when it has been finalised.</p></reply>

On Tuesday 21 November 2017 I convened a meeting with my colleagues, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and their officials to discuss online safety issues, including the various initiatives which are taking place at a national and European level to tackle illegal or harmful content online.</p>  <p>  Recognising that there are already a range of diverse activities being taken by many Government Departments, by the European Commission, by industry and by stakeholders, we agreed at this meeting to further progress the matter of digital safety through an Open Policy Debate. The Open Policy Debate will take place on Thursday 8 March in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham.  The establishment of an Office of a Digital Safety Commissioner is one of a number of proposals which will be discussed during this event.</p>  <p>  My Department is co-ordinating this open policy debate with the support and participation of the Departments of Justice &amp;amp; Equality; Education &amp;amp; Skills; Business, Enterprise and Innovation; Health; and Children and Youth Affairs. My Department is also engaging with the relevant online platforms, ISPCC, parents' groups and other key stakeholders who will be participating in the initiative. The overall aim of the event is to raise awareness among all participants of the activities which are being undertaken by the Irish Government, by the European Commission, by industry and NGOs. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the event will identify issues requiring further consideration and areas where additional cooperation between stakeholders would be beneficial.  Following the event, I will engage further with my Ministerial colleagues in relation to these matters.</p></reply>

While the rate has fallen from 15.3% at the end of 2013, it is still very high and equates to a loss of &euro;40m per annum to public service broadcasting.</p>  <p>  To address this issue, my Department has been working with An Post and RT&Eacute; on an on-going basis to ensure that the TV licence collection system is working as effectively as possible. Measures such as marketing campaigns, more evening and weekend inspection and appointment of additional temporary inspectors are just some of the initiatives that have been utilised to enhance sales and improve compliance rates. </p>  <p>  While these measures are important steps, I believe that the current system needs to be reformed. As the Deputy will be aware, I obtained Government approval last year to draft a number of legislative amendments to the Broadcasting Act 2009, including amendments for the tendering of TV Licence fee collection. The proposed amendments are currently under Pre-Legislative Scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment and I look forward to receiving the Committee's Report on the matter.</p>  <p>  In addition, I requested the Committee to examine the longer term issue of the future funding of public service media. The Committee published their report at the end of November 2017 and I intend to bring the matter to Government shortly. </p></reply>

Ireland's contribution to the overall 30% reduction in the non-ETS sector by 2030, as well as the contributions to be made by other Member States, will be established in the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), which will replace the current Effort Sharing Decision. In December 2017, the European Parliament and the Council reached a provisional agreement on the proposed ESR and I expect that this agreement to be shortly formally endorsed by both the European Parliament and Council. This provisional agreement sets a target of a 30% reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s 2005 emissions by 2030, with a starting point of May 2019, based on average emissions over the period 2016 to 2018.</p><p>Official inventories of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are prepared annually by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The most recent data, for the year 2015, is available on the EPA's website at: <i></i>.</p><p>According to this data, the breakdown of emissions by sector in 2015 is as follows: <table><tr><th>Sector</th><th>Mt CO2eq.</th><th>% of total 2015 emissions</th></tr><tr><td>Agriculture</td><td>19.81</td><td>33.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Transport</td><td>11.83</td><td>19.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Energy Industries</td><td>11.80</td><td>19.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Residential</td><td>6.04</td><td>10.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing Combustion</td><td>4.55</td><td>7.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Industrial Processes</td><td>1.99 </td><td>3.3%</td></tr><tr><td>F-Gases</td><td>1.14 </td><td>1.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial Services</td><td>0.94 </td><td>1.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Waste</td><td>0.97</td><td>1.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Public Services</td><td>0.81</td><td>1.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Total ETS</td><td>16.84</td><td>28%</td></tr><tr><td>Total Non-ETS</td><td>43.04</td><td>72%</td></tr><tr><td>Total for all sectors</td><td>59.88</td><td>100%</td></tr></table></p><p>The latest EPA report on greenhouse gas emissions, published on 27 November, indicates that Ireland complied with its annual limits in the period 2013-2016. However, EPA projections indicate that Ireland is expected to exceed its annual limits from 2017 onwards, and that emissions could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020, and between 1% and 3% below 2005 levels by 2030. The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. It is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. In the light of this, Ireland&rsquo;s 2030 target will present a very significant challenge. </p><p>As a means of addressing this challenge, I published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Mitigation Plan last July. It provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A key objective of the Plan is to close the gap to Ireland's 2020 EU target and to prepare for the EU targets that Ireland will take on for 2030.  The Plan sets out over 70 individual mitigation measures and 106 related actions to reduce emissions in the four sectors with the most significant contribution to national emissions (Electricity Generation; the Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use). Action across all sectors will be paramount to building the foundations for Ireland&rsquo;s low carbon transformation considering the cross-cutting nature of the climate challenge.</p><p>Although the Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve either Ireland&rsquo;s proposed 2030 target or the 2050 transition objective, it begins the process of developing medium-to-long-term policy options so as to achieve progressive emissions reductions in each of the four key sectors, and to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. </p><p>It is important to note that the National Mitigation Plan is a living document that will be updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options. This continuous review process reflects the broad and evolving nature of the sectoral challenges outlined in the Plan, coupled with the continued development and deployment of emerging low carbon and cost effective technologies across different sectors of the economy.</p></reply>

As I have said many times, delivering high speed broadband to each of these premises is a personal commitment from me and remains a key priority of Government.  The Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.</p><p>The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland now have access to high speed broadband.  By the end of this year that number will rise to nearly 8 out of 10 premises and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises or 90% of premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This will be achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention. </p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map on my Department's website https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/communications/topics/Broadband/national-broadband-plan/high-speed-broadband-map/Pages/Interactive-Map.aspx is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.  </p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p><p>- The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of this year as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department last April. </p><p>The following table outlines the number of premises in Cavan, Monaghan and Meath which fall into these categories.<table><tr><th>County Name</th><th>Total Premises</th><th>AMBER % Premises within the NBP Intervention Area</th><th>BLUE % Premises within Commercial Operator&rsquo;s Area</th><th>LIGHT BLUE premises planned rural deployment</th></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>41,990</td><td>16,938(40%)</td><td>18,812(45%)</td><td>6,240(15%)</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>32,939</td><td>15,654(47%)</td><td>13,769(42%)</td><td>3,516(11%)</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>83,572</td><td>19,222(23%)</td><td>56,679(68%)</td><td>7,671(9%)</td></tr></table></p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.

Every single one of the remaining 46,000 (46%) premises that lack this service will be served under the Government's National Broadband Plan; some 12,000 by commercial investment, the remaining 34,000 by the planned State led intervention.</p>  <p>  In April 2017, I signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide high speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. eir has reconfirmed this committment to completing the rollout by the end of this year.  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at http://fibrerollout.ie/eircode-lookup/.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.dccae.gov.ie.  In the period to Q3 2017, over 14,100 premises in County Donegal were passed by eir's rural deployment.   </p>  <p>  Quarterly updates on eir's rural deployment are published on this website. Although deployment figures for Q4 2017 have not yet been verified by my Department&rsquo;s teams, I understand eir has passed a national total of 121,000 premises of the 300,000 eircodes identified by eir.  </p>  <p>  My Department is in a formal procurement process to engage the company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network to those premises in the State intervention area who will not be covered by private investment. My Department&rsquo;s specialist NBP procurement team will continue to engage intensively with all the relevant stakeholders in the process, including the sse/enet consortium, to ensure the earliest possible achievement of the Government&rsquo;s objective of providing reliable high quality, high speed broadband to every home, farm and business across the country. My Department will also engage with the bidder to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of any contract. </p>  <p>  When the procurement process reaches a satisfactory conclusion for Government, a contract will be awarded and the network rollout will commence. Through the said combination of commercial investment and State led intervention the National Broadband Plan has already provided a high speed broadband connection to thousands of homes around the country, ensuring that today, 7 out of 10 Irish premises can access this vital service. By the end of this year this will be almost 8 out of 10 and by 2020, 9 out of every 10 premises in this country will have a high speed broadband connection. </p></reply>

This commitment recognises the significant obligation which has been placed on Local Government to develop and implement its own climate action measures, as well as the need to build capacity within the sector to engage effectively with climate change. </p>  <p>  The Regional Climate Action Offices will be operated by a lead Local Authority in four different regions grouped according to shared climate change risks. The establishment of these offices will enable a more coordinated engagement across the whole of government and will help build on the experience and expertise which exists across the sector. </p>  <p>  Through these offices the Local Authorities can play a crucial role in driving practical policy and behavioural changes within our communities to encourage both businesses and citizens to embrace the need for climate action. In addition, I also see the Regional Climate Action Offices as having a key role in helping to facilitate the National Dialogue on Climate Action at both regional and local level. The regional structure being established can provide a leadership role through, for example, Public Participation Networks, community groups, Local Enterprise Offices and environmental awareness programmes, to advance informed discussions across all areas of the national climate agenda. </p>  <p>  Local Authorities, through the regional structure, are also very well placed to help future-proof our cities, towns and counties as the global climate changes.  In this regard Local Government has a central role in implementing the new National Planning Framework and National Development Plan (through the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies), which will help set our communities on a more sustainable pathway over the coming decades so as to ensure we achieve a low carbon and climate resilient future.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently engaging with the Local Government Management Agency and regional lead authorities to advance the process in terms of establishing this regional structure as efficiently and effectively as possible, while also ensuring that proper oversight and governance arrangements are put in place for the years to come.</p></reply>

Nonetheless, I am acutely conscious of the value placed by communities in both rural and urban areas on services provided by post offices and am concerned to ensure the needs of those communities continue to be met. Government remains fully committed to a sustainable post office network which is a key piece of economic and social infrastructure for both rural and urban areas. Reflecting its commitment to sustaining a nationwide post office network and daily mails service, the Government recently made &euro;30m available in State funding to An Post to support the renewal of the post office network and the continued fulfilment of a 5 day per week mails delivery service.</p>  <p>  Discussions on the future of the post office network are a matter for An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union and I understand negotiations are ongoing between both parties.

Respecting the principle of subsidiarity, detailed adaptation measures will be developed across sectors and Local Government. </p>  <p>  Under the Framework, seven Government Departments (or Agencies, where appropriate) with responsibility for twelve priority sectors are required to prepare sectoral adaptation plans in line with the requirements of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 and the policies laid out in the Framework. </p>  <p>  Local understanding is also crucial to getting adaptation right and in this regard Local Authorities will be preparing their own adaptation strategies under the Framework. In publishing the Framework last month I also announced a funding commitment from my Department of &euro;10 million over five years to establish four Local Authority Regional Climate Action Offices. This will underpin a risk-based approach to climate action at the local and regional level, and will provide a coherent and coordinated response to climate change, both in terms of adaptation and mitigation. The Regional Climate Action Offices will be operated by a lead Local Authority in four different regions grouped according to shared climate change risks. </p>  <p>  Ireland already has a number of resources in place to assist with adaptation planning, including an online resource and guidelines for both key sectors and Local Authorities. Under the Framework the guidelines will be strengthened to support Local Authorities and sectors in preparing their adaptation strategies and plans respectively so as to ensure that a coherent and consistent approach to adaptation planning is adopted at national, regional and local levels.</p>  <p>  In addition, and again under the Framework, I will be putting in place arrangements so as to further develop the online climate information platform, Climate Ireland, which provides tools to assist both sectors and Local Authorities in planning and prioritising adaptation actions.  While the  platform will provide operational support to the key sectors concerned, it will also serve as an educational and awareness resource for the private sector and civil society who also have a key role to play in enabling our climate resilient transition.</p>  <p>  Adaptation planning is an iterative process with the NAF and the Sectoral Plans prepared under it to be reviewed at least once every five years in line with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. This will ensure that we adopt a dynamic approach to adaptation planning which is informed by the latest scientific evidence thus enabling Departments, Agencies and Local Authorities to modify or escalate adaptation actions as appropriate.</p>  <p>  This week government will publish our new National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan, both of which are critically important to how we implement the NAF. Climate proofing our spatial planning processes and recognising the investments required to achieve climate resilience are key objectives under the NAF and this Government and my Department are committed to seeing that these objectives are met. </p>  <p>  In the coming weeks I will be returning to Government to get approval for requesting the key sectors to start preparing their respective adaptation plans, thus initiating another key step in developing a whole-of-Government approach to how we will achieve climate resilience under this new statutory NAF.  </p></reply>

Today 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband.  By the end of this year that number will rise to nearly 8 out of 10 premises and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises or 90% of premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This will be achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p>  <p>  I fully recognise the importance of availability of high speed broadband connectivity to employment in rural Ireland and appreciate the frustration felt by people in rural areas who do not currently have access to this level of connectivity.  </p>  <p>  My Department is continuing the formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area and the procurement process is now at an advanced stage. </p>  <p>  Delivering high speed broadband to citizens across Ireland remains my firm commitment and that of the Government.</p>  <p>  In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services.</p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

Since this Government came into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband.  By the end of this year nearly 8 out of 10 premises and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p>  <p>  There are just under 32,000 premises in County Wexford which do not currently have access to a high speed broadband connection. Of these, over 10,000 will receive a high speed broadband connection via commercial investment by the end of 2018 under eir's ongoing 300k rural deployment, while the remaining circa 21,500 will be served via the planned State led intervention. </p>  <p>  My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now at an advanced stage.  The NBP procurement team in my Department will continue to engage intensively with all the relevant stakeholders in the process, including the sse/enet consortium which has reaffirmed its commitment to the procurement process.  My Department will continue to engage with the bidder to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract. </p>  <p>  Based on the momentum of the eir rollout, I expect that the company that delivers the State led intervention, when it is up and running, can reach the vast majority of premises in the intervention area within 3 years of the commencement of rollout.</p>  <p>  Delivering high speed broadband to every citizen in Wexford and every other county remains my firm commitment and that of the Government.</p></reply>

There are approximately 900 EV charge points in Ireland of which circa 70 are rapid chargers. A map showing eCars public charge points is available on the ESB&rsquo;s website at </font><font color="#0D0D0D">.  </font>In addition to the charge points installed by ESB eCars, car manufacturers are also becoming increasingly involved in the provision of charging infrastructure. I understand that Nissan has a number of charge points available through its dealer network and Tesla provides charge points for its vehicles at two locations in Co. Laois and Co. Tipperary.  In addition, Lidl Ireland has installed chargepoints in a number of its car parks.</p><p>The National Policy Framework on the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland: 2017 to 2030 states that Ireland&rsquo;s current EV charging network infrastructure is ahead of current market demand.  This is helped by Ireland&rsquo;s capability for home charging being greater than that of other countries with approximately 80% of EV owners charging at home. However, it is imperative that the future development of the EV public charging progresses alongside the growth of Electric Vehicles.  </p><p>In Budget 2018 I secured additional funding to support both public and home charging.  A new grant scheme is now available to support the purchase and installation of home chargers and &euro;1.8 million has been allocated to support public charging. The Low Emissions Vehicle Taskforce, which is co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is considering a range of options for effective and efficient EV charging. The key objectives are supporting the operation of the existing charging network and facilitating the expansion of the network, with a particular focus on increasing the number of fast chargers.  The Taskforce held a stakeholder workshop in November 2017 to explore issues related to the future requirements for the public charging infrastructure. This workshop included representatives of EV owners, the motor industry, local authorities and other key stakeholders. Valuable feedback was provided which will assist the Taskforce in devising a sustainable policy framework for effective and efficient electric vehicle charging.</p></reply>

These include front-line consular and passport services to citizens and communities.</p>  <p>  In relation to transgender, Section 11 of the Passports Act 2008, as amended, provides for the issuing of a passport in a new gender and, if applicable, in a new name to applicants producing a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC) provided by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The Passport Service provides training to staff on these sensitive cases and has written guidelines for processing applications.  Information on the documents required for a passport in a new gender are available on the Passport Service website at www.dfa.ie/passports-citizenship/top-passport-questions/documentary-requirements-passport-applications.  My Department also works closely with the Transgender Equality Network Ireland, including to ensure that clarifications on any passport-related matter are provided promptly.</p>  <p>  Following the enactment of the Gender Recognition of Foreign Births Regulations in December 2017, the Global Irish Services Division of my Department launched the Register of Gender Recognition of Foreign Births.  The introduction of the Register allows Irish citizens who have obtained citizenship through Foreign Births Registration to be recorded under their preferred gender and name.  As part of that initiative, staff working in the Foreign Births Registration Unit of the Department were briefed on the new Regulations, as well as on transgender issues more widely. </p>  <p>  Separately, my Department is participating in the ongoing review of the Gender Recognition Act 2015.</p>  <p>  Within my Department, a Sub-Committee of the Management Board on Gender Equality, Equality and Diversity was established in 2016 to support an inclusive and diverse working environment.  The Committee is chaired by two members of the Management Board.  The initiative works to foster a culture of respect and equality to benefit the Department, its staff and ultimately the citizens that we serve.  The focus of the Sub-Committee is the Department&rsquo;s treatment of the grounds for discrimination in employment equality law.  Significant progress has been made on a number of Departmental initiatives to address barriers to equality in our work place and in service provision. </p>  <p>  The Sub-Committee, in cooperation with the Human Resources Unit and other sections, runs regular events to celebrate and support equality and diversity at home and through our Mission network overseas. </p></reply>

As an employer, the Department must fulfil its obligations under equality legislation, particularly the Employment Equality Act 1998-2015.</p>  <p>  The Employment Equality Act 1998-2015, outlaws discrimination in a wide range of employment and employment-related areas.  These include recruitment and promotion; equal pay; working conditions; learning opportunities - whether on the job or formal training; dismissal and harassment including sexual harassment. </p>  <p>  In 2015, the Civil Service published its revised Dignity a Work Policy which was developed in partnership between the civil service management and staff unions.  The revised policy which applies to staff of the Department of Finance, aims to promote respect, dignity, safety and equality in the workplace.  Every member of staff should be aware that all forms of bullying, harassment and sexual harassment are unacceptable and every member of staff has a duty to behave in an acceptable and respective manner.</p>  <p>  As part of the revised policy a new role of Designated Person and Contact person were introduced.  The contact person is someone who is available to listen and provide information to a staff member who may be concerned regarding bullying, harassment or sexual harassment in the workplace.</p>  <p>  In addition the Civil Service Employment Service, CSEAS, is a neutral support service and provides a wide range of free and confidential supports to all employees of the Department.</p>  <p>  Lastly, I wish to advise the Deputy that the Department of Finance, has run unconscious bias training for staff and that during 2017 over 175 staff attended this training. The Department proposed to provide further opportunities for staff to attend unconscious bias training during 2018.</p></reply>

This decision was based on article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage.  The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.  </p><p>The personal tax credits and standard rate bands available to a married couple or a couple in a civil partnership are therefore equal in value to the personal tax credits and bands available to two individuals, with the difference being that one spouse&rsquo;s personal tax credit and a portion of his or her standard rate band may be transferred to their spouse if they so choose.  This can be of benefit where one spouse has low income or does not work outside the home and therefore does not use their own credit and rate bands in full.</p><p>Where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of income tax as a separate and unconnected individual.Each partner is entitled in his or her own right to the tax credits and standard rate band appropriate to a single person, but do not have the option to partially transfer their personal tax credit and/or rate band.  Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership, which is why they are not accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.</p><p>From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a tax regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners.  Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status.  It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting.  It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  </p><p>It should also be noted that, while there may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for the couple and for persons connected with them.To counter tax avoidance, special provisions often apply in respect of transactions between &ldquo;connected persons&rdquo; as defined throughout the various Tax Acts.  The definition of &ldquo;connected persons&rdquo; usually extends to the relatives and children of a taxpayer&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner.Such provisions would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a taxpayer&rsquo;s cohabiting partner where the couple has no legal recognition of their status as a couple. </p></reply>

The incidents of wetter winters and the number of heavy rainfall days per year are both projected to increase, giving rise to greater risk from river and urban storm water flooding. </p>  <p>  While there is considerable uncertainty associated with most aspects of the potential impacts of climate change on flood risk (e.g. how fast sea levels will continue to rise into the future), the OPW considered that it was prudent to take the potential for climate change into account in the development of proposed measures in the Catchment Flood Risk Management (CFRAM) Programme.</p>  <p>  One of the main objectives of the CFRAM Programme has been to assess the existing flood risk and also the potential for significant increases in this risk in the future, including due to climate change.  </p>  <p>  Therefore the OPW&rsquo;s CFRAM Programme took into account the assessment of risk for two potential future scenarios, the:</p>  <p>  - Mid-Range Future Scenario - increase in rainfall of 20% and sea level rise of 500mm (20 inches), and</p>  <p>  - High-End Future Scenario - increase in rainfall of 30% and sea level rise of 1,000 mm (40 inches). </p>  <p>  In this way, the assessment of potentially feasible proposed measures to be outlined the Flood Risk Management Plans have taken into account how they might cope with the potential impact of climate change. The specific adaptation strategy for each proposed measure can be assessed when the measures are developed in further detail at a project-level. </p>  <p>  In general, flood relief schemes in the OPW's current Capital Programme are designed to be adaptable in the future for climate change. Some defences are constructed with an inbuilt allowance for climate change where it might be difficult or costly to undertake works in the future while others are built without an allowance but can be extended in the future to take account of climate change.</p></reply>

The sub-committee identified a small number of areas where targeted maintenance would increase the conveyance capacity of the river.</p>  <p>  During 2017, targeted maintenance works were carried out at Madden&rsquo;s Island, downstream of Banagher, to improve the conveyance capacity and navigation of the Shannon. Further works were due to be carried out this month however this has not been possible due to the high water level on the channel. This work will be carried out later this year during the next cutting season.</p>  <p>  Following the receipt of consent in September 2017 from the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, targeted works have been planned for a number of other locations for the appropriate seasonal windows. To date, work has been carried out at Muckinish and Shannon Grove (Kilnaborris), in accordance with the consent provided. Further work at these and other locations for which consent applies will be planned in terms of the seasonal restrictions that may apply to the types of activity required at each site.</p></reply>

The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans. </p>  <p>  The CFRAM Programme focussed on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding. The proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified for AFAs are outlined in the Flood Risk Management Plans.  </p>  <p>  The Draft Flood Risk Management Plans were published for public consultation in 2016 and a significant volume of submissions were received for consideration.  In Summer 2017, the OPW finalised all Plans and each Plan was submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for an independent review of the environmental assessments. This independent review is expected to be completed this week, after which the Final Plans will be formally submitted to the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for approval, in accordance with the statutory requirements. </p>  <p>  I would hope in the coming weeks to seek the approval from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for the Flood Risk Management Plans developed under the CFRAM process.</p></reply>

In order to support schools in developing a positive whole-school approach the Department has produced a range of guidance documents and has also supported the provision of guidance by civil society organisations. &ldquo;Being LGBT in School &ndash; A Resource for Post-Primary Schools to Prevent Homophobic and Transphobic Bullying and Support LGBT Students&rdquo;, which was developed by the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network (GLEN) with the support of the Department, provides guidance in relation to supporting LGBT students in schools. The resource, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, includes a section that addresses the specific support needs of students who identify as transgender. The non-governmental organisation, Transgender Equality Network Ireland (TENI) provided advice and support to ensure that this information is both practical and respectful to the needs of young people who are transgender. </p><p>The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) Wellbeing Team have also developed a number of resources in the area of Relationship and Sexuality Education (RSE) in conjunction with representative groups. These resources, which are available at <i></i>,  include guidance for teachers, schools and guidance counsellors on their role in supporting LGBT students. PDST also offer a specific 1 day Seminar on Gender and Sexual Orientation. This seminar is for teachers of Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) and RSE and explores the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people. Participants receive the &lsquo;Growing Up LGBT&rsquo; resource and explore how to raise awareness through both the curriculum and at a whole school level.</p><p>In addition, inclusive education is a mandatory area of study in programmes of initial teacher education (ITE), The ITE graduate is required to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the factors that promote and hinder learning, the impact of pupils&rsquo; backgrounds and identities on learning and the need to provide for the holistic development of the learner, particularly through differentiated approaches. </p><p>At the Department level, civil servants are subject to the terms of the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour which outlines that officials should treat members of the public and their peer workers with dignity and respect. At section 12 of the Code it specifically addresses the matter of relationships with colleagues and states the nine grounds that Civil Servants have a legal duty to ensure that they do not discriminate on as stated in the Equality Act. At this section there is specific reference made that an official cannot discriminate on the basis of gender and this includes transgender. When the Code was published it was circulated to all staff and they were requested to sign an undertaking that they had read the document. All new appointees are presented with a copy of the Code and have to sign a similar undertaking. In addition to this Civil servants are obliged to support the Civil Service Policy on harassment, sexual harassment and bullying and a copy of the Dignity at Work Policy can be viewed on the Department&rsquo;s intranet site.</p><p>Finally, my Department is represented on the group that has been established by the Minister of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to review the Gender Recognition Act 2015. The Group, which is chaired by Moninne Griffith, Executive Director of BeLonG To, met for the first time in December 2017.</p></reply>

The Employee Assistance Programme plays a key role in supporting staff, particularly those who have been injured on duty. </p>  <p>  In October 2016, the Irish Prison Service launched an Independent Counselling Service for staff, which is provided by Inspire Workplaces.  This service is available to all staff and is free of charge.  This is an important enhancement of the Irish Prison Service Employee Assistance Programme.  This Counselling Service is completely confidential and is designed to assist employees in resolving personal or work-related concerns.   It is a 24/7 Freephone helpline, with access to up to 6 counselling sessions for support covering a wide range of issues.  </p>  <p>  For the purpose of sick pay, absences that are deemed to be Occupational Injury or Disease related, are dealt with under Civil Service Circulars which allow for six months on full pay followed by six months on half pay.  In 2015, the Director General sought and obtained sanction to introduce a Serious Physical Assault Scheme which allows that, in certain cases, full pay may be sanctioned up to a maximum of twelve months.  This is a considerable benefit for the small number of staff affected.  The Scheme which was introduced in July 2015 is an interim arrangement pending the completion by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform of a full review of Occupational Injury or Disease in the Public Service.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service is committed to strengthening the support that the Irish Prison Service provides for staff.  The Irish Prison Service is introducing the CISM (Critical Incident Stress Management) model of interventions, which has been endorsed by the State Claims Agency.  CISM provides guidance to staff on how to manage and control stress and reduce or eliminate uncontrolled stress.  CISM comprises of a continuum of care and targets the response of individuals and groups of individuals to traumatic events rather than the incident itself.  It aims to minimise the emotional impact of critical incidents on staff, increase the resistance and resilience of staff to harmful stress and prevent the harmful effects on staff of these incidents by working with and supporting employees at the time of critical incidents.</p>  <p>  Information on these supports is available through the Employee Assistance Programme and a booklet for staff is available in all prisons and on the Irish Prison Service intranet.  The responsibility for the Human Resource function in each prison and unit of the Irish Prison Service lies with the HR Governor and the HR office.  It is the responsibility of the HR Governor to maintain supportive contact with staff members who have been injured in the course of their duties.</p></reply>

The Employee Assistance Programme plays a key role in supporting staff, particularly those who have been injured on duty. </p>  <p>  In October 2016, the Irish Prison Service launched an Independent Counselling Service for staff, which is provided by Inspire Workplaces.  This service is available to all staff and is free of charge.  This is an important enhancement of the Irish Prison Service Employee Assistance Programme.  This Counselling Service is completely confidential and is designed to assist employees in resolving personal or work-related concerns.  It is a 24/7 Freephone helpline, with access to up to 6 counselling sessions for support covering a wide range of issues.  </p>  <p>  In February 2015, the Irish Prison Service launched its Accommodations (Rehabilitative/Restricted Duties) Policy which provides workplace rehabilitation that supports and enables injured or sick employees to remain at or return to the workplace to continue the discharge of work duties.  The objective of this policy is to facilitate an early return to work following a period of sickness absence where an employee may not be fit for a &ldquo;full range of operational duties&rdquo;.  This rehabilitation period will be for a maximum of  3 months following receipt of medical advice form the Officer of the Chief Medical Officer.</p></reply>

These studies are on the website <i><i>www.cso.ie</i></i><i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i></p><p>The 2016 study reports on:</p><p>- Prison Recidivism which is a detailed study on those who were released from a custodial prison sentence in 2010 and whether they were subsequently convicted of a further offence up to the end of 2013 and </p><p>- Probation Recidivism which is a detailed study of recidivism among offenders placed under Probation Service supervision in 2010.</p><p>The Prison Recidivism Study&rsquo;s findings indicate that the recidivism or re-offending rate was 45.1% for the particular cohort of offenders released in 2010.  When compared with the equivalent cohort from the 2009 study there is a fall in recidivism of 2.4%.  This follows the 3.5% decrease that was seen for the 2009 cohort from the previous report. </p><p>For the purposes of this study, release recidivism is defined as an individual committing a criminal offence (a 're-offence') within a three year period following their release from prison and being subsequently convicted for that offence.  Internationally, sample selection and definitions of recidivism as well as follow up times &amp;amp; outcomes can vary considerably.  These differences in recording and reporting practises can invalidate findings and make comparisons between countries difficult.  In this respect, it will be noted that no link to an international comparison is provided in that section of the CSO website where the 2016 study is published.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the Presidents of the Courts and the presiding judges who are, under the constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. </p><p>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the Circuit Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the High Court in family law proceedings (including judicial separation, divorce and nullity), with the High Court generally dealing with cases involving considerable assets or income as well as appeals from the Circuit Court.  Where the market value of lands exceeds &euro;3 million the Circuit Court must, on application to it by an interested party, transfer the proceedings to the High Court. </p><p>The Courts Service has advised that the current waiting time in the High Court for a hearing date for a divorce case is three months from the time the parties indicate to the Court that they are ready for hearing.  Issues which may arise between parties before trial may result in a case taking considerably longer, but there is currently no backlog in the High Court of cases awaiting hearing dates. </p><p>The Courts Service has also advised that waiting times for the transaction of family law business in the Circuit Court are listed in the table, noting that waiting times are collated on a Court office basis rather than on an individual Court basis and that the waiting times are not specifically collated on a case type basis e.g. divorce cases.</p><p><b>Circuit Court Family Law - Waiting times in months </b><table><tr><th>Office</th><th>Family Law <br /><br />Contested</th><th>Family Law<br /><br />Non-contested</th><th>Family Law  <br /><br />Appeals</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>Next sitting</td><td>Next sitting</td><td>Next sitting</td></tr><tr><td>Carrick on Shannon</td><td>6</td><td>Next sitting</td><td>Next sitting </td></tr><tr><td>Castlebar</td><td>Next sitting </td><td>Next sitting</td><td>Next sitting</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>6</td><td>Next sitting</td><td>Next sitting</td></tr><tr><td>Clonmel</td><td>Next sitting </td><td>Next sitting </td><td>Next sitting </td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>6-9 </td><td>Next sitting </td><td>Next sitting </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>3-5  </td><td>2</td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk</td><td>6-12 </td><td>Next sitting </td><td>6-12</td></tr><tr><td>Ennis</td><td>6</td><td>Next sitting</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>Next sitting</td><td>Next sitting</td><td>Next sitting </td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>6</td><td>Next sitting</td><td>Next sitting</td></tr><tr><td>Letterkenny</td><td>6-9</td><td>Next sitting </td><td>6-9 </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>Next sitting </td><td>Next sitting </td><td>3-6</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>Next sitting </td><td>Next sitting</td><td>Next sitting </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>Next sitting</td><td>Next sitting</td><td>Next sitting</td></tr><tr><td>Mullingar</td><td>6 </td><td>Next sitting</td><td>Next sitting</td></tr><tr><td>Naas</td><td>6 </td><td>Next sitting </td><td>6 </td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td>Next sitting</td><td>Next sitting</td><td>Next sitting </td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>Next sitting</td><td>Next sitting</td><td>Next sitting </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>Next sitting</td><td>Next sitting </td><td>Next sitting </td></tr><tr><td>Tralee</td><td>Next sitting </td><td>Next sitting </td><td>Next sitting </td></tr><tr><td>Trim</td><td>6-9 </td><td>Next sitting </td><td>6-9 </td></tr><tr><td>Tullamore</td><td>6 </td><td>Next sitting</td><td>Next sitting</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>3-6 </td><td>Next sitting </td><td>Next sitting </td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>6-12</td><td>Next sitting</td><td>3-6 </td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>6-9</td><td>3-6</td><td>6</td></tr></table></p><p>Note: The waiting time is from receipt of notice of trial/notice of motion to listing for hearing in contested and uncontested matters.</p><p>The Courts Service has further advised that delays in the hearing of cases and the size of court lists can be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are outside the control of the courts and the Courts Service, for example, the unavailability of a witness or vital evidence, delays in the furnishing of reports or because the parties and/or legal practitioners are not ready to proceed on allocated dates.  This gives rise to adjournments, which can have an impact on the time taken to complete the hearing of a case and on the number of cases which can be disposed of in a court sitting. Most adjournments are sought by parties to a case.</p><p>The Courts Service has also informed me that the Presidents of the High and Circuit Courts monitor waiting times and workload across all court lists and seeks to ensure the optimum use of court time and judicial resources.  Wherever possible, the Presidents targets additional judicial resources at the areas of greatest need. </p><p>The Government is committed to significant reform of the courts, including the establishment of a family law court structure that is streamlined, more efficient, and less costly.  My Department is currently working on the General Scheme of a Family Court Bill which will aim to streamline family law court processes, clarify jurisdictional issues and provide for a set of guiding principles to help ensure that the Family Court will operate in a user-friendly and efficient manner.  The intention is to establish a dedicated Family Court within the existing court structures.  The Family Court Bill will support the provisions in the Mediation Act 2017 by encouraging greater use of alternative dispute resolution to assist in more timely resolution of family law cases.  </p><p>I hope to secure Government approval in the coming months for the General Scheme of a Family Court Bill.  Once the General Scheme has been approved by Government, it will be referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and to the relevant Oireachtas Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p></reply>

That Commencement Order brought provisions of Parts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 13 of the Act into operation.  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 355 of 2017) commenced part of section 47(c) of the Act with effect from 31 July 2017 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement) (No. 2) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 474 of 2017) commenced provisions of the Act relating to adoption by civil partners and cohabiting couples with effect from 2 November 2017. </p>  <p>  Part 10 of the Act, which amended the Passports Act 2008, was commenced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on 1 July 2015.</p>  <p>  Part 11 of the Act, which related to adoption, was not commenced and was repealed by section 2(2) of the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, which came into operation on 19 October 2017, as provided for by the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017 (Commencement) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 443 of 2017).  The provisions in Part 11 have been incorporated into the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, for which the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is responsible.  </p>  <p>  Section 177 of the Act has not yet been commenced due to technical issues, which have now been resolved.  The Department is currently reviewing the section to ensure that there are no further outstanding issues.  It is expected that the section will be commenced in early course. </p>  <p>  Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provide for parentage through donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR).  The issue of the recognition of parentage for same-sex couples and their children is dealt with under Part 2 of the Act.  The Minister for Health has responsibility for commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act.  </p>  <p>  Other provisions of the Act which relate to DAHR have not yet been commenced as they are linked to Parts 2 and 3.  The commencement of the provisions of the Act which are related to Parts 2 and 3 will be co-ordinated with the commencement of those Parts by the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill is undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health.  That Bill will provide for the establishment of an Assisted Human Reproduction Regulatory Authority which will, among other things, undertake certain functions under Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.</p>  <p>  Part 9 of the Act provides for a number of amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004.  No provision of Part 9 has yet been commenced.  Some sections cannot be commenced until Parts 2 and 3 are brought into operation by the Minister for Health.  Other sections are dependent on provisions of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 being commenced and my Department is liaising with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in relation to scheduling the commencement of these sections.</p></reply>

Upon approval of the grant, the applicant will receive an up-front payment of 50% of the grant with the balance to be paid when the system is fully operational. </p><p>The requirements of the scheme are based on similar requirements that applied to the previous grant scheme operated by my Department between 2005 and 2013 which assisted with the establishment of some 45 systems. </p><p>The key requirements for the establishment of such systems are statutorily based and require that the proposal must&mdash;</p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant Local Authority, which must also act as Data Controller &ndash; this is a long-standing statutory requirement, set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (S.I.

Minister Charles Flanagan T.D. and I participate in the Taskforce which is composed of key Government Departments, State Agencies and non-State actors.</p><p>Concern was expressed by the Taskforce at the difficulty in identifying suitable social housing solutions in the main urban centres due to the high demand for housing and the limited supply available in these locations. It was agreed by the Taskforce that a Housing Sub-Group would be established to co-ordinate the provision of medium to long-term housing accommodation for the people arriving under the IRPP relocation and resettlement programmes. </p><p>This sub-Group was comprised of the following members: - </p><p>- Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government </p><p>- City and County Management Association </p><p>- Department of Justice and Equality </p><p>- Irish Red Cross. </p><p>The sub-Group prepared an approach for resettling people arriving under the IRPP according to a series of objective criteria including the population size of the county into which they were to be resettled.  The Taskforce adopted this approach and decided to exclude<b></b>the Dublin local authorities (and other local authorities with responsibility for major urban areas) from the initial distribution of refugees into accommodation sourced by the local authorities because of the pressure on housing supply in those areas.  This decision may be reviewed by the Taskforce in the future.  </p><p>However, it should be noted that the Irish Red Cross coordinates a programme of voluntarily pledged accommodation for people arriving under the IRPP.  Pledged accommodation is sourced in urban areas across Ireland, including in Dublin.  So far 26 persons have been accommodated in Dublin through this option and I anticipate that further persons will be accommodated in Dublin in the months ahead.</p></reply>

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination and can be a difficult diagnosis to make in cases which do not develop the characteristic rash.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease. </p>  <p>  Testing for Lyme disease is available in each of the HSE&rsquo;s Hospital Groups, who have a number of Infectious Disease Consultants who are expert in the diagnosis and management of the disease. Laboratories in Ireland generally follow the laboratory testing recommendations of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Disease Society of America, the European Federation of Neurological Societies, and the British Infection Association. Irish laboratories have their own quality assurance methods to make sure the tests are working correctly as well as being accredited by the Irish National Accreditation Body to perform the test correctly.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory. This laboratory uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities which involves a screening test followed by a confirmatory test.  Testing which is performed abroad may be performed in laboratories which have not met National or International Accreditation (Quality Standards) and these tests may be more likely to give a &ldquo;false positive&rdquo; result. </p>  <p>  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics by General Practitioners.  In Ireland, treatment by most clinicians is based on that laid out in evidence-based guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2006.  Antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications, and are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.   </p>  <p>  As accredited testing and treatment are readily available in Ireland, there is no need for anyone to travel abroad for diagnosis or treatment.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-14a.386.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018021400080#WRM01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158, 188 and 189 together.</p>  <p>  Transgender-specific guidelines have been developed by WPATH (World Professional Association for Transgender Health) and the Endocrine Society (who updated their guidelines in 2017). These guidelines were devised by experts in transgender healthcare, along with members of the International Transgender, Transsexual and LGBT community, and supported by the Transgender Equality Network of Ireland (TENI).</p>  <p>  The guidelines recommend a comprehensive multidisciplinary psychosocial assessment prior to commencement of hormone therapy by endocrinology services. The assessment focuses on more than just assessment for the possible diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria. The guidelines highlight several criteria which must be met prior to referral for hormonal intervention. It is important that co-morbid conditions are identified and addressed, and that people access the supports that they need to manage co-morbid difficulties, which can impact on response to medical transition (including hormone treatment). </p>  <p>  International best practice involves an assessment by a multi-disciplinary team and shared decision making in the best interests of the individual. Both WPATH and the Endocrine Society Guidelines 2017 specify the assessment must be carried out by a mental health professional (s) with experience in transgender healthcare and possess specific skills. Endocrinologists and General Practitioners (GPs) do not possess these skills, and require access to the multidisciplinary team as described. GPs would only see a small number of gender variant individuals during their lifetime in clinical practice, and would not be in a position to build up the requisite skillset outlined in WPATH and Endocrine Society Guidelines or have the time resource to conduct a comprehensive evaluation. </p>  <p>  Informed consent is essential, whereby benefits and risks of hormone treatment and surgery are discussed with individuals seeking these interventions. Although regret rates are low, it can happen and can also lead to high levels of psychological distress. Healthcare providers work with people to try to prevent negative outcomes. The emerging evidence on good outcomes following medical and/or surgical transitioning is based on use of multi-disciplinary psychosocial assessment, fulfilment of criteria for hormones and on-going psychological support throughout the process. It is important that psychological support is available to individuals before, during and after transitioning. </p>  <p>  Prescription of hormone blockers and cross-sex hormones for transgender people is relatively new. Significant side effects can occur with cross sex hormones including irreversible physical changes and infertility. There is a lack of long-term research on outcomes. For these reasons the decision to prescribe should only be made by specialists (i.e. Endocrinologists) in consultation with other professionals involved in the assessment process. Shared decision-making is in accordance with best practice internationally.  Prescriptions can then be supported by local GPs with specialist guidance. </p>  <p>  The Best Practice approach as outlined above is endorsed in the Service Development Model as developed by the Quality Improvement Division of the HSE in 2017, in collaboration with TENI. This model is providing the framework for the development of National Gender Clinics and MDTs for children and adults, funded by the Acute Hospitals and Mental Health Divisions of the HSE. Recruitment will commence to develop these national teams in 2018. This investment in new posts in 2018 which includes one consultant endocrinologist (adult services), one consultant endocrinologist (paediatric services), one social worker (adult services), one speech and language therapist (adult services), one senior psychologist (adult services), one senior psychologist (paediatric services), one clinical nurse specialist (Paediatric services), two administrative support officers (adult and paediatric services) is a concerted measure by the HSE to address the waiting times and immediate service needs of children, adolescents and adults in transition. The HSE, across a number of programmes including mental health, acute hospitals, primary care and social inclusion, is committed to building services for this community in accordance with International Best Practice. </p>  <p>  The HSE is a member of the group established to review the operation of the Gender Recognition Act, and the Department has no plans to make a submission to the review group. The number of persons waiting to see physicians regarding hormone replacements therapy and the number of physicians treating persons for hormone replacement therapy are service matters. I have referred these issues to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The National Plan set out the projected infrastructure and equipment required to meet the needs for radiation oncology over a 20 year period. </p>  <p>  Radiation oncology is available in five public hospitals: St. James's Hospital, Beaumont Hospital, St. Luke's Hospital Rathgar (which three together form the St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Network, Dublin), Cork University Hospital and University Hospital Galway. Radiation oncology services for public patients are also provided in two private facilities in Waterford and Limerick under the aegis of Cork University Hospital and University Hospital Galway respectively. Meanwhile, patients from the North West can receive radiation oncology treatment at the North West Cancer Centre in Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Derry.</p>  <p>  The model of care for radiation oncology allows for the sufficient volume and concentration of activity and expertise to facilitate high quality radiation oncology treatments in line with best evidence and international best practice. Modern radiation oncology is increasingly complex. Delivery of such complex care requires several key components to ensure safe, high quality radiation therapy. These include appropriate physical infrastructure and equipment to meet the needs of both patients and staff, a highly trained multidisciplinary team including specialist doctors, nurses, radiation therapists, physicists and other health and social care professionals and a system of quality assurance that can ensure that radiation oncology services are safe, effective, equitable, efficient, timely and centred on the patients needs. </p>  <p>  Future planned developments for radiation oncology services include the construction of new and upgraded facilities in Galway and Cork and the expansion of the facility in Beaumont. In line with the National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 and the National Plan for Radiation Oncology, it is not intended to establish a centre for radiation oncology in the Midlands Regional Hospital, Tullamore.</p></reply>

This is closely related to a public consultation conducted by the Department in 2017 on the drafting of a health information policy framework.  Preparations will continue in the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  A number of staff in key areas of my Department have attended relevant seminars and presentations in recent months and I expect that additional training will take place over the course of the coming months.  An appointment to the role of Data Protection Officer, as required under the GDPR, will be made in time for the coming into effect of the regulation in May this year.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware of the key recommendation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility<i></i>that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  The Expert Panel Report also concluded that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  Therefore, medical card provision is based on financial assessment.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Accordingly, a patient suffering from either MS or MND will not have automatic eligibility for a medical card.</p><p>Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.  In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.</p><p>Within the application process, the HSE endeavours to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  The legislation allows the HSE, in certain circumstances, to exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. </p><p>The HSE is required to undertake reviews of eligibility in order to ensure that a person continues to meet the qualifying criteria required to continue holding eligibility.  Where a medical card is due to expire, these cards are reviewed and a renewal notice is sent out to the medical card holder three months in advance of the expiry date.  It is important to note that the person under review maintains eligibility for the card while the review is being conducted, including any period where additional information is requested.  It should be noted that no reviews of discretionary medical cards are taking place at this time.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017.</p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-licence use for pain not associated with shingles.</p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN.</p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  In August 2017 the HSE advised GPs of the changes and of treatment alternatives.</p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes.  The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision.</p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,500 applications from GPs, of which some 10% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.</p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  Of some 200 appeals to date, the HSE advises that over 50% have been accepted on clinical grounds.</p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at .</p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

The Deputy is correct to refer to the dairy sector, but labour pressures also exist in the horticultural and meat processing sectors.  The reasons for the shortages include: the significant value added growth expansion of the sector in recent years; the growth in the economy as a whole, now approaching full employment; and also economic growth in other EU countries which have traditionally supplied workers for the sector.</p>  <p>  My Department and I have had extensive engagement with the industry on the shortage of labour in the dairy, horticulture and meat processing sectors.  The issues within the Horticulture sector have been discussed at the Horticulture Industry Forum which my colleague, Minister of State Doyle, co-chairs, while the challenges faced by the meat processing industry in securing labour have also been raised with me by meat industry representatives.  I am aware of the impact that these labour shortages are having, and I am committed to helping the sectors involved find appropriate solutions.</p>  <p>  In relation to the dairy sector, last November I established a multi stakeholder industry group with a view to ensuring that Irish dairying has access to the human capital it requires to achieve future growth.  The Chair, former Secretary General of my Department Tom Moran, expects to finalise an action plan towards the end of this month which will address the short term and medium term labour issues facing the dairy sector.  This action plan will be submitted to the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC) for approval.</p>  <p>  In addition to the work of this group, a range of other measures are being pursued by the dairy sector to try to attract and retain labour, including exchanges with New Zealand; and efforts at regional level to engage with and attract people on the live register, homemakers and drystock farmers to avail of opportunities on dairy farms.</p>  <p>  My Department and I are also engaged in discussions with my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and her officials in relation to employment permits for non-European Economic Area nationals, as a further strand in the range of options available to address the labour gap. These discussions are ongoing and I do not want to pre-empt their outcome.</p></reply>

I understand that the Department of Health is working to finalise the European Union (Basic Safety Standards for Protection Against Dangers from Medical Exposure to Ionising Radiation) Regulations 2018 in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  The Basic Safety Standards Directive provides for a risk-based graded approach to the regulatory control of radiation sources in place of the one-size-fits-all system of licensing currently operated by the EPA.  The new graded approach to licensing will provide an alternative system of registration for low-risk activities resulting in a reduction of the regulatory, financial and administrative burden on current licence holders.  The provisions to give effect to the graded approach are set out in the  Radiological Protection (Amendment) Bill which will be published shortly.  The Bill also addresses other legal anomalies that have arisen since the 1991 Radiological Protection Act came into force.  </p>  <p>  The secondary legislation to transpose the remaining elements of the Basic Safety Standards Directive under the remit of my Department has been prepared and will be signed once the Bill is enacted.  </p></reply>

In delivering this function, IFI adapts development, protection and environmental/conservation practices to maximise the return on state investment in policing, conserving and developing the resource.  </p>  <p>  The majority of the fisheries on the River Slaney are in private ownership.  Nevertheless, IFI adopts a wide-ranging protection strategy and delivers an associated broad protection programme on the Slaney system encompassing coastal (from Arklow to Bannow Bay), estuarine and freshwater (main channel and tributaries) environments.  </p>  <p>  Protection measures are delivered through the operation of highly trained, skilled and experienced inland fishery protection and surveillance teams, enabled through deployment of state-of-the-art technology and supporting infrastructure, on a 24 hour, 365 day basis.  </p>  <p>  The implementation of proven traditional work practices has been augmented by the  increasing use of new  innovative approaches such as kayak and bike patrolling, dog assisted patrolling and covert surveillance using advanced digital technologies.  These innovations have assisted in deployment of protection resources and have delivered significantly improved efficiency and effectiveness on the River Slaney system and at a national level.  A total of 2,746 person hours were spent on protection patrolling by the IFI staff in 2017 which included kayak, foot, bicycle and vehicle patrols on the main channel of the River Slaney, its tributaries and some other small coastal rivers.  </p>  <p>  IFI has established a wide-ranging network of stakeholders who liaise with staff regarding possible illegal activity on the River Slaney system.  IFI has also experienced year on year increases in reports received to its 24 hour emergency telephone hotline.  IFI staff respond to, and act on, all valid communications and information relating to poaching on the River Slaney system received via the 24 hour emergency telephone hotline and other communications and information sources.  All this facilitates pre-emptive action by Fisheries Protection Teams when a potential threat is identified.  </p>  <p>  IFI operates a confidential hotline number to enable members of the general public to report incidents -1890 34 74 24 or 1890 FISH 24.  This phone line is designed to encourage the reporting of incidents of illegal fishing, water pollution and invasive species.  </p>  <p>  In the case of serious infringements of fisheries legislation, IFI initiates prosecution proceedings, in some instances in conjunction with the Garda&iacute;.  Garda&iacute; have pursued 4 cases in conjunction with IFI arising from incidents in 2017.  In addition, a system of "Fixed Charge Notices" also facilitates enforcement of fisheries legislation without recourse to the Courts process. This system has enhanced the regulatory capacity of IFI and has improved levels of compliance nationally.  </p></reply>

Under the Acts, the primary management and enforcement response to littering rests with Local Authorities, and it is a matter for each Local Authority to decide on the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean-up actions in their area.  </p><p>When the 2016 National Litter Pollution Monitoring Survey report (<i></i>) identified a very slight deterioration in the litter situation after a number of years of improvement, I took immediate action on the issue by increasing 2017 funding for the Local Authority Anti-Litter and Anti-Graffiti Awareness Grant Scheme (ALAGS) by 28% to &euro;884,000.  The ALAGS scheme enables Local Authorities to support appropriate local public education and awareness initiatives to tackle both litter and graffiti.  In previous years the invitation to submit applications under the scheme has encouraged Local Authorities to consider the development of 'adopt-a-road' styled projects in their functional areas.  In 2017, ten of thirty-one Local Authorities received funding under ALAGS for an &lsquo;adopt-a-road&rsquo; style scheme.  </p><p>In 2017, I also increased funding for the National Spring Clean by &euro;40,000 to &euro;225,000. The campaign, now entering its twentieth year, encourages every sector of society to actively participate and take responsibility for litter by conducting clean-ups of their own local environment.  I intend to maintain these levels of increased funding for 2018.My Department also supports Irish Business Against Litter (IBAL), and has negotiated anti-litter agreements with the banking industry and the chewing gum industry.  My Department also supports the Green Schools Programme, which is key to effecting a long-term change in societal attitudes towards litter disposal.  </p></reply>

The Regulator advised that it published a consumer information notice on 18 October 2017, which provides advice urging vigilance at all times on the part of consumers and listing suggestions for the proactive steps to be taken by those receiving scam calls, and in particular, advising people not to answer or to call back any number which they do not recognise or where there is a bland or no voicemail left.  The notice also provides a phone number for consumers to contact and the Regulator also offers a text call back service and other facilities to assist consumers.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, ComReg continues to monitor the situation closely.  Unfortunately it is not possible to identify scam call numbers in advance, which can resemble normal, familiar geographical or international numbers encountered on a daily basis.</p></reply>

It is important that before we deploy further public money we validate the demand and projected cost in an Irish context. </p>  <p>  The proposed pilot scheme which I announced at the recent Renewable Energy Summit will commence this summer and will target solar PV and self-consumption amongst domestic customers. The data gathered during this scheme and throughout the behavioural and attitudes study will inform future phases of support for micro generation in Ireland, as we align with the ambition of the recast Renewable Energy Directive which recognises the rights, entitlements and obligations of renewable self-consumers and deliver on ambitions and commitments made in the Energy White Paper and the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Further details of the pilot scheme for domestic rooftop solar PV self-consumption will be made available when I have received the study being undertaken  by the SEAI and have had a  opportunity to consider its analysis. I intend that the final decision will be made in sufficient time to allow the scheme to commence this summer.</p>  <p>  As set out in the National Mitigation Plan, a very significant increase in effort is required to realise the potential of the residential sector to contribute to the low carbon transition. Improving the energy efficiency of a home so that it needs less energy to maintain levels of comfort is a prerequisite for  moving off fossil fuels for heating to less energy intensive renewable energy options. This is why I have been providing additional funding to  include deeper energy efficiency measures, combined with renewable technologies, in the range of supports for residential energy efficiency operated by SEAI. Already, solar PV is supported under the Better Energy  Communities Scheme and the Deep Retrofit Pilot. Crucial to these schemes is the advice and technical support available to groups of householders and businesses to undertake these measures and embrace renewable technologies.</p></reply>

The Framework sets out the context to ensure Local Authorities, regions and sectors can assess the key risks and vulnerabilities of climate change, implement climate resilience actions, and ensure climate adaptation considerations are mainstreamed into all local, regional and national policy making. It includes a number of key actions and supporting objectives. </p>  <p>  Under the Framework, seven Government Departments - or Agencies, where appropriate - with responsibility for the twelve priority sectors identified in the Framework will be required to prepare sectoral adaptation plans in line with the requirements of Sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Climate Act and the policies laid out in the Framework. </p>  <p>  The Framework does not identify specific locations or propose adaptation measures or projects in relation to sectors, such as specific measures in relation to flood relief and drainage. Respecting the principle of subsidiarity, detailed adaptation measures will be developed across sectors and Local Government, in accordance with the Framework. </p>  <p>  Under the Climate Act responsibility for the development of sectoral adaptation plans, and the prioritisation of the actions within them, rests with the lead Government Minister responsible for developing the plan. For example, the Framework provides that the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works will prepare a statutory sectoral adaptation plan on flood risk management.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that under the non-statutory 2012 National Climate Change Adaptation Framework, which has now been superseded by the National Adaptation Framework, four draft sectoral plans covering five sectors have already been developed, including for flood risk management, agriculture and forestry, transport, and the electricity and gas networks. These plans will be reviewed and updated in line with the requirements of the new statutory National Adaptation Framework. </p>  <p>  Local understanding is also crucial to getting adaptation right and in this regard Local Authorities will be preparing their own adaptation strategies under the Framework. In publishing the Framework last month, I also announced a funding commitment from my Department of &euro;10 million over five years to establish four Local Authority Regional Climate Action Offices. These will underpin a risk-based approach to climate action at the local and regional level and will provide a coherent and coordinated response to climate change, both in terms of adaptation and mitigation. The Regional Climate Action Offices will be operated by a lead Local Authority in four different regions grouped according to shared climate change risks. The establishment of these offices will enable a more coordinated engagement across the whole of Government and will help build on the experience and expertise which exists across the sector. </p>  <p>  Ireland already has a number of resources in place to assist with adaptation planning, including an online resource and guidelines for both key sectors and Local Authorities. As set out in the Framework I will be putting in place arrangements so as to further develop the online climate information platform, Climate Ireland, which provides tools to assist both sectors and Local Authorities in planning and prioritising adaptation actions.  While the platform will provide operational support to the key sectors concerned it will also serve as an educational and awareness resource for the private sector and civil society who also have a key role to play in enabling our climate resilient transition.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, existing guidelines will be strengthened under the Framework in order to support Local Authorities and sectors in preparing their adaptation strategies and plans respectively, so as to ensure that a coherent and consistent approach to adaptation planning is adopted at national, regional and local levels.</p>  <p>  Adaptation planning is an iterative process, with the National Adaptation Framework and the sectoral plans prepared under it to be reviewed at least once every five years in line with the Climate Act. This will ensure that we adopt a dynamic approach to adaptation planning which is informed by the latest scientific evidence thus enabling Departments, Agencies and Local Authorities to modify or escalate adaptation actions as appropriate. </p>  <p>  In the coming weeks I will be seeking Government approval to request the key sectors to start preparing their respective adaptation plans, thus initiating another key step in developing a whole-of-Government approach to how we will achieve climate resilience under this new statutory National Adaptation Framework.  </p></reply>

At its heart is a commitment to transform Ireland into a low carbon society and economy by 2050 and reduce the country&rsquo;s fossil fuel dependency. This ambitious vision for Ireland&rsquo;s energy system envisages a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from that sector by 80-95% relative to 1990 levels by 2050. The White Paper identifies the long-term strategic importance of diversifying Ireland's energy generation portfolio and largely decarbonising the energy sector by 2050.  It also recognises that oil and natural gas will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in that transition period.  </p><p>In 2016, imported fossil fuels accounted for 69% of our energy needs at a cost of &euro;3.4 billion. Given the inextricable link between energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, achievement of the commitments set out in the National Policy Position and the Energy White Paper will require a significant transformation of Ireland&rsquo;s energy system from being predominantly fossil-fuel based to a clean, low carbon energy system.</p><p>As a means of addressing this challenge, the 2017 National Mitigation Plan<font color="#0D0D0D">sets out over 70 individual mitigation measures and 106 related actions to reduce emissions in the electricity generation, built environment, transport and agriculture sectors. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter target also being legally binding. The most recent annual data from the SEAI indicates that 27.2% of electricity, 6.8% of heat and 5.0% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2016. Overall, SEAI analysis shows that 9.5% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2016 were met from renewable sources.  </font>The SEAI projects that Ireland will achieve between 13.2% and 15.4% of its 16% renewable energy target by 2020, indicating that Ireland should be between 82% and 96%  of its target. </p><p>While the focus of my Department remains firmly on meeting our 2020 renewable target and on implementation of renewable energy measures, including the new  Renewable Electricity Support Scheme and the Support Scheme for Renewal Heat, contingency planning has commenced to explore the potential extent, mechanisms and costs of addressing our targets within the framework of the 2009 Directive.</p><p>Any requirement for the purchase of statistical transfers under the Directive to meet compliance would be undertaken against a background of discussions by the Irish authorities with the EU Commission and relevant Member States. As any purchases arising would be made over a period, the costs to the Exchequer of acquiring statistical transfers to meet any potential shortfall would be spread over a period of more than one year and in any event the cumulative costs would not be known until 2021, the deadline for completion of all purchases.</p></reply>

In direct response to the 2030 Agenda and in advance of Ireland&rsquo;s first national voluntary review at the United Nations in July 2018, my Department is finalising coordination of a National Implementation Plan which I will publish shortly.  Looking beyond the first national voluntary review, I also intend to develop a renewed high-level national policy position on environment protection.  Work on this policy initiative is at an early stage in my Department but I intend to complete it in 2018.</p><p>In addition, both the Environmental Protection Agency's 2016 report on the state of the environment, Ireland's Environment: An Assessment 2016, and the National Risk Assessment 2017, prepared by the Department of the Taoiseach, identify a range of environmental risks but highlight Climate Change and the need to decarbonise the economy as the most pressing environmental issue for Ireland.

I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services and make specific investments in particular locations.  The ComReg consumer helpline is accessible at and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator.</p><p>With respect to the quality of mobile telephony service in other countries, comparisons between Member States and within regions, can be problematic for many reasons, including the fact that the technical characteristics of mobile phone networks that determine coverage and capacity will vary between operators and locations.  Other factors would include the characteristics of individual markets, including topography, population density, frequencies used etc. </p><p>Various initiatives are underway to improve the quality and coverage of mobile services and broadband throughout Ireland. Notwithstanding ComReg&rsquo;s independence, I recognise the frustration felt by Irish consumers where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contains 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits.  The Implementation Group I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery.  This includes ComReg, who attend as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in their role as the independent Regulator.</p><p>In October 2017, together with Minister Kyne, I hosted the first National Stakeholder Forum in Athlone.  It arose from the Taskforce&rsquo;s recognition that, given the rapid technological change and the emergence of new equipment and solutions to deliver telecommunications services, stakeholders needed an opportunity to raise concerns on impediments to the rollout of services. Representatives from the telecoms industry, Government Departments and consumer groups attended the event. Issues impacting on rollout of mobile networks were discussed at the Forum, and there were also some new recommended actions for the Taskforce to help improve services to consumers and in preparing for roll-out of the National Broadband Plan network, once contracts are in place. Following the success of the 2017 event, I plan to hold a similar forum later this year.</p><p>I published the third Taskforce Quarterly Progress Report in November 2017, which demonstrates that good progress has been made in delivering the actions. I plan to publish an Annual Report shortly.  This Report will give an update on progress made on each of the 40 actions and will evidence the continuing progress, together with the sustained level of engagement between action owners and industry.  The Annual Report will also contain a work programme for 2018, with new actions identified that will lead to improvements for consumers across Ireland.</p><p>The Taskforce&rsquo;s achievements to date include:</p><p>- Revisions to Exempted Development Regulations to facilitate prompt roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure and to prepare Ireland for the roll-out of 5G mobile technology;</p><p>- Funding of all local authorities to assign a Broadband Officer; </p><p>- Close cooperation with local authorities to develop local digital strategies and to identify approximately 320 high speed Strategic Community Access Hubs to be connected at an early juncture after award of the NBP contract;</p><p>- ComReg&rsquo;s development of a testing regime to check mobile handset performance which will inform consumers in choosing products and network services. ComReg will also develop a new network coverage map.</p><p>- Most local authorities applying waivers in respect of development contributions for telecoms development.</p><p>- Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has constructed 80km of ducting on the M7/M8 corridor and 14km on the N25 in Cork, with more following in the coming months to help expedite infrastructure roll-out. TII is also reviewing the cost of duct access for telecoms.</p><p>All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of telecommunications services, particularly in rural areas.</p></reply>

For instance, collectors of waste must conduct their activities in accordance with the relevant legislation and the conditions of their waste collection permits which, <i>inter alia</i>, require that waste is managed in line with the waste hierarchy.</p><p>The Government's policy of increasing the landfill levy to its current level of &euro;75 per tonne has provided a real financial incentive for waste operators to divert as much material as possible from being disposed of at landfill.  The success of the above and many other policy and legislative measures, including the National Waste Prevention Programme and the phasing-out of flat rate fees for household waste collection, which encourage waste prevention, preparation for re-use, recycling and other recovery, has meant that more waste can be put to environmentally sustainable and productive use as opposed to being buried in the ground.</p><p>Up until November 2017, different household waste collectors accepted different items for recycling, which lead to some confusion on which items go in which bin.  Now, however, following co-operation between my Department, the regulatory authorities, the waste industry, Repak and environmental NGOs, we have a single, standard national list of items and materials that can be placed in the recycling bin.  Removing confusion will play an important role in improving the quality of the waste presented for recycling.  This will help to ensure that these items are actually recycled, as opposed to being contaminated accidentally by householders and sent to landfill.  Supporting householders to 'do the right thing' in terms of recycling is important.  Householders are also being supported through a number of awareness and education initiatives such as the <i>Recycling Ambassadors Programme </i>and <i>recyclinglistireland.ie.</i></p><p><i></i>Statistics compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency show that we have come a long way in a relatively short period of time in terms of improving our recycling and recovery rates and reducing our reliance on landfill.  In this regard, National Waste Statistics are available to download at <i></i><i><font color="#0000FF">/</font></i>including the State's progress in meeting targets under EU waste legislation including the Waste Framework Directive; the Landfill Directive; and the Producer Responsibility Directives (Packaging, End-of-Life Vehicles, Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, Batteries and Accumulators).</p><p>Of particular note is the reduction in the disposal  (landfill) rate of managed Municipal Solid Waste, which fell from 41% in 2012 to 21% in 2014.</p></reply>

Plastics feature across a wide range of applications and products, such as packaging, construction, electrics and electronics, agriculture, medical and health.</p><p>The effects of plastic pollution, in particular, on the marine environment has been well publicised. My colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is responsible for marine environmental policy, including marine litter policy in the first instance.  Both he and I recognise that the waste that is created on land and certain plastic waste items in particular, can represent significant marine litter problems. Accordingly, we are working together to identify measures to address this with our European partners.</p><p>On 16 January 2018, the Commission published its European Strategy for Plastics in the Circular Economy.  The strategy focuses on plastics production and use and sets a goal of ensuring all plastic packaging is recyclable by 2030.  The strategy is built around 4 key actions:</p><p>- Improving the economics and quality of plastics recycling; </p><p>- Curbing plastic waste and littering; </p><p>- Driving innovation and investment towards circular solutions; and  </p><p>- Harnessing Global Action.</p><p>The strategy lists future EU measures and recommends measures to national authorities and industry for the attainment of its goals.</p><p>Coupled with this, the Commission is pushing for higher mandatory recycling targets for plastics.  Under the current Packaging Directive Member States are required to recycle 22.5% by weight of all plastic packaging.  Under a new Circular Economy legislative package to be finalised this year the Commission is increasing this target to 50% by 2025 and 55% by 2030.</p><p>In terms of plastic packaging at a national level, Repak, the producer responsibility scheme tasked with managing packaging in Ireland, has been working with its members (including all the major retailers)  to identify ways to reduce or optimise packaging.  Under the EU Packaging Directive, Member States cannot impede the placing on the market of packaging which is fit for purpose. Notwithstanding this, I am working with the Local Authorities to roll out an education programme on the recycling of all waste, including plastics.</p></reply>

These Directives also include rules on how Member States should monitor, assess and manage ambient air quality.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with co-ordinating and managing the monitoring programme.</p><p>Under the Directives, EU Member States must designate &quot;zones&quot; for the purpose of managing air quality.  For Ireland, four zones were defined in the Air Quality Standards Regulations, 2011. The zones in place in Ireland in 2017 are Zone A: the Dublin conurbation, Zone B: the Cork conurbation, Zone C: comprising 23 large towns in Ireland with a population of more than 15,000, and Zone D: the remaining area of Ireland.</p><p>Ireland currently has a nationwide network of 31 monitoring stations which measure levels of air pollutants in the four zones.  This information is delivered to the public in near real-time at<i>www.airquality.epa.ie.</i>The numbers and locations of the monitoring equipment for each pollutant are determined by the requirements of the Directives for ambient air monitoring in each zone.</p><p>The Agency's most recent annual Air Quality Report was published in November 2017 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2016.  Values for all network sites were below the EU annual limit value, but exceeded the stricter World Health Organisation guideline values for a number of pollutants at individual sites.  The report indicates that most pollutant concentrations are low, with no discernible trend or slight downward trends.  It cautions, however, that NO2 concentrations in urban areas are close to the EU annual limit value, and increases in traffic numbers or certain weather conditions may lead to exceedances.  The report can be found at the following link: </p><p>Notwithstanding the favourable comparison with EU annual limit values, the report notes that maintaining our standard of air quality is a growing challenge.  With this in mind, I am committed to bringing forward Ireland's first ever National Clean Air Strategy.  The Strategy, which I intend to publish in the coming months, will provide the policy framework necessary to identify and promote integrated measures across Government that are required to reduce air pollution and promote cleaner air, while delivering on wider national objectives.</p><p>A key part of the Strategy will be the expansion of our monitoring and data gathering capacity, to better inform policy choices.  Following a review by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of air quality monitoring and information provision in Ireland, a decision was taken to develop a new Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP) which aims to enhance and build on current arrangements.  The new national Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme is being developed under Section 65 of the EPA Act, 1992 as amended. One of the key objectives of the programme is to enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public.  The statutory basis for the programme underlines the importance placed on air quality monitoring in Ireland.  The AAMP will double the number of ambient air quality monitoring stations in Ireland by 2022, and enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public.  Further details on the timeframes for the expansion of the network will be released as they become available.

There are five Coast Guard Units based in Wexford, in Courtown (with a sub-station in Arklow), Curracloe, Rosslare (with a sub-station in Carnsore), Kilmore Quay and Fethard-on-Sea.  The units are single purpose shoreline search units, that do not have cliff or boat functions.</p>  <p>  The Coast Guard has undertaken a station upgrade programme over the last twenty years, upgrading or undertaking new builds on an ongoing basis.  The development of Coast Guard Stations is undertaken by the Office of Public Works on behalf of my Department. Upgraded stations, as a standard, typically contain a kitchenette, toilet, showering and changing facilities as well as classroom, operations room and garage space.  Selection of the sequence of upgrading depends on a number of factors including an existing station's suitability for modernisation and enlargement or the available of suitable state-owned land for a new build. </p>  <p>  In the Wexford area this has resulted in the building of a modern purpose built stationhouse on Rosslare strand, which has been operational for several years. In recent years Curracloe has undergone remedial works, completed in early 2015.  Plans are presently being drawn up for a new Coast Guard station at Kilmore Quay and the Office of Public Works is currently in communication with Wexford County Council regarding this development.  The Coast Guard is also currently investigating options for a new Coast Guard station in Courtown.  A Heritage Impact Assessment has been undertaken regarding the Fethard-on&ndash;Sea station house and the Coast Guard is currently awaiting this report.  A limited extension to the Fethard-on-Sea station is also currently under consideration. </p></reply>

The NTA has been working with Irish Rail on a revised proposal.  In the meantime and enabled by significant investment to upgrade signalling and turn-back facilities in the critical city centre area, work was undertaken to upgrade and re-open the Phoenix Park Tunnel in late 2016.  This was identified by the NTA as an opportunity in the short term, at modest cost, to bring commuters from the west and south west to the city centre and beyond, and to enable enhanced integration of public transport services for the passenger.</p>  <p>  Following the Mid-Term Review of Capital priorities, Budget 2018 increased the multi-annual capital investment funding envelopes for the coming four-year period, including providing an enhanced capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion for Ireland's public transport investment between 2018 and 2021.  This enhanced capital envelope includes funding in the order of &euro;230 million for mainline rail and DART capacity enhancement and will allow acceleration of the initial stages of the overall DART Expansion Programme, focussing particularly at this stage on providing additional fleet to enhance capacity, and extending the electrified DART system.  Specifically, it will allow substantial progress on electrification of the Northern rail line as far as Balbriggan - now expected to be delivered in 2022 - and commencing work on the Maynooth line.  Planning for longer term investment will form part of the National Development Plan which is the Government's overall 10-year investment plan which we will be launching later this week alongside the new National Planning Framework for the period to 2040.</p></reply>

Under this scheme, employers may agree with their employees to operate a cycle to work scheme under a salary sacrifice arrangement. Participation in the scheme is voluntary but, where offered by an employer, it must be made available to all employees and directors.  The scheme applies to new bicycles and pedelecs (electrically assisted bicycles which require some effort from the cyclist) and also includes the purchase of certain new safety equipment.</p></reply>

As part of Ireland's effort to contain emissions and mitigate climate change, I am dedicated both to increasing the capacity of our public transport system and to facilitating the uptake of low-emission vehicles and technologies within the public transport sector.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to furthering the progressive development of electric fuelled public transport, particularly along high demand routes in the GDA where capacity requirements make such investment cost-effective.  Rail already plays an important role in meeting increased passenger demand while also providing an energy-efficient mode of transport.  The rail sector accounts for only 1.1% of transport emissions.  Electrified rail use, in particular, is capable of achieving low emissions through utilising renewable sources of energy.  Rail operators are also already playing an active role in emission reductions on existing services, introducing a range of technical measures including automatic engine shutdown, configuring train length to match passenger demand and installing traction control software.</p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made on increasing capacity on the electrified light and heavy rail networks through the Luas and DART networks.  In terms of future investment plans, the Metro system is due to commence construction in 2021 with passenger services starting in 2027 while funding of the DART Expansion Programme will allow substantial progress on electrification of the Northern rail line as far as Balbriggan - now expected to be delivered in 2022 - and commencing work on the Maynooth line.  The DART Expansion Programme also has a key role to play in delivering an efficient transport system that will deliver a very substantial increase in peak-hour capacity on all lines from Drogheda, Maynooth, Greystones and Hazelhatch on the Kildare line while also contributing to the overall aim of combating climate change.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-14a.746.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018021400096#WRCC01000"><p>Self-employed workers who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year, are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.  This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory) and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit and treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from 1st December 2017.</p><p>This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the Class A rate of 4%.  In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings. These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.</p><p>The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published on 18 October 2017.  The Review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.</p><p>The Review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure.  In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers became eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the Actuarial Review.</p><p>As part of the Review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.</p><p>The Review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  </p><p>It should be noted that the projected expenditure on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit assume the same incidence rate as prevail in the employed (PRSI Class A) population.  The following table gives a breakdown of the costs of the individual benefits:</p><p><b>Projected costs of extending Invalidity Pension, Illness Benefit, Jobseekers Benefit, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit (&euro;m)</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Invalidity</th><th>Illness</th><th>Jobseeker&rsquo;s</th><th>Carer&rsquo;s</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>30</td><td>40</td><td>45</td><td>2</td><td>118</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>59</td><td>54</td><td>58</td><td>3</td><td>173</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>87</td><td>72</td><td>60</td><td>4</td><td>223</td></tr><tr><td>2021</td><td>125</td><td>88</td><td>63</td><td>5</td><td>281</td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>152</td><td>94</td><td>67</td><td>5</td><td>317</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>176</td><td>99</td><td>71</td><td>5</td><td>351</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>198</td><td>104</td><td>75</td><td>6</td><td>382</td></tr><tr><td>2025</td><td>218</td><td>108</td><td>81</td><td>6</td><td>413</td></tr></table>The Review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the Class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.</p><p>This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension (contributory).  </p><p>The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.  </p><p>The findings of the Review will play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the Social Insurance Fund in the years ahead including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.</p></reply>

Unlike the current Homemakers scheme, this credit will apply to periods both before and after 1994.  This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for such pensioners to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines a final pension outcome, and it also acknowledges, for the first time, the contribution made by home-carers in the period before 1994.</p>  <p>  The TCA model proposed for post-2020 pensioners has yet to be decided upon, as the Government proposal will not be finalised until after a public consultation later this year. There are a number of factors, not just the number of years required for a full pension, which influence outcomes, and I will consider very carefully the priorities identified by stakeholders in that consultation process.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the policy regarding Home-Caring credits has also not been finalised.  However, it is my intention that it will be possible for Home-Caring credits to be allocated in the same year as paid contributions, where appropriate.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Code, which is signed by all staff,  provides for non-discrimination under the nine specified grounds as stated in the Equality Act 2004, which includes gender. In addition, my Department is committed to the Dignity at Work Policy for the Civil Service which aims to promote respect, dignity, safety, and equality in the workplace. </p>  <p>  Since it came into operation, no issues relating to the Gender Recognition Act 2015 have been brought to the Department's attention by staff, managers or any representative bodies or trade unions. In the event of an issue being brought to my Department's attention it will be treated in accordance with the Act.</p></reply>

The recording of buildings in the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH), which is maintained by my Department, forms the basis of recommendations to local authorities for inclusion of structures on their RPS.</p>  <p>  The building mentioned by the Deputy is rated in the NIAH as being of Regional significance. It was recommended for inclusion in the RPS, and has been added to the RPS by the planning authority.  As such, the building is a protected structure within the meaning of the Planning and Development Acts.</p>  <p>  Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures. They are legally required to make sure that the structure does not become endangered through neglect, decay, damage or harm.</p>  <p>  Inclusion on the RPS also gives planning authorities a number of powers to deal with such structures and safeguard their future. If a protected structure is endangered, the planning authority can serve a notice on the owner or occupier, requiring them to carry out any work that it considers necessary to protect it.</p>  <p>  Financial support is provided by my Department through a number of schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings. These schemes are administered via the local authorities and include the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and the Structures at Risk Fund. Details of the schemes are available on all local authority websites and on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p></reply>
