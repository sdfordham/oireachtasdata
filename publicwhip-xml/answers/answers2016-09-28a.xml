In this regard, I welcome the recent assignment by the Commissioner of a Superintendent to head up the Garda Reserve Management Office.  I understand that that Office is currently undertaking an audit of the experience and skills of Reserves which, when completed, will assist Garda management in considering the future role to be played by the Reserve.  It has also started work on the development of a recruitment plan with the objective of recruiting and training 300 new Reserves annually, starting next year, to bring the strength of the Reserve up from its current strength of 789 members to 2,000.  As part of the planning process, I understand that the Office is examining the possibility of recruitment at the regional or divisional level, rather than centrally, and also the manner in which the training is delivered. </p><p>The expansion of the Reserve will complement the commitments in the Programme for Government to continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000 and also to increase further civilianisation to free up Garda&iacute; to front-line policing duties.  The delivery of these measures over the lifetime of the Government will ensure a visible policing presence in communities nationwide.  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 150 will attest later this year.</p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September which includes a special stream for eligible reserve members.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner.  Applications must be made through <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i><i>. </i>The existing recruitment campaign which was launched last November is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year.

It is an important feature of the close relationship between Ireland and the UK with long-established benefits for trade and tourism between our two countries. Both Governments have publicly declared their commitment to ensuring no return to a so-called 'hard border' on the island of Ireland.  There are excellent relations at official and political level in relation to enhancing the operation of the Common Travel Area and we are committed to that continuing.  Retaining the Common Travel Area will be a key issue for Ireland in the context of negotiating new terms and conditions for the EU&rsquo;s relationship with the UK.  We will prioritise this matter in the context of a new relationship between the EU and the UK, and in bilateral discussions with the British Government.</p><p>The eventual departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union does mean that the only land border between the European Union and the United Kingdom will be on the island of Ireland.  But just as is the case right now, the Irish border will be geographically isolated from the rest of the European Union and in particular it will be outside the Schengen area so the integrity of the border controls of the Schengen area will not be affected in any way by the UK's exit.  There is therefore a strong case to be made for the continuity of current arrangements in relation to the border, in particular an absence of border controls or other restrictions on the free movement of people.</p><p>On the police and security co-operation<b></b>front it is important to emphasise that we do not envisage any diminution in security and police co-operation between Ireland and the UK. </p><p>Let me assure the House that substantial work has been undertaken across Government to identify the key strategic, policy and operational risks. This will continue to be prioritised in my Department and across all Government Departments and agencies. Our primary objective remains to protect and advance this country's best interests.</p><p>As I stated earlier, I cannot pretend to the House that 'Brexit' will not pose complex challenges but we are committed to doing all we can to reduce any potential adverse effects for all the people on the island, including of course those who reside in the border counties.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-09-28a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016092800068#WRB00700"><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including Community Garda&iacute; and Garda Reserves, among the various Garda Divisions and Districts, and I as Minister have no direct role in the matter. Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that, as of the 31 August 2016, there were 61 Community Garda&iacute; and 53 Reserves assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Division.</p><p>In relation to Community Garda&iacute;, it is, of course, the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises. In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p><p>The implementation of these initiatives will be supported by the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country. This will be achieved though continuing the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000, as well as doubling the Garda Reserve and increasing the number of civilian staff so as to free-up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing. Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 members will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide. Community policing, and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream.</p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner. Applications must be made through <i>www.publicjobs.ie. </i>The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year.  It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017.</p><p>In relation to the Garda Reserve and our commitment to doubling its numbers,  I have had discussions with the Commissioner in relation to the delivery of this commitment and what steps might be taken to ensure that the expanded Reserve is used to best effect in support of visible policing.  In this regard, I welcome the recent assignment by the Commissioner of a Superintendent to head up the Garda Reserve Management Office.

There is therefore a strong case to be made for the continuity of current arrangements in relation to the border, in particular an absence of border controls or other restrictions on the free movement of people.</p><p>On the police and security co-operation<b></b>front it isimportant to emphasise that we do not envisage any diminution in security and police co-operation between Ireland and the UK. </p><p>Let me assure the House that substantial work has been undertaken across Government to identify the key strategic, policy and operational risks. This will continue to be prioritised in my Department and across all Government Departments and agencies. Our primary objective remains to protect and advance this country's best interests.</p><p>As I stated earlier, I cannot pretend to the House that 'Brexit' will not pose complex challenges but we are committed to doing all we can to reduce any potential adverse effects for all the people on the island, including of course those who reside in the border counties.</p></reply>

The commitments entered into particularly focus on the most vulnerable.  They include commitments to:</p><p>- Protect the human rights of all refugees and migrants, regardless of status. This includes the rights of women and girls and promoting their full, equal and meaningful participation in finding solutions to refugee situations.</p><p>- Ensure that all refugee and migrant children are receiving education within a few months of arrival in their country of resettlement.</p><p>- Prevent and respond to sexual and gender-based violence.</p><p>- Work towards ending the practice of detaining children for the purposes of determining their migration status.</p><p>- Improve the delivery of humanitarian and development assistance to those countries most affected, including through innovative multilateral financial solutions, with the goal of closing all funding gaps.</p><p>- Implement a comprehensive refugee response, based on a new framework that sets out the responsibility of Member States, civil society partners and the UN system, whenever there is a large movement of refugees or a protracted refugee situation.</p><p>- Find new homes for all refugees identified by UNHCR as needing resettlement; and expand the opportunities for refugees to relocate to other countries through, for example, labour mobility or education schemes.</p><p>The New York Declaration also contains concrete plans to build on these commitments including:</p><p>- Starting negotiations leading to an international conference and the adoption of a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration in 2018. The agreement to move toward this comprehensive framework is a significant one because it means that migration, like other areas of international relations, will be guided by a set of common principles and approaches.</p><p>- Develop guidelines on the treatment of migrants in vulnerable situations. These guidelines will be particularly important for the increasing number of unaccompanied children on the move which I know is an area of particular interest to the Deputy.</p><p>- Achieve a more equitable sharing of the burden and responsibility for hosting and supporting the world&rsquo;s refugees by adopting a global compact on refugees in 2018. </p><p>Clearly, the world faces highly significant challenges in trying to deal with refugees and migrants, especially given the large population displacements caused by war and climate change.  There are no easy solutions.  I indicated at the Summit that the scale of the challenges requires global responses.  I am pleased, in this regard, that countries are engaging together under the auspices of the UN on identifying global responses to these challenges and I indicated Ireland's commitment to supporting this process. </p></reply>

The Deputy's question focusses on the refugee resettlement element of that Programme, as opposed to the relocation element so I will directly address this component in my response. </p>  <p>On 13 May 2015, the European Commission, published an EU Agenda for Migration. Among the measures proposed was the establishment of an EU-wide resettlement scheme to offer 20,000 resettlement places across the EU with each Member State's allocations calculated according to a distribution key. Ireland's allocation under this mechanism was 272 persons displaced by the Syrian conflict to be resettled in Ireland over a two year period up to mid 2017.</p>  <p>  Taking account of the situation in the Middle East, and the plight of the refugees, the T&aacute;naiste announced that Ireland would go further and would accept 520 persons for resettlement over an 18 month period - up to the end of 2016. This was far in excess, almost double the figure proposed by the Commission.  As of today, 486 persons displaced by the Syrian conflict have arrived in Ireland. I have since announced that a further 260 refugees will be taken in by Ireland in 2017 bringing the total number of refugees to 780.  Hence, at least 780 of the 4,000 that Ireland has agreed to accept under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme will come purely from the refugee cohort. The possibility of an additional refugee pledge in 2017 is under active consideration. Other mechanisms to fill the gap are also under review and will be contingent on further developments at EU level. </p>  <p>  I also wish to inform the Deputy that the refugee pledges focus on the most vulnerable families and I am satisfied with the progress being made in regard to the refugee resettlement portion of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.</p></reply>

A person possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life is liable to a minimum of 10 years imprisonment and up to a maximum of life imprisonment and a fine at the discretion of the Court.  The Court has some discretion in applying these minimum sentences in the case of a first offence, depending on the circumstances concerned, but not in the case of a second or subsequent offence.  This, and other mandatory minimum sentences for firearms offences, were introduced on foot of concerns regarding the impact these type of offences had on society and individual communities.</p>  <p>  On foot of the introduction of these penalties in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 much progress has made in tackling gun crime in Ireland.  The number of offences relating to the possession and discharge of a firearm fell by 52% from 745 in 2005 to 356 in 2015; while incidents of assault, burglary, robbery and murder involving a firearm are down 28% from 455 to 329.  Given the severe sentences in place with the potential for a maximum of life imprisonment, I am not sure there is scope for any further strengthening of sentences.  However, I will be more than happy to consider any specific suggestions which the Deputy may have.  </p>  <p>  Gun crime is and must be tackled aggressively by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by means of a range of targeted and intelligence based operations, disrupting and preventing incidents before harm is caused, as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved. Against this background and in the context of recent organised crime activity, a number of targeted additional measures have been put in place in support of the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. These include the recent changes to the Proceeds of Crime Acts, the allocation of an additional &euro;55 million to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year, and the establishment of a Special Crime Task Force.  A dedicated Armed Support Unit for the Dublin Metropolitan Region is also being established. </p></reply>

Reserve members have undergone training in many of the skills required to be an effective full-time member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is important that we build on the very real contribution that they are making to the policing of communities right across the country.</p><p>I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner in relation to the delivery of this commitment and what steps might be taken to ensure that the expanded Reserve is used to best effect in support of visible policing. In this regard, I welcome the recent assignment by the Commissioner of a Superintendent to head up the Garda Reserve Management Office. I understand that that Office is currently undertaking an audit of the experience and skills of Reserves which, when completed, will assist Garda management in considering the future role to be played by the Reserve.  It has also started work on the development of a recruitment plan with the objective of recruiting and training 300 new Reserves annually, starting next year, to bring the strength of the Reserve up from its current strength of 789 members to 2,000. As part of the planning process, I understand that the Office is examining the possibility of recruitment at the regional or divisional level, rather than centrally, and also the manner in which the training is delivered. </p><p>The expansion of the Reserve will complement the commitments in the Programme for Government to continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000 and also to increase further civilianisation to free up Garda&iacute; to front-line policing duties. The delivery of these measures over the lifetime of the Government will ensure a visible policing presence in communities nationwide. Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 150 will attest later this year.</p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September which includes a special stream for eligible reserve members. The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner. Applications must be made through <i>www.publicjobs.ie </i>.  The existing recruitment campaign which was launched last November is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year. It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017.</p><p>Specifically in relation to the Waterford Garda Division I am informed by the Commissioner that, as of the 31 August 2016, there  were 26 Reserves assigned to that Division. It is, of course the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, and I as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I have been informed that as of the 31 August  2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 780 Community Garda&iacute; assigned to Garda Divisions throughout the country. Of these 6 were assigned to the Clare Division.It is, of course, the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises. In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute;  from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p><p>The implementation of these initiatives will be supported by the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country. This will be achieved though continuing the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000, as well as doubling the Garda Reserve and increasing the number of civilian staff so as to free-up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing. Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 members will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide. Community policing, and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream. </p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September.

My announcement last week at the National Ploughing Championships of a doubling of the funding for the Community Alert Programme to &euro;350,000 which will go directly to local groups is a tangible expression of this commitment to supporting a partnership approach to crime prevention between local communities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

These specialist units also work closely with the Criminal Assets Bureau in targeting persons involved in such criminality.</p>  <p>  All of these units operate under the umbrella of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Special Crimes Operations Unit and are continuing to achieve commendable successes in targeting criminal groups as well as the ongoing drugs and firearms seized.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the very significant measures which have been introduced in response to the appalling gangland feuding activity which has manifested itself both here and abroad.  These measures include the provision of significant additional resources to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, strengthened legislative measures targeting the proceeds of crime, the establishment of a dedicated Garda Armed Support Unit in Dublin and the establishment of a new Garda Special Crime Task Force. </p>  <p>  We are already seeing significant results being achieved on foot of these measures including those of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Operation Hybrid.  As at 4 September, this Operation has resulted in 40 arrests and 5 charges brought in connection with the recent shootings, a number of firearms being seized and over 8,000 lines of enquiry conducted.  Furthermore, in excess of 11,500 high visibility checkpoints involving armed support have been implemented and a significant amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic, and forensic evidence is also being examined as part of ongoing investigations. </p>  <p>  As I have already publicly stated, most recently on the occasion of the very effective joint policing operation involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their Spanish colleagues, the Garda authorities and the Government are absolutely determined that Irish criminals will not escape justice by fleeing this jurisdiction or by seeking to conduct their criminal activities from abroad.  Recent operational activities clearly demonstrate the close liaison An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has in place with other law enforcement agencies internationally.</p></reply>

It is an important feature of the close relationship between Ireland and the UK with long-established benefits for trade and tourism between our two countries.  Both Governments have publicly declared their commitment to ensuring no return to a so-called 'hard border' on the island of Ireland.  There are excellent relations at official and political level in relation to enhancing the operation of the Common Travel Area and we are committed to that continuing.  Retaining the Common Travel Area will be a key issue for Ireland in the context of negotiating new terms and conditions for the EU&rsquo;s relationship with the UK.  We will prioritise this matter in the context of a new relationship between the EU and the UK, and in bilateral discussions with the British Government. </p><p>The eventual departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union does mean that the only land border between the European Union and the United Kingdom will be on the island of Ireland.  But just as is the case right now, the Irish border will be geographically isolated from the rest of the European Union and in particular it will be outside the Schengen area so the integrity of the border controls of the Schengen area will not be affected in any way by the UK's exit.  There is therefore a strong case to be made for the continuity of current arrangements in relation to the border, in particular an absence of border controls or other restrictions on the free movement of people.</p><p>On the police and security co-operation<b></b>front it is  important to emphasise that we do not envisage any diminution in security and police co-operation between Ireland and the UK. </p><p>Let me assure the House that substantial work has been undertaken across Government to identify the key strategic, policy and operational risks. This will continue to be prioritised in my Department and across all Government Departments and agencies.  Our primary objective remains to protect and advance this country's best interests.</p><p>As I stated earlier, I cannot pretend to the House that 'Brexit' will not pose complex challenges but we are committed to doing all we can to reduce any potential adverse effects for all the people on the island, including of course those who reside in the border counties.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources</p><p>I have been informed that as of the 31 August  2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 780 Community Garda&iacute; assigned to Garda Divisions throughout the country.  Of these 58 were assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West Division.It is, of course, the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises. In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute;  from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p><p>The implementation of these initiatives will be supported by the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country. This will be achieved though continuing the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000, as well as doubling the Garda Reserve and increasing the number of civilian staff so as to free-up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing.  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 members will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.

Under the programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 migrants into the State by the end of 2017, through a combination of the EU relocation mechanism established in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece (opted into by Ireland voluntarily) and the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focused on resettling refugees from camps in Jordan and Lebanon.  </p>  <p>  This is made up of approximately 2,622 persons to be relocated to Ireland from other EU Member States (Italy and Greece) under the two EU relocation decisions and 520 programme refugees which Ireland pledged to resettle under the voluntary EU resettlement programme. Persons admitted here under these programmes will also have an entitlement to family reunification, if they wish to do so, thereby further increasing the numbers accepted by Ireland.</p>  <p>  Under the Resettlement programme, 520 programme refugees are to resettled in Ireland under the UNHCR-led programme by December 2016.  To date, some 486 refugees have been admitted from Lebanon.  Sufficient candidates were selected during a selection mission to Lebanon earlier this year to fill the rest of the quota of 520 refugees.  These have been security screened and health screened and are scheduled to arrive in groups between now and the end of October.  As we will have fulfilled our commitments under the EU Resettlement programme ahead of target, the Government recently announced that we are extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 260 refugees from Lebanon in 2017. </p>  <p>  As regards the EU relocation programme, it is well documented that the pace of arrivals under this programme to date has been slower than expected.  This has been a subject of concern for me.  The Government is wholly committed to ensuring that Ireland meets its obligations under the programme in a timely fashion.  I am pleased to report, therefore, that following a highly productive visit by Irish officials to Greece earlier this year, the frequency and numbers of arrivals has increased and is continuing to improve.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has to date taken in 69 Syrian people, mostly families.  It is estimated that by the end of 2016 Ireland will have accepted over 360 people under relocation.  A further 40 people have been assessed and cleared for arrival and arrangements for their travel to the State are currently being made and IRPP officials interviewed a group of 63 people in Athens who, once cleared for travel, are expected to arrive in October.  The intention thereafter is to sustain the pace and size of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meet its commitments within the timeframes envisaged under the EU Relocation Decisions.     </p>  <p>  As regards relocations from Italy, some technical issues have arisen with regard to the programme in Italy.  More recently, I spoke directly with relevant EU Ministerial colleagues, and a Departmental official travelled to Italy in order to address the delays.  Following this work a solution to the technical issues preventing relocations from Italy is in train. </p></reply>

I am informed by the Commissioner that, as of the 31 August 2016, the strength of the Garda Reserve stood at 789 of which 23 were assigned to the Meath Garda Division.</p><p>The members of the Reserve have undergone training in many of the skills required to be an effective full-time member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and make a real and tangible contribution to the policing of communities right across the country.

Phase 1 (identification of key themes for the new Strategy) and Phase 2 (identification and agreement of high level objectives under each agreed theme) of that consultation process have been completed.  The final phase, Phase 3 (identification of detailed actions to achieve each agreed objective, with associated time-scales, key performance indicators, institutional responsibilities and monitoring arrangements), is currently underway.  This process will provide a new set of specific, cross-Departmental actions that need to be taken to bring about a real improvement in quality of life for Travellers and Roma.  It is intended that the new Inclusion Strategy will run from 2016 to 2020 and that it will be in place later this year.  As part of Phase 3, regional public consultations took place from 22 September 2016 - 27 September 2016; I attended two of those consultations (in Dublin and in Athlone, respectively) and I am delighted to report that overall attendance and participation were encouraging and positive.  Feedback from those consultation sessions will be collated by my officials and the draft Inclusion Strategy will be updated accordingly.  I plan to submit the final draft of the Inclusion Strategy to Government shortly for consideration and sign-off.</p>  <p>  As set out in my earlier response, the issue of recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group is being considered in the context of the development of the Inclusion Strategy.  I have had a long standing interest in this area, most notably through my chairing of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality when it produced its report on the Recognition of Traveller Ethnicity (April 2014). When I spoke earlier this year at the Traveller Pride awards, I stressed that we need to broaden the discussion on this issue.  The debate needs to be taken forward in an inclusive way, explaining what is involved to mainstream Irish society and bringing the settled community along with Travellers on the issue.  My officials are continuing to work with the national Traveller organisations on this matter and I intend this to be a priority for me over the coming months.</p></reply>

As of yesterday, 486 of these 520 have been admitted to the State.   Sufficient cases were selected during a selection mission to Lebanon earlier this year to fill the rest of the quota of 520.  These cases have been security screened and health screened and is scheduled to arrive in groups between now and the end of October.  In addition to this 520, the Government recently announced that it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 260 refugees from Lebanon in 2017. </p>  <p>  Ireland has to date taken in 69 Syrian asylum seekers, mostly families under the relocation programme.  A further 40 Syrian asylum seekers have been assessed and cleared for arrival and arrangements for their travel to the State are currently being made.  IRPP officials interviewed a group of 63 people in Athens who, once cleared for travel, are expected to arrive in October.  It is estimated that by the end of 2016, Ireland will have accepted over 360 people under relocation.</p>  <p>  However, as indicated in previous responses to parliamentary questions, the pace of the relocation programme in Ireland and across the European Union had been hampered by significant operational delays and technical issues due to the sheer numbers involved and other logistical difficulties that have arisen at the 'hotspot' locations in Italy and Greece.</p>  <p>  As regards the EU relocation mechanism, it is well documented that the pace of arrivals under this programme to date has been slower than expected.  The Government is wholly committed to ensuring that Ireland meets its obligations under the EU Relocation mechanism in a timely fashion.</p>  <p>  A team of officials from my Department, including the Director of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, travelled to Greece in June to meet with Irish embassy officials and relevant Greek authorities both to signal Ireland's tangible willingness to assist and to identify ways of addressing the obstacles that have arisen.  The outcome of that visit has been very positive and the Greek authorities have now confirmed that, within the coming months, they will be able to increase significantly the overall numbers available to Ireland.   The frequency and numbers of arrivals have increased and will continue to improve over the coming months. </p>  <p>  As regards relocations from Italy, some technical issues have arisen with regard to the programme in Italy.  I recently spoke directly with relevant EU Ministerial colleagues, and a Departmental official travelled to Italy in order to address the delays.  Following this work a solution to the technical issues preventing relocations from Italy is in train.</p>  <p>  The intention thereafter is to accelerate the pace and size of intakes throughout 2017 to achieve the levels required to allow Ireland to meet its commitments within the time frames envisaged under the EU Relocation Decisions.</p>  <p>  Both the T&aacute;naiste and I continue to work proactively with our colleagues in Europe to ensure that Ireland and the European Union responds comprehensively to all aspects of the ongoing migration and refugee crisis.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Garda Authorities that at present 80 percent of vetting applications are processed by the Garda Central Vetting Bureau in under five days.  I do not consider that this is an unreasonable timeframe.  This represents a dramatic improvement in turnaround times for the processing of vetting applications in recent years, falling from an average of 14 weeks in mid-2013.</p>  <p>  This improvement is the result of an unprecedented investment by the Government and the Garda Authorities in this area of Garda activity, including an increase of over 80 per cent in staffing levels - the number of staff assigned at present stands at 173 - and the roll out earlier this year of the e-Vetting system. The Garda National Vetting Bureau is located in Thurles, Co. Tipperary.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched an e-Vetting system in tandem with the commencement by me in April this year of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016.  E-Vetting facilitates the processing of applications in an on-line format and this has significantly streamlined the vetting process and contributed to a sustained reduction in processing times for vetting applications.  I am informed that, currently, 85 per cent of organisations registered for vetting are operating the e-Vetting system and the Garda Authorities are working to encourage all other organisations to do so.  For those vetting applications that continue to be submitted in paper format, the average turnaround time is in the order of four weeks.</p>  <p>  One very important feature of the e-Vetting system is that the individual applicant can track the progress of their own vetting application on line and can, therefore, see when their application has been processed and returned to the relevant registered organisation.</p>  <p>  In some individual cases processing times for applications can be longer when, for example, additional enquiries may be necessary, which may involve seeking information from abroad, or where errors have been made in the application.  Delays can also occur in other aspects of the application process which are outside of the control of the Garda Authorities, for example, in the submission or return of applications by the registered organisations.</p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the Garda employment vetting service is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account the importance of protecting children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, the current processing period is not unreasonable.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I have been informed that as of the 31 August  2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 780 Community Garda&iacute; assigned to Garda Divisions throughout the country. Of these 8 were assigned to the Wexford Division.  It is, of course, the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises. In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute;  from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p><p>The implementation of these initiatives will be supported by the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country. This will be achieved though continuing the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000, as well as doubling the Garda Reserve and increasing the number of civilian staff so as to free-up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing. Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 members will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide. Community policing, and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream. </p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September.

My announcement last week at the National Ploughing Championships of a doubling of the funding for the Community Alert Programme to &euro;350,000 which will go directly to local groups is a tangible expression of this commitment to supporting a partnership approach to crime prevention between local communities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

These include provisions under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 which provides a range of offences which may occur in a domestic violence context including assault, assault causing harm, assault causing serious harm and coercion.  The Act also provides for the offence of harassment.  As part of the proceedings for such an offence the court may issue a restraining order requiring that the person shall not communicate by any means with the victim or shall not approach within a specific distance of the victim&rsquo;s home or place of work.  It is also an offence to breach such a restraining order.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 introduced important amendments to the Domestic Violence Act 1996 and 2002 to extend the powers of the Court to provide protections in certain cases of domestic violence. </p>  <p>  In the case of dating relationships, many incidences of abuse in dating relationships are also offences under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997. Defining dating relationships in statute is problematic.  Given the complexities, these relationships were not included in the General Scheme of the Domestic Violence Bill published last year. However, the issue of including dating relationships in domestic violence legislation is currently being considered further by my Department.</p>  <p>  A proposal in relation to emergency barring orders was included in the general scheme of the Domestic Violence Bill, approved by Government and following legal advice an appropriate provision will appear in the Bill which I intend to publish this session. This legislation will enhance the legislative measures available to support and protect victims. Key improvements include extending access to emergency barring orders, providing for the possibility of giving evidence by televisual link, and enabling the court to appoint an expert to ascertain the views of a child where an order sought relates to the child.</p>  <p>  With regard to online intimidation and stalking, the Law Reform Commission published its report on 'Harmful Communications and Digital Safety' just yesterday and the recommendations contained therein will now be considered by the relevant Ministers of the Government.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.

It has also started work on the development of a recruitment plan with the objective of recruiting and training 300 new Reserves annually starting next year.

In addition, the National Community Policing Office captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, published on 9 June 2016, places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, including the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every Garda District.</p>  <p>  As part of the Community Policing approach Garda&iacute; engage with a wide range of local groups, including informal community groups as well participating in more formal structures such as Joint Policing Committees.  In addition Garda&iacute; support in excess of 3,700 Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert groups established countrywide.  Guidelines for the establishment and operation of such partnership initiatives, including Text Alert groups have been published by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The Garda Text Alert Scheme is a particularly successful example of Community Policing in action with over 960 local groups in operation, involving in excess of 164,000 subscribers and with an estimated 3 million text messages sent annually.  I am informed that every Garda Division, rural and urban, now offers the Text Alert service.</p>  <p>  I was very pleased to secure more than a doubling of the funding available to my Department for initiatives such as Community Alert this year, and I was particularly pleased to announce recently the provision of &euro;100,000 in 2016 for a rebate of costs incurred by local Text Alert Groups.  This rebate scheme is available to all Text Alert Groups registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is being administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re who already support the national and regional operation of the Community Alert programme.  I believe it is only right that we recognise the considerable efforts involved in organising local groups and make a contribution to the costs which have, up to now, been borne entirely from voluntary contributions.</p>  <p>  The ongoing development of Community Policing and partnerships between communities and their local Garda&iacute; is underpinned by the Government&rsquo;s commitment to increase Garda numbers to 15,000 through further recruitment into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This process will involve the recruitment of some 3,200 new Garda members on a phased basis over the next four years, to ensure that the service is renewed and has the capacity to provide visible, responsive and effective policing to every community throughout the country.  </p></reply>

Of these 11 were assigned to the Meath Division.  It is, of course, the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p><p>The implementation of these initiatives will be supported by the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country.  This will be achieved though continuing the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000, as well as doubling the Garda Reserve and increasing the number of civilian staff so as to free-up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing.  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 members will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.

My announcement last week at the National Ploughing Championships of a doubling of the funding for the Community Alert Programme to &euro;350,000 which will go directly to local groups is a tangible expression of this commitment to supporting a partnership approach to crime prevention between local communities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

Persons admitted here under these programmes will also have an entitlement to family reunification, if they wish to do so, thereby further increasing the numbers accepted by Ireland.     </p>  <p>  My Department is fully engaged with our commitments under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and all available resources are being directed to ensuring that we can meet these commitments within the time scales envisaged.  The programme includes family reunification and I have no plans at present to introduce an additional humanitarian programme such as that referenced by the Deputy.  </p>  <p>  I continue to work proactively with my colleagues in Europe to ensure that Ireland and the European Union responds comprehensively to all aspects of the ongoing migration and refugee crisis.</p></reply>

While there are currently no Garda&iacute; specifically assigned to the role of Community Garda attached to the Kildare Division, the Commissioner has advised that it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute;  from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  The implementation of these initiatives will be supported by the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country.  This will be achieved through continuing the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000, as well as doubling the Garda Reserve and increasing the number of civilian staff so as to free-up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing.  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 members will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Community policing, and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream. </p>  <p>  In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner.  Applications must be made through www.publicjobs.ie.

The Roadmap to Ratification, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, sets out the substantial legislative agenda required for ratification.  </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  Phased commencement of the Act will begin before the end of the year, which will allow us to ratify the Convention.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 was passed by the Seanad on 26 January this year.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.   </p>  <p>  Work is also underway on drawing up an Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification.  It is intended that the Bill will address issues such as the Convention's requirements in relation to reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty, as well as removing archaic references in existing legislation relating to mental health. The General Scheme of the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is available on the Department's website.  Enactment is expected by the end of the year.</p></reply>

Domestic violence is a social evil and the protection of members of society from domestic violence remains a priority for me and my Department.  Drafting of the Domestic Violence Bill is at an advanced stage.  It is my intention that the Bill will be submitted for Government approval and published during the current D&aacute;il session.  The Bill will improve access to barring orders and provide for greater supports for victims in the court process in areas such as court accompaniment.  The enactment of the Domestic Violence Bill is one of the actions required in order to enable Ireland to ratify the Istanbul Convention.  The Istanbul Convention is a significant legal instrument in the fight against domestic and sexual violence.  The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to implementing in full the Convention.  Work is underway across a range of Government agencies to implement the legislative and administrative actions required for ratification of the Istanbul Convention.  Those actions are contained in the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence which was published in January.  Monitoring of the implementation of the strategy, which involves representatives from key state organisations and the community and voluntary sector, has commenced and formal reporting on the implementation of the strategy will take place every six months.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note I recently announced the awarding of contracts for a national awareness campaign as part of the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender based Violence 2016-2021.  Funding of &euro;950,000 for 2016 has been secured for this campaign.  In addition, funding of &euro;200,000 has been awarded under the Dormant Accounts Fund to localise the campaign in 2016 and 2017.  The campaign will commence in the last quarter of 2016 and it is intended that it will run for a period of 6 years up to 2021,  subject to the continued availability of the necessary funding.  The overall aim of the campaign is to increase the awareness of domestic and sexual violence, to bring about a change in long established societal behaviours and attitudes and to activate bystanders with the aim of decreasing and preventing this violence.  It will recognise that women and men are victims of such crimes.</p></reply>

Those Regulations were revoked by the 2014 Act and an entirely new system was put in place.</p>  <p>  The 2014 Act was part of the then Government's comprehensive approach to enhancing the protections available to whistleblowers, including members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Under the Act, GSOC is now the prescribed body authorised to receive protected disclosures on Garda matters. Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the very significant fact that a member of the Garda&iacute; who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all the protections provided for whistleblowers in the Act.  These protections include protection from having their identity revealed, protection from dismissal and protection from being penalised in their employment as a result of having made a protected disclosure.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the comments made by the Chairperson of GSOC at the Justice and Equality Committee on 21 September, 2016.  I am of course pleased that the Committee has had the opportunity to hear from the Chairperson and her views on how matters might be improved. Judge Mary Ellen Ring has been in place for a year now and she has made a significant contribution to ensuring confidence in its oversight role. </p>  <p>  There are undoubtedly matters which can be examined with a view to improvement.  I am aware of the Chairperson's general views on the legislation which governs the manner in which GSOC operates and my Department will be studying in detail the remarks she made to the Committee.  In that regard, it is the case that the relevant legislation is under review in the Department in the light of its operation and views which have been expressed by GSOC to the Department in recent discussions.  Following that review I will consider specific proposals for change in this area. </p>  <p>  I should mention that GSOC's budget for 2016 is &euro;9.546 million, which represents an increase of some &euro;500,000 on the 2015 amount.  Resources and funding will be kept under continuing review to ensure that GSOC is enabled to continue to operate effectively and efficiently and in accordance with its statutory remit and there will be ongoing consultation between the Department and GSOC on this matter.</p></reply>

Management in accordance with the policy includes an input from all of the relevant services in relation to the prisoner&rsquo;s conditions of detention.  This involves case conference discussion on a regular basis, with participation from a multi-disciplinary team including operational, therapeutic and healthcare services.  </p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that the prisoner referred to is one of a small number of  violently disruptive prisoners currently being managed within the terms of the Violently Disruptive Prisoners Policy.  Any decisions that are taken in relation to the regime in place for the prisoner are taken in full consultation with the relevant services and are cognisant of the advice received from them.  In this case, the prisoner can spend all prison unlock periods out of cell, to include access to the exercise yard, gym, shower facilities, phone calls, visits, healthcare services and association with a small number of prisoners, assessed as suitable by the Governor. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that when dealing with prisoners who pose a particular challenge to the good order of a prison and a safe environment for staff and prisoners, a balance is required between the rehabilitation of individual prisoners and  the requirement to provide safe, secure and humane conditions while in custody.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service is in the process of setting up a specific unit to better manage the risks and needs of such prisoners.  This unit is being developed based on international best practice and will allow for the management of particularly high risk prisoners within a small and highly supervised unit, where their management is informed from both an operational and psychological perspective.  This unit will allow for specialist assessment of individual risks to be carried out, followed by individual and/or group work to try to reduce the risk of harm to others, thus enabling a return to normal or a more appropriate location as risk reduces.</p></reply>

Reserve members have undergone training in many of the skills required to be an effective full-time member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is important that we build on the very real contribution that they are making to the policing of communities right across the country. </p><p>I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner in relation to the delivery of this commitment and what steps might be taken to ensure that the  expanded Reserve is used to best effect in support of visible policing. In this regard, I welcome the recent assignment by the Commissioner of a Superintendent to head up the Garda Reserve Management Office. I understand that the Office is currently undertaking an audit of the experience and skills of Reserves which, when completed, will assist Garda management in considering the future role to be played by the Reserve.  It has also started work on the development of a recruitment plan with the objective of recruiting and training 300 new Reserves annually, starting next year, to bring the strength of the Reserve up from its current strength of 789 members to 2,000.  As part of the planning process, I understand that the Office is examining the possibility of recruitment at the regional or divisional level, rather than centrally, and also the manner in which the training is delivered.</p><p>The expansion of the Reserve will complement the commitments in the Programme for Government to continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000 and also to increase further civilianisation to free up Garda&iacute; to front-line policing duties.  The delivery of these measures over the lifetime of the Government will ensure a visible policing presence in communities nationwide.  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 150 will attest later this year.</p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September which includes a special stream for eligible reserve members.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner.  Applications must be made through<i>www.publicjobs.ie.</i>The existing recruitment campaign which was launched last November is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year.

I do not consider that this is an unreasonable timeframe.  This represents a dramatic improvement in turnaround times for the processing of vetting applications in recent years, falling from an average of 14 weeks in mid-2013.  This improvement has come about as a result of an unprecedented investment by the Government and the Garda Authorities in this area of Garda activity, including an increase of over 80% in staffing levels and the roll out earlier this year of the e-Vetting system.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched an e-Vetting system in tandem with the commencement by me in April this year of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016.  E-Vetting facilitates the processing of applications in an on-line format and this has significantly streamlined the vetting process and contributed to a sustained reduction in processing times for vetting applications.  I am informed that, currently, 85% of organisations registered for vetting are operating the e-Vetting system and the Garda Authorities are working to encourage all other organisations to do so.  For those vetting applications that continue to be submitted in paper format, the average turnaround time is in the order of four weeks.</p>  <p>  One very important feature of the e-Vetting system is that the individual applicant can track the progress of their own vetting application on line and can, therefore, see when their application has been processed and returned to the relevant registered organisation.</p>  <p>  In some individual cases processing times for applications can be longer when, for example, additional enquiries may be necessary, which may involve seeking information from abroad, or where errors have been made in the application.  Delays can also occur in other aspects of the application process which are outside of the control of the Garda Authorities, for example, in the submission or return of applications by the registered organisations.</p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the Garda employment vetting service is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account the importance of protecting children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, the current processing period is not unreasonable.</p></reply>

Under the programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons overall under the EU Relocation and Resettlement programmes.  This is made up of approximately 2,622 persons to be relocated to Ireland from other EU Member States (Italy and Greece) under the two EU relocation decisions and 520 programme refugees which Ireland pledged to resettle under the voluntary EU resettlement programme.  Persons admitted here under these programmes will also have an entitlement to family reunification, if they wish to do so,  thereby further increasing the numbers accepted by Ireland.</p>  <p>  Under the Resettlement programme, the 520 programme refugees are to be resettled in Ireland under the UNHCR-led programme by December 2017.  To date, some 486 of these 520 have been admitted from Lebanon.  Sufficient cases  were selected during a selection mission to Lebanon earlier this year to fill the rest of the quota of 520.  These cases have been security screened and  health screened and are scheduled to arrive between now and the end of October.  As we will have fulfilled our commitments under the EU Resettlement programme ahead of target, the Government and I recently announced that we are extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 260 refugees from Lebanon in 2017.  </p>  <p>As regards the EU relocation programme, it is well documented that the pace of arrivals under this programme to date has been slower than expected.  The Government is wholly committed to ensuring that Ireland meets its obligations under the programme in a timely fashion.  I am pleased to report, therefore, that following a highly productive visit by Irish officials to Greece earlier this year, the frequency and numbers of arrivals has increased and is continuing to improve.  Ireland has to date taken in 69 Syrian people, mostly families.  It is estimated that by the end of 2016 Ireland will have accepted up to 360 people under relocation.  The intention thereafter is to sustain the pace and size of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meet its commitments within the timeframes envisaged under the EU Relocation Decisions.  As regards relocations from Italy, some technical issues have arisen with regard to the programme in Italy.  More recently, I spoke directly with relevant EU Ministerial colleagues, and a Departmental official travelled to Italy in order to address the delays.  Following this work a solution to the technical issues preventing relocations from Italy is in train.</p>  <p>  In announcing the IRPP, the Government recognised the importance of prioritising family groups and in addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  A significant number of those who have arrived to date are children with one or two parents.  With regard to unaccompanied minors Ireland has formally indicated to Greece its desire to accept unaccompanied minors under the relocation mechanism and we now have a commitment from the Greek authorities that Ireland will be receiving the first group of unaccompanied minors later this year.  Tusla - the Child and Family Agency with responsibility for the care of unaccompanied minors in the State - will travel to Greece to assess the needs of those minors and plan for their care and accommodation upon arrival.  It is not possible at this juncture to determine the overall number of unaccompanied minors that will be accepted during the lifetime of the programme as it will depend on the number of cases referred by Greece and the level of resources that each individual case will require upon arrival.  Ireland will continue to prioritise its commitment to offer protection to this vulnerable group.</p>  <p>  As part of our humanitarian response to the crisis you will be aware that our naval vessels have also been performing vital search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean Sea. Irish naval vessels have rescued more than 12,000 people at risk of drowning since the operation commenced in May of last year.</p>  <p>Equally important is the support we provide to countries hosting large numbers of refugees and migrants.  Ireland has committed to providing multi-annual funding to the World Food Programme; some &euro;60 million over the next three years, which is specifically targeted at refugees and in particular Syrian refugees.  We are also contributing &euro;22.9 million to the Refugee Facility Fund to support Syrian refugees in Turkey.  In addition, Irish Aid, the Government's development cooperation programme has been supporting efforts to assist the Syrian people, which by the end of 2015 saw a total of &euro;42 million in support provided with an additional &euro;20 million pledged for 2016.</p>  <p>  I continue to work proactively with my colleagues in Europe to ensure that Ireland and the European Union responds comprehensively to all aspects of the ongoing migration and refugee crisis.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that as of the 31 August  2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 780 Community Garda&iacute; assigned to Garda Divisions throughout the country. Of these 16 were assigned to the Wicklow Division.  It is, of course, the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute;  from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The implementation of these initiatives will be supported by the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country.  This will be achieved though continuing the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000, as well as doubling the Garda Reserve and increasing the number of civilian staff so as to free-up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing.  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 members will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.

My announcement last week at the National Ploughing Championships of a doubling of the funding for the Community Alert Programme to &euro;350,000 which will go directly to local groups is a tangible expression of this commitment to supporting a partnership approach to crime prevention between local communities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  I am informed by the Commissioner that, as of the 31 August 2016, the strength of the Garda Reserve stood at 789 of which 25 were assigned to the Wexford Garda Division.</p><p>The members of the Reserve have undergone training in many of the skills required to be an effective full-time member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and make a real and tangible contribution to the policing of communities right across the country.  This is recognised in the  &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; which includes a commitment to double the Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures.  I have had discussions with the Commissioner in relation to the delivery of this commitment and what steps might be taken to ensure that the  expanded Reserve is used to best effect in support of visible policing.  In this regard, I welcome the recent assignment by the Commissioner of a Superintendent to head up the Garda Reserve Management Office.  I understand that the  Office is currently undertaking an audit of the experience and skills of Reserves which, when completed, will assist Garda management in considering the future role to be played by the Reserve.  It has also started work on the development of a recruitment plan with the objective of recruiting and training 300 new Reserves annually starting next year. I understand that as part of the planning process the Office is examining the possibility of recruitment at the regional or divisional level, rather than centrally, and also the manner in which the training is delivered.</p><p>The expansion of the Reserve will complement the commitments in the Programme for Government to continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000 and also to increase further civilianisation to free up Garda&iacute; to front-line policing duties.  The delivery of these measures over the lifetime of the Government will ensure a visible policing presence in communities nationwide.  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.

Another 150 will attest later this year.</p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September which includes a special stream for eligible reserve members.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner.  Applications must be made through <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i>.  The existing recruitment campaign which was launched last November is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year.

Under the Act, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) is now the prescribed body authorised to receive protected disclosures on Garda matters.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer if they so choose, or they may make a disclosure directly to GSOC.  Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the very significant fact that a member of the Garda&iacute; who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all the protections provided for whistleblowers in the Act.  These protections include protection from having their identity revealed, protection from dismissal and protection from being penalised in their employment as a result of having made a protected disclosure.</p>  <p>  In light of the public interest in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having robust policies and procedures in place to support and protect whistleblowers and to ensure that their complaints/allegations are fully investigated, I signalled during the D&aacute;il debate on the O'Higgins Report that I would refer certain matters to the independent Policing Authority. To that end, I wrote to the Authority on 2 June 2016 requesting that in accordance with section 62O(6) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended) they submit a report on the policies and procedures in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with whistleblowers/whistleblowing.  I also asked that they make any recommendations that they consider appropriate in order to ensure that the policies and procedures in place are appropriate and can provide assurance that whistleblowers can make complaints/allegations in a safe environment where their complaints/allegations are properly investigated.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is also no doubt aware of the measures that the Garda Commissioner outlined at her meeting on 13 June, 2016 with the Policing Authority. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published their Protected Disclosures Policy and all Garda Members and civilians have been informed of this policy. In addition the Garda Commissioner has appointed a Protected Disclosures Manager who will be supported with a dedicated and properly trained team. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been working with Transparency International Ireland and other external providers to create an environment to ensure that whistleblowers are protected and supported.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner is committed to providing a positive and supportive working environment for all Garda personnel.  An  Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Dignity at Work Policy, entitled &ldquo;Working Together to Create a Positive Working Environment, outlines the policy and procedures for dealing with Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Bullying in the Workplace.

On foot of this we have developed a considered and robust strategy to confront the criminals involved in organised burglary gangs who have targeted communities around the country, including County Meath.  With the implementation of this strategy I am glad  to say that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has made huge progress, leading to a reduction of one third in burglaries nationwide following the launch of Operation Thor last year. The figures for the first three months of the year show a decrease for burglary offences in Meath. In fact, in the first three months of 2016 there were 40% less burglaries than in the first three months of 2015.</p><p>Operation Thor has involved concentrated Garda activity with more than 30,000 crime prevention patrols and in the order of 38,500 targeted checkpoints nationwide. There have also been in the region of 2,500 arrests and 2,900 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. Further resources have also been put in place to support Garda operations in 2016, including provision for ongoing implementation of Operation Thor.  An additional &euro;50 million is to be provided, doubling the overtime available for intensive and targeted policing and crime prevention activities.  So there will be no let-up on the pressure which the Gardai are bringing to bear on the organised gangs engaged in burglary in all areas of the country.  </p><p>I have also made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary. I am very pleased that this new legislation is now available to support the work which is being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor.</p><p>Underpinning all of these measures is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to increase Garda numbers to 15,000 by way of recruitment into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This process will involve the recruitment of some 3,200 new Garda members on a phased basis over the next four years, to ensure that the service is renewed and has the capacity to provide visible, responsive and effective policing to local communities. This will undoubtedly benefit policing and public safety in County Meath and throughout the country.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Kildare Division, on the 31 August 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 314.  There are also 26 Garda Reserves and 26 civilians attached to the Kildare Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Divisional Units such as the Traffic Unit, Burglary Response Unit and the Scenes of Crime Unit and also from the Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Drugs and Organised Crime Unit.  The needs of each Division are fully considered within the context of the overall policing needs of the State.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom 25 of these have been assigned to Kildare.  Another 150 will attest later this year and will be assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide. </p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Garda Commissioner.  Applications must be made through <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i>before the closing date for applications on 29 September 2016.  The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year. It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017.  Kildare Division, like all Garda Divisions, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream. </p></reply>

There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail because, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.</p>  <p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that the accused person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses or evidence.   Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  A &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; is an offence listed in the Schedule to the Bail Act that is punishable by at least five years imprisonment.  </p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice 1984 as amended by section 22 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 provides that any sentence of imprisonment for an offence committed while on bail shall be consecutive but if imposed in the District Court the aggregate term of imprisonment shall not exceed two years.</p>  <p>  As part of the Government's response to crime, one of the major objectives is to focus on the key area of strengthening the law to get tougher on serious and repeat offenders.  In that context the new Bail Bill, which is being drafted on a priority basis in accordance with the Programme for a Partnership Government, will specifically provide that the courts must have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant for bail.</p></reply>

An accused person is entitled to be informed by the court in which he or she is appearing of his or her possible right to legal aid.  The grant of legal aid entitles the applicant to the services of a solicitor and, in certain circumstances, up to two counsel, in the preparation and conduct of his or her defence or appeal.  The courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation themselves.  Furthermore, the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the "gravity of the charge" or "exceptional circumstances", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  There is no lawful basis for taking into account an applicant's previous convictions in determining whether or not a person qualifies for criminal legal aid.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that my Department is currently preparing new legislation to update the law relating to the granting of criminal legal aid and to give effect to commitments contained in the Programme for Government.  These commitments include the transfer of the operation of the system of criminal legal aid to the Legal Aid Board, introducing powers to secure contributions from defendants, more rigorous means testing and stronger sanctions against abuses.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; </p>  <p>  -  be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; </p>  <p>  -  be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  -  be without one or both legs; </p>  <p>  -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; </p>  <p>  -  have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p>  <p>  The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Scheme. The Senior Medical Officer makes an independent clinical determination, and as Minister I cannot intervene in such decisions.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual. The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations. The Medical Board of Appeal's clinical determination is limited to the scope of the six qualifying criteria, and the Board does not have discretion in relation to the application of these criteria. The criteria to qualify for the Scheme are necessarily precise and specific.</p></reply>

The Working Group's report is available on the Budget 2016 website. While the Report acknowledges a VAT burden on charities, I decided at the time not to introduce a VAT refund scheme for charities as the sector already benefits from a range of Ministerial Refund Orders and favourable tax treatment across a number of tax heads. Details of the existing Ministerial Refund Orders that provide some VAT relief to charities can be found at the following link: </p><p><i></i></p><p>Requests for new Ministerial Refund Orders have been consistently refused since the 1980s primarily to maintain the integrity of the VAT system. In addition, from an Exchequer perspective, putting in place an unlimited refund scheme would be a risk due to an unpredictable levels of refund claims and the limited fiscal space available. Introducing a VAT refund scheme for charities would also most likely lead to similar claims from other VAT exempt organisations, most notably sporting organisations.</p><p>However, the Programme for Partnership Government recognises the difficulties faced by community groups and charities in relation to VAT rates on certain products and commits to raising the issue at EU level. The European Commission's Action Plan on VAT was adopted on 7<sup>th</sup>April 2016 and contains a proposal to look at VAT rate policy across the EU in 2017. The Action Plan's proposal on rates will provide an opportunity to discuss VAT rates and may offer Member States more flexibility in the future in determining VAT rates applicable to goods and services. However, the Deputy will be aware that any proposed changes to the current EU VAT Directive would require unanimous agreement from all Member States.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-09-28a.320.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016092800078#WRM01500"><p>Where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of income tax as a separate and unconnected individual. Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.</p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.  </p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.</p>  <p>  From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting. It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  </p>  <p>  There would also be legal issues with regard to 'connected persons'. To counter tax avoidance, 'connected persons' are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits. However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.</p>  <p>  The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Mr. Leo Varadkar TD. However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples. This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</p></reply>

Where an individual's income exceeds the exemption limit, he or she is liable to tax based on the normal system of rate bands and tax credits, but he or she may still benefit from marginal relief. This is explained in further detail in leaflet IT8, available on the Revenue website via the following link: </p><p><i>. </i></p><p>The purpose of the exemption limit is to identify a certain income limit below which a taxpayer aged 65 or over is not required to pay income tax or to submit claims to Revenue for income tax reliefs. This exemption limit does not equate to the amount of income which would be sheltered by the tax credits available to the individual or couple as both the exemption limit and the tax credits available can vary depending on the personal circumstances of the individual.  For example: </p><p>-  There are separate single and married exemption limits, and increases are also available for individuals with dependent children including incapacitated adult children. </p><p>-  While all taxpayers have a personal tax credit, a PAYE or an Earned Income credit is available only in respect of qualifying income and is limited for use against that type of income.  Additional tax credits are also available, such as those for widows/widowers, for blind individuals, for those caring for incapacitated children or dependant relatives, and for health expenses incurred by the taxpayer.  </p><p>In my view the current income exemption limits are the most appropriate use of limited resources, especially given the constraints on finances available for changes to the tax system in the forthcoming Budget. However, I would point out that in the Programme for Partnership Government there is a commitment to ask the Oireachtas to continue to phase out the Universal Social Charge (USC) as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan that keeps the tax base broad, reduces excessive tax rates for middle income earners, and limits the benefit for high earners. Reductions will be introduced on a fair basis with an emphasis on low and middle income earners, including those aged 65 years or over. </p></reply>

For children of preschool age this will be in an early intervention class setting. In the event that such a setting is not available, my Department will make funding available to fund Home Tuition provision for the child as a compensatory measure until such time as a placement is available.</p><p>Where such a school placement is sought but not available, it is also open to parents to enrol their child in an ECCE funded setting.

Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. </p>  <p>  The 2016 budget provided an improved staffing allocation from September 2016 to second level schools for the purpose of enhancing guidance provision.  It brings the basis of allocation from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for the 2016/17 school year. This improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation is a restoration of 50% of the teaching resources that were removed when the allocation of guidance posts was brought within quota. </p>  <p>  The delivery of the 50% restoration through a change in the staffing schedule allows each school to determine how best to allocate the additional resources to meet the guidance needs of the school. The circular issued earlier this year by my Department outlining the allocation of teaching resources clearly stated that this additional resource is to complement existing resources in order to best meet the guidance needs of the school in line with the school's guidance plan.</p>  <p>  Up until September 2012, an ex-quota allocation was provided for guidance in addition to the standard teacher allocation to post primary schools. This resource was allocated in accordance with pupil enrolment. 42% of second-level schools at the time were allocated at least 22 hours per week in respect of guidance (22 hours being the equivalent of one teaching post) while the remainder of the schools were allocated between 8 and 17 hours of guidance per week.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that in previous changes to guidance counselling allocations in 2012, as a consequence of the Budget adjustment which had to be made at the time, all 195 DEIS schools were effectively sheltered from these changes as a result of the more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This was a 0.75 point improvement compared to the current PTR of 19:1 that applies in non-fee-paying second-level schools.</p>  <p>  That was a very important protection for the cohort of our schools in DEIS most in need of support. DEIS schools have also benefited from the 0.3 improvement to the staffing schedule which now gives them an enhanced allocation on the basis of 17.95:1 in respect of the current school year.</p></reply>

The Act provides for a number of key child protection measures such as a requirement on organisations providing services to children to keep children safe and to produce a Child Safeguarding Statement, a requirement on defined categories of persons (mandated persons which includes all registered teachers) to report child protection concerns over a defined threshold to the Child and Family Agency and a requirement on mandated persons to assist the Agency in the assessment of a child protection risk, if  requested to do so by the Agency. </p><p>Work is currently underway in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in relation to publishing an updated Children First to reflect the Act&rsquo;s requirements.  The commencement of the 2015 Act and the publication of a new Children First will necessitate changes to the existing procedures for schools.  In preparation for the forthcoming changes, my Department has recently commenced a review of the existing procedures for schools in consultation with the relevant education partners. </p><p>The Professional Development Service for Teachers through its Health and Wellbeing Team will develop a continuing professional development framework to support the implementation of Children First in schools.

The role of the Council is to promote and regulate the teaching profession, including establishing and promoting professional standards and supporting teachers&rsquo; learning. </p><p>The Teaching Council&rsquo;s criteria for initial teacher education (ITE) programmes set out, for professional accreditation purposes, learning outcomes that graduates of the programmes are expected to meet, including that they will &ldquo;practise within the statutory framework pertaining to education, including child protection guidelines&rdquo; and &ldquo;demonstrate knowledge and understanding of children&rsquo;s rights, including their right to a voice in various matters that relate to their lives&rdquo;. The Council has also adopted School Placement Guidelines as an addendum to its ITE criteria. The Guidelines set out, inter alia, the Council&rsquo;s expectations of student teachers on placement, including that they will be familiar with the school&rsquo;s child protection policy, and other relevant policies. </p><p>ITE programmes are accredited by the Council and are the subject of regular review by independent panels established by the Council so as to ensure that standards continue to be met. </p><p>With regard to induction, the Council adopted Droichead as the enhanced induction framework for newly qualified teachers in March of this year. Droichead is, primarily, a school-based model of induction, whereby a new teacher&rsquo;s learning is supported by experienced colleagues. This allows for national policies, such as Children First, to be mediated within the particular context of the school.</p><p>In addition, the National Induction Programme for Teachers (NIPT), a support service for teachers, provides a Child Protection workshop for both primary and post primary newly qualified teachers (NQTs). This workshop is available in Education Centres to all NQTs completing probation/induction and is also available on the NIPT website (www.teacherinduction.ie).</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that the Teaching Council this year adopted Cos&aacute;n, the national framework for teachers&rsquo; learning, following the induction phase. Through this framework, the Council has sought to capture the breadth of teachers&rsquo; lifelong learning by reference to six high-level learning areas. Two of those, inclusion, and well-being, are particularly pertinent in the context of the Children First Guidelines.</p></reply>

A central element of this framework is the Children First &ndash; National Guidance published originally by that Department in 1999 and updated in 2011.  The Children First Guidance operates as the over-arching national guidelines for all individuals and agencies that come into contact with children.</p>  <p>  The role of my Department is to provide guidance and support to schools in implementing Children First. In that regard, in autumn 2011, my Department published updated Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools based on the revised Children First.  The procedures apply to all recognised schools.</p>  <p>  The purpose of these procedures is to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in the implementation of Children First when dealing with allegations/suspicions of child abuse and neglect.  In relation to implementation of Children First, the 2011 procedures for schools incorporated significant improvements to the previous school guidelines, including strengthening the local oversight arrangements, all of which are intended to better ensure consistent and uniform implementation of Children First across all schools.  The improvements include a new template child protection policy, a requirement that all primary schools fully implement the Stay Safe programme and improved oversight arrangements at Board of Management level.</p>  <p>  The Whole School Evaluation (WSE) inspection process by my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate also incorporates an assessment of a school&rsquo;s compliance with my Department&rsquo;s requirements under the child protection procedures. </p>  <p>  At national level, my Department participates in a Children First inter-Departmental Committee, chaired by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the role of which is to oversee the implementation of Children First across all Government Departments. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Children First Act 2015 will, when fully commenced by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, put elements of the Children First- National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children (2011) on a statutory footing.  The Act provides for a number of key child protection measures such as a requirement on organisations providing services to children to keep children safe and to produce a Child Safeguarding Statement; a requirement on defined categories of persons (mandated persons) to report child protection concerns over a defined threshold to the Child and Family Agency and a requirement on mandated persons to assist the Agency in the assessment of a child protection risk, if requested to do so by the Agency.  Under the Act, the Children First Interdepartmental Implementation Group has also been put on a statutory footing.</p>  <p>  Work is currently underway in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in relation to publishing an updated Children First to reflect the Act&rsquo;s requirements.  The commencement of the 2015 Act and the publication of a new Children First will necessitate changes to the existing procedures for schools.  In preparation for the forthcoming changes, my Department has recently commenced a review of the existing procedures for schools in consultation with the relevant education partners.</p></reply>

These secondments are subject to annual review.  The arrangements provide flexibility and ensure that the in-service needs of teachers and other support priorities of the school system can be met within the resources available. </p>  <p>  Having teachers with relevant and recent teaching experience and expertise is a key requirement for the role.  It is a condition therefore that the maximum length of time that a teacher may be on secondment is five years, following which they return to their teaching roles within their schools.  Returning to the teaching role is always planned and is seen as one of the strengths of the policy and in this way, their expertise and knowledge is not lost to the system.  These teacher secondment arrangements were disseminated extensively so the necessary planning could take place at all levels including education centres, support services, school boards of management and individual teacher.</p>  <p>  It is Department policy to extend a secondment in certain limited situations, for example, where a seconded teacher is engaged in a leadership role, has a specialism or expertise where retention is necessary for continuity, quality planning and management.   The implementation of this policy is a matter for the services concerned and the relevant section of my Department.</p></reply>

Recruitment to apprenticeship is therefore driven by employers rather than by SOLAS or by education and training providers.  The 2014 Review of Apprenticeship in Ireland acknowledged that the number of women employed in craft apprenticeships is low as this has been traditionally a male dominated sector.  As an incentive to employers, a bursary is available to encourage women to take up apprenticeships.  The bursary provides a total grant of &euro;2,667 to each employer for each female apprentice recruited.  The grant is intended as a contribution towards wage and other apprentice costs over the first 28 weeks of phases 1 and 3.  Despite the availability of the bursary the number of female apprentices remains low.</p>  <p>  Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers. 25 proposals have been prioritised by the Council for development.  The Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship was launched earlier this month with further new apprenticeships to be launched later this year and early next year. </p>  <p>  Many of these new apprenticeships are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace and thus will lead to a natural increase in female participation when these new apprenticeships are launched in the coming months.  </p>  <p>  Accompanying the renewal and expansion of apprenticeship in Ireland will be a new branding and marketing campaign. SOLAS will examine how this campaign can assist with promoting apprenticeship to women and to their potential employers.</p></reply>

The objective of the Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.</p>  <p>  Good agricultural practice involves the land spreading of organic fertilisers as early as practicable in the growing season in order to maximise the uptake of nutrients by crops and to minimise pollution risks to water courses and groundwaters.  In accordance with the requirements of the Nitrates Directive, the Regulations include provisions regarding periods when the land application of certain types of fertilisers is prohibited.  In addition, the Regulations prohibit such application at any time of the year when the ground is frozen, waterlogged or heavy rain is forecast.</p>  <p>  Specified closed periods for the spreading of fertilisers, including slurry, are a key aspect of the Nitrates Regulations.  They are a requirement of the Nitrates Directive and are mandatory in every Member State.  The closed periods in Ireland were decided following extensive consultation and were discussed with farming bodies and the European Commission when Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme was being introduced.  I have no plans at present to extend the spreading periods for organic fertilisers in 2016.  The Programme will be reviewed again in 2017.</p></reply>

Houses sold to first time buyers under the various affordable housing schemes were priced at a significant discount from their market value. Buyers were free to sell their properties at anytime. However, in order to prevent short-term profit-taking on the resale of the house to the detriment of the objectives of the schemes, the schemes contained a clawback provision.</p>  <p>  Under the clawback provisions, as set out in the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, as amended, where the purchaser proposes to sell the unit within 20 years of the date of purchase, he/she must refund to the local authority a percentage of the proceeds of the sale of the unit. The percentage of the proceeds to be repaid will be related to the proportion of discount from the market value originally received from the local authority. A full refund must be paid if the unit is sold within the first 10 years of occupancy. A reduction of 10% per annum is given for each full year of occupancy between 10 and 20 years and after 20 years of full occupancy no refund would be due to the local authority.</p>  <p>  However, where a person is selling an affordable home and the clawback amount payable would reduce the proceeds of resale below the initial price actually paid, the legislation provides for the amount of the clawback payable to be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid that result.</p>  <p>  There is no provision for exceptions from the clawback provision. I have no plans to amend these provisions.</p></reply>

Those families need and deserve answers, and it is critically important that a full and comprehensive investigation of their disappearance be carried out.</p>  <p>  Ireland, along with its EU partners, has urged the Mexican government to ensure that a comprehensive investigation into the events in Iguala in September 2014 takes place, and to continue to take steps to address human rights challenges in Mexico.  </p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the work of the Group of Independent Experts (GIEI) appointed by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) to investigate the disappearances.  I welcome the agreement reached earlier this month between the Mexican authorities and the GIEI on a mechanism to follow up on the recommendations made by the GIEI in its two reports of its investigations. </p>  <p>  My Department has provided over &euro;1.2 million in funding to the IACHR since 2005.  During the visit of Mr Emilio &Aacute;lvarez Icaza, the IACHR Executive Secretary, to Dublin in March of this year, my officials discussed with him the Iguala case and assured him of our support for the continued work of the GIEI. </p>  <p>  The broader issue of disappearances in Mexico continues to be of grave concern.  I am aware of the troubling statistics quoted by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  Ireland and other EU Member States engage with the Mexican authorities on human rights on an ongoing basis.  In particular the EU uses the High-Level Dialogue on Human Rights, the High-Level Political Dialogue and the Security and Justice Dialogue, to raise issues related to human rights, rule of law and security with the Mexican authorities.  These fora allow for open and frank discussions on human rights and related citizen security issues in Mexico and the EU. </p>  <p>  The sixth session of the High-Level Dialogue on Human Rights between the EU and Mexico was held in June 2016 in Brussels.  Both sides agreed on the importance of continued cooperation to effectively address challenges in the area of human rights, particularly on issues such as the rule of law and the fight against impunity, missing and disappeared persons, torture, discrimination, migration, and the protection of vulnerable groups, human rights defenders and journalists. </p>  <p>  EU member states are to the fore in funding projects led by national and international NGOs aimed at tackling impunity and improving the protection of human rights in Mexico.  For its part, Ireland has also provided support to civil society and missionary organisations for development projects to improve, amongst other things, the human rights situation in Mexico.</p></reply>

In recognition of this changing business environment, the Post Office Network Business Development Group, chaired by Mr. Bobby Kerr, was established in 2014 to examine the potential for new and existing Government services to be transacted through the post office network, and to identify new business opportunities for the network.  The final report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group, which was published in January of this year, made a number of recommendations to support the future sustainability of post offices.  These include recommendations in relation to the renewal of the post office network, the development of a basic payment account, the provision of motor tax services, and the creation of hubs around which local economic and social activity could revolve.  The report also recommended that An Post should, following appropriate consultation with postmasters and others, review and amend the five-year strategy for the post office network.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>commits to acting on the recommendations in the report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group.  A number of Working Groups have been established to progress the recommendations, including through the establishment of a Network Renewal Implementation Group, which is being independently chaired by Mr. Kerr.  This Group is examining the number and spatial distribution of post offices, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts, and training and qualifications for post office employees.</p><p>The Group is continuing to meet monthly, with the intention of finishing its deliberations soon and reporting back to the Board of An Post in the first instance.</p><p>I have separately established the Post Office Hub Working Group, to identify potential models under which the post offices could act as community hubs, especially in rural areas.  </p><p>I will be reporting back to the Cabinet Committee on Regional and Rural Affairs on a regular basis on the progress being made on these, and other recommendations in the report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group.</p></reply>

Under a Framework Agreement, signed in 2014, the HSE, my Department and the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) are currently engaged in a comprehensive review of the General Medical Services (GMS) and other publicly funded health sector contracts involving GPs.</p>  <p>  To date, agreements have been reached in relation to universal GP care without fees for all children under the age of 6 years, universal GP care without fees for all people aged 70 years and over, a specific Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult patients with Type 2 diabetes who hold a medical card or GP visit card, a new Rural Practice Support Framework and a revised list of special items of service that can be provided by GPs.</p>  <p>  I have recently met with GP representative bodies to discuss the future development of general practice and I have assured them of the Government's commitment to developing primary healthcare services for all our citizens and the key role of general practice in that context.  In order to ensure that primary healthcare will be enhanced for our citizens by a new contract for general practice services, I am currently considering a number of options around the next phase of this process, including the most appropriate arrangements for GP and other primary healthcare providers' engagement.  This will help to determine the time lines for the next formal engagement with GP representatives.</p></reply>

The rationale for this post is to provide more dedicated focus at the most senior level of the HSE on the twin challenges of improved operational performance in our health service on a day to day basis and the planning of a significant programme of change to equip the health service to better meet current and future health challenges. The sanction was conditional on agreement being reached on the terms and conditions attaching to the post. The Department is currently examining draft terms and conditions which will also require the approval of DPER.</p>  <p>  Wider changes in the senior management structures within the HSE are a matter in the first instance for the Director General.  I understand that an overall objective is to reduce the number of direct reports to the Director General to a more manageable number, without any overall increase in the senior manager complement.  Where it is proposed to recruit existing or revised senior roles the approval of my Department and DPER will be required and my Department is currently liaising with the HSE in relation to such proposals.</p></reply>

The review was undertaken by Dr Niall Herity, a highly respected, Belfast based NHS cardiologist.  During the course of the review Dr Herity met, and had interactions with, a wide range of people and relevant stakeholders as required by the agreed Terms of Reference. This included the South-South West Hospital Group, representatives from University Hospital Waterford and Cork University Hospital, HSE Acute Hospitals Division, the National Ambulance Service, the Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) Programme, the Chief Medical Officer and the Department of Health.  My own engagement was limited to providing the Terms of Reference, and a meeting with Dr Herity after receiving the report.</p>  <p>  In the course of these engagements, Dr Herity received a number of specific briefings and documents. I note that a request for documents in relation to this issue, submitted by the Deputy under the Freedom of Information Acts, is currently under consideration in my Department.        </p>  <p>  I would also like to advise the Deputy that the ACS programme was initiated to standardise the treatment of patients suffering from heart attack in its different forms. The Programme has developed a model of care which describes the treatment of ACS and the protocols for an Optimal Reperfusion Service, based on international guidelines and best practice. A national review of PPCI and PCI services is to be undertaken and completed by July 2017; recommendations will be made regarding the future configuration of these services, including the number and location of centres required to serve the population needs.</p></reply>

A revised Code of Practice on Alcohol Marketing, Communications and Sponsorship has been in place since July 2008.  Following a Departmental review of the Codes in 2010 it was agreed that the existing Codes would remain while the Department examined the possibility of the providing a legislative basis for the Codes.  The Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, 2012 recommended the development of a statutory framework with respect to the volume, content, and placement of all alcohol advertising in all media in Ireland.  Regulation of the advertising of alcohol products and sponsorship by alcohol companies is provided for in the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill remains a priority for this Government.  The Bill has been restored to the Seanad Order Paper and I expect that it will commence Committee Stage in October.</p>  <p>  The AMCMB is comprised of representatives my Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the advertising industry, and the drinks industry.  The current members are: Mr Peter Cassells (Chair), Ms Alessandra Fantini, Dr Sean Denyer, Mr Michael O'Keeffe, Mr Ciaran Cunningham and Mr Ross McMathuna.  The group meets on a quarterly basis and the last meeting was held on 23 August 2016.  The AMCMB has submitted nine annual reports to the Minister for Health.  The 7th Annual Report was the last annual report to be published on the Department of Health website.</p>  <p>  The AMCMB monitors compliance with the Codes through a review of quarterly reports submitted by the advertising industry, review of complaints received examined by the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland and commissioned research.  A number of companies have been commissioned by AMCMB to assess adherence to the Codes including Havas Media, BBN and Poster Audit Bureau.  Companies have been commissioned to produce reports to allow the AMCMB to, inter alia,  check compliance with the Code by televisions broadcasters, to survey sample films to assess compliance with the Code's provisions and to check compliance with outdoor media advertisers.  Approximately &euro;172,800 has been spent on commissioned research to date.</p></reply>

Nine Member States issued detailed opinions on the proposed legislation. The EU Commission and two other Member States also issued comments. The standstill period was extended until 28 July 2016. Two further Member States issued comments and one Member State issued detailed opinions after the expiry of the standstill period. The issues raised are being considered and a response is being prepared for the Commission. As the standstill period has now ended, the Bill can proceed through the Houses of the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  The Commission has advised that comments and detailed opinions issued under Directive 98/34/EC should not be released.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.</p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying  for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p>  <p>  The HSE has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to an emergency situation for persons with a serious medical condition in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and persons in palliative care, who are terminally ill.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are issued on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the medical card eligibility.  These cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant.  For terminally ill persons, no means test applies and the cards are not renewed.</p>  <p>  I can clarify for the Deputy that Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p></reply>

The BDGP builds on the large investment in data recording and genomics which have been made in recent years and will continue to drive further developments and improvements in this area.</p>  <p>  The BDGP has been agreed with the European Commission as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan (2014-2020) alongside a number of other schemes.  I am conscious of the positive effect that the programme will have on the Irish suckler herd.  It will help to improve productivity, profitability and carbon efficiency in the Irish suckler herd.  I firmly believe that the scheme will deliver long-term and cumulative positive effects for both suckler farmers participating in the scheme, and farmers who buy the progeny of suckler cows for further finishing.  It is a significant contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of sustainable beef.</p>  <p>  In relation to any possible reopening of the scheme, this will have to be considered in the context of an assessment of budgetary priorities, the operation of the Rural Development Programme and the potential impact both upon the scheme itself and other schemes.  However, it will not be possible to allocate additional resources to the scheme, having regard to the very large financial commitment already made to the BDGP in the Rural Development Programme, and the significant budgetary pressures across the agri food sector.</p></reply>

The outcome of these deliberations will ultimately determine Ireland&rsquo;s contribution, which needs to reflect a level of ambition that is technically feasible, cost-effective and fair, to the overall EU 2030 effort.</p><p>The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the <i>National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development</i>, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the <i>Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015</i>which was enacted in December 2015.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Act.</p><p>In accordance with Section 4 of the Act, and in line with responsibilities delegated to me as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I intend to submit a draft National Mitigation Plan for public consultation by the end of this year, followed by a final plan to be submitted to Government for approval by June 2017.  Work is well underway on the development of the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.  The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020, but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place for the period 2021-2030.</p><p>A key element of the development process for successive National Mitigation Plans will be the identification of the most cost-effective measures with the optimal mitigation potential, which safeguard Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and ideally support sustainable economic growth.  This will be done with due consideration of both current and future fiscal space.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie, shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>-  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered.</p><p>-  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process.  Premises within this area will get services of at least 30Mbps when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.</p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including Counties Cavan and Monaghan.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.  The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to broadband@dcenr.gov.ie.  57% of all premises in Cavan and 58% of all premises in Monaghan are within the Intervention (AMBER) area.</p><p>The areas to which the Deputy specifically refers are set out in the table below, which shows the percentage of premises that are expected to be covered by commercial investments, and the percentage that will be covered by the State Intervention.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Name</th><th>Townland</th><th>Premises currently expected to be covered by State intervention under NBP</th><th>Existing and Planned commercial High Speed Broadband</th></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Cavan</td><td>Arvagh</td><td>Drumalt</td><td>1%</td><td>99%</td></tr><tr><td>Canningstown</td><td>Tullylorcan</td><td>100%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cootehill</td><td>Killycramph</td><td></td><td>100%</td></tr></table></p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus for the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015.  This includes over 24,000 premises in Cavan and over 19,500 premises in Monaghan.  On 5 July, I announced that my Department has also identified that up to an additional 170,000 premises which are currently marked BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map are unlikely to get access to services.  My Department is conducting further analysis to identify these additional premises with a view to including them in the formal procurement process.  This work will conclude in the coming months and will be reflected in a further update to the High Speed Broadband Map.</p><p>The Department commenced the Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase of the procurement process in July and is engaged in the formal dialogue process with the three qualifying bidders.  Following the conclusion of the Dialogue Phase and an invitation to bidders to submit detailed draft proposals, the Department will issue final tender documentation to bidders.  When final tenders have been submitted a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.</p><p>The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of qualified bidders and the complexities that may be encountered during the procurement process.  It must be noted that bidders will need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at these stages of the process.</p><p>In preparation for the procurement stage of the process my Department investigated how different technical solutions could be used to deliver high speed broadband.  In line with EU State Aid rules, the process must be &quot;technology neutral&quot; and it is not therefore possible to specify what technology should be used to build the network.  As part of the procurement process bidders will be asked to propose solutions which meet the NBP service requirements.  It is recognised however, that a significant fibre build will be required, regardless of what technology is used to provide services to individual premises.  Once the successful bidder or bidders is chosen the technology(ies) to be deployed will become clear.</p><p>As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.</p><p>In line with commitments in the Programme for Government I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys in July 2016.  The Taskforce will recommend practical actions that can be taken in the short-term to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland, working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, ComReg, State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The work of the taskforce will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the rollout of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place.  I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the Taskforce's report.</p></reply>

However, these proposals were subsequently withdrawn by the Commission, to be replaced by new proposals (expected to be published shortly) which, rather than focussing on the amount of days travelled, will link the ability to enjoy RLAH to the residence or frequent and substantial presence in the Member State of the roaming provider. This will aim to prevent systematic, commercial abuses of RLAH, and to balance the ambition for RLAH with the need to ensure continuing investments in networks in individual Member States.  </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are now actively engaged in examining these upcoming proposals and will be engaging with industry on the matter. It is expected that the original EU target of June 2017 will be met. </p></reply>

I am not aware of any concerns raised by individual local authorities regarding the safety of such crossings.</p>  <p>  Controlled crossings, such as zebra crossings have an important role to play in urban areas.  While guidance on their use is set out in both the Traffic Management Guidelines (TMG) and the Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets (DMURS), the legal requirements for zebra crossings are set out in the Traffic Signs Manual. </p>  <p>  Zebra crossings are generally used on roads where a speed limit of 50 km/h or lower applies but they can also be considered in certain cases on roads where a speed limit of 60 km/h applies. When used appropriately as set out in the TMG and DMURS guidance documents they can function very effectively and contribute to road safety as well as being cost effective. </p>  <p>  My Department has no proposals at this time to commission an independent review of zebra crossings as they have a proven record in many countries and suitable advice on their use in Ireland is set out in the TMG and DMURS documents.</p></reply>

CETA represents a modern high standard agreement which has the ability to set a new global standard for Trade Agreements.  It will end limitations in access to public contracts, open up markets for services and offer predictable conditions for investors.</p>  <p>  CETA will save on duty costs as 99.6% of all industrial tariffs will be eliminated on entry into force.  Irish firms will also benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, thus saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic.  These are some of the benefits of the trade deal with Canada as well as providing new market opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms.</p>  <p>  The procurement chapter in CETA will eliminate the major asymmetry between the EU and Canada, given that the EU procurement market is already de facto open to Canadians, including at the sub-federal level, while in Canada the access for EU firms is very limited.  For the first time, Canadian provinces, territories and municipalities will open their procurement markets to a third country, going well beyond what Canada has offered in the GPA (the multilateral Government Procurement Agreement) or under NAFTA (the North America Free Trade Agreement).  Canada&rsquo;s provincial procurement market is estimated to be double the size of its federal equivalent. </p>  <p>  Canada will also create a single electronic procurement website that combines information on all tenders, which corresponds to existing intra-EU arrangements, and would greatly facilitate the effective access of firms, especially small and medium sized enterprises, to procurement opportunities in Canada.  Making the trading landscape easier and more predictable is particularly important to SME&rsquo;s to internationalise and grow exports, given that trade barriers tend to disproportionately burden smaller firms, who have fewer resources to overcome them than larger firms.</p>  <p>  I support provisional application of CETA as I am keen to see Irish firms enjoy the tariff free benefits and new opportunities as soon as possible included in the all-important chapters on public procurement, rules and tariffs.  The issue of growing market share in other markets is made even more important by the result of the UK referendum on its membership of the EU.  CETA and the EU&rsquo;s other trade agreements help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish firms.</p></reply>

The EU Commission is currently finalising the text on provisional application of CETA for submission to the Council for a decision.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Article 218(8) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the full entering into force of CETA will be subject, in the first instance, to a decision by the EU, through a Council decision with the consent of the Parliament, and secondly by the approval of all Member States through the relevant national ratification procedures.

This would ensure that children and families had access to care and education in these formative years. </p><p>The implementation of this recommendation means that 37,500 children will not be eligible to enrol at the commencement of the pre-school year, i.e. September, but will be eligible to enrol in the January and April entry points in 2017. They will re-enrol the following September.</p><p>Pre-school providers are currently entitled to request a booking deposit to hold a free pre-school place for a child. All deposits are fully refundable when the child&rsquo;s entitlement to free pre-school is confirmed. Eligibility for free pre-school in the January or April intake will not be dependent on the child having been enrolled in the service since the previous September. Pre-school providers may choose to prioritise children already enrolled in the service for the January or April intake (whether those children are benefitting from free provision, or paying if the child is not eligible for free pre-school). Each pre-school provider operates their own admission policies, and once these are within the terms of the ECCE programme, the Department cannot interfere with them. Families who find that their preferred pre-school service has no available places in January or April may have to avail of another service in the area.</p><p>Where parents have been refused a place or are unable to find one, they should contact their local County Childcare   Committee(CCC) for advice and assistance in locating a suitable place. The CCC can then bring any issues of concern to the attention of my Department. </p><p>My Department has conducted extensive research on capacity in the system for the extended ECCE and data to date suggests that sufficient capacity exists in the system to meet demand.</p></reply>

The rule enabled more parents to avail of some level of subsidisation at a time when the funding available for such schemes was limited. Currently, parents can choose which programme would be most advantageous to them in terms of cost.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the introduction of the Single Affordable Childcare Scheme will resolve this restriction. The proposed Single Affordable Childcare Scheme will not replace, or incorporate, ECCE. The ECCE programme will remain in place on a universal basis, i.e. available to all children who qualify on age grounds. However, it is intended that the new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme will 'wraparound' the ECCE programme so that the two schemes align seamlessly to support access to early childhood care and education. The two schemes will not be mutually exclusive, in that it will be possible for a child to be simultaneously supported via the ECCE programme and the proposed Single Affordable Scheme, once they meet the qualifying criteria for each.</p>  <p>  Government will shortly consider when it may be possible to introduce the new scheme. Introduction in September 2017 is the current objective of the DCYA.</p></reply>

Similar to many other voluntary organisations, members of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve undertake unpaid activities on a voluntary basis and are to be commended for their commitment. While members of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve are also afforded the opportunity to avail of paid training, there are no plans to restore gratuity payments to members of the Reserve Defence Force.</p>  <p>  The Steering Committee which undertook the Value For Money (VFM) Review of the Reserve Defence Force recognised the importance of retaining an effective Reserve capacity that can augment the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) in times of need. In order to ensure appropriate training within the existing resource envelope, the VFM Review recommended the withdrawal of gratuities from members of the Reserve and the reallocation of this money to paid training. This recommendation was accepted and implemented.  In the intervening years since publication of the VFM Review in 2012, the reallocation of funding to paid training has ensured that all members of the Reserve have been afforded the opportunity to participate in annual collective training and other specialised training and are financially supported whilst doing so.   </p>  <p>  The overall budget available in Subhead A5 in 2016 is set at &euro;2.150 million, of which &euro;2.068 million is allocated to paid training of Reserve members. This budget provides for 30,000 training man days. This allocation provides a minimum of 7 days annual paid training for all effective members of the Reserve. It also provides for 14 days paid training for all additional personnel recruited to the Reserve Defence Force in 2016 and for career and specialist courses for selected members of the Reserve. The allocation also includes provision for RDF participation in 2016 commemoration ceremonial parades and events. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied with the current financial provision for the Reserve in terms of man days allowance. This allowance ensures that there are sufficient paid training opportunities available to members of the Reserve. These training opportunities, in turn, allows Reserve personnel to fulfil the roles allocated to them, which remain as set out in the 2015 White Paper on Defence, to augment the PDF in times of crisis and to participate in ceremonial events.</p></reply>
