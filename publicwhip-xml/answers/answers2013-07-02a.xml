    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-02a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070200058#WRA00800"><p>The corporation tax paid by some large multinational corporations and the rate at which they pay that tax is an issue that has attracted a lot of public and media attention recently.  Every country in the world has its own particular tax system.  These systems have been put in place and developed over the years to reflect their own circumstances.  Some multinational corporations, with the assistance of legal practitioners and tax advisers, have exploited the differences in these systems to their own advantage.  What is evident is that these corporations can organise their company structures to such an extent that they are able to minimise their corporate tax liabilities while still acting within the law.</p><p>  In recent weeks national and international attention has turned to Ireland, our competitive corporate tax rate, and the tax arrangements employed by some multinational corporations based here.  I want to reiterate some points that are very important to the debate.</p><p>  Firstly, I want to make it clear that we do not have a special low corporation tax rate for multinational companies.  Ireland's tax system is statute-based so there is no possibility of individual special tax rates for companies.  </p><p>  All companies resident in Ireland are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities in Ireland.  A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits.  Chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.</p><p>  The tax rates that were quoted publicly are, emphatically, not the rate of tax paid by such companies, or by any company, on their Irish activities.  Having examined the document produced by the US Senate Subcommittee, it appears that the rate that is being quoted is reached by taking the Irish tax chargeable on the branch activities of companies that are not tax resident here, and dividing this figure by the entire global profit of the company concerned.</p><p>  It is clearly wrong and misleading to attribute this rate of tax to Ireland.  Companies which are not tax-resident in Ireland are not chargeable in Ireland in respect of their non-Irish profits, and these non-Irish profit figures should not be used to assert special tax rates that simply do not apply here. </p><p>  Secondly, the ability of multinational entities to lower their aggregate, global tax payments using international structures reflects the global context in which Ireland and indeed all countries operate.  This is an issue that we cannot solve on our own, and in a time where citizens are being asked to dig deeper into their pockets, Governments around the world are now taking co-ordinated action to ensure that these corporations pay their fair share of taxes.</p><p>  I would like to reassure the house that Ireland has been proactive and has already taken the lead on many of these global issues, for example:</p><p>- The Irish Presidency has made significant progress on a number of key files in the area of tax evasion and tax fraud and we were able to bring a number of these to a successful conclusion:</p><p>- At the June Ecofin meeting we agreed a VAT anti-fraud package to combat sudden and massive VAT fraud. </p><p>- In May, significant progress was made on widening the scope of the EU Savings Directive which involves automatic exchange of information between tax authorities, an important step forward in an area where progress has been stalled for a number of years.  </p><p>- And also in May we brokered an agreement among EU Finance Ministers to set out a roadmap on aggressive tax planning and good governance.</p><p>  All of these achievements have been acknowledged as significant by our EU colleagues.  In fact, the EU Tax Commissioner, Algirdas Semeta, took to Twitter last week publicly thanking us for our &quot;very successful Presidency&quot; from a tax perspective. </p><p>- Beyond the EU, Ireland is actively participating in the OECD's &quot;Base Erosion and Profit Shifting&quot; project, which will shortly produce an action plan that will be the main toolkit of the global effort to tackle this issue.</p><p>- And, in December last year, Ireland signed an Agreement with the United States to provide for the automatic reporting and exchange of information between the US Treasury and the Irish Revenue Commissioners.  In so doing, Ireland was the fourth country in the world to sign such an agreement, which gave effect to the FATCA regulations.  This was a welcome opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to combat tax evasion, and in particular, demonstrates our excellent relationship with the US authorities in such matters.</p><p>  Both the OECD and EU work has clearly demonstrated that this is a global problem, which cannot be solved by one nation or even one continent acting on its own.  <i></i></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-02a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070200058#WRA00900"><p>As advised in response to a recent Parliamentary Question 82 of 20th June 2013, NAMA debtors who have been declared bankrupt outside of Ireland had, by reference to the nominal or par value of loans, exposure to debt of approximately &euro;8 billion at the time of NAMA's acquisition of loans from the participating institutions.  As also advised, NAMA has enforced over the assets securing these loans and continues to realise these assets.    </p><p>  Bankruptcy proceedings relate, generally, to any remaining unencumbered or unsecured assets held by the bankrupt.  The role of the bankruptcy trustee is, therefore, to realise any other residual or unencumbered assets, including property and cash, which the bankrupt may have and to make a distribution to creditors including NAMA.  The bankruptcy trustee can also seek to have the bankrupt contribute from post-bankruptcy earnings through an income payment order.</p><p>  NAMA advises that it does not write off debt as a result of debtors filing for bankruptcy outside the jurisdiction of the State.  Rather, it is a matter for the bankruptcy proceedings to deal with the outstanding debt.  NAMA advises that even where the bankruptcy is discharged, the bankruptcy estate continues until such time as all assets have been liquidated and the debt, in so far as possible, has been repaid.  NAMA advises that, in its position as a secured lender, its experience has been that bankruptcy has not tended to prejudice recoveries.  </p><p>  The Deputy may wish to refer to NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements for 2012, which contains extensive information regarding the Agency's operations, including, as set out in pages 26-27 in particular, its insolvency activity and on the locus of debtor bankruptcy.  The end 2012 financial statements takes account of the financial position of its whole loan book including those debtors that have declared bankruptcy.  As with all debtor connections, NAMA conducts regular impairment reviews of connections whose principals have been declared bankrupt.  The fact of being declared bankrupt does not in itself necessarily cause the impairment position to deteriorate.  NAMA's security position is not impacted by bankruptcy proceedings.</p><p>  It is important to point out that debtors are entitled to petition to bankrupt themselves in other jurisdictions if they are entitled to do so under the laws of that jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that for a debtor to avail of bankruptcy in any given jurisdiction he/she must first of all establish that jurisdiction as his/her centre of main interest (COMI).  The establishment of COMI is a matter for the relevant authorities in the jurisdiction in which bankruptcy is sought.  NAMA advises that in each instance of bankruptcy involving a NAMA debtor it reviews its options and selects the most appropriate method of ensuring the best possible return for the taxpayer.  NAMA advises that it is currently challenging bankruptcy applications on the basis of COMI in two instances and in a further case is supporting the application of another secured bank with a view to having bankruptcy proceedings take place in Ireland. </p><p>  NAMA advises that in each instance of bankruptcy involving a NAMA debtor it reviews its options and selects the most appropriate method of ensuring the best possible return for the taxpayer.  As advised in NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements, the Agency, as a secured creditor, is generally neutral on the locus of bankruptcy proceedings and its experience has been that the location has not tended to prejudice recoveries.  This position is based in part on its positive on-going engagement with several bankruptcy trustees of debtors who have been adjudged bankrupt in the UK.  The Agency also advises that the bankruptcy regime in the UK is well-established, sophisticated and that bankruptcy trustees under the UK system possess extensive powers to compel production of legal and banking information, on a cross-border basis, from the bankrupt.  These powers have been used in bankruptcy cases involving NAMA debtors to uncover significant undeclared assets. </p><p>  NAMA further advises that the comparatively shorter duration of bankruptcy in the UK is not a consideration for the Agency as the bankrupt's assets remain in the control of the bankruptcy trustee long after the bankrupt may have been discharged from bankruptcy and any failure to make full disclosure may result in the period of bankruptcy being extended.  NAMA advises that it challenges the release from bankruptcy of any debtor in instances where there is non-co-operation with the bankruptcy trustee.   <i></i></p></reply>

Therefore, like other insolvency services such as those provided by liquidators, receivers and examiners, the service provided by a personal insolvency practitioner is liable to VAT at the standard rate of 23%. </p><p>  I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that under a personal insolvency arrangement, the personal insolvency practitioner's fees are ultimately deducted from the dividend payments to the creditors under the arrangement rather than charged to the debtor.  As the debtor is availing of a personal insolvency arrangement because of their insolvent position, it is the creditor who is bearing the ultimate cost of the fees and the VAT on the fees. </p><p>  Since information is not available on the volume of personal insolvency practitioner activity or the fees charged, it is not possible to estimate the cost to the Exchequer of exempting the service from VAT were it possible to grant such an exemption.<i></i></p></reply>

This is ultimately a commercial decision for the management team and board of each bank, having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability.  I must ensure that the banks are run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure their value as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.  A Relationship Framework has been specified that defines the nature of the relationship between the Minister for Finance and each bank.  These Frameworks were published on 30 March 2012 and can be found at: <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></p><p>  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) stipulates very strict and narrow conditions for any change of a tracker mortgage contract.  As the Deputy is aware, the CCMA requires that a lender must not require the borrower to change from an existing tracker mortgage, as part of any alternative repayment arrangement offered, except where:</p><p>- all other options, which would retain the tracker rate, have been considered to be unsustainable; </p><p>- the arrangement offered is affordable to the borrower;</p><p>- the arrangement is a long-term sustainable option.</p><p>  The Central Bank has reviewed the CCMA and undertook a consultation in relation to the provisions in the CCMA.  The revised CCMA was published on 27 June 2013 and came into effect on 1 July 2013.  </p><p>  The CCMA provides an integrated and cohesive package of consumer protection measures for borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears.  It reflects the current mortgage arrears situation and seeks to deliver on the following principles, to:</p><p>- ensure appropriate resolution of each borrower's arrears situation;</p><p>- ensure that lenders deal with borrowers in a fair and transparent manner; </p><p>- support and facilitate meaningful engagement between lenders and borrowers; and  </p><p>- ensure borrower awareness of the benefits of co-operating with their lender, and the consequences of not co-operating. </p><p>  With regard to restructuring of mortgage loans, the CCMA requires lenders to explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements offered by that lender, for each particular case.</p><p>In addition, where an alternative repayment arrangement is offered by a lender, the revised CCMA requires the lender to outline the reasons why the alternative arrangement offered is considered to be appropriate and sustainable, as well as the advantages and any disadvantages or potential disadvantages of any arrangement offered, with regard to the individual circumstances of the borrower.  <i></i></p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware the Relationship Framework with the bank provides that the State will not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the bank or their management decisions.  These frameworks are published on the Department of Finance website.  I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.   </p><p>  I have been informed by AIB that these pricing changes will increase the average Maintenance and Transaction cost for fee paying personal customers by &euro;0.75 per month and by less than &euro;2 per month for business customers.  These fee increases do not affect the  circa 40% of personal banking customers in AIB who avail of free banking via, &quot;a way to bank free of maintenance and transaction fees&quot;, if they are students or Advantage customers over the age of 60.  Free banking offers also exist for start-up businesses and young farmers, while business customers have the option to negotiate fees on a case by case basis. </p><p>  I have also been informed by the bank that for every ATM transaction the actual cost of providing the service is greater than the fee charged to customers for availing of the service.  The bank also provides a guide on its website for customers on the way to reduce the cost of banking.</p><p>  It should also be noted that the Central Bank of Ireland is required under section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 to approve any increases in bank charges and approval for these increases was received prior to the announcement last week.</p><p>  In 2011, I requested that the Central Bank examine ways to improve Ireland's payment infrastructure.  The Central Bank established a Steering Committee which prepared and submitted the National Payments Plan to me.  Government subsequently approved the plan in April 2013 and my Department is now working to implement its recommendations.  <i></i></p></reply>

In particular, the tax and development programme implemented by the OECD's Committee on Fiscal Affairs (CFA) and Development Assistance Committee (DAC) is concerned with supporting effective tax systems in developing countries. Notwithstanding our own severe budgetary challenges resulting from the international financial crisis, Ireland, through Irish Aid, is contributing to the funding of this work on tax and development.  The OECD's Tax Inspectors Without Borders (TIWB) project is an important initiative under the tax and development programme which is directly concerned with helping developing countries to collect their taxes. </p><p>  To improve tax transparency and compliance in developing countries, civil society groups have for some time now been campaigning for multinational enterprises to publicly report on a country-by-country basis in their annual financial statements. Proponents of published country-by-country reporting suggest this would discourage profit-shifting between countries. Ireland supports the ongoing work at OECD level on tax and development issues, including work on country-by-country reporting. While supporting the principle of country-by-country reporting our position is that it should be rolled out carefully on a phased basis with an appropriate impact assessment. Ireland has given country-by-country reporting a significant boost by negotiating its extension to the financial services sector under our EU Presidency.</p><p>  Effective exchange of information is a critical tool in ensuring that countries are able to collect taxes owing to them. Ireland has now fully signed up to the joint Council of Europe/OECD Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. Ireland's instruments of ratification were deposited on 29 May of this year and the Convention/Protocol will enter into force on 1 September 2013. The deputy may wish to note, in particular, that an amending Protocol extends participation in this Convention to developing countries. This enables developing countries to access exchange of information with an ever-increasing range of countries without having to incur the expense of negotiating agreements with each of the countries concerned individually.   <i></i></p></reply>

As I said last week in commenting on the affair, the content of the tapes has been very negative for Ireland's standing internationally and has resulted in extremely unfavourable press coverage abroad. Here at home, public anger, disgust and dismay at the tone and content of the transcripts is, understandably, almost palpable. I, too, am appalled at what I have read and heard.</p><p>   The question of any abuse of the bank guarantee scheme in relation to deposit-taking by Anglo Irish Bank  referred to by the Deputy is currently being examined by the Central Bank. The Bank is liaising with the Gardai on the matter and is examining whether or not any breaches of regulatory requirements may have occurred arising from the information contained in the transcripts. As the Deputy will appreciate therefore, I am not in a position to comment more specifically on this issue at this time.</p><p>  The revelations of the past week or so bring to the fore the need for a banking inquiry as soon as possible. Of course, this will be a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas themselves to determine. As I said recently in responding to a Parliamentary Question on the matter, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform indicated that he supported the objective of holding a legally robust, parliamentary banking inquiry when he announced last month the publication of  his Department's  'Houses of the Oireachtas  (Inquiries ,Privileges and Procedures)  Bill 2013'. Indeed, Minister Howlin has since - in the wake of the publication of the transcripts - underlined the need for such an inquiry. While the primary purpose of the Bill is to create a legislative framework for Oireachtas inquiries generally, it would be of direct practical assistance in facilitating a banking inquiry in accordance with a decision of the Houses of the Oireachtas in this regard.  <i></i></p></reply>

Ireland's tax system is statute-based so there is no possibility of individual special tax rates for companies. </p><p>  However, I am aware of recent media reports which refer to the ways that some companies structure their international tax affairs to minimise their tax costs, and the fact that some of these reports make reference to Irish companies being part of these structures.  By mixing up the Irish profits and the foreign profits of multinational groups, such reports can produce a global tax rate for the companies concerned that is lower than 12.5% -- and an incorrect inference that the full Irish profits are not being charged.</p><p>  All companies resident in Ireland are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities in Ireland.  A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits. Chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.</p><p>  The profits charged in Ireland fully reflect the functions, assets and risks located here by a multinational group. The payments to the non-resident company represent the required remuneration of intellectual property assets funded and owned outside the State and its tax payments are properly reduced in these circumstances by reference to expenditure incurred for the purpose of its trade.  Ireland cannot expect to receive or retain the remuneration of these assets.</p><p>  The ability of entities to lower their global rate of tax using international structures reflects the global context in which Ireland and indeed all countries operate.  Differences arise in the legal and tax systems between countries.  International tax planning takes account of these differences in national systems and rules.  What companies do outside of Ireland is beyond the scope of the Irish tax system.  We cannot conclusively determine the effective rate of tax paid under international tax structures by reference to taxation in Ireland alone.  </p><p>  The only way to effectively deal with such arrangements is for countries to work together to examine these structures and to consider how international rules can be amended to ensure fair levels of taxation.  Ireland remains fully committed to this approach to ensure fair play in international taxation.  In this regard, Ireland is participating in projects at EU and OECD level which aim to address international tax issues.  </p><p>  Further, as part of the Irish Presidency of the EU, we were able to demonstrate our willingness to take the lead and made significant progress on a number of key files in the area of tax evasion and tax fraud.  We were able to bring a number of these to a successful conclusion:</p><p>- At the June Ecofin meeting we agreed a VAT anti-fraud package to combat sudden and massive VAT fraud. </p><p>- In May, significant progress was made on widening the scope of the EU Savings Directive which involves automatic exchange of information between tax authorities, an important step forward in an area where progress has been stalled for a number of years. </p><p>- And also in May we brokered an agreement among EU Finance Ministers to set up a roadmap on aggressive tax planning and good governance.</p><p>  All these achievements were acknowledged as significant, no less than by EU Tax Commissioner Algirdas Semeta last week when he referred to our &#8220;very successful Presidency&#8221; from a tax perspective.</p><p>  My Department has been actively engaged in the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ('BEPS') project.  Following our invitation, the head of this project, Pascal Saint-Amans, spoke at our Tax and Economics conference last month and spoke very positively about Ireland's support for the BEPS project.  An Action Plan on BEPS will shortly be published: this Action Plan will be the main toolkit of the global effort to tackle this global issue.  This is the appropriate forum in which to consider any potential changes to the Irish corporate tax system.  My officials will take this under consideration as part of the regular Budgetary and Finance Bill process.  <i></i></p></reply>

Indeed, it went as far as stating that, without effective bankruptcy legislation, the mortgage arrears problem will not be resolved.  The Government has accepted the need for fundamental reform in this area and the new debt settlement frameworks as provided for in the 2012 Personal Insolvency Act will very soon be available to debtors.</p><p>  However, the Government also accepts that personal insolvency reform on its own is not a sufficient response to deal with the problem.  Other initiatives and measures are also required and are being implemented in tandem with personal insolvency reform.  These include:-</p><p>- With Central Bank oversight, the development of mortgage arrears resolution strategies by mortgage lenders and the subsequent setting of performance targets for the main banks to require them to implement these strategies and, in particular, to propose sustainable solutions to their customers who are in mortgage difficulty. Associated with this is the recent Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears changes which seek to ensure an appropriate resolution of each case of mortgage difficulty and to require lenders to explore all meaningful alternative repayment arrangements offered by the lender for co-operating borrowers.</p><p>- The provision of general and, where appropriate, more targeted information and advice to mortgage holders which is free to the users of the service.</p><p>- The development of a &quot;mortgage to rent&quot; scheme as a social housing response to eligible households to allow them remain in their home.</p><p>  The necessary overall strategy and building blocks to address the mortgage arrears problem are, therefore, now in place. These include the Central Bank targets initiative, the new Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the fundamental change to personal insolvency legislation including the provision of new, more accessible and less penal resolution mechanisms to debtors and a comprehensive mortgage information and advice service.  </p><p>  The onus is now on lenders to move to address individual arrears cases in a comprehensive and speedy manner.  Therefore, I expect the banks to increase the number of &#8220;split mortgage&#8221; and the other long term restructured mortgage arrangements put in place over the remainder of this year.  </p><p>As part of the process banks are requested to make regular returns to the Central Bank on their performance against the targets and the Central Bank will audit the performance of the lenders in this regard.  I can assure the Deputy that, both my Department and I will keep in close liaison with the Central Bank and individual banks on this important issue.  <i></i></p></reply>

Strong protections are included in the Code to protect indebted borrowers when dealing with their lenders.    In addition to these protections, provision 14 of the revised CCMA, which came into effect from 1 July, provides that a lender must prepare and make available to borrowers an information booklet providing details of its MARP. In the context of providing additional information in the MARP booklet, lenders must, if they make use of a confidentiality agreement or similar agreement, provide summary information in its MARP booklet. </p><p>  The Central Bank is currently considering the issue of confidentiality agreements by lenders and has asked lenders to furnish information on their use. </p><p>From information received from lenders to date following contact by the Central Bank, it would appear that not all of the covered banks are using confidentiality agreements.

Member States shall ensure that corporate or legal entities established within their territory obtain and hold adequate, accurate and current information on their beneficial ownership.</p><p>2. Member States shall ensure that the information referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article can be accessed in a timely manner by competent authorities and by obliged entities.&quot;</p><p>  Article 30 makes similar provisions in relation to Trusts and other legal arrangements. Neither Article requires the establishment of a Government registry.

The 3rd Money Laundering Directive was transposed into Irish Law in the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.  <i></i></p></reply>

This should apply to both Executive and Non-Executive Board members and provides a process to ensure a smooth succession of incumbent board members who were in place before September 2008.  I would expect this succession to be substantially completed by early 2012, and will use my powers as shareholder to affect such changes if necessary&quot;</i></p><p>  Across the financial institutions covered by the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, only one of the board members currently in place was in place in September 2008. That  director, Mr Richie Boucher of Bank of Ireland, has passed a full fitness and probity review by the Central Bank.</p><p>  The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 became operational on the 1st December 2011 when the Central Bank prescribed regulations into law setting out those functions (&#8220;controlled functions&#8221;) which would be covered by the Act, and a smaller subset of controlled functions (&#8220;pre-approval controlled functions&#8221; or &#8220;PCFs&#8221;) which will require the prior approval of the Central Bank before an appointment can be made to a Bank.</p><p>  The Central Bank fulfils its functions under the Act by processing applications for approvals to all PCFs in all regulated financial service providers since 1 December 2011. The Central Bank may refuse to approve a proposed appointment to a PCF role where it is of the opinion that the proposed appointee is not of such fitness and probity as is appropriate to perform the relevant function. Where the Central Bank refuses to approve a proposed appointment, then a regulated financial service provider may not appoint the person to the role.</p><p>  Further, the Central Bank as part of its role in the on-going supervision of the financial services sector, including the banking industry, may from time to time consider that there is reason to suspect the fitness and probity of any person performing a controlled function and may commence an investigation into that person. The existence and progress of such investigations are confidential and details of such investigations may not be disclosed by the Central Bank.</p><p>  As previously announced, The Central Bank wrote to all directors of the state-supported institutions in 2011 to determine their intention to remain in their posts beyond 1 January 2012. During the period of the review, many of the long-standing directors of the six State-supported credit institutions resigned. The Central Bank issued a statement on 28 June 2012 where it was outlined that the fitness and probity review of all sitting directors of the six banks and building societies covered by the State guarantee had concluded.  A copy of this statement is available on the Central Bank website. In respect of remaining directors of these credit institutions, the Central Bank continues to carry out its role in respect of the supervision of the fitness and probity of those directors. New applications to sit on the boards of any of these institutions which remain under the Bank's active supervision will require the applicants to establish, to the satisfaction of the Bank, that proposed directors meet the Bank's minimum standards of fitness and probity. </p><p>  All assessments of fitness and probity of persons being proposed to PCF roles, and of persons performing controlled functions are made with respect to the criteria set out in Section 25(3) of the Act and a Code issued by the Central Bank under Section 50 of the Act entitled &#8220;Fitness and Probity Standards (Code issued under Section 50 of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010).  <i></i></p></reply>

Regulation 473/2013, one of the &lsquo;two pack&rsquo; surveillance and coordination regulations, provides that euro area member countries must make public their draft budget not later than 15 October each year. The Regulation further provides that euro area Member States must submit a separate draft budgetary plan, containing all of the information in the budget but in a common standardised format, to both the Commission and the Eurogroup by 15th October. Therefore, there is no obligation to submit the draft budgetary plan to the Commission or Eurogroup before the budget itself is announced but it is a matter for individual Member States to comply with the new budgetary timeline in whichever sequence they decide as long as the deadline of 15th October is respected. I intend to submit Ireland&rsquo;s draft budgetary plan to the Commission following the publication of the Budget.</p></reply>

While this represented an increase of around 3,200 accounts on the position as at end 2012, the rate of increase, while still upward, is not as strong as that which generally prevailed in recent years.  The main reason for the increase in the level of mortgage arrears is of course the prevailing economic situation with the high level of unemployment, reduced disposable income and a decline in property prices all contributing to this.  The mortgage arrears problem is a major problem that needs to be resolved for the long term economic and social health of the country and the Government has now put in place a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem.</p><p>  The Central Bank compiles and publishes quarterly mortgage arrears and repossession statistics for both primary domestic homes (PDH) and buy-to-let (BTL) mortgages and my Department closely monitors these statistics closely.  Regarding future mortgage arrears data, the Central Bank will, over the coming months, commence the publication of additional statistics which will be designed to provide more information on the level of progress in relation to mortgage arrears resolution. One such measure is the number of newly agreed loan modifications during each reference quarter. This will be captured for both temporary and permanent mortgage restructure types. A second measure of progress is the performance of restructured loans. Current data collection only allows the user to identify whether a restructured account is in arrears or not; it does not capture information on those accounts that still have old arrears outstanding but which are meeting the terms of the new restructured arrangement.  Reporting performance against specific resolution targets, as well as the full suite of key performance indicator data, should provide a more complete measure of progress in addressing arrears cases. </p><p>  The necessary overall strategy and building blocks to address long term mortgage arrears are now in place. These include the Central Bank targets initiative, the new Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the fundamental change to personal insolvency legislation including the provision of new, more accessible and less penal resolution mechanisms to debtors and a comprehensive mortgage information and advice service.  The main onus is now on lenders to move to address individual arrears cases in a comprehensive and speedy manner.</p></reply>

The concept of a &ldquo;split mortgage&rdquo; involves splitting a distressed mortgage into an affordable mortgage and warehousing the balance.  I am informed by the Central Bank that the majority of lenders have now introduced, or are in the process of introducing, a &ldquo;split mortgage&rdquo; as one of the alternative repayment arrangements to restructure a mortgage.  While lenders have taken the broad approach set out in the Keane report, the product details vary from lender to lender. The most notable difference involves the interest rate charged on the warehoused element of the split mortgage and this varies from 0% up to the full mortgage interest rate. Also, the maximum amount that can be warehoused is dependent on each lenders own internal criteria. The split mortgage, like all other forbearance and modification arrangements, is based on affordability and sustainability of the arrangement from both the borrower and the lender&rsquo;s perspective.  There is also a commercial and contractual leeway for the lender in formulating the details of any particular restructure or alternative repayment arrangement from the initial contractual requirements.</p><p>  As lenders offer split mortgages with differing terms and conditions, the main supervisory issue is one of transparency and the Central Bank is of the view that all lenders should make public all terms and conditions and eligibility criteria for a &ldquo;split mortgage&rdquo; to aid both customers and financial advisors.  In addition, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears will require the lender, where an alternative repayment arrangement is offered, to outline the reasons why the alternative arrangement offered is considered to be appropriate and sustainable, as well as the advantages and any disadvantages or potential disadvantages of any arrangement offered, in the context of the individual circumstances of the borrower.</p><p>  While the Central Bank engagement with lenders to require them to propose options for the sustainable resolution of mortgage difficulty is a major element of the strategy to deal with the mortgage arrears problem, other measures are also important.  Among these is the reform of personal insolvency legislation with more accessible and effective debt resolution mechanisms being made available to debtors and the less penal character of debtor insolvency.</p><p>  The necessary overall strategy and building blocks to address the mortgage arrears problem are, therefore, now in place. These include the Central Bank targets initiative, the new Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the fundamental change to personal insolvency legislation including the provision of new, more accessible and less penal resolution mechanisms to debtors and a comprehensive mortgage information and advice service.  </p><p>  The onus is now on lenders to move to address individual arrears cases in a comprehensive and speedy manner.  Therefore, I expect the banks to increase the number of &ldquo;split mortgage&rdquo; and the other long term restructured mortgage arrangements put in place over the remainder of this year.  </p><p>  As part of the process banks are requested to make regular returns to the Central Bank on their performance against the targets and the Central Bank will audit the performance of the lenders in this regard.  I can assure the Deputy that, both my Department and I will keep in close liaison with the Central Bank and individual banks on this important issue.</p></reply>

Profits charged here are aligned with real economic activity here - and these profits are charged at 12.5%. Very low rates computed in some cases are got by dividing the Irish tax by the sum of Irish profits <i>and</i> foreign profits of multinational companies.    International tax planning opportunities largely arise from the interaction of different countries' national tax laws and from international tax rules not keeping pace with current organization of multinational business. Addressing such issues comprehensively is beyond the scope of individual national tax systems or bilateral agreements between them.</p><p>  The way to deal with international mismatches, gaps and loopholes effectively is for countries to work together on a multilateral basis to consider how national rules can be coordinated and international rules can be amended to address these issues.  Ireland is committed to this approach and supports the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, which is specifically concerned with addressing these issues.  Ireland has concluded tax treaties with all member countries of the OECD, all of which have signed up to the BEPS project.   <i></i></p></reply>

This declaration outlined G8's commitment to &quot;make a real difference&quot; in ten particular areas. Four of these areas relate to tax. The Taoiseach has already welcomed the Declaration and asserted that it did not present a problem for Ireland.   Perhaps the single most important element of the ten point plan was in relation to the automatic exchange of information to fight the scourge of tax evasion. Ireland fully supports this objective. A lot of our efforts in the tax area during the Irish Presidency were focussed on countering tax fraud and evasion, whether this arose in specific tax dossiers, such as VAT or Savings, or whether in a more general sense, such as the Council's response to the Commission's Action Plan and associated Recommendations. In that regard, following a very successful discussion at the Informal ECOFIN which was held in Dublin Castle in April, myself and Commissioner Semeta issued a joint letter to all Ecofin Ministers urging quick progress on seven particular tax proposals. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that progress has been made in all seven areas.</p><p>  Ireland has nothing to fear from the Lough Erne Declaration. The technical discussions aimed at achieving the aspirations contained in the Declaration have been underway for some time by way of the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project. Ireland is deeply involved in the BEPS discussions, a fact that has recently been acknowledged by the Director of the OECD's Committee on Fiscal Affairs. We look forward to seeing the final results of this work.  <i></i></p></reply>

I have already said that I found the taped conversations appalling. The Government is determined to find out exactly what happened and we propose to establish an inquiry to do exactly that. I have noted that the Governor of the Central Bank has also indicated that the Central Bank is examining the scope for action against those involved in the recently released tapes.</p><p>  On the question of regulatory reforms, the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 was a crucial first step in the introduction of a new fully-integrated single structure within the Central Bank. It provided a statutory basis for a comprehensive domestic regulatory framework for financial services and set out new powers for the Central Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers.</p><p>  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011, which is being considered at Report stage in the Seanad, further strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions. The reforms being brought in under the Bill are complemented by a number of strategically important reforms at EU level in financial services. Agreement has been reached on the single supervisory mechanism, one of the main cornerstones of Banking Union, which will provide for the European Central Bank to act as supervisor for systemic important banks throughout the Union. Agreement has also been reached on the Capital Requirements package which will ensure that European banks hold enough good quality capital to withstand future economic and financial shocks. Member States have also agreed in principle the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and Directive.</p><p>In terms of promoting good corporate governance, I would also point to the Central Bank&rsquo;s 2011 Corporate Governance Code for Credit Institutions and Insurance Undertakings which imposes minimum core standards upon all credit institutions and insurance undertakings licensed or authorised by the Central Bank.</p></reply>

As such, the size and composition of adjustment will form part of the budgetary discussions themselves and will not be published prior to Budget day.

The contribution formula for the EU Budget is comprised of Traditional Own Resources, a VAT-based payment and a residual balancing component paid in accordance with a contribution key derived from each Member State's share of EU Gross National Income (GNI). This GNI element accounts for approximately two-thirds of Ireland's contribution to the EU Budget.   The CSO prepares the GNI figures for Ireland in accordance with European and international statistical standards. In line with these methodologies, as the re-domiciled companies to which the Deputy refers are resident in Ireland, they must be incorporated in our national accounts. It should also be noted that revisions to Irish economic data are frequent due to the output fluctuations in the large multinational sector operating here. Indeed, should the position related to these re-domiciled firms unwind, this would serve to lower GNI, which would in turn reduce our EU contribution in future years. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the use of GNI as a contribution key favours Ireland, as unlike other countries this is significantly lower than our GDP. While my Department will continue to monitor the situation closely, it should be noted that under the current 2007 - 2013 MFF, Ireland has remained a net beneficiary from the EU Budget over the whole period. Furthermore, it is anticipated that Ireland will, almost certainly, continue to be a net beneficiary for the next number of years.  <i></i></p></reply>

The anti-money-laundering obligations applicable in Ireland derive from the Third EU Money-Laundering Directive.  The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 was enacted in July 2010 to transpose the Third Money Laundering Directive (2005/60/EC) and its Implementing Directive (2006/70/EC) into Irish Law.</p><p>  Part 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 2010 sets out the obligations of &#8220;designated persons&#8221; in relation to customer identification.  One such obligation set out in the Act is the obligation to conduct customer due diligence, prior to the establishment of a business relationship. Customer due diligence refers to the identification of customers and that of any beneficial owners of financial products associated with the customer.</p><p>  An Post and the Prize Bond Company are deemed to be a &#8220;<i>designated person</i>&#8221; under the Criminal Justice Act 2010 as they fall within the definition of a &quot;<i>financial institution</i>&quot;. In light of this, An Post and the Prize Bond Company are required to comply with the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the sale of Prize Bonds to customers.  This means, in practical terms, that customer due diligence must be conducted on all purchases of prize bonds, irrespective of value.</p><p>  The extent to which any particular person or product may be exempted from the customer due diligence requirements of the Act is determined by reference to the Act having regard to the underlying Directives.</p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has no discretion to exempt certain firms from the requirement to comply with the Act.</p><p>In light of the above, I am exploring with the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and my colleague the Minister for Justice whether or not exemptions available under the Directives may be applied to small value purchases of prize bonds facilitated on behalf of the State by An Post and the Prize Bond Company.</p></reply>

The Promissory Notes were returned to the Department of Finance and cancelled at that time.   As part of the transaction the Central Bank committed that the bonds would be sold in accordance with an agreed schedule and only where such a sale is not disruptive to financial stability. As the bonds are now legally owned by the Central Bank it would not be possible for me to freeze those bonds. I am deeply disturbed and outraged by the taped conversations involving Anglo executives in 2008 and dismayed to hear senior banking executives refer to the banking crisis with such arrogance. As the Deputy will be aware, there are a number of on-going criminal and other investigations into events in Anglo Irish Bank which will deal with these matters. The Government is determined to ensure the public is informed about what happened in Irish Banks and has published the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Bill which, once enacted, will provide the legal framework for a banking inquiry to be held within the current constitutional parameters.</p></reply>

We have an outstanding record of attracting companies of real substance to invest and create thousands of jobs in Ireland. These companies are here for a number of reasons including: our talented English-speaking workforce, good education system, and ease of doing business. Therefore tax is just one reason why companies choose to locate in Ireland. Officials are also working to make sure that the nature of our corporation tax regime is not misrepresented or misunderstood.</p><p>  Erroneous allegations are monitored and a response is issued where appropriate.

It is expected that this facility will come into force towards the end of the first half of 2014. In addition the Eurogroup also agreed to consider retro-active recapitalisation of banks on a case-by-case basis once the instrument enters into force.  This provides one potential avenue for Ireland to recoup some of the funds it put into the Banks in the wake of the banking crash. However, there is a long way to go in the negotiations and as each case will be considered on its merits it would not be appropriate for me to prejudge the outcome at this early stage.   <i></i></p></reply>

This standard provides guidance on the Building Condition Assessment, as well as on the sampling and testing to be carried out, to establish the presence of significant pyritic damage.</p><p>  To be eligible for an exemption from LPT, a liable person must obtain a certificate from a competent person, such as an engineer, confirming the presence of significant pyritic damage and cannot claim the exemption until the relevant certificate has been issued in respect of the residential property concerned.  Once they have the relevant certificate, the liable person should notify the Revenue Commissioners in writing that they wish to claim the exemption.  By virtue of the LPT legislation, the liable person can, as it suits their particular circumstances, opt to claim the exemption from that date forward or retrospectively if they received the certificate after they had already met their LPT obligations for a particular liability date.  </p><p>  Special arrangements will apply in respect of the years 2013 and 2014.  Liable persons who do not have the relevant certificate on the first liability date of 1 May 2013 (liability date for 2013), or by 1 November 2013 (liability date for 2014), will be required to pay LPT for those periods.  Where a certificate is issued after either of these dates but on or before 31 December 2013, a liable person may elect for retrospective exemption for one or other of the years 2013 and 2014.  This election must be made on or before 31 January 2014. Where a liable person elects for retrospective exemption for the years 2013 or 2014, any LPT that has already been paid will be refunded by Revenue.  Any refund is subject to Revenue's usual four year time limit on the refund of tax.  </p><p>  Depending on when in a three year valuation cycle the certificate is issued, the exemption may last for up to five years.  It is the date of the certificate and not the date of the claim for the exemption that determines when the exemption first starts from. Where a property qualifies for the exemption, it continues to apply even where the property is subsequently remediated before the end of the exemption period.  </p><p>  For those persons who have previously paid for tests to be carried out, I am advised that, conscious of the need to reduce costs to liable persons who own properties with significant pyritic damage, the Regulations provide for the use, where feasible, of the results from testing of the sub-floor hardcore undertaken prior to the publication of I.S. 398-1:2013, to classify the hardcore material, if the testing that has already been carried out is in accordance with, or equivalent to, the test methods provided in this standard, and this has been validated as such by a competent person.  However, a Building Condition Assessment, in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013, will be required to be carried out by a competent person irrespective of when the testing is, or was, carried out. Affected homeowners may be eligible to recoup the cost of the Building Condition Assessment, subject to a maximum limit of &euro;500 (including VAT), under the pyrite remediation scheme currently being developed by the Pyrite Resolution Board.</p><p>  The rules governing when, and for how long, the exemption applies are complicated and are best explained by the use of examples.  I am advised that further detailed information and examples on how the exemption for residential properties with significant pyrite damage operates are provided by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, on <i><font color="#0000FF">www.environ.ie</font></i>, or can be accessed from the LPT pages of the Revenue website, <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>.</p></reply>

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  The USC is a tax in nature and not a social contribution as it does not possess the attributes of a social security contribution.  Payment of the USC does not guarantee a benefit nor is there a defined relationship between payments under the charge, contributions and benefits paid, as there normally is with a social insurance system.  PRSI is applied on a narrower earned income base, the rates of charge differ by sector and other non-income related criteria, and there are cash benefit entitlements that derive from the maintenance of a contribution record that varies by sector i.e. employee, self-employed and public servant.  These differences mean there are considerable non-tax policy issues that would need to be resolved before PRSI could be incorporated in to the USC charge.  Delivering on a commitment in the Programme for Government, the USC was reviewed by the Department of Finance in the lead up to Budget 2012.  The report is available at <i>www.finance.gov.ie</i>.  As the Deputy will be aware, it is a long-standing practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment in advance of the Budget on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.</p></reply>

In response to this, the Commission set out a range of measures to provide a strong foundation for addressing the difficult problems in the sector.  Specifically, in terms of the stability of credit unions, the Commission made recommendations in relation to restructuring, stabilisation and resolution.  A core recommendation was that the sector be restructured on a voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis in order to allow the credit union sector perform to a greater level of efficiency.  The Government contributed &euro;250 million to the Credit Union Fund in December 2012 to support the restructuring of the credit union sector by the Credit Union Restructuring Board.  The board is working to the timetable set out in the Commission&rsquo;s report and is expected to complete its work by the end of 2015 with any necessary disbursement of funding taking place before then.  Any funding provided to credit unions will be on a recoupable basis.  The Commission recommended that a statutory stabilisation fund be established to address short-term problems at credit unions that are viable but undercapitalised.  The statutory basis for stabilisation is in place under the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 and my Department is conducting an analysis in advance of implementation of a levy by the end of 2013.  The Commission also recommended that resolution powers provided to the Central Bank under the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 should be considered for those credit unions that meet certain conditions set out in that Act.  The Government has provided resolution funding for credit unions of &euro;250 million.  Funding will be based on a principle of recoupment over the medium term via a levy under the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011.  I am satisfied that these measures, together with governance and regulatory changes, introduced on foot of the Commission Report will underpin a stable credit union sector into the future.</p></reply>

NAMA advises that in each instance of bankruptcy involving a NAMA debtor it reviews its options and selects the most appropriate method of ensuring the best possible return for the taxpayer.  The Agency advises that, as a secured creditor, it is generally neutral on the locus of bankruptcy proceedings and its experience has been that the location has not tended to prejudice recoveries.  This position is based in part on its positive ongoing engagement with several bankruptcy trustees of debtors who have been adjudged bankrupt in the UK.  The Agency also advises that the bankruptcy regime in the UK is well-established, sophisticated and that bankruptcy trustees under the UK system possess extensive powers to compel production of legal and banking information, on a cross-border basis, from the bankrupt.  These powers have been used in bankruptcy cases involving NAMA debtors to uncover significant undeclared assets.  NAMA further advises that the comparatively shorter duration of bankruptcy in the UK is not a consideration for the Agency as the bankrupt&rsquo;s assets remain in the control of the bankruptcy trustee long after the bankrupt may have been discharged from bankruptcy and any failure to make full disclosure may result in the period of bankruptcy being extended.  NAMA advises that it challenges the release from bankruptcy of any debtor in instances where there is non-cooperation with the bankruptcy trustee.  NAMA also advises that, even when a bankruptcy is discharged, the bankruptcy trustee continues to deal with outstanding debt until as all assets have been realised and the debt, in so far as possible, has been repaid.</p></reply>

Moneylenders have to apply to the Central Bank each year for renewal of their licences.  In addition to the provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, a licensed moneylender must comply with the provisions of the Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders and with the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010.  Licensed moneylenders must comply with the following specific provisions with regard to advertising: Chapter 3 of the Moneylenders Code, Regulation 4 (1) and Regulation 7 of the Regulations, and Part II of the Act.  Compliance with these pieces of legislation is monitored on an ongoing basis through a robust annual licensing process, ongoing supervision, themed inspections, mystery shops, consumer intelligence and complaints from the Financial Services Ombudsman.  Failure to adhere to the provisions may lead to proceedings under our Administrative Sanctions Procedures, which enable us to sanction and to fine regulated entities for breaches of regulatory requirements.</p><p>  Since 1 December 2011, licensed moneylenders are also subject to a new fitness and probity regime.  The ML Code sets out General Principles with which a moneylender must comply.  For example, a moneylender must act honestly and professionally, with due skill, care and diligence in the best interest of consumers.  Chapter 3 of the ML Code places specific requirements on moneylenders in relation to the contents and presentation of advertisements.  The main areas covered by Chapter 3 of the ML Code require moneylenders to ensure advertisements are fair and not misleading, clearly understood, complete and accurate.  The Central Bank deals with regulated entities, including moneylenders, where concerns around the fairness, clarity, accuracy and potential for an advertisement to be construed as misleading in their overall content and presentation and actively follow up on any issues identified.  For example, where key information in relation to a product or service in advertisements is not sufficiently prominent and is included in smaller print to other parts of the advertisement, the Central Bank will address this with the individual entity.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-02a.163.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070200061#WRD01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 236, 245, 246 and 252 together. </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners, which have responsibility for the collection of mineral oil tax, that they are very aware of the threat fuel fraud poses to the Exchequer and to legitimate businesses.  The most serious risk in relation to illicit trade in mineral oil products is from the laundering of markers from diesel that is subject to a reduced rate of mineral oil tax on condition that it is not used in road vehicles.  EU Directive 2003/96/EC, which sets out the requirements for the taxation of energy products and electricity, permits diesel used for certain industrial and commercial purposes to be subjected to a lower rate of energy tax than that applied to auto-diesel.  Those purposes include agricultural, horticultural and piscicultural works and in forestry, in stationary motors and in plant and machinery used in construction, civil engineering and public works.  The Directive provides also that diesel used for certain other purposes, such as sea fisheries and commercial navigation, must be exempted from energy tax.  Where diesel is released for consumption subject to a lower rate of energy tax, or is exempted from that tax, the fuel concerned may not be used as auto-diesel and must be marked, in accordance with EU Directive 95/60/EC on fiscal marking of gas oils and kerosene (and its associated Decisions), to distinguish it from auto-diesel.  The corresponding provisions of Irish law are contained in the Mineral Oil Tax Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 231 of 2012).  Under these regulations, a specified substance and a blue dye must be added to the fuel, resulting in a green coloured marker.</p><p>  This system of marking diesel has been an effective and efficient means of delivering a tax rebate on a product used by a very large number of users across a wide range of uses.  Fuel laundering to remove the marker added to lower-taxed mineral oil for off-road use has been a persistent problem over the years.  However, it remained a marginal activity because the sulphur content of marked fuel was higher than that for road fuel and therefore the sulphur content continued to distinguish laundered fuel from genuine road fuel.  Environmental requirements in relation to the sulphur content of fuel changed from the beginning of 2011, which resulted in marked fuel with the same sulphur content as road fuel coming onto the market.  With this change, fuel laundering became more viable and criminal gangs intensified their laundering and distribution activities dramatically from the first half of 2011.  In response, Revenue has made action against fuel laundering one of its priorities and is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem through enhanced supply chain controls, the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker and continued robust enforcement action.</p><p>  This strategy included strengthening the licensing conditions for auto-fuel traders in 2011 and the introduction of a new licensing system for marked fuel traders in October 2012.  In addition, since January 2013, all licensed fuel traders are required to make electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions each month.  These supply chain control measures are designed to make it difficult for fuel criminals to source marked fuel for laundering and to get laundered product onto the market.  Analysis of the monthly returns of fuel trading will enable Revenue to identify suspicious or anomalous fuel transactions and patterns of distribution.  Analysis of the first few months of returns data is well advanced.  Traders found to be involved in suspicious activity will be investigated and if they are unable to account properly for the source or disposal of product, they will face revocation of their licence, tax assessment and prosecution where appropriate.  In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs in the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding in May 2012 on a joint approach to finding a more effective marker for use in both jurisdictions.  A number of proposals for a new marker submitted in response to an Invitation to Make Submissions are being evaluated.  The outcome of this process is expected later this year.  Revenue, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the Border, continues to intensify enforcement action against fuel fraud and this work has yielded significant results to date.  In the past two years 97 filling stations throughout the State were closed for breaches of licensing conditions.  Since the beginning of 2010, over 2.8 million litres of fuel have been seized and 29 oil laundries detected and closed down, including five oil laundries in 2013 to date.</p><p>  While there have been a number of calls for the replacement of the current marking scheme with a rebate scheme, a change of this nature would impact on a wide range of users, would be costly to implement and would, itself, be at risk from fraud.  Marked gas oil has a variety of uses including the propulsion of trains, the operation of agricultural, construction and industrial machinery, commercial sea-navigation (including fishing) and commercial and home heating purposes.  A change to a rebate system for all users would involve the establishment of an expensive repayments system and place a new administrative burden on oil traders, users and the Revenue Commissioners.  It would also impose significant cashflow costs for those currently using marked gas oil.  Also, repayment schemes are vulnerable to abuse and the introduction of a wide-ranging scheme such as that proposed would not necessarily offer greater security against fraud than the current arrangements.  </p><p>  It has been suggested recently that huge savings could be made by moving from the current system of marking rebated fuel to one based on making repayments to those users that currently use marked fuel.  This seems to be based on the erroneous view that adding the prescribed markers to rebated fuel is exceptionally costly and is borne by the Exchequer.  This is not the case; the cost of the markers is negligible and is borne by the industry.  The cost to the Exchequer of marked fuel is the tax foregone and an alternative system based on direct repayments to users would not produce any savings for the Exchequer and might be more costly if the incidence of fraud were greater.  If the fuel for off-road use was not marked under the new system, it could be diverted easily to road use; if it was marked it could be laundered as at present.  It would also be the case that marked fuel from Northern Ireland would continue to be available and could be laundered by fuel criminals based in Border areas.</p><p>  For these reasons, I am not proposing any change to the existing scheme.  I strongly support the current strategy bring implemented by Revenue and am confident that it will succeed with the co-operation and support of the legitimate trade.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the industry has worked very closely with them in developing and implementing their strategy.  Revenue regularly reminds motorists and the public generally that, in addition to its impact on the Exchequer and legitimate trade, they should be aware of the risks posed to their vehicles by using laundered fuel and the fact that sourcing fuel in this way is funding criminal activity.  The legitimate retail trade can also contribute to closing down this illegitimate trade by providing information on the outlets that are selling laundered diesel.  Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group (HEMG) and has established regional sub-groups of the HEMG to facilitate the reporting of information by traders through their representative associations.  Retailers who suspect or have evidence that laundered diesel is being sold in their area should report this through their representative associations to the Revenue.  Such reports are treated as confidential and are fully investigated by Revenue.</p></reply>

I have advised the House on a number of occasions that our European partners expressed strong reservations about burden sharing with senior bondholders and the rationale for this position. This commitment was agreed with our external partners and was the basis on which Ireland&rsquo;s financing strategy was built.  However, the Deputy will also be  aware that under the Irish Presidency significant progress in dealing with Ireland&rsquo;s banking debt has been made. In February the successful conclusion of negotiations with the ECB facilitated the replacement by the Irish Government of the Promissory Notes issued to IBRC with a series of longer term, non-amortising floating rate Government bonds. This has resulted in significant benefits to the State including spreading the cost of the Promissory Notes from a weighted average life of c.7-8 years to c.34-35 years at a lower funding cost for the State, resulting in significant annual interest savings.</p><p>  The Government has also successfully negotiated a further extension of the maturities of our EU loan facilities. Recently the EU Finance Ministers agreed in principle to further extend the maximum weighted average maturities on our EFSF and EFSM loans by up to 7 years, over and above the extension agreed in 2011. This further maturity extension removes a re-financing requirement of some &euro;20 billion for the Irish state in the years 2015 to 2022.   This extension of maturities has a number of significant benefits for Ireland, including smoothing our redemption profile, improving our long term debt sustainability and it has a positive impact on the cost of Exchequer borrowing through creating further downward pressure on our borrowing costs.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that under the Irish Presidency the European Union finance ministers agreed a deal on new rules that will force investors and wealthy savers to share the costs of future bank failures.The plan stipulates that shareholders, bondholders and certain depositors with more than &euro;100,000 should share the burden of saving a bank, instead of a taxpayer-funded bailout.</p><p>  These new rules will likely come into force by the end of the year and mark a revolutionary change in the way banks are treated and it is a major milestone in our effort to break the vicious link between the banks and the sovereign.</p><p>  Finally, on the 20th June 2013 the Eurogroup of Euro-area Finance Ministers agreed the framework under which the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) will operate its direct bank recapitalisation instrument. It is expected that this facility will come into force towards the end of the first half of 2014. In addition the Eurogroup also agreed to include retro-active recapitalisation of banks in the framework, to be considered on a case-by-case basis once the instrument enters into force. </p><p>There is still a lot of negotiation to be done on this aspect of the facility but the agreement now in place keeps the possibility to apply to the ESM for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks open for us, should we wish to avail of it.</p></reply>

I am further advised that these products have a structured deposit element which is covered by the Deposit Guarantee Scheme for that element of the product. As a result the first &euro;100k of any claim from these depositors is covered under the DGS Scheme. I have been advised that the Special Liquidators are aware of a number of depositors who fall outside the eligibility criteria for the ELG Scheme due to the nature of the investment product. Unfortunately, if a deposit is not eligible under the ELG scheme the depositor will rank as an unsecured creditor in the liquidation. At the time that this investment product was purchased by Credit Unions, there was no additional guarantee provided by the State.  It was always the case that the ELG scheme covered only those liabilities which were entered into during the issuance window.</p></reply>

All of the economic policies being implemented by the Government - restoring order to the public finances, repairing the banking system, promoting competitiveness improvements - are designed to generate sustainable economic growth, so that employment growth is sufficient to make inroads into current unacceptably high rates of unemployment.  I would point out that progress is being made.  For instance, employment has been expanding since the third quarter of last year, and the unemployment rate in May - at 13.7 per cent - was lower than the peak of 15.1 per cent recorded early last year.  Having said that, I fully recognise that there is a long way to go and that much more needs to be done.</p><p>  I am also conscious of the disproportionate impact that the crisis has had on the young, and in particular the rise in youth unemployment, both in Ireland and elsewhere in the European Union.  This is why the European Council last week agreed on a comprehensive approach to combat youth unemployment and identified a number of measures to be implemented, including launching a new 'investment plan' to support SMEs and boost the financing of the economy.</p><p>  Finally, I would like to emphasise the <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2013</i> which set out over 333 actions to be undertaken in the coming year to support job creation and complement measures already undertaken in the <i>Jobs Initiative</i> and the <i>Pathways to Work</i>.</p></reply>

The Euro-Area Heads of State or Government confirmed this position and mandated EU Finance Ministers to prepare an operational framework by mid-2013.  A considerable amount of work has been undertaken at technical, senior official and Ministerial level on the ESM&rsquo;s Direct Bank Recapitalisation Instrument. This work culminated in agreement on the main features of the operational framework for the ESM&rsquo;s Direct Bank Recapitalisation (DBR) Instrument at the June 20th Eurogroup meeting of Euro-Area Finance Ministers in Luxembourg.</p><p>  We have succeeded in having specific provision for retrospective recapitalisation included in the framework, which states that &ldquo;The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.&rdquo;  There is still a lot of negotiation to be done on this aspect of the facility but the agreement now in place keeps the possibility to apply to the ESM for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks open for us, should we wish to avail of it. </p><p>  This overall framework builds upon the agreement secured on the 29th of June 2012, and is an important step in the Eurozone&rsquo;s efforts in this regard. It is expected that the earliest date that the ESM Direct Bank Recapitalisation Instrument can come into effect will be towards the end of the first half of 2014, given the need to satisfy national procedures, and also the requirement to have the Single Supervisory Mechanism in place and operational beforehand.</p></reply>

Trilogue discussions (Council/Parliament/Commission) will commence next week under the Lithuanian Presidency and are expected to conclude by the end of this year.

There is a shared ambition amongst Member States and MEPs to progress these negotiations and the urgency of bringing these talks to a conclusion has been highlighted many times by the European Council.</p><p>  To complete the Banking Union, the Commission will bring forward a proposal in the summer for a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) for banks covered by the Single Supervisory Mechanism.

This is expected around mid-2014.</p><p>  Consequently, the Irish authorities, in consultation with the troika, will this year conduct a series of diagnostics to provide greater clarity regarding the underlying quality of banks' balance sheets.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-02a.216.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070200062#WRE03500"><p>As I have previously stated, Ireland's position is that a Financial Transactions Tax (FTT) would be best applied on a wide international basis to include the major financial centres.  If it cannot be introduced on a global basis, it would be better if it were introduced on at least an EU-wide basis to prevent any distortion of activity within the Union. This is in line with the Commission's desire that the tax should be applied on a global basis. Such an approach would avoid the danger of activities gravitating to jurisdictions where taxes are not levied on financial transactions.  The FTT that is currently being discussed at EU level is not an EU-wide FTT - 11 Member States are considering adopting an FTT by way of enhanced cooperation.  Therefore our position has not changed.  I have also previously indicated Ireland's principled opposition to dealing with tax measures under &#8220;enhanced co-operation&#8221;.</p><p>  An FTT could impact the financial services industry, especially in the IFSC, and lead to some activities moving abroad, particularly if it was not introduced on an EU wide basis.</p><p>  An FTT could affect transactions in Irish Government bonds, including in the secondary market, and may also affect the ECB's ability to give effect to its own monetary policy via the repurchase (&#8220;repo&#8221;) market.  A significant number of countries have also raised this point in respect of their own debt management. Members of the Economic and Financial Committee Sub-Committee on EU Sovereign Debt Markets have recently stated that the introduction of the FTT would have a significantly negative effect on Sovereign Debt Markets and may impair the good-functioning of secondary markets for sovereign debt resulting in reduced liquidity, reduced investor demand and therefore higher financing costs for States. The European Investment Bank (EIB) has also expressed concerns and has suggested that serious consideration be given to the general <font color="#3C613E">exemption</font> of all transactions on sovereign bonds, EIB bonds and bonds issued by Multilateral Development Banks from the scope of the FTT.</p><p>  We are also concerned that the Commission's own projections are that an FTT could reduce EU growth and raise the cost to ordinary, non-financial companies for their use of financial products. Both these aspects would be harmful to EU recovery.</p><p>  If Ireland were to participate in the FTT it would require us to abolish our current tax on financial transactions, a Stamp Duty on transfers of shares in Irish incorporated companies, which currently stands at 1%.</p><p>  One of the Commission's aims in introducing an FTT was to ensure that the financial sector makes a fair contribution to the cost of the crisis.  Ireland is committed to the principle that the banks will contribute to the cost of State's support - the banks have been charged for the Government's guarantee of their liabilities and the NAMA Act provides for a surcharge on the banks should NAMA result in a loss for the taxpayer.  The Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 provides for the introduction of such a levy on authorised credit institutions, to be paid into a bank resolution fund.</p><p>  The draft Proposal for a Council Directive implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of financial transaction tax is currently being discussed in the relevant Council working group.  As the Deputy is aware, Ireland held the Presidency of the EU from January to June 2013 and during our Presidency we aimed to progress this file as transparently and inclusively as possible.  The first read-through of the draft directive is not yet complete, further amendments to the text are likely and it is unclear what the final form of the Directive will be.</p><p>  As of 1 July, Lithuania has assumed the Presidency of the EU.  Ireland intends to fully contribute to future Working Party meetings. We will continue to monitor discussions on the FTT to ensure the compatibility of any proposed measure with the internal market and with existing taxes on financial transactions, including our Stamp Duty; and with a view to protecting our existing financial services business.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that the UK has challenged the legality of the decision of 22 January 2013 of the Council to authorise enhanced cooperation on a common framework of FTT and the scope and objectives of the initial Commission proposal.</p></reply>

However, the OECD has consistently stated that low corporation tax rates combined with a broad base is the best way to encourage economic growth while still maintaining tax revenues. That is what we have being doing for many years and what we will continue to do.  A reform of the Northern Ireland corporation tax rate and base has the potential to generate benefits in that part of the island, as well as on this side of the Border. Some commentators might see it as a case of Northern Ireland entering into direct competition with us on corporation tax, but I do not see it that way &ndash; I see it as having the potential to benefit both sides of the Border thereby providing an impetus for the island as a whole.</p><p>  Of course there is strong evidence that a low corporation tax rate on its own will not be enough to attract significant FDI and we have consistently demonstrated that Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness for foreign multinational corporations is based on a whole range of factors &ndash; one of which happens to be our 12.5% tax rate.</p></reply>

This EU Regulation, which is directly applicable in all Member States, entered into force on 16 August 2012.</p><p>  In particular, the Council text of MiFID II contains important provisions relating to position management, position limits and product intervention.  These provisions are in respect of all financial instruments, including commodity derivatives, and have the purpose of providing regulators with tools to avoid excessive speculation in financial instruments, including commodity derivatives.  Competent authorities will be obligated to establish and apply position limits on the size of a position in a commodity derivative which a person can have over a specified period of time. </p><p>  Furthermore, competent authorities will have product intervention powers whereby they may prohibit or restrict trading of financial instruments or prohibit or restrict investment activities when there is a threat to the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or commodity markets.  The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will have contingency and coordination powers in position management and product intervention to ensure consistent application across all Member States.  In the exercise of its powers, ESMA will also have to consult public bodies competent for the oversight, administration and regulation of physical agricultural markets. </p><p>  EMIR and MiFID II combined are expected to result in a tighter regime for all derivatives, including food securities, whether traded OTC or through exchanges.  The measures are intended to keep pace with trends in derivatives trading, in line with G20 commitments made at the 2009 Pittsburgh summit.</p><p>  Council General Approach will be progressed further by the Lithuanian Presidency when they begin negotiations with the European Parliament at Trilogues.</p><p>  We will continue to monitor developments on this file throughout the legislative process. </p></reply>

At its results briefing last March, Bank of Ireland indicated that it was considering a range of options relating to its preference shares.  I can confirm to the Deputy that officials in the Department of Finance, as part of their regular interaction with Bank of Ireland management, have discussed options regarding the State&rsquo;s current holding of &euro;1.8bn of preference shares. Should an opportunity arise to sell the shares or have them redeemed, the transaction will be considered having assessed the best interests of the State. </p><p>  As regards AIB, I remain very supportive of the bank&rsquo;s efforts to return itself to profitability and ultimately generate an exit for the taxpayer.  Getting the bank back to profitability as quickly as possible is the best way to achieve this goal and indeed support our economic recovery.</p></reply>

The Euro-area Heads of State and Government confirmed this position and mandated EU Finance Ministers to prepare an operational framework by mid-2013.  A considerable amount of work has been undertaken at technical, senior official and Ministerial level on the ESM&rsquo;s Direct Bank Recapitalisation (DBR) Instrument during the Irish Presidency.  This work culminated in agreement on the operational framework for the ESM&rsquo;s Direct Bank Recapitalisation Instrument at the June 20th Eurogroup of Euro-area Finance Ministers meeting in Luxembourg.</p><p>  This framework builds upon the agreement secured on the 29th of June 2012, and is an important step in the Eurozone&rsquo;s efforts to restore market confidence in the single currency and its banking system.</p><p>  It is expected that the earliest date that the ESM DBR can come into effect will be towards the end of the first half of 2014, given the need to satisfy national procedures, and also the requirement to have the Single Supervisory Mechanism in place beforehand.</p><p>  We have succeeded in having provision for retrospective recapitalisation included in the framework.  Although there is still a lot of negotiation to be done on this aspect of the facility I am satisfied with the progress made during the Irish Presidency as the agreement now in place keeps open the possibility for us to apply to the ESM for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it.</p></reply>

Real progress was made during the Irish Presidency in setting down the first real steps to a European Banking union with the agreement on the creation of a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) - a very significant step forward towards ensuring financial stability and thus facilitating growth. </p><p>  We have also achieved agreement on the Capital Requirements Directive IV, (CRDIV) which aims to strengthen the capital requirements for banks and the overall effectiveness of regulation for the sector and enhance financial stability.</p><p>  On 26 June 2013 EU finance Ministers agreed a common position on the proposal for a harmonized bank recovery and resolution regime.  This agreement will now allow negotiations to start with the European Parliament on the file and also on the related Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive. Furthermore, the Eurogroup has agreed on the main features of the operational framework for direct bank recapitalisation by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).</p><p>  These achievements represent significant milestones towards Banking Union.  The June 2013 European Council meeting concluded that the completion of the Banking Union is key to ensuring financial stability, reducing financial fragmentation and restoring normal lending to the economy.</p><p>  To complete the Banking Union, the Commission will bring forward a proposal in the summer for a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) for banks covered by the SSM.  We look forward to further progress under the incoming Lithuanian Presidency to reach agreement in the Council by the end of the year so that all elements of the banking union can be agreed by the end of the current parliamentary term of the European Parliament, as called for by the European Council.</p></reply>

The Association provides a forum for regular and formal discussions between Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas on issues of mutual interest and concern.  The Association will meet twice yearly on a rotational basis. </p><p>  Another important commitment under the Good Friday Agreement was realised in October 2012 with Digital Switchover on the island of Ireland on 24 October 2012, when TG4 and Radio na Gaeltachta became available in Northern Ireland. </p><p>  A Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland which takes account of the separate and specific context of Northern Ireland is an important outstanding provision of the Good Friday Agreement.  I believe that all parties in the Oireachtas share my frustration at the lack of progress on a Bill of Rights and I continue to engage actively with the British government and the Northern Ireland Executive on this issue.  Some of the contentious issues around parades, flags and identities have at their heart rights issues and a Bill of Rights is the key to dissolving the obstacles to progress on these issues.</p><p>  Recent events have recalled the positive role that civil society continues to play in Northern Ireland and points to the valuable role that could be played by the Civic Forum envisaged by the Agreement and I will continue to encourage its development.</p><p>  The first Term of Reference of the St Andrews Agreement Review which called for an examination of the efficiency and value for money of Implementation Bodies has essentially been completed.  The Second and Third Terms of Reference of the Review look to the future of North South co-operation.  This has not progressed as rapidly as I would have wished and was a subject of discussion when I met with the First and Deputy First Minister on 29 April.  I hope that we will be in a position to make substantial progress at the next North South Ministerial (NSMC) Plenary meeting on 5 July.</p><p>  While the North South Consultative Forum is still outstanding, it continues to be raised at NSMC Plenary meetings and will be considered further with our Northern colleagues. </p><p>  The Government will continue to encourage progress on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement, particularly during my ongoing schedule of close contact with the Secretary of State, and with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.</p>Insert Question Heading |  Quick Edit ^^ Money Laundering ^^ Snippet Ref No: WRFFF00400 ...

I can confirm to the Deputy that officials in the Department of Finance, as part of their regular interaction with Bank of Ireland management, have discussed options regarding the State&rsquo;s current holding of &euro;1.8bn of preference shares. Should an opportunity arise to sell the shares or have them redeemed, the transaction will be considered having assessed the best interests of the State.    As regards AIB, I remain very supportive of the bank&rsquo;s efforts to return itself to profitability and ultimately generate an exit for the taxpayer.  Getting the bank back to profitability as quickly as possible is the best way to achieve this goal and indeed support our economic recovery. Snippet Ref No: WRFFF00750 ...

Edit Snippet   |   Insert Snippet  |  Delete Snippet  |  Insert Question Heading  | Quick Edit    Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan): As you are aware the Euro-area Heads of State and Government agreed on 29th June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns, and that when a Single Supervisory Mechanism is in place involving the ECB, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) could recapitalise banks directly.  The Euro-area Heads of State and Government confirmed this position and mandated EU Finance Ministers to prepare an operational framework by mid-2013.  A considerable amount of work has been undertaken at technical, senior official and Ministerial level on the ESM&rsquo;s Direct Bank Recapitalisation (DBR) Instrument during the Irish Presidency.  This work culminated in agreement on the operational framework for the ESM&rsquo;s Direct Bank Recapitalisation Instrument at the June 20th Eurogroup of Euro-area Finance Ministers meeting in Luxembourg.   This framework builds upon the agreement secured on the 29th of June 2012, and is an important step in the Eurozone&rsquo;s efforts to restore market confidence in the single currency and its banking system.   It is expected that the earliest date that the ESM DBR can come into effect will be towards the end of the first half of 2014, given the need to satisfy national procedures, and also the requirement to have the Single Supervisory Mechanism in place beforehand.   We have succeeded in having provision for retrospective recapitalisation included in the framework.  Although there is still a lot of negotiation to be done on this aspect of the facility I am satisfied with the progress made during the Irish Presidency as the agreement now in place keeps open the possibility for us to apply to the ESM for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it.

Edit Snippet   |   Insert Snippet  |  Delete Snippet  |  Insert Question Heading  | Quick Edit    Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan): When Ireland assumed the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in January the highest priority was afforded to the completion of the Banking Union, with the aim of breaking the link between banks and sovereigns which had been unanimously agreed by European leaders on 29 June 2012.  Real progress was made during the Irish Presidency in setting down the first real steps to a European Banking union with the agreement on the creation of a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) - a very significant step forward towards ensuring financial stability and thus facilitating growth.    We have also achieved agreement on the Capital Requirements Directive IV, (CRDIV) which aims to strengthen the capital requirements for banks and the overall effectiveness of regulation for the sector and enhance financial stability.   On 26 June 2013 EU finance Ministers agreed a common position on the proposal for a harmonized bank recovery and resolution regime.  This agreement will now allow negotiations to start with the European Parliament on the file and also on the related Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive. Furthermore, the Eurogroup has agreed on the main features of the operational framework for direct bank recapitalisation by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).   These achievements represent significant milestones towards Banking Union.  The June 2013 European Council meeting concluded that the completion of the Banking Union is key to ensuring financial stability, reducing financial fragmentation and restoring normal lending to the economy.   To complete the Banking Union, the Commission will bring forward a proposal in the summer for a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) for banks covered by the SSM.  We look forward to further progress under the incoming Lithuanian Presidency to reach agreement in the Council by the end of the year so that all elements of the banking union can be agreed by the end of the current parliamentary term of the European Parliament, as called for by the European Council.

Recruitment to the Civil Service is governed by the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004 and by the Civil Service Regulation Acts, 1956-2005.  The 2004 Act established the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA) and the Public Appointments Service (PAS).  The CPSA is the regulator of public service recruitment in Ireland and the PAS provides a centralised recruitment, assessment and selection body for the Civil Service.   The CPSA has developed Codes of Practice to apply to open recruitment and internal promotion competitions.  The Codes cover the areas of probity, selection on the basis of merit, equity and fairness, protection of the public interest, implementation of best practice and good governance.  Selection processes must focus on the competencies required for a post and there is no provision under the Codes to focus recruitment for posts in the Civil Service on the basis of age.  All eligible candidates must be considered on an equal basis. Snippet Ref No: WRFFF02200 ... Edit Snippet   |   Insert Snippet  |  Delete Snippet  |  Insert Question Heading  | Quick Edit   146.

There is no formal requirement on the devolved institutions to report to the Irish and British Governments on the implementation of the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements.   Some provisions of the Good Friday and St. Andrews agreements such as a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, an Irish Language Act and an examination of the future of North South economic cooperation have not yet been implemented but nevertheless there has been good progress on the implementation of the Agreements in recent years.   The North South Inter-Parliamentary Association &ndash; as provided for in the Agreement - met for the second time in Plenary at Stormont last month.  The Association provides a forum for regular and formal discussions between Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas on issues of mutual interest and concern.  The Association will meet twice yearly on a rotational basis.    Another important commitment under the Good Friday Agreement was realised in October 2012 with Digital Switchover on the island of Ireland on 24 October 2012, when TG4 and Radio na Gaeltachta became available in Northern Ireland.    A Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland which takes account of the separate and specific context of Northern Ireland is an important outstanding provision of the Good Friday Agreement.  I believe that all parties in the Oireachtas share my frustration at the lack of progress on a Bill of Rights and I continue to engage actively with the British government and the Northern Ireland Executive on this issue.  Some of the contentious issues around parades, flags and identities have at their heart rights issues and a Bill of Rights is the key to dissolving the obstacles to progress on these issues.   Recent events have recalled the positive role that civil society continues to play in Northern Ireland and points to the valuable role that could be played by the Civic Forum envisaged by the Agreement and I will continue to encourage its development.   The first Term of Reference of the St Andrews Agreement Review which called for an examination of the efficiency and value for money of Implementation Bodies has essentially been completed.  The Second and Third Terms of Reference of the Review look to the future of North South co-operation.  This has not progressed as rapidly as I would have wished and was a subject of discussion when I met with the First and Deputy First Minister on 29 April.  I hope that we will be in a position to make substantial progress at the next North South Ministerial (NSMC) Plenary meeting on 5 July.   While the North South Consultative Forum is still outstanding, it continues to be raised at NSMC Plenary meetings and will be considered further with our Northern colleagues.    The Government will continue to encourage progress on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement, particularly during my ongoing schedule of close contact with the Secretary of State, and with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.

There have been allegations that the detainees have been kept mostly in solitary detention, denied access to their relatives and lawyers and subjected to torture and other ill-treatment.

The action of Russia, Iran and other parties in arming and assisting the Assad regime is wrong and should cease immediately.In the face of relentless violence, the EU adopted wide-ranging sanctions against Syria.   These included, until last month, a ban on the export of weapons to Syria as part of an effort to stop the fighting and to promote a process of dialogue between the authorities and the opposition. I remain firmly of the view that the provision of weapons to Syrian opposition groups, however well-intentioned, runs the risk of exacerbating an already heavily militarized conflict and fuelling further instability and violence in the wider region.  </p><p>Instead of adding to the stock of weaponry in Syria, I would like to see a global arms embargo imposed through a UN Security Council resolution which would cut off all weapon flows to Syria.   Believing that this would be the best means of getting the regime and the opposition to focus on political dialogue rather than on military action, Ireland and many of its international partners have called for a global arms embargo.    Regrettably, it has not been possible to achieve this because of lack of agreement within the Security Council.</p><p>The bloody and destructive conflict rages on, accordingly.  The continuing supply of heavy weapons to the Syrian Government, which has used them to inflict massive damage on built-up areas, has been especially damaging.   At the same time, there has been no decisive alteration in the balance of forces on the ground.    The prolonged stalemate we are witnessing in Syria only reinforces my view that there can be no military solution to this crisis. </p><p>I believe that the supply of weapons to the warring parties can only lead to further destruction and casualties and runs the risk of launching an arms race, with potentially devastating consequences for the stability of the wider region.  I fear also that the supply of arms to Syria severely undermines the diplomatic efforts which are underway to promote a political settlement to the conflict, such as the US-Russia proposal to convene an international peace conference on Syria (Geneva II).</p><p>At the EU Foreign Affairs Council meetings on 27 May and 24 June, both of which I attended, it was clear that there is broad agreement among the 27 member States to lend full and active support to the Geneva II initiative.   This initiative was also strongly endorsed by the G8 leaders meeting in Enniskillen on 17/18 June.</p><p>Promoting a power-sharing agreement between Syrian authorities and the opposition is clearly the only way to end the violence and to respond to the legitimate aspirations of so many Syrians for peace and democracy. Ireland and its EU partners will continue to work hard to achieve these vital objectives.</p></reply>

As the number of fatalities moves towards 100,000, there are now close to 7 million people who are in need of immediate life saving support. In addition to more than 4 million people who are displaced within Syria, there are currently 1.7 million Syrians who have fled the violence to take refuge in neighbouring countries. Estimates suggest that the total number of refugees could be as high as 3.5 million by the end of the year.  To date Ireland has provided almost &euro;10m to support the delivery of life saving supplies to those most affected by the crisis. This includes Ireland's pledge of &euro;4.7 million made at the Kuwait Pledging Conference for Syria in January, which was met in full. This significant support marks us out as one of the most generous contributors in the world to the humanitarian response on a <i>per capita</i>   basis. This funding has supported the provision of water, food, shelter and vital medicines to IDPs and host families within Syria and also to refugees in neighbouring countries, particularly Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon. </p><p>  Humanitarian access has been a huge challenge for those delivering assistance inside Syria. Restrictions imposed by the Assad regime, combined with logistical constraints and increasing insecurity have made it very difficult to access vulnerable populations. Until recently this meant that donors such as Ireland focused their funding to key UN partners and the Red Cross/Red Crescent - agencies based in Damascus which had negotiated certain levels of access with the Syrian regime and were capable of delivering assistance to large numbers of beneficiaries. These agencies also play the key role in supporting the host governments in neighbouring countries to provide assistance to the refugee populations. </p><p>  By early 2013 UN agencies were reaching 2 million people in Syria every month, however the needs were escalating rapidly and serious gaps remained. The UN recognised that innovative and alternative forms of aid delivery, including cross-border operations were necessary to get aid into the hard-to-reach areas. NGOs have more flexible operational systems and they now key to reaching vulnerable populations in specific areas of the country. The increasing refugee caseload has also meant that NGOs now have a more defined role in refugee camps and host communities in neighbouring countries. Ireland's funding to our NGO partners will enable the delivery of assistance in the hard to reach areas of north and north-west Syria from an operational base in Turkey. The support for our NGO partner in Lebanon and Jordan will ensure that refugees awaiting registration in the refugee camps and informal settlements receive desperately needed assistance. </p><p>  We have worked closely with all the agencies that receive Irish Aid support to ensure that the necessary systems are place to monitor and evaluate the use and impact of Ireland's assistance. Ireland also insists that our partners adhere to best practice in humanitarianism including promoting accountability, efficiency and effectiveness in implementing humanitarian action. Equally, we are committed to the full implementation of the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid, which clearly articulates the EU and its Member States' commitment to uphold and promote the fundamental humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. </p></reply>

I am gratified that the international donor community has now become more aware of the importance of agriculture and agricultural research in enhancing rural livelihoods and reducing poverty. Given the huge contribution that agricultural research makes in reducing poverty and hunger, we have committed to continuing this strong support in our new Policy for International Development, '<i>One World, One Future', </i>which I launched in May.<i></i></p><p>  Irish Aid supports agricultural research in developing countries in a number of ways. We provide funding for the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research - CGIAR, including support to research programmes on Agriculture and Nutrition, and on Agriculture and Climate Change. I have seen the difference this kind of operational research is making.  In Malawi, Mozambique and Ethiopia, the introduction of the nutritious orange fleshed sweet potato is improving the diversity and nutritional value of crops produced by small holder farmers in a sustainable manner. Through our Programme of Strategic Co-operation, Irish Aid will continue to work with a variety of Irish research institutions such as Teagasc and our Universities, and with our civil society partners, to support innovative research which can support pro-poor development. </p><p>  We will also continue to support the sharing of agricultural research with farmers, through national agricultural research and extension services, and through organisations that work directly with smallholder farmers to support their uptake of new agricultural inputs and technologies. Some examples include organisations that share research on plant diseases through village-level plant 'clinics', and on new farming practices through local radio programmes. </p><p>  Supporting smallholder farmers to access markets is an important priority for Irish Aid.  We support a number of important market-access programmes in our key partner countries, such as smallholder farmer-led enterprises in pigeon-pea and potatoes in Malawi, enhancing market opportunities for smallholder farmers in the cashew and pineapple sector in Mozambique, and supporting smallholder farmers to improve cocoa quality and market access in Tanzania. We also support smallholder farmer associations and groups in Malawi, Tanzania and Ethiopia, recognising that this is an important element of building farmers' capacity to improve their productivity and access to markets.</p></reply>

Through Ireland's development assistance programme, managed by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, we place a strong emphasis on building community resilience, reducing disaster risk and addressing climate change challenges in programmes in our key partner countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.   At international level, we provide funding and support to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction as part of our commitment to the Hyogo Framework for Action, which provides the global blueprint for disaster risk reduction efforts. We also provide strategic support for the work of a number of leading global environment and development agencies, such as the World Resources Institute and the International Institute for Environment and Development. </p><p>  In 2009, the international leaders made a global commitment to provide US$30 billion for climate actions in developing countries between 2010 and 2012. I am pleased to confirm that Ireland has fully met its commitment to provide &euro;100 million in assistance under this global three-year commitment. </p><p>  Addressing the links between hunger, malnutrition and climate change was a central development priority for Ireland's EU Presidency in the first half of 2013. Working in cooperation with Mary Robinson, the Government hosted a high level international conference in Dublin in April to focus on these interlinked challenges. This seminal event allowed us to hear the experience of local people from developing countries where climate change is having a direct impact on the poorest communities. One of the key messages from this conference is that we must take a truly integrated approach if we are to achieve sustainable development in a changing climate.  </p><p>  During Ireland's EU Presidency, we also helped to strengthen EU action on building the resilience of vulnerable communities in developing countries. </p><p>  Looking ahead, it is important that the issues of climate change and development have been set as a key priority area for action in the Government's  new Policy for International Development, '<i>One World, One Future</i>' which I launched in May. This policy commitment will assist us in our efforts to ensure that the world's poorest communities can develop in a way that is resource-efficient, climate resilient and therefore sustainable.</p></reply>

The excessive use of force by police is deeply regrettable and should be investigated immediately. I would call on the government to fully engage with the protestors on their legitimate concerns, and I would urge calm and restraint on all sides. As also outlined previously, my Department is aware of one Irish citizen who was directly affected by the demonstrations. He was unhurt and given consular assistance by the Irish Embassy in Ankara. I do not intend to comment further on this case. We will provide similar assistance in any other cases which may arise.As outlined in my reply of 11 June, my Department acted as soon as the demonstrations started, heightening the warning in its travel advisory, urging Irish citizens to avoid demonstrations and alerting them to the cities and areas affected.

These demonstrations began earlier this month as a protest at a rise in bus fares.  Demonstrations have since spread to cities across the country and have become an expression of broader discontent on a range of issues. Grievances are reported to include the quality of public services, corruption and the cost of public spending on preparations for the 2014 World Cup.     While most of the public gatherings have been peaceful in nature, there have been regrettable incidents of violence.  There are also reports of vandalism and of looting carried out by fringe elements taking advantage of the situation.  </p><p>  The grievances raised by demonstrators highlight complex issues that require work over time.  Brazil is a country that has been enjoying strong economic growth and positive social development since its return to democracy a little over 25 years ago.  Notably, Brazil has developed and delivered policies that have lifted an estimated 40 million people from poverty.  The demonstrations of recent weeks have highlighted issues which many citizens now wish to see addressed by their authorities.</p><p>  The Government of Brazil has expressed willingness for dialogue on these issues while, at the same time, making clear the need for violence and vandalism to cease.  Brazil&rsquo;s President Rousseff met last week with representatives of those protesting on public transport issues.  She also met with Governors and Mayors from across Brazil to discuss the range of issues raised by the protestors.  The President has since announced an increase in funding for key public services, and has also proposed consultations on political reforms. </p><p>  The Ambassador in Brazil and his colleagues continue to monitor the situation carefully.  I am informed that no Irish citizens have sought consular assistance as a result of the current unrest in Brazil. From the outset of these demonstrations, the Embassy has been seized of the need to keep Irish citizens informed of developments and, to this end, it has liaised with EU and other Embassies in Bras&iacute;lia, many of which have consulates and networks of citizens across the country, to ensure the widest possible flow of information. The Embassy has also been in touch with many of the Irish citizens resident in Brazil and has also continued to update the travel advisory on my Department&rsquo;s website. We continue to strongly suggest that all Irish citizens monitor the local and national news for up to date information and that they avoid demonstration locations so far as is possible.  Our Embassy in Brasilia and the Consular Assistance section in Dublin stand ready to provide consular assistance to any Irish citizens who may require it.</p></reply>

The Central Bank's review included a public consultation process, with in excess of 230 submissions received. The revised CCMA was published on 27 June 2013 and came into effect yesterday, 1 July 2013. The submissions made, as well as feedback document outlining the Central Bank's response to some of the main issues raised, are available on the Central Bank's website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.centralbank.ie</font></i>.  The revised Code provides a framework which complements the work of the Central Bank which has for some time been intensively working with lenders to ensure that they have a range of longer term options, such as 'trade-down mortgages', 'split mortgages' and 'sale by agreement' or other appropriate options as may be developed by lenders for their customers with distressed mortgages<b>.  </b>  The CCMA provides an integrated and cohesive package of consumer protection measures for borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears.  It reflects the current mortgage arrears situation and seeks to deliver on the following principles, to:</p><p>- ensure appropriate resolution of each borrower's arrears situation;</p><p>- ensure that lenders deal with borrowers in a fair and transparent manner;</p><p>- support and facilitate meaningful engagement between lenders and borrowers; and</p><p>- ensure borrower awareness of the benefits of co-operating with their lender, and the consequences of not co-operating. </p><p>  With regard to restructuring of mortgage loans, the CCMA requires lenders to explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements offered by that lender for each particular case.</p><p>In addition, where an alternative repayment arrangement is offered by a lender, the revised CCMA requires the lender to outline the reasons why the alternative arrangement offered is considered to be appropriate and sustainable, as well as the advantages and any disadvantages or potential disadvantages of any arrangement offered, with regard to the individual circumstances of the borrower.</p></reply>

Deposits held by pension funds and retirement funds fall within the category of excluded deposits, though small self-administered pension schemes are included. The decision to include SSAPs and exclude ARFs, AMRFs and other pension funds/instruments was based on the fact that SSAPs are usually small schemes administered by the member(s) of the scheme whilst ARFs are managed by a qualified fund manager through a credit or investment institution.</p><p>  There are currently no plans to alter the terms of the Deposit Guarantee Scheme.</p><p>If customers are concerned about the coverage for their pension fund they can contact either my Department in respect of queries on the ELG Scheme or the Central Bank with queries about the DGS Scheme.</p></reply>

For example, the customer sets the date of payment of a standing order.  Where there are insufficient funds on the date payment is due, no payment will be made.  Revenue will not be notified of any unpaid standing orders and would be obliged to check each month to ensure each standing order is paid, and to pursue each monthly payment with the taxpayer.  Managing large amounts of standing orders creates significant reconciliation difficulties. </p><p>  By contrast, direct debit gives greater certainty and facilitates the orderly collection of taxes while ensuring safeguards for customers.  A direct debit requires the customer (the payer) to authorise Revenue (the payee) to take a payment.  The customer can cancel the payment at any time. From an Exchequer point of view, if the payment goes unpaid, Revenue will be advised within five working days and will be able to pursue payment then.  This is not possible with standing orders.  In addition, with direct debits Revenue will always know the source of the payment and will be able to update the customer record electronically.  It is not possible to manage standing orders in this fashion.</p><p>  Accordingly, the option of paying LPT by standing order is not possible.  Revenue has provided a very wide range of payment options ranging from debit/credit cards to phased arrangements, including payment via a range of service providers.  It would not be reasonable for me to suggest that Revenue would move to a payment system which is riskier from the Exchequer's point of view and is less efficient in that it leads to administrative delays and costs. </p><p>  By way of general comment, it is my understanding that it would be unusual for financial institutions to make standing orders available other than from current accounts and that the types of accounts which are suitable for standing orders would also usually be suitable for direct debit.</p><p>Finally, as I have previously informed the House, an individual whose only income is a Department of Social Protection (DSP) payment, such as jobseeker's benefit, will qualify for a deferral of LPT.  Full details of all payment methods and deferral arrangements are available on Revenue's website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>.</p></reply>

The tax withheld by Principal contractors is paid over to Revenue and the subcontractor is given credit for any tax withheld.  From 1 January 2012, the Revenue Commissioners have made available a new online system for the operation of RCT and the system provides for three rates of deduction - zero, 20% and 35%. The zero rate recognises that it would be undesirable to deduct tax from compliant subcontractors.   One criterion for qualifying for the 0% rate is that the subcontractor has throughout the previous three years complied with all the obligations imposed by the Tax Acts, Capital Gains Tax Acts and the Value Added Tax Acts in relation to (i) the payment or remittance of taxes, interest and penalties, (ii) the delivery of returns and (iii) the supply, on request, of accounts or other information to Revenue. Notwithstanding this, the legislation provides for the granting of a 0% rate where a person satisfies Revenue that the three year compliance history ought to be disregarded.  </p><p>  For new tax registrations, the Revenue system automatically grants a rate of 20% as a three year compliance history does not exist. However, this may be changed to 0% if the subcontractor satisfies the Revenue that in all the circumstances the three year compliance period ought to be disregarded.</p><p>  I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the rate of deduction is reviewed periodically and, if a subcontractor who has been allocated the 20% rate meets the necessary conditions, the deduction rate is adjusted to zero. Similarly where a subcontractor no longer meets the conditions associated with either the zero or 20% rate the deduction rate is adjusted upwards as appropriate.</p><p>  RCT plays an important role in ensuring tax compliance by subcontractors in the relevant sectors and it is the view of the Revenue Commissioners that it would not be appropriate to automatically allocate a zero rate to newly established subcontractors. Revenue has to be satisfied that a subcontractor has established a satisfactory record of tax compliance.</p></reply>

I would point out that all NAMA staff are employees of the NTMA and are assigned to NAMA by the NTMA.  Under the NTMA business model, all employees are recruited on the basis of individually negotiated contracts.  In addition to NAMA, the NTMA carries out a range of commercial asset and liability functions on behalf of Government and its ability to successfully perform these functions is critically dependent on its ability to attract employees &ndash; often with specialist skills &ndash; from the private sector, including those at middle and senior management level. It is simply not possible for the NTMA and NAMA to carry out the work that they do on behalf of the taxpayer without recruiting the relevant expertise from outside of the public sector. Mobility with the private sector is a critical component of the NTMA model and if it is to be successful we have to accept that expertise can move in both directions.   That is the basis on which close to 300 staff have been recruited to NAMA from the private sector over the past three years and it would not have been possible to move from a standing start in December 2009 to become fully operational with a &euro;32 billion balance sheet a year later without having that ability to recruit the appropriate expertise and experience from the private sector. That expertise and experience is now producing results for NAMA: you will have noted that NAMA recently announced a profit for the second consecutive year and that it has generated cash of over &euro;12 billion in its three years of existence. </p><p>  There are extensive safeguards in place to protect the confidentiality of information held by NTMA employees, including those assigned to NAMA.    Employees assigned to NAMA by the NTMA, as is the case with all other NTMA staff, are subject to Section 14 of the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990 which prohibits an employee from disclosing any information obtained while carrying out their duties as employees of the NTMA. Employees assigned to NAMA are also subject to a prohibition on release of confidential data under Sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act 2009.  NTMA employees, including those assigned to NAMA, are subject to the Official Secrets Act.  Contravention of these prohibitions is a criminal offence.  These protections do not cease at the point of resignation but rather apply indefinitely and extend to former employees.  </p><p>  The notice period for NTMA employees assigned to NAMA is typically three months.  NTMA contracts for employees assigned to NAMA have a provision entitling the NTMA to place the employee on garden leave at any point during the notice period during the time the employee may not work for another employer.</p><p>  As was indicated by the Chief Executive of the NTMA at a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 24 January last, the NTMA has been engaged in a review of its policy in respect of notice periods and post-termination restrictions on employment.  The review commissioned by the NTMA was conducted by the law firm, Matheson, and has now been completed.  Arising from the review, I am advised that the NTMA is implementing a number of changes to its employment contracts, including the introduction of longer notice periods of 3 to 6 months (up from 1 to 3 months) for middle and senior management employees and garden leave provisions to be included in all employment contracts. These changes have been introduced for new NTMA employees and existing NTMA employees as they are promoted. As I pointed out above, the three-month notice period and garden leave provisions already apply to NTMA staff assigned to NAMA. </p><p>  In addition, I am advised that additional post-termination restrictions on employment are being considered on a case-by-case basis in respect of NTMA senior management employees in particular. However, the imposition of such restrictions needs to be carefully balanced against the NTMA&rsquo;s need to recruit good candidates for whom such restrictions may act as a significant disincentive to taking up employment with the NTMA.</p></reply>

The revised CCMA was published on 27 June 2013 and came into effect on 1 July 2013.  The submissions made, as well as feedback document outlining the Central Bank's response to some of the main issues raised, are available on the Central Bank's website, <i><i><font color="#0000FF">www.centralbank.ie</font></i></i>.  The CCMA provides an integrated and cohesive package of consumer protection measures for borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears.  It reflects the current mortgage arrears situation and seeks to deliver on the following principles, to:</p><p>- ensure appropriate resolution of each borrower's arrears situation;</p><p>- ensure that lenders deal with borrowers in a fair and transparent manner;</p><p>- support and facilitate meaningful engagement between lenders and borrowers; and</p><p>- ensure borrower awareness of the benefits of co-operating with their lender, and the consequences of not co-operating.</p><p>  With regard to the moratorium, to clarify, the 12 month moratorium applied from day 31 after arrears first arose and did not take into account any time taken by the lender to gather information from the borrower, complete an assessment or make an offer.  The revised CCMA requires a lender to wait at least eight months from the date the arrears arose, before legal action can commence against a co-operating borrower.</p><p>  Separately, regardless of how long it takes the lender to assess a case, and provided that the borrower is co-operating, the lender must give three months' notice to the borrower before they can commence legal proceedings where:</p><p>- the lender does not offer an alternative repayment arrangement; or</p><p>- the borrower does not accept an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender.</p><p>  This will give co-operating borrowers time to consider other options that may be available to them, such as voluntary surrender, voluntary sale or a personal insolvency arrangement.  The combined effect of the protection period and the notice period is that, for a co-operating borrower, legal proceedings may not commence until three months from the date the letter is issued (where lender declines to offer an arrangement or where the borrower does not accept an arrangement offered) or eight months from the date the arrears arose, whichever date is later.  The revised CCMA also sets out a requirement for lenders to draw up a contacts policy that will apply to all communications with borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears, and must be approved by the lender's board of directors.</p><p>  To mitigate against the risk of harassment resulting from the removal of the limit on contacts, provision 22 of the revised CCMA will require lenders to ensure that:</p><p>  a) communications with borrowers are proportionate and not excessive, taking into account the circumstances of the borrower, including that unnecessarily frequent communications are not made; </p><p>  b) communications are not aggressive, intimidating or harassing;</p><p>  c) borrowers are given sufficient time to complete an action they committed to, before follow up communication is attempted; and </p><p>  d) steps are taken to agree future communication with borrowers. </p><p>  In relation to appeals, the Central Bank does not have the power to require lenders to delegate commercial decisions in relation to debt restructuring to independent parties.  A complaint may of course be made to the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, including in respect of an appeal.  The FSO will consider whether the lender complied with the CCMA in reaching the decision and may direct a lender to re-assess the borrower's case.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the new Personal Insolvency Act provides new statutory insolvency frameworks to allow debtors, through the utilisation of a professional personal insolvency practitioner, and creditors, to consider an arrangement to resolve unsustainable mortgage and personal debt.  The legislation provides a legal framework for the resolution of mortgage arrears, as well as other personal debt, and it will provide certainty for borrowers and lenders alike about the consequences of non-payment and failure to reach agreement.  The effect of this legislation is to rebalance the relationship between debtors and creditors and to offer more accessible and effective options to debtors to deal with debt difficulty.</p><p>  Also, in preparing a Personal Insolvency Arrangement which can include mortgaged assets, there is an onus on a personal insolvency practitioner to formulate a proposal, insofar as reasonably practicable, on terms that will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in or cease to occupy a principal private residence.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland, which will oversee the operation of the new insolvency frameworks, has now been established and will shortly begin accepting applications for the new personal insolvency processes.</p></reply>

It is important too for the continued development of Ireland as a centre for international financial services and as a location of choice for international foreign financial services firms.  A range of reforms have been introduced to underpin a more effective and efficient financial regulatory regime.  The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 gave effect to significant structural changes in the operation of financial regulation in Ireland. It provided a statutory basis for a comprehensive domestic regulatory framework for financial services and set out new powers for the Central Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers.  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011, which is being considered at Report Stage in the Seanad, further strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.  These reforms followed on from the reports of Prof. Honohan and Messrs. Regling and Watson which identified a range of regulatory failures which were instrumental in the financial crises.</p><p>  At EU level, the Irish Presidency succeeded in agreeing a number of dossiers which balance responsible governance with the need to avoid unnecessary burdens, thereby ensuring that opportunities for economic growth and job creation are maximised.  That work will ensure that our regulatory framework is benchmarked against other EU and international jurisdictions and enable us to work in building growth for the future that is underpinned by a sound regulatory environment.</p></reply>

The Government has consistently stated its commitment to the 12.5% corporation tax rate which has the support of all the major parties and the majority of Deputies in this House.  We have a very strong track record of attracting companies of real substance to invest and create thousands of jobs in Ireland.  Many of the large Multi-National Corporations, MNCs, are here for many years and regard Ireland as an excellent base from which to serve their customers in Europe and further afield.  Our competitive taxation system is just one element of what makes Ireland attractive to MNCs.  We remain committed to our competitive 12.5% tax rate and I have no concerns whatsoever regarding Ireland's ability to maintain this rate.</p><p>  In addition a low corporate tax rate is a tool to address the economic limitations that come with being a peripheral country, as compared to &ldquo;core&rdquo; countries.  Furthermore taxation is a powerful instrument of economic policy. Retaining the right of EU Member States to decide taxation rules and levels allows Member States to take account of their differing positions in the economic and business cycle.  Therefore taxation may also be used as a tool to stimulate the economy or to cool it down in case of risks of overheating.  However, it is important to make a distinction between a competitive tax economy and harmful tax competition. Ireland is does not engage in harmful tax competition. Ireland just like other EU countries believes in fair tax competition and building on the work of the Global Forum on Tax Transparency, unfair tax competition is an issue that needs to be examined.</p></reply>

SEPA is an EU initiative that will change the way that these payments are processed across Europe.  SEPA will allow payment systems users to make euro-denominated retail electronic payments to payees located in any of the participating countries, using a single payment account and a single set of payment instruments (the participating countries are the EU member states, together with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Monaco).  SEPA comes into full effect on 1 February 2014 and businesses will need to ensure that payroll, direct debit and accounting systems are SEPA-ready.  SEPA will introduce new business rules in relation to retail electronic payments and implement common standards in all participating countries for issuing and executing the underlying payment instructions.  SEPA will deliver tangible benefits to businesses, for example by allowing faster settlement and simplified processing will improve cash flow and reduce costs.</p><p>  The implementation of SEPA within Ireland is overseen by the National Payments Plan, NPP, Steering Committee, which was established in 2012 to modernise the way payments are made in Ireland.  In this regard, an NPP-SEPA sub-group has been formed, consisting of representatives of consumers, businesses, Government and banks.  Officials from my Department are represented on this group which provides an avenue for the discussion of any issues that arise in the process of migrating to SEPA.  Progress towards migration is being made and progress will continue to be monitored closely to ensure an efficient migration to SEPA.  More information on SEPA can be found on the website <i><i><font color="#0000FF">www.readyforsepa.ie</font></i></i>.</p></reply>

A joint High Level Working Group, HLWG, was established to identify concrete and flexible mechanisms to enhance the Bank&rsquo;s support for Ireland&rsquo;s growth agenda.  The EIB and Ireland are strongly committed to working together to enhance the Bank&rsquo;s activity in the country and this commitment is beginning to bear results.  EIB group activity in Ireland in 2012 was almost &euro;600 million, representing an increase of over &euro;100 million in 2012 over 2011 levels and covering a diversified range of sectors and transactions.

To put this in context SMEs make up 99% of Irish businesses and account for almost 70% of employment in the State.  A number of Government Departments including the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are working closely together to ensure that Ireland secures as much funding for our SMEs as possible.</p><p>  There have been positive results in this regard as evidenced with the recent announcement of the EIB of the provision of &euro;200 million for investment in AIB for small and medium companies across Ireland.  This represents the latest EIB support for SMEs in Ireland since an earlier lending programme intermediated by AIB in 2011.  As part of the Management Committee visit to Ireland in April, the EIB delegation met with myself and a number of other Government Ministers including Deputy Bruton, where it was highlighted that access to funding for Irish SMEs is a priority for Ireland.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that earlier this month, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills signed a &euro;100 million loan agreement with the European Investment Bank, EIB, to further support the Government&rsquo;s investment in school buildings. SMEs are likely to have significant involvement in these building projects.  Most recently, the European Council welcomed a report last week, which the European Commission and the EIB had prepared on the financing of the economy.  At that meeting, the European Council agreed on a number of measures and welcomed the intention of the Commission and the EIB to implement them as a matter of priority and to present a comprehensive report on their implementation ahead of its October 2013 meeting, with quantitative objectives, instruments and a timetable.  The following measures were agreed:</p><p>- To step up efforts by the EIB to support lending to the economy by making full use of the recent increase of EUR 10 billion in its capital. The European Council called on the EIB to implement its plan to increase its lending activity in the EU by at least 40% over 2013-2015. To this effect, the EIB has already identified new lending opportunities of more than EUR 150 billion across a set of critical priorities such as innovation and skills, SME access to finance, resources efficiency and strategic infrastructures;</p><p>- To expand joint risk-sharing financial instruments between the European Commission and the EIB to leverage private sector and capital markets investments in SMEs. These initiatives should ensure that the volume of new loans to SMEs across the EU is expanded, respecting the principles of financial soundness and transparency as well as the MFF ceilings. The Council, in consultation with the Commission and the EIB, will specify without delay the parameters for the design of such instruments co-financed by the Structural Funds, aiming at high leverage effects. The necessary preparations should be made to allow these instruments to begin operating in January 2014;</p><p>- To increase the European Investment Fund's credit enhancement capacity;</p><p>- To gradually expand of the EIB's trade finance schemes to favour SME business across the Union, especially in programme countries;</p><p>- To strengthen the cooperation between national development banks and the EIB to increase opportunities for co-lending and exchanges of best practices;</p><p>- To develop alternative sources of financing in close cooperation with Member States.</p></reply>

The targets set reflect the banks&rsquo; capacity, processes and systems.  The Credit Review process remains available to any SMEs whose credit has been reduced or withdrawn by the pillar banks as well as when credit is refused by them.  I would strongly advise any SME whose credit is reduced or withdrawn to avail of the services of the Credit Review Office.  The Government recognises that SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy and will play a vital role in the recovery of employment growth in our country.  It also recognises that businesses with legacy debts may be viable. One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme.</p></reply>

I have no statutory function in relation to business interest rate and decisions made and charges imposed by individual lending institutions at any particular time.  The decisions financial institutions operating in Ireland make on the interest rates and other fees they charge to customers are commercial decisions for the institutions concerned.  Interest rates are determined by a broad range of factors including ECB base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment, and an institution&rsquo;s overall funding.</p><p>  Given concerns over breakdown in monetary transmission and in particular increasing fragmentation within the Single European Market as highlighted by the high interest rates for SME lending in the periphery the ECB is currently considering a number of options that could reduce costs of funding in the periphery.

Data from the latest Quarterly National Household Survey show that employment on an annual basis increased by 1.1% in the first quarter of 2013, the second successive quarter of annual growth.  In May, the standardised unemployment rate stood at 13.7%, substantially down from the peak rate of 15.1% in February of last year.</p><p>  In line with these latest developments, my Department is forecasting modest employment growth in 2013, with employment expected to continue expanding thereafter.  However, over the medium term increased labour supply is likely to result from the assumed economic recovery as participation rates pick-up and the pace of outward migration slows.  In other words, while this pick-up in employment is expected to result in some decrease in the unemployment rate in the next few years, increasing labour supply will likely curtail, at least to some extent, the decline in the unemployment rate.</p><p>  As outlined in the <i>Irish Stability Programme - April 2013 Update</i>, my Department expects the unemployment rate to average 12.8% in 2015.  This is based on annual average GDP growth of 2.3%.  However, I would stress that this unemployment projection takes account only of policies which are known.  The impact of measures yet to be announced will be factored into the Department's macroeconomic forecasts as and when the specifics of these measures become available.  If the pace of economic growth is stronger than expected then unemployment could potentially fall more rapidly; however, as outlined above, labour supply might also increase at a faster pace.</p><p>  Finally, I would like to emphasise that the Government remains committed to tackling the unacceptably high level of unemployment.  Reflecting this, the <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2013</i> set out over 333 actions to be undertaken in the coming year to support job creation and complement measures already undertaken in the <i>Jobs Initiative</i> and the <i>Pathways to Work</i>.</p></reply>

That said, I remain concerned at the low level of numbers of SMEs seeking reviews by the Credit Review Office.  The most recent report by the Credit Reviewer shows that the Credit Review Office upheld the credit appeal in 135 cases or 57% of cases decided.  The upheld appeals have resulted in &euro;16.8M credit being made available to SMEs and farms, protecting 1,297 jobs.  This shows that there is a strong prospect of success for SMEs going to the Credit Review Office and I would strongly encourage SMEs refused credit to seek a review by the Office.  I find it difficult to understand why SMEs and farms who are at risk of going out of business are not willing to seek a review of a refusal of credit.</p><p>  The independent assessment contained a number of recommendations to make the CRO more effective in encouraging and increasing the supply of credit to SMEs.  One of these recommendations was to increase the resources of the CRO and I sanctioned the appointment of additional reviewers at budget time last year.  The recent CRO report stated that the procurement process for additional reviewers has been completed and that the implementation of the remaining recommendations in the assessment within the CRO&rsquo;s remit would follow the training of these reviewers.  I am satisfied that the CRO now has sufficient resources to fulfil its mandate of encouraging and increasing the supply of credit to SMEs.  In looking at the implementation of other recommendations, my officials have also been considering where the CRO should fit into the overall strategy of ensuring credit availability for viable SMEs and the level of resources is one aspect of this strategy.  I expect that the deliberative process on the strategy will conclude shortly.</p></reply>

Dividends and other distributions are not deductible in computing profits for tax purposes: whether a company retains its profits or distributes them to its shareholders or parent company does not affect the amount of those profits that is chargeable to corporation tax, and I am assuming that this is not what the Deputy has in mind.  Setting a minimum threshold of profits for corporation tax purposes would involve restricting deductible amounts, in respect of what would otherwise be allowable deductions and reliefs, to a percentage of profits before those deductions and reliefs.  For companies whose net taxable profits would otherwise be below such a threshold, imposing such a cap on the aggregate amount of deductions and allowances would effectively increase the rate of tax above 12.5%.  I do not believe that such an approach would provide a suitable basis for taxing company profits or that it would be a desirable option in the context of our 12.5% corporation tax regime and its important role in generating investment and jobs in the economy.</p></reply>

These frameworks are published on the Department of Finance website.  I must ensure that the banks are run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the banks as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.  However, AIB has informed me of the following: &quot;While AIB's standard notes lodged fee is one of the most competitive in the market, we are aware that the above changes will impact on c. 5% of our business customers.&quot;</p><p>  Changes to European Regulations in 2011 have meant that AIB is now obliged to check cash lodgements for fitness and authenticity before lodgement to the Central Bank.  Historically, AIB was one of the only banks to offer a discount to some of its business customers who prepared lodgements to an agreed standard.  This removed the requirement to check the cash in such lodgements and thus allowed for reduced cash handling/notes lodged rates (&euro;0.25 and &euro;0.17) off the standard &euro;0.45c per &euro;100 fee.  As a result of the manual nature now involved in checking-counting cash, a review has taken place of AIB's historical cash handling fees.</p><p>  In this regard, we have written to all impacted customers offering them the opportunity to approach the Bank to discuss their transaction fee arrangements in advance of the next fee charging period.  These discussions and any potential revised fee negotiation and transaction fee arrangements can be put in place up to 30th August next and back dated to the start of that fee quarter.  AIB's business customers often negotiate individual fee arrangements based on their specific circumstances and needs, and the bank is offering them the opportunity to do so in the coming months in order to minimise the impact of the above changes.</p><p>  More broadly, there may be opportunities for business customers to reduce their overall cash handling and fees through some electronic banking services such as:</p><p>- AIB's Point of Sale systems</p><p>- AIB has also launched its 'contactless payment' service for transactions up to &euro;15 which involves customers holding their card up to a secure reader which records the transaction in seconds</p><p>- For business customers with larger cash lodgement requirements, the use of AIB's centralised Lodgement Processing may reduce costs.</p><p>- In-store ATMs offer the ability to recycle cash and which may reduce cash lodgement costs.&#8221;</p><p>  In the case of Bank of Ireland I have been informed that with effect from 8 April 2013, the Bank has changed how it accepts coin lodgements from its business customers.  The changes include:</p><p>- Only full sachets/sacks of coin will be accepted for lodgement or withdrawal</p><p>- In addition, coin will not be accepted in priority lodgement bags or nightsafe wallets</p><p>- Cash in transit services must be used for bulk coin lodgement</p><p>  Bank of Ireland has indicated that it will continue to offer its business customers the opportunity for more efficient day-to-day banking.  The Bank has indicated it remains committed to communities nationwide and this change will ultimately deliver an enhanced customer experience and provide greater access to branch staff and their expertise for more complex transactions.  The bank has indicated it will be working closely with its customers to ensure an easy transition.  With regard to developing a guide to banking costs including cost comparisons between the pillar banks it would not be appropriate for my department to undertake this activity.</p></reply>

The draft lending criteria were published on its website on 24 June 2013 having being approved by the Bank&rsquo;s Management Committee. They will be submitted for discussion and approval to the Bank&rsquo;s Board of Directors on  23 July 2013. The new EIB Energy Lending criteria are fully aligned with EU policy priorities to deliver economic growth, energy security and sustainable development. The EIB is fully committed to playing its part in bringing Europe out of the crisis by working with national authorities, public investors and private business to finance effective growth and jobs investment projects while delivering on sustainability and meeting strategic objectives for energy security. Energy Efficiency, Renewable Energy and Networks are key areas for EIB investment and support the EU climate objectives. Climate action considerations are mainstreamed in all EIB sectorial strategies and integrated into all operational activities. In addition, the Bank&rsquo;s Corporate Operational Plan (COP) specifies a clear target that 25% of the EIB&rsquo;s overall lending has to be in support of climate action activities. The EIB funds available from AIB are targeted to support the financing of all investments and expenditures incurred in the context of the development of SMEs and Mid-Caps through eligible projects. They are not specifically targeted at any specific sector and it is important that sectors should not be excluded from using these funds. A key outcome of investment initiatives by SMEs and Mid-Caps is expansion and growth for companies, including additional employment.</p></reply>

I am advised by the bank that they are fully co-operating and in that context the Bank has provided originals and/or copies of large data sets under compulsion/court order to the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Body (CARB), Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation (GBFI), Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE), the then Financial Regulator (FR) and the Nyberg Banking Commission. In particular the Bank has informed me that: in 2009, the ODCE seized under Court Search Warrant approximately 3 million electronic documents and in excess of 5,000 original hard copy documents; in 2009, the FR compelled the production of approximately 45,000 hard copy documents and approximately 9 million electronic documents; the electronic material remains in the possession of the Bank as the FR investigation was deferred in 2009; in 2010, the GBFI under Court Order received significant quantities of electronic and hard copy documents and recordings requested in respect of 18 employees of the Bank whose lines were recorded; in 2010, the Bank was compelled to provide large volumes of electronic and hard copy material to the Nyberg Banking Commission; minutes of meetings as requested were provided to CARB, the ODCE, the GBFI, the Banking Commission and the FR; and in civil litigation copies of various items including certain recordings were provided to parties to such litigation. The originals of the above materials (save where seized) rest with IBRC (in Special Liquidation) and their legal advisors hold copies of certain of the materials.</p><p>  I am advised that the Central Bank was not aware of the tapes or the content contained therein.

These discussions took place following on from a successful Ecofin meeting which I chaired on the 14th May, where council conclusions were agreed on the European Commission Action Plan to strengthen the fight against tax fraud and evasion, and associated Recommendations on aggressive tax planning and good governance in tax matters. Agreement on these conclusions was brokered by the Irish Presidency following discussions at official level in the Working Party on Tax Questions, and at senior official level in the High Level Working Party, before final agreement was adopted at Ecofin. During the Irish Presidency in the tax area I have prioritised files aimed at tackling tax fraud and evasion and aggressive tax planning and I am pleased to be able to inform the deputy that we have had some significant achievements in this area. In April EU Tax Commissioner Algirdas Semeta and I issued a joint letter to EU Finance Ministers (ECOFIN) Ministers urging action against tax fraud, evasion, and aggressive tax planning, and outlined seven key areas where work could be taken forward. I am pleased to inform the deputy that we have made progress in all seven areas. In addition to the above mentioned May Ecofin council conclusions, at the recent June Ecofin we reached agreement on the VAT anti-fraud package. We have also made progress in widening the scope of the EU Savings Directive towards the new global standard of automatic exchange of information, and agreement was also reached on the related Negotiating Mandate for the Commission to align EU savings tax agreements with selected European third countries. Furthermore we reached agreement on the adoption of the Fiscalis 2020 programme and work has begun to revise the Directive on Administrative Cooperation to further widen the scope of automatic exchange of information within the EU. Finally the subgroup of the Code of Conduct on Business Taxation presented a report on intra-EU hybrid entity mismatches which demonstrated the scope for coordinated action in the EU against aggressive tax planning.</p></reply>

For example, such individuals could be transferred to head up new divisions of the company and thus lead to additional investments in Ireland. An exemption from income tax on 30% of salary between &euro;75,000 and &euro;500,000 is provided for qualifying employees that are assigned for a minimum of 1 year and the relief is available for a maximum period of 5 years. USC continues to be payable on the full income amount. Social Insurance is also payable where the individual is not liable to it in their normal State of residence. The scheme has been introduced for an initial three-year period ending on 31 December 2014, at which point it will be reviewed. Depending on the outcome of that review, I will decide whether the relief should be retained. It is worth nothing that the existence of similar incentives in other European countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland would indicate that such incentives can be a persuading factor when companies decide where to locate investment projects. In tandem with our corporation tax rate, this relief will help us to compete for Foreign Direct Investment.</p></reply>

This is ultimately a commercial decision for the management team and board of each bank, having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability. Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a minority shareholder in Bank of Ireland, I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure its value as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.

Lump sum amounts up to &euro;200,000 are paid free of tax. They are also paid free of USC. The portion of a lump sum between &euro;200,001 and &euro;575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%. This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum. No USC is chargeable. Any amount of a lump sum in excess of &euro;575,000 is taxed at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax (credits and other tax reliefs are available). In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess. These amounts are lifetime amounts with prior lump sums aggregating with later lump sums.</p><p>  As there is no general requirement for data on the number of persons who are receiving payments of retirement lump sums of less than &euro;200,000 to be returned to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners, I am not in a position to provide definitive figures on the Exchequer impact of the tax-free retirement lump sums allowed. Based on broad assumptions and an extrapolation of certain available data, it is estimated that the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums of up to &euro;200,000 at 20% in respect of the public service could be about &euro;85 million in a full year. I have no data on which to provide a similar estimate in relation to the private sector. I should point out, however, that one significant difference between public sector and private sector pension schemes is that private sector schemes invariably allow scheme members the option of commuting part of their pension fund for a tax-free lump sum. The option of receiving benefits in the form of pension only is not available to members of public sector schemes. Depending on the impact of any tax charge on retirement lump sums, the option to commute part of a pension fund may no longer be exercised by private sector pension scheme members or may be exercised in a manner that reduces the value of the lump sum taken to minimise or avoid any immediate tax charge.</p></reply>

The Group recognised the considerable pressures on the public finances and the need to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue, and therefore suggested that consideration be given to phasing in deductibility over a period of years.  The Group also considered that it is for Government, having regard to the prevailing budgetary situation, to decide on the time span for phasing-in deductibility and on what percentage of LPT to allow as a deduction from gross rents for tax purposes.    The Government accepted the recommendation of the Thornhill Group on this matter but has not considered the manner or the timing in which this will happen.</p></reply>

The achievement of a Council General Approach, which was endorsed at Ecofin on 21 June 2013, signals a significant step forward by the EU towards protecting against excessive financial speculation in the food and other commodity derivative markets.</p><p>  The regulation of derivative trading in the EU has been part of Council discussions within the EU since September 2010 when the Commission published its proposal for the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) to regulate this market in the context of over-the-counter (OTC) trades. This EU Regulation, which is directly applicable in all Member States, entered into force on 16 August 2012. </p><p>  In particular, the Council text of MiFID II contains important provisions relating to position management, position limits and product intervention. These provisions are in respect of all financial instruments, including commodity derivatives, and have the purpose of providing regulators with tools to avoid excessive speculation in financial instruments, including commodity derivatives. Competent authorities will be obligated to establish and apply position limits on the size of a position in a commodity derivative which a person can have over a specified period of time. </p><p>  Furthermore, competent authorities will have product intervention powers whereby they may prohibit or restrict trading of financial instruments or prohibit or restrict investment activities when there is a threat to the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or commodity markets. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will have contingency and coordination powers in position management and product intervention to ensure consistent application across all Member States. In the exercise of its powers, ESMA will also have to consult public bodies competent for the oversight, administration and regulation of physical agricultural markets. </p><p>  EMIR and MiFID II combined are expected to result in a tighter regime for all derivatives, including food securities, whether traded OTC or through exchanges. The measures are intended to keep pace with trends in derivatives trading, in line with G20 commitments made at the 2009 Pittsburgh summit.  Council General Approach will be progressed further by the Lithuanian Presidency when they begin negotiations with the European Parliament at Trilogues.  We will continue to monitor developments on this file throughout the legislative process. </p></reply>

Under Section 42 of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 all designated bodies (including all financial institutions) are required to report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners all suspicious transactions, including any unusually large cash movements.  Similarly, any solicitors or other practitioners who execute property transfer instruments are also designated persons for the purposes of the money laundering legislation and must satisfy themselves as to the source of purchase monies in drawing up the transfer instrument and report anything untoward to the Garda&iacute; and to Revenue.</p><p>  In addition, citizens can, and do, report directly to Revenue instances of unusually high amounts of cash used by individuals in transactions and Revenue reviews all such useful information supplied.  This affords all citizens an opportunity to assist in combatting possible shadow economy, money laundering or other nefarious activities.</p><p>  I am further advised that the Revenue Commissioners audit and compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, with a specific focus on those sectors that traditionally have been susceptible to shadow economy activity specifically cash businesses, such as the hospitality sector, including bars, nightclubs, fast-food/restaurants and entertainment, and white collar cash activities, such as doctors, dentists, solicitors, accountants, engineers etc.  The Commissioners recognise that a use to which undeclared cash can be put is to purchase properties and Revenue&rsquo;s risk systems are geared to identify possible instances of such behaviour.</p><p>  To facilitate and enhance this approach, Revenue has a well established computerised Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling (REAP) system.  This contains large amounts of data that has been sourced directly from taxpayers via their tax returns as well as information received from a wide range of third parties.  As the Commissioners administer the Stamp Duties regime, they also have access to details of all real property sales, purchases and voluntary transfers in the State and this data is also fed into the REAP system.</p><p>  While REAP ranks the full taxpayer population in terms of risk, it also facilitates the selection of individual cases based on single or multiple business rules.  One such rule identifies cases where significant capital expenditure has been incurred, specifically the purchase of houses and other real property, which is out of line with the person&rsquo;s visible or declared means.  Additional data sources available to Revenue that would help identify whether a property was purchased using loans from financial institutions include the Tax Relief at Source system as well as information on borrowings returned by taxpayers in their tax returns.  In due course, Local Property Tax data will be analysed to identify property ownership patterns which may be further indicators of risk.  I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners have a very strong focus on the risk to tax compliance posed by all aspects of the cash economy and have a range of programmes in place to manage the tax risks involved.</p></reply>

In addition, the matter of tax payments made by specific taxpayers is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and in such circumstances is confidential to the taxpayers concerned.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners do not have information on the ratio between duty free and duty applied sales in Irish airports as, again, VAT returns do not require this information to be returned to the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners, for operational and confidentiality reasons, are not in a position to provide details of risk interventions including audits of individual customers or of how these are managed.

Article 29 of the Draft Directive provides as follows: </p><p>  &quot;Article 29</p><p>  1. Member States shall ensure that corporate or legal entities established within their territory obtain and hold adequate, accurate and current information on their</p><p>  beneficial ownership.</p><p>  2. Member States shall ensure that the information referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article can be accessed in a timely manner by competent authorities and by obliged</p><p>  entities.&quot;</p><p>  Article 30 makes similar provisions in relation to Trusts and other legal arrangements.  Neither Article requires information on beneficial ownership to be made available </p><p>  to the public. The Commission's proposals are currently under discussion in an Expert Working Party of the European Council.  The Deputy may be aware that the 3rd Money Laundering Directive requires financial institutions and other designated persons to identify any beneficial owner and take risk based and adequate measures to verify his identity so that the financial institution etc is satisfied that it knows who the beneficial owner is including, as regards legal persons, trusts and similar legal arrangements, taking risk based and adequate measures to understand the ownership and control structure of the customer.  The 3rd Money Laundering Directive was transposed into Irish Law in the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.</p></reply>

A full list of Ireland's Double Taxation Treaties and Tax Information Exchange Agreements is available on the Revenue website    <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i></p><p>  The total number of exchange requests regarding direct tax matters received from non-OECD countries in each of the years 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 is as follows: 2009, 23; 2010, 18; 2011, 26; and 2012, 23  Information was provided in all cases.</p><p>  Ireland does not have an exchange of information provision with any of the countries listed as Least Developed Countries (LDCs) (other than Zambia).  No request for information in relation to direct taxes has been received from or provided to Zambia.  The total number of requests for information regarding direct tax matters received from OECD countries in each of the years 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 is as follows: 2009, 89; 2010, 157; 2011, 176; and 2012, 142. Information was provided in all cases. </p><p>  Effective exchange of information is a critical tool in ensuring that countries are able to collect taxes owing to them. Ireland has now fully signed up to the joint Council of Europe/OECD Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. Ireland's instruments of ratification were deposited on 29 May of this year and the Convention/Protocol will enter into force on 1 September 2013. The Deputy may wish to note, in particular, that an amending Protocol extends the opportunity to participate in this Convention to developing countries. This enables developing countries, which sign and ratify the Convention, to access exchange of information with an ever-increasing range of countries without having to incur the expense of negotiating individual agreements with each of the Convention countries concerned.</p></reply>

In order to apply a lower reduced VAT rate to these services, the only rate possible would be the 9% VAT rate.  While EU VAT law provides that a VAT rate of 5% or more may be applied to the supply of construction services on residential dwellings, the EU VAT Directive also provides that Member States may only apply up to two reduced rates of VAT and Ireland already operates reduced VAT rates of 9% and 13.5%.  In this context, in order to apply a rate of 5% to the supply of such construction services, all activity at the 9% rate would have to be applied at the 5% rate and such a move would be excessively costly to the Exchequer.</p><p>  Furthermore, while it is possible under EU VAT law to apply the 9% VAT rate to the supply of construction services on residential dwellings, it is not possible to apply this rate to construction services on non-residential property.  This is because the application of the 13.5% rate to these services in Ireland is part of a derogation under the EU VAT Directive, which provides that as Ireland applied a reduced rate to such construction services on 1 January 1991, we are entitled to retain this historic treatment, provided the rate is charged at 12% or more.  This would mean that if housing repair, maintenance and improvements was applied at the 9% VAT rate, this would involve two separate rates applying to the same services depending on the type of dwelling concerned, which would be complicated to administer. </p></reply>

Qualifying fees means tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college and includes what is referred to as the &ldquo;student contribution&rdquo;. No other fees (e.g. administration fees, examination fees, capitation fees) qualify for tax relief. For the tax year 2011 and subsequent tax years, the maximum qualifying fee per course per academic year is &euro;7,000.</p><p>The tax relief is confined to tuition fees actually borne by the claimant.   Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grants, scholarships, employer contribution or other means are to be deducted in arriving at the fees qualifying for tax relief.</p><p>An individual can claim tax relief on fees paid by him or her in respect of an approved course pursued by other individuals (e.g. a son or daughter) and that the claim may cover more than one student.  Only a portion of the qualifying fees in each claim is eligible for relief.  Each claim is restricted by the amount shown in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>   Full time<br />(Where any one of the students in respect of whom relief is claimed is a full-time student).</th><th>Part time<br />(Where all the students in respect of whom relief is claimed are part-time students).</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;2,000</td><td>&euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;2,250</td><td>&euro;1,125</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;2,500</td><td>&euro;1,250</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;2,750</td><td>&euro;1,375</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;3,000</td><td>&euro;1,500</td></tr></table></p><p>The restriction applies to each claim, the subject of which may be one or more students.

Four criteria have been identified: minimal or no tax rates; lack of transparency; lack of exchange of information and lack of substance or economic activity. None of these four criteria apply to Ireland, a fact that has been acknowledged in recent months by Algirdas Semeta, the European Commissioner responsible for tax policy. The Director of the OECD's Centre for Tax Policy and Administration has also acknowledged recently that Ireland competed fairly for Foreign Direct Investment.   However, not everyone agrees with the OECD's criteria. Some commentators, whether they be political, media, academic or business, hold a different view and have developed their own criteria to identify countries they regard as tax havens. Some of these commentators' analysis erroneously includes Ireland and many other countries with high reputations, as problem jurisdictions. These commentators are entitled to their opinion but in my view, and in the view of many countries around the world, they have got it wrong.</p><p>  I would like to remind the Deputy of a few salient facts:</p><p>- We have a very strong track record of attracting companies of real substance to invest and create thousands of jobs in Ireland. Many of the large Multi-National Corporations (MNCs) are here for many years and see Ireland as an excellent base to serve their customer in Europe and further afield.</p><p>- These corporations have set down significant roots in the Irish economy and the Irish Government will continue to take steps to enhance our attractiveness through investment in our people, investment in our infrastructure and our strong commitment to Europe.</p><p>- Over 1,000 MNC&rsquo;s have successfully located in Ireland and, despite the challenges that the Irish economy has faced in recent years, that pipeline has remained strong. Over 100,000 are employed directly by Multi-national companies in Ireland and they are an integral part of our past, our present and our future. Indeed, it is estimated that over 250,000 people are employed indirectly across the country servicing this key sector of our economy.</p><p>- These are companies of real substance and they are certainly not &ldquo;post-box&rdquo; companies &ndash; the Multi-National Corporations (MNCs) that establish operations in Ireland have created many thousands of sustainable, well-paid, jobs.</p><p>- Our competitive taxation system is, of course, an element of the Irish package and we remain committed to our competitive 12.5% tax rate.</p><p>- Our taxation system is open and transparent and all companies in Ireland pay tax at 12.5% on their profits earned in Ireland. Of course, profits earned by these companies that are outside the scope of the Irish tax system are not subject to Irish tax.  Incorrectly counting these profits as &ldquo;Irish profits&rdquo; is often the reason for the inaccurate analysis of the Irish taxation system and throws up very low effective tax rates. However, we can only tax profits that are liable to tax in Ireland.</p><p>- Added to all of this, we exchange tax information with 80 different jurisdictions around the world through our network of international agreements, either by way of a Double Taxation Agreement of a Tax Information Exchange Agreement.</p><p>  Aggressive tax planning by companies is a major issue for legislators across the world and needs to be addressed. However, it is clear to us from our work at the forefront of efforts at European and OECD level that  these issues cannot be addressed at national level alone - we need a co-ordinated international response. The OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project represents that international response and work is well underway in this regard. Ireland has given its full support to the project and is working closely with our international partners on this important work. I look forward to seeing the results. </p></reply>

I understand that the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation have requested access to various documents/materials in the banks, including audio recordings, and that the banks have fully complied with these investigations to date. It would be completely inappropriate for the Department of Finance to act outside of its legal powers and interfere with any investigation that could compromise potential future criminal or civil investigations by the bodies responsible under statute.

The Euro-area Heads of State and Government confirmed this position and mandated EU Finance Ministers to prepare an operational framework by mid-2013.</p><p>  A considerable amount of work has been undertaken at technical, senior official and Ministerial level on the ESM&rsquo;s Direct Bank Recapitalisation (DBR) Instrument. This work culminated in agreement on the operational framework for the ESM&rsquo;s Direct Bank Recapitalisation Instrument at the June 20th Eurogroup of Euro-area Finance Ministers meeting in Luxembourg.</p><p>  This framework builds upon the agreement secured on the 29th of June 2012, and is an important step in the Eurozone&rsquo;s efforts to restore market confidence in the Eurozone. It is expected that the earliest date that the ESM DBR can come into effect will be towards the end of the first half of 2014, given the need to satisfy national procedures, and also the requirement to have the Single Supervisory Mechanism in place beforehand.</p><p>  The European Central Bank, as the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), will complete assessments of banks in the Eurozone.  Asset quality reviews will take place in Quarter 4 2013 or early 2014.  These will be followed by stress tests in early 2014. Both tests will assess capital and identify any bank shortfalls that might need to access the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).</p><p>  Finally, we have succeeded in having provision for retrospective recapitalisation included in the framework. There is still a lot of negotiation to be done on this aspect of the facility but the agreement now in place keeps open the possibility for us to apply to the ESM for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it. </p></reply>

For example, we have agreed the reversal of the minimum wage cut, and also on the use of up to half of the proceeds of asset sales for investment in projects of a commercial nature.  Changes to the programme loans have included reductions of the interest rates and, in the case of the EU facilities, extension of maturities.    In addition, we have negotiated the replacement of the Promissory Notes issued to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) with a series of longer term, non-amortising floating rate Government bonds.   When the programme was initially agreed in late 2010, the average interest rate on the &euro;67.5 billion available to drawdown from the external sources was estimated by the EU Commission to be 5.82% on the basis of market rates at that time. The average life of the borrowing was initially set at 7.5 years. </p><p>  In July 2011, the Euro Area Heads of State or Government (HOSG) agreed to reduce the cost of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) loans, and similar reductions were subsequently agreed for the interest rates on the loans provided by the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and also by the bilateral lenders (UK, Sweden, Denmark).  </p><p>  In the case of the EFSF, which is providing a total of &euro;17.7 billion in funding to Ireland, the changes to the interest rates removed the interest rate margin, which was 2.47%.  The revised pricing structure for the EFSF loans incorporates a guarantee commitment fee of 0.1% per annum and a service fee to cover the cost of operations of the EFSF.  It also provides that EFSF lending done after that point will be done on a floating rate basis.  The overall reduction in the interest rate margin which Ireland pays to the EFSF is estimated to be in the region of 2.7 to 2.8 percentage points which includes the margin and other structural changes. The original weighted average maturity of Ireland&rsquo;s EFSF loans was increased to 15 years at this time.</p><p>  For the EFSM facility, in October 2011 the EU Council of Ministers approved an EU Commission proposal to eliminate the margin of 2.925% on the facility which, when fully drawn, will amount to &euro;22.5 billion. This applied to EFSM disbursements back to the date upon which they were issued. The actual cost of funding depends on the prevailing market rates at the time of each drawdown. The original weighted average maturity of EFSM was extended from 7.5 years to 12.5 years at this time. </p><p>  The United Kingdom bilateral loan of GBP 3.3 billion has been re-negotiated to remove the interest rate margin of 2.29% although the base interest rate has been changed from a GBP interest rate swap level to the UK Debt Management Office cost of funds plus a service fee of 0.18%. The bilateral loans with Sweden and Denmark, which will amount to total disbursements of &euro;1 billion by the end of the programme, were negotiated after the interest rate margin reductions on both the EFSF and EFSM facilities and their interest rate is floating three month EURIBOR plus a margin of 1.00%. </p><p>  Given these interest cost changes, the total savings on the original EU facilities, based on the original average maturity of 7.5 years, is some &euro;9 billion, or approximately 5.5% of 2012 GDP. This reduces the annual repayment on these loans by an average of &euro;1.2 billion per year over the initially envisaged 7.5 years.</p><p>  In April of this year, EU Finance Ministers agreed in principle to further extend the maximum weighted average maturities on our EFSF and EFSM loans by up to 7 years, over and above the extension agreed in 2011. This further maturity extension removes a refinancing requirement of some &euro;20 billion for the Irish State in the years 2015 to 2022.   This extension of maturities has a number of significant benefits for Ireland, including smoothing our redemption profile, improving long term debt sustainability and it also has a positive impact on the cost of Exchequer borrowing through creating further downward pressure on our borrowing costs.  </p><p>  As you are aware the Euro-Area Heads of State or Government agreed on 29th June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns, and that when a Single Supervisory Mechanism is in place involving the ECB, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) could recapitalize banks directly. The Euro-Area Heads of State or Government confirmed this position and mandated EU Finance Ministers to prepare an operational framework by mid-2013.</p><p>  A considerable amount of work has been undertaken at technical, senior official and Ministerial level on the ESM&rsquo;s Direct Bank Recapitalisation Instrument (DBR). This work culminated in agreement on the main features of the operational framework for the ESM&rsquo;s DBR Instrument at the June 20th Eurogroup meeting of Euro-Area Finance Ministers in Luxembourg.</p><p>  We have succeeded in having specific provision for retrospective recapitalisation included in the framework, which states that &ldquo;The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.&rdquo; There is still a lot of negotiation to be done on this but the agreement now in place keeps the possibility to apply to the ESM for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks open for us, should we wish to avail of it. </p><p>  This overall framework builds upon the agreement secured on the 29th of June 2012, and is an important step in the Euro Area&rsquo;s efforts in this regard.</p><p>  It is expected that the earliest date that the ESM Direct Bank Recapitalisation Instrument can come into effect will be around mid-2014, given the need to satisfy national procedures, and also the requirement to have the Single Supervisory Mechanism in place and operational beforehand. </p><p>  In February this year, the successful conclusion of negotiations with the ECB facilitated the replacement by the Irish Government of the Promissory Notes issued to IBRC with a series of longer term, non-amortising floating rate Government bonds. This has resulted in significant benefits to the State including spreading the cost of the Promissory Notes from a weighted average life of c.7-8 years to c.34-35 years at a lower funding cost for the State, resulting in significant annual interest savings.</p><p>  There have been no renegotiations of the bank guarantee at EU/ECB/IMF level and therefore no savings arise. It may be said, however, that the general improvement in financial stability that the Government has brought about through the actions that it has taken, facilitated the ending of the bank guarantee for new liabilities from 29 March, 2013, onwards. </p></reply>

It is the Government's vision that all viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy. The working capital requirements of many SMEs are often fulfilled by short term credit in the form of overdrafts or short term loans.   The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion last year and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks have achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets and the recent Credit Review Office report commented &#8220;At the end of quarter 1, both banks' sanctions are on or near where they would be expected to meet the target, taking account of the seasonality which has been identified over the past two years.&#8221; </p><p>  The pillar banks are expected to lend to viable businesses both for investment and working capital purposes. The Credit Review Office is available to assist businesses which have been refused credit. The recent CRO report shows that the Credit Review Office upheld the credit appeal in 135 cases or 57% of cases decided. The upheld appeals have resulted in &euro;16.8M credit being made available to SMEs and farms, protecting 1,297 jobs. This shows that there is a strong prospect of success for SMEs going to the Credit Review Office and I would strongly encourage SMEs refused credit to seek a review by the Office. </p><p>  The Government has taken a number of actions, particularly where SMEs have been refused credit, to improve the situation in relation to credit availability to SMEs. </p><p>  The Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee scheme addresses the situation where the SME is outside the risk appetite of the banks. This can arise because the SME's lack of collateral or the banks' lack of understanding of the business model, the market, the sector or the technology. The three main SME lenders are all participating in the Guarantee scheme. </p><p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme will provide loans of up to &euro;25k to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, who have commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.   <i></i></p></reply>

They are informed by consultation with key education partners and by the findings of recent research. The guidelines provide practical guidance to post-primary schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. </p><p>  The Guidelines have been developed to bring coherence to and build upon the multitude of practices that are already in place in schools to promote well-being. They emphasise the need to integrate all elements by using a coordinated whole-school approach in the promotion of positive mental health. This involves building and integrating school self-evaluation processes, implementing the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, developing the whole-school guidance plan, adopting the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support, and building effective inter-agency relationships. Support for schools will be integrated into existing CPD work plans for the SPHE support service and will be coordinated nationally in collaboration with NEPS and HSE to ensure a streamlined approach. Copies of the Guidelines have been circulated to schools authorities.</p><p>  In addition in the same period I had published, along with my colleague, Minister Fitzgerald, an Action Plan on Bullying which sets out twelve actions to help prevent and tackle bullying in primary and second level schools. I have ring-fenced &euro;500,000 to support implementation of these actions this year.</p><p>  Officials from my Department have already commenced work on the implementation of the actions. In particular, an awareness raising initiative on cyber bullying targeted at young people is already underway and my Department is supporting the Stand Up! Awareness Week Against Homophobic &amp;amp; Transphobic Bullying in second level schools which took place in March. </p><p>Work has also commenced on developing new anti-bullying procedures for schools in consultation with the school management bodies, teacher unions and national parents councils. These new procedures are due to issue to schools for the start of the next school year. Preliminary work has commenced on other aspects of the Action Plan on Bullying. Implementation will continue in the coming months.</p><p>  Also the Framework for Junior Cycle, published in October 2012, is underpinned by 8 principles one of which is &quot;Wellbeing&quot;, Through Wellbeing &quot;the student experience will contribute directly to their physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing and resilience. Learning takes place in a climate focused on collective wellbeing of school, community and society&quot;. The Framework contains 24 Statements of Learning which students should experience. One of these statements aims to ensure that the student &quot;takes action to safeguard and promote his/her wellbeing and that of others&quot;. </p><p>  In addition, there are six key skills required for successful learning by students across the curriculum and for learning beyond school. One of the six key skills of Junior Cycle is &quot;Staying Well&quot;.</p><p>As part of the revised Junior Cycle, short courses are being prepared by the NCCA not only in PE but also in SPHE and will be available for schools from September 2014. These courses may be assessed as a part of the School Certificate in the new Junior Cycle.</p><p>  The overall focus of my Departments Well-being and Suicide prevention policy is to provide a safe and supportive growing environment for students imparting skills and knowledge in relation to their emotional well-being and development and assisting them to seek help when they or their peers are in crisis or approaching crisis. Programmes such as Asist and SafeTALK are designed to impart skills and knowledge in recognising developing emotional crisis situations among young people and identifying the appropriate support and referral paths to tend to their needs. Both programmes, in the formal education setting, are by their nature aimed at adults tending to young people rather then for use by young people themselves.</p></reply>

I will seek to publish the Bill in draft form to allow a full public discussion, including inputs from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection and the education partners. I also intend to publish draft regulations that I plan to make when the Bill is enacted.  In bringing forward these proposals, it is not my intention to unnecessarily intrude into how schools do their business. My policy objective is to ensure that the way in which schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent.  As the Bill and the Regulations will be published in draft form, they will also be subject to a lot of detailed scrutiny before becoming law. I will be reflecting carefully on the views expressed in the consultation process to ensure they strike the right balance between school autonomy and fairness in our education system.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  Whereas the allocations of SNA support for individual schools may change each year in line with a schools enrolment of children with care needs, there has been no reduction to the overall number of SNA posts being provided for schools for the coming school year. This provision remains at 10,575 posts, which is the same number as in recent years, and will ensure that all children who qualify for access to SNA support for the coming school year will receive access to such support. There has been no cut to the number of SNA posts available for allocation.  Allocations are made to schools annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support each year. Where a school may  receive a reduction in SNA support in a given school year, this is not a cut to support, but a reflection of the number of qualifying children and the extent of care support that they require.</p><p>  Details of the SNA allocations which have been made to schools by the NCSE for the 2013/2014 school year are available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie, which provides details of the SNA allocations for each school on a school by school and per county basis, including schools in Ballymun and Finglas, Dublin.</p></reply>

While some students may have had the impression that a grant award would be made to them on the basis of their telephone discussion with SUSI regarding the progress or detailed aspects of their application, I understand that it is the policy of SUSI not to confirm or give any indication to students regarding the decision or award of a grant otherwise than formally in writing and following full assessment.  There are internal review procedures as well as internal and external appeals mechanisms in place whereby students may query or appeal any aspect of the assessment of their grant application by SUSI and there is also the possibility of referral to the Ombudsman in respect of SUSI&rsquo;s administrative procedures. </p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that, in the context of SUSI having received in excess of 69,000 applications in 2012/13, some administrative errors will inevitably arise when handling a high volume of applications within a relatively short timeframe.  In a very small number of cases where an administrative error was made by SUSI in actually awarding a grant, and the formal award of a grant in writing was subsequently rescinded by SUSI, the grant scheme does not provide for the award of a grant where the applicant is not entitled to receive a grant under the terms of the scheme. </p></reply>

In line with these recommendations and in preparation for the 2013/14 academic year, both the online application system and the application assessment process have been further developed to enhance their effectiveness and to deal with the difficulties experienced in year one.  A number of new initiatives will make the application process more efficient this year including direct information sharing between SUSI and Government agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection, the General Register Office and the Central Applications Office. These links should significantly reduce the number of documents required from applicants themselves.</p><p>  In addition the staff resources recommended by the review have already been sanctioned. The resources include three additional management posts and some 23 (whole time equivalent) additional processing staff. This will help to ensure that qualifying students have their applications assessed as quickly as possible. SUSI has also significantly developed its training programme to meet the training needs of new and existing staff.  In addition, the closing date will be a month earlier to facilitate earlier application and decision on a grant application. Also SUSI is working closely with all third level institutions to improve the payment process for the 2013/14 academic year.</p></reply>

This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and nearly 10,000 Learning Support and Resource Teachers.  These resources have been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position.  The ongoing commitment of my Government to protecting frontline supports for children with special educational needs is an acknowledgment of the important role played by SNAs and resource teachers in ensuring that children with special needs can progress and develop and be included in mainstream school settings.</p><p>  Whereas the allocations of SNA support for individual schools may change each year in line with a schools enrolment of children with care needs, there has been no reduction to the overall number of SNA posts being provided for schools for the coming school year. This provision remains at 10,575 posts, which will ensure that all children who qualify for access to SNA support for the coming school year will receive access to such support. The total number of SNA posts allocated to schools for the 2012/13 school year was 10,487 posts. For the 2011/12 school year it was 10,320 posts. It is estimated that there will be sufficient SNA posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such support in the coming school year.</p><p>  In relation to the allocation of resource teaching support for schools from September 2013, demand for support has risen again this year, due to a combination of demographic growth and increased assessments.  Despite the fact that the overall number of posts available to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) for allocation to schools had been maintained at existing levels, the allocations initially announced by the NCSE on 19th June were reduced to take into account of the growth in demand, within the maintained number of posts, in order to ensure that equivalent allocations could be made for all qualifying children.  On 25th of June, I announced that I have now authorised the NCSE to restore the level of resource teaching allocations which can be provided for students with special educational needs to the 2012/13 levels. This will mean that there will not now be any reduction to resource teaching time for children over the level which applied last year.</p><p>  I also committed to ensuring that the resources which will be required to ensure that the allocations can be made to schools at existing levels will be provided, including resources required to meet any late demand expected to arise between now and the start of the school year.  The NCSE have now published revised details of the Resource Teaching allocations for all schools, based on existing allocation levels. Details of these allocations are now provided at www.ncse.ie.  In the longer term, it is proposed to develop a new model to improve how resources for children with special Educational needs are allocated to schools.  I am concerned that the scale of increased demand for resource teachers this year, if it were to continue, would make the current system unsustainable.  I am asking the NCSE to consider the reasons for the unprecedented 12 per cent rise in applications for resource teacher support this year, which compares with an annual 1.3 per cent increase in the number of students attending school in the current year.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools.  I have, as suggested by the Report, requested the NCSE to establish a Working Group to develop a proposal, for consideration, for a new allocation model for teaching supports for children with Special Educational Needs based on the profiled educational needs of children in schools.  In the interim, I wish to ensure that children will not be disadvantaged while we move towards a new model which will ensure greater fairness and quality of education for children with special educational needs. That is why I have made the decision to maintain the existing allocation levels this year.</p></reply>

This process is ongoing.  </p><p>  My Department's policy on the education of children with Autism resides within the overall policies on the education of children with special educational needs.  In the main these policies are non condition specific.  In this context, the Autism policy, whether expressed in a multiple of documents or in a single document, should not be viewed as a separate 'stand alone' policy.  The new policy statement will not be exclusive.  Policies are subject of necessity to change from time to time.  Also, the new statement will neither alter nor add to existing policy. It will reflect the current policy in a coherent and articulate manner for the benefit of schools and parents. </p><p>  My Department is conscious of the need to adapt existing policies and to develop new policies as new research or learning becomes available.  The National Council for Special Education has a formal role under Section 20.1(j) of EPSEN to advise the Minister 'in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities'.  I have now requested the NCSE to prepare Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.  The NCSE have commissioned research which will not be finalised until mid to late 2014 and I expect that this research will inform much of the work in preparing the policy advice. Accordingly it is not expected that the report will be finalised until early 2015.</p></reply>

Applied Behavioural Analysis, or ABA, is one of the approaches used in special classes for children with autism. </p><p>  The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues. My Department supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use. However, the Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that ABA should be the only approach used. While ABA helps to improve behaviour, other approaches, such as Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills. It is important that children have access to a range of approaches so that their broader needs can be met. As children differ significantly from one another and as children's needs vary and change over time, it is not possible to impose a method or approach that will work for all children with autism. This child centred approach is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism. </p><p>  The Deputy may be interested to note that teachers in special schools have been using ABA principles for more than 25 years. ABA involves the systematic application, at any time during the child's day, of behavioural principles to modify behaviour. The effectiveness of behavioural interventions to improve the performance of children with autism and to ameliorate behavioural difficulties has been recognized for decades. </p><p>To clarify the position regarding psychological assessment reports prepared by health service staff which identify a child's educational needs, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has provided guidance to their staff which clarifies that if a report prepared by HSE staff identifies a child's educational needs the report should not specify how the education sector should meet those needs. </p></reply>

My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability. Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided.</p><p>  The allocation of home based provision to siblings for July Provision is reflective of the school grouping principle.

The age or ability of siblings is reflected in their education level as determined by education and health professionals. In general where a child is receiving their education in a class setting with other children of mixed age and ability, this should carry through to their July Provision.</p><p>  However in recognition of the differing needs of some siblings, including the brothers referred to by the Deputy, separate allocations can considered on a case by case basis. Applications in this regard will require supporting documentation including professional reports from a psychologist or a letter from the principal of the school detailing the existing arrangements currently in place for the respective children and providing reasons why they cannot be tutored together in the home.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such supports.</p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are on the Department's website. Where a NEPS psychologist is not assigned to a school, authorities therein may access psychological assessments through SCPA. Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. </p><p>  It should be noted that in common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for a pupil's initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. </p><p>  It is the responsibility of the school Principal in the first instance to identify and prioritise pupils for assessment under the process described above. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that some parents also acquire assessments for their children either privately, or through an assessment by the Health Service Executive.</p><p>  As all applications low incidence resource teaching support are considered by the NCSE, I have referred the Deputy's question regarding the nauture of the supporting assessments which have accompanied such applications for support to the NCSE in 2011 and 2012, and the number of applications approved, for their consideration and direct reply to the Deputy. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools. This policy advice is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  The policy advice concluded that children with special educational needs are well supported in schools. However, the NCSE also concluded that the current allocation system does not always provide all children with special educational needs with the same access to supports, as some children may be delayed in receiving supports due to  difficulties in accessing an assessment for a diagnosis of disability which is needed to trigger additional teaching support for students with more complex disabilities under the current allocation system.</p><p>  I have, therefore, as recommended by the Report, requested the NCSE to establish a Working Group which will consider this issue and develop a proposal, for consideration, for a new allocation model for teaching supports for children with Special Educational Needs based on the profiled educational needs of children in schools. </p></reply>

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. </p><p>  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention. This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. This process has been embedded by NEPS psychologists in the Primary sector with the production by the Department of Special Educatioal Needs - A Continuum of Support guidance and resource materials which has been distributed to all schools since 2007/8. In late 2010 similar support documentation was produced in relation to Emotional and Behavioural difficulties in the Primary sector and in relation to a formal Post-Primary Continuum process.  </p><p>  The continua described above all involve a graduated problem solving model of assessment and intervention in schools processes which moves from basic classroom based interventions to more specialised and individual interventions and comprise three distinct school based phases characterised as follows:</p><p>  Classroom Support - is an intervention which is co-ordinated by the Class Teacher and is carried out in the regular classroom,</p><p>  School Support - is an assessment and intervention process which is usually co-ordinated by the learning support/resource teacher working alongside the class teacher. Interventions at this stage will be additional to those provided through classroom support.</p><p>  School Support Plus - is generally characterised by the school requesting the involvement by the relevant external service (predominantly NEPS) in more detailed assessment and development of intervention programmes. This level of intervention is for children with complex and/or enduring needs and whose progress is considered inadequate, despite carefully planned interventions at previous levels. </p><p>  The staged model recognises that pupils present with a wide range of issues and difficulties and allows for their amelioration and intervention at the level most appropriate to the particular need.

This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and nearly 10,000 Learning Support and Resource Teachers. These resources have been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position.</p><p>  In relation to special needs assistants, there has been no proposed cut to SNA numbers or their working hours. Whereas the allocations of SNA support for individual schools may change each year in line with a schools enrolment of children with care needs, there has been no reduction to the overall number of SNA posts being provided for schools for the coming school year. This provision remains at 10,575 posts, which will ensure that all children who qualify for access to SNA support for the coming school year will receive access to such support. </p><p>  The total number of SNA posts allocated to schools for the 2012/13 school year was 10,487 posts. For the 2011/12 school year it was 10,320 posts. The demand for SNAs for the 2013/2104 school year currently stands at 10,490 leaving some 85 posts available for late demand. It is therefore estimated that there will be sufficient SNA posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such support in the coming school year. </p><p>  In relation to the allocation of resource teaching support for schools from September 2013, demand for support has risen again this year, due to a combination of demographic growth and an increased number of assessments.</p><p>  The overall number of posts available to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) for allocation to schools had been maintained at existing levels and accordingly the allocations initially announced by the NCSE on 19th June were reduced to take into account of the growth in demand, within the maintained number of posts, in order to ensure that equivalent allocations could be made for all qualifying children.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I announced recently that I have now authorised the NCSE to restore the level of resource teaching allocations which can be provided for students with special educational needs to the 2012/13 levels. This will mean that there will not now be any reduction to resource teaching time for children on the level which applied last year.</p><p>I also committed to ensuring that the resources which will be required to ensure that the allocations can be made to schools at existing levels will be provided, including resources required to meet any late demand expected to arise between now and the start of the school year.</p><p>  The NCSE have now published revised details of the Resource Teaching allocations for all schools, based on existing allocation levels. Details of these allocations are now provided at www.ncse.ie. </p><p>  I am concerned that the scale of increased demand for resource teachers this year, if it were to continue, would make the current system unsustainable.</p><p>  I have therefore asked the NCSE to consider the reasons for the unprecedented 12 per cent rise in applications for resource teacher support this year, which compares with an annual 1.3 per cent increase in the number of students attending school in the current year. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools.</p><p>I have, as suggested by the Report, requested the NCSE to establish a Working Group to develop a proposal, for consideration, for a new allocation model for teaching supports for children with Special Educational Needs based on the profiled educational needs of children in schools.</p><p>In the interim, I wish to ensure that children will not be disadvantaged while we move towards a new model which will ensure greater fairness and quality of education for children with special educational needs.

The contractual position in respect of SNAs is outlined in their contract of employment (Department of Education and Skills Circulars 12/05 (Post-Primary) and 15/05 (Primary)).  This outlines that the allocation of special needs assistant posts to schools will be reviewed on an annual basis.  This review is conducted by the NCSE and the employment of Special Needs Assistants may be reduced from full-time to part-time or terminated by way of redundancy where the allocation is reduced.  Details of redundancy arrangements are outlined in Department Circular 58/06.  </p><p>  Under the Croke Park Agreement the Government gave a protection from compulsory redundancy to permanent public servants.  However, this does not apply to SNAs because an existing exit mechanism i.e. DES Circular 58/06 was already in existence.  This was allowed for in the Croke Park Agreement.  Recently, a new set of proposals was put forward by the Labour Relations Commission which now form the Haddington Road Agreement.  These arose from an intensive and difficult set of negotiations between the Public Services Committee of ICTU and the Government that took place against a backdrop of continuing significant difficulties in the finances of the State.  The Government has agreed to implement the terms of the Haddington Road Agreement for grades represented by Unions which have signed up to the Haddington Road Agreement. </p><p>  As both Unions that represent SNAs namely, SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to the Haddington Road Agreement, the Department has implemented supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2013/2014 school year.  The detailed arrangements are set out in Departmental Circular 0037/2013 which issued on 1 July 2013.</p></reply>

My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability.  Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided.</p><p>  The allocation of home based provision to siblings for July Provision is reflective of the school grouping principle.  This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary.  Accordingly it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home.  The school grouping principle does not purport to replicate or mirror all aspects of school based provision.  The age or ability of siblings is reflected in their education level as determined by education and health professionals.  In general where a child is receiving their education in a class setting with other children of mixed age and ability, this should carry through to their July Provision.</p><p>  However, in recognition of the differing needs of some siblings, including the brothers referred to by the Deputy, separate allocations will be considered on a case by case basis.  Applications in this regard will require supporting documentation including professional reports from a psychologist or a letter from the principal of the school detailing the existing arrangements currently in place for the respective children and providing reasons why they cannot be tutored together in the home.  Separate allocations have been made to the children referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Officials from my Department have been in communication with the person in question and have offered advice on both the parental complaint procedure and the child protection procedures.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department sets out the constitution of Boards of Management and rules of procedure but it is not directly involved in the management of schools.  Under the provisions of the Education Act, 1998, the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school, and it is the Board of Management which employs the teachers at the school.  Accordingly, whereas my Department provides funding and policy direction for schools, it does not have the power to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with regard to individual complaint cases.  The Department's role is to provide clarity and guidance to parents about how their complaint can be progressed.  It does not make judgment on individual complaints. </p><p>  The case which you reference is in a VEC school which is a statutory body that recruits, employs and pays its own staff.  Accordingly, my Department does not have a direct role in this issue and officials in my Department are not in a position legally to intervene in the dispute in question.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints relating to the administrative actions or non-actions of a school recognised by my Department, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures.  The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the administrative actions or non-actions of a school has, or may have, adversely affected the child.  If there are any child protection concerns, the person in question may wish to report the matter to the Health Service Executive (HSE), who have statutory responsibility for child protection.  On the other hand, they may wish to report the matter to my Department, who will deal with it in accordance with its procedures.  My officials have recently written to the HSE on the matter.</p><p>  As the Deputy is probably aware, on 29th of January last, Minister Fitzgerald and I published the Action Plan on Bullying which sets out twelve actions to help prevent and tackle bullying in primary and second level schools.  As part of the Action Plan, new anti-bullying procedures for all primary and second level schools are currently in development in consultation with the education partners.  These new procedures will include requirements for noting and reporting bullying incidents.  These will be issued to all schools at the beginning of the next school year.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such supports.</p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are on the Department's website.  Where a NEPS psychologist is not assigned to a school, authorities therein may access psychological assessments through SCPA.  Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. </p><p>  It should be noted that in common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for a pupil's initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention.  Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment.  It is the responsibility of the school Principal in the first instance to identify and prioritise pupils for assessment under the process described above.  The Deputy will be aware that some parents also acquire assessments for their children either privately, or through an assessment by the Health Service Executive.</p><p>  As all applications for SNA and low incidence resource teaching support are considered by the NCSE, I have referred the Deputy's question regarding the nature of the supporting assessments which have accompanied such applications for support to the NCSE, for their consideration and direct reply to the Deputy.  The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools.  This policy advice is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie.  The policy advice concluded that children with special educational needs are well supported in schools.  However, the NCSE also concluded that the current allocation system does not always provide all children with special educational needs with the same access to supports, as some children may be delayed in receiving supports due to difficulties in accessing an assessment for a diagnosis of disability which is needed to trigger additional teaching support for students with more complex disabilities.  I have, therefore, as recommended by the Report, requested the NCSE to establish a Working Group which will consider this issue and develop a proposal, for consideration, for a new allocation model for teaching supports for children with Special Educational Needs based on the profiled educational needs of children in schools.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. </p><p>  The NCSE allocates a level of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school. SNAs are then deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>  Some 10,575 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) SNA posts have been made available for allocation to schools by the NCSE for the coming school year, subject to qualifying applications being received. The number of SNA posts available for allocation has been maintained at a time when there has been a requirement to make savings across a range of expenditure areas. </p><p>  The NCSE has allocated 10,490 SNA posts to schools for the 2013/14 school year, providing for access to SNA support for 22,000 pupils. The total number of SNA posts allocated to schools for the 2012/13 school year was 10,487 posts.</p><p>  Details of the SNA allocations which have been made to schools by the NCSE for the 2013/2014 school year are now available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie, which provides details of the SNA allocations for each school on a school by school and per county basis.</p><p>  As all applications for SNA support are considered by the NCSE, I have referred the Deputy's question regarding the number of children who have been assigned SNA support for the past five years to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply to the Deputy. </p></reply>

My Department has committed to the development of such a database in it's Data Strategy 2008-2010. As part of the development of the Data Strategy consultations were carried out with many of my Department's agencies to discuss how data could best be collected and shared in a manner which reduces the overall administrative burden for the school and allows for the most efficient operation and provision of services to the pupil. </p><p>  There have been a number of developments in recent years in the area of pupil data collection from post-primary schools. My Department is currently in the process of streamlining the post-primary returns process to allow for a live online system allowing for easy exchange of information that reflects the up-to-date situation in regard to enrolment at any one time and to cut down on administrative burden and the scale of paper-based information flows across the Department and its associated agencies. This is currently in a pilot phase.</p><p>  My Department has begun preliminary work on extension of this development to primary level schools. Once this is done, my Department will have access to an integrated live Learners database covering primary and post-primary level, which will allow for the effective monitoring of progression, and for enhanced policy planning using real-time data.</p></reply>

The main highlights are: </p><p>1. Bandwidth improvements to the telecommunications infrastructure between the three main offices (Dublin, Athlone and Tullamore) has facilitated improved resilience between these locations.  Increased bandwidth has also been rolled out to 31 local/regional offices.  </p><p>2. Over the last 3 years, network storage has been consolidated, resulting in the reduction of the number of computer servers from 100 to approximately 10.  This has resulted in a reduction in the associated maintenance and running costs of the provision of network storage.</p><p>3. A major PC upgrade programme is currently underway, in the three main offices, along with an upgrade to Windows 7, Microsoft Office 2013 and rollout of Unified Communications.</p><p>4.

My Department's ICT in Schools programme sets out a clear agenda to be pursued in this regard, focusing on four main priorities: ICT Infrastructure in schools, the Schools Broadband Programme, the development of teacher skills, and the provision of curriculum-relevant digital content. On the infrastructure side, my Department distributed more than &euro;90m in ICT Infrastructure grants to schools nationwide in 2009 and 2010. The priority under this grant scheme was the equipping of all classrooms with a digital projector, teaching computer and wireless keyboard and mouse. This ICT infrastructure grant scheme is now fully disbursed. In view of budgetary pressures there are no plans to introduce a new Infrastructure Grant Scheme. However, my Department continues to fund the various elements of the ICT schools programme.  Work has commenced on the development of a new ICT Strategy for schools. The new ICT Strategy will address the new policy challenges and opportunities arising from major developments in curricular reform, digital publishing, portable computing and student devices.</p><p>  While the works covered under the Minor Works Scheme include the purchase of IT related equipment, I stated when the Minor Works Grant last issued in November 2011 for the school year 2011/2012, that given the need to focus on meeting the demand for additional school places, it was unlikely that funding would be available for the Minor Works Grant in the coming years. This is borne out by the fact that in 2012, 85% of the capital expenditure in the school sector was in respect of large scale projects, additional accommodation and prefab replacement. The balance was expended on site acquisition, emergency works, furniture and equipment provision and commitments arising from earlier years. </p><p>  The capital allocation that is available for the school sector in 2013 is expected to have a similar spend pattern as was the case in 2012 and at this time there are no plans to reinstate the Minor Works Grant. I can inform the Deputy that in the case of new schools, extensions and additional accommodation a sum of &euro;5,000 is allocated by my Department for the provision of ICT in respect of each new classroom delivered.</p></reply>

This is set out most recently to schools in Circular Letter 31/2011. Current recruitment procedures direct schools to ensure that teachers proposed for appointment to publicly paid posts must be registered with the Teaching Council and have qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the post for which they are proposed. The Teaching Council was established under the Teaching Council Act 2001 as the regulator of the teaching prefession. The Council promotes professional standards in teaching. </p><p>  The Education (Amendment) Act 2012 was enacted on 23 May 2012. This Act provides for a number of education-related matters, including provision to enable the implementation of Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act, 2001 which I intend to commence on the 1st November 2013. This will prohibit payment from public funds of people employed as  teachers in recognised school's unless they are registered with the Teaching Council except for very limited, exceptional and short- term circumstances which will be set out in Ministerial Regulations. </p><p>  This provision which is outlined in Circular 25/13 reinforces the Department's longstanding position that education in recognised schools funded by the State must be delivered by appropriately qualified teachers.</p></reply>

There are sixty-one criteria in all, sixteen essential and forty-one desirable, organised under five headings:Leadership &amp;amp; VisionICT in the CurriculumSchool ICT CultureProfessional DevelopmentResources &amp;amp; Infrastructure</p><p>  To assist in this process, participating schools use a self-evaluation tool based on the Digital Schools' criteria, to identify areas which may meet the criteria and those that require improvement. Successful schools retain their Digital School status for a period of two school years, at which time they may reapply.</p><p>  The Digital Schools Award has entered a new phase.  It is now managed by Dublin West Education Centre working closely with the PDST Technology in Education (formerly the NCTE) and other partners including the Irish Primary Principals Network (IPPN), Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) and the Computer Education Society of Ireland (CESI). </p><p>  HP Ireland (Hewlett-Packard) and Microsoft Ireland have committed expertise and resources to the new phase of the Digital Schools Award scheme and are providing worthwhile devices for schools that achieve Digital Schools status.  Both companies will be involved in a launch of the new phase in the autumn.</p><p>  Dublin West Education Centre will communicate with the 93 schools that have achieved Digital Schools status and a further 179 schools that have registered for the scheme in September.  All schools will be contacted after the launch of the new phase.</p><p>  I am keen for this project to develop and arrangements are in place for its promotion and ongoing review.</p></reply>

The curricula aim to foster self-worth, self -confidence and respectful relationships and place a particular emphasis on developing a sense of personal responsibility for one's own behaviour, feelings and actions. </p><p>  The Mental Health Guidelines for Post-Primary Schools (2013) also promote the development and implementation of relevant policies including an anti-bullying policy and code of behaviour incorporating positive behaviour management strategies and the promotion of a 'telling' culture in schools. </p><p>  I also published 'An Action Plan on Bullying' in January 2013. This Action Plan, which arises from the work of the Anti-Bullying Working Group, provides guidance to schools in the area of bullying, including cyber bullying.</p><p>  The SPHE Support Service provides for whole-staff seminars on bullying prevention and intervention and policy review and development. The Support Service also provides for school-based anti-bullying support to include, for example, administration of a student survey, the provision of a parent evening and the development of strategies for resolving bullying issues. </p><p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle that I launched in October 2012 will build on this by placing a focus on the principle of Well Being and key skills such as Managing Myself and Staying Well. It also includes a Statement of Learning that requires that students will be enabled to take action to safeguard and promote their well-being and that of others. The NCCA is currently developing a short course in SPHE which will support schools in meeting this statement of learning. </p></reply>

This service is delivered using a mix of Bus &Eacute;ireann, both school transport and road passenger vehicles, private contractor vehicles including private operator scheduled services, and Dublin Bus, Irish Rail, DART and LUAS where practical. In the region of 115,000 children avail of school transport services throughout the school year including more than 8,000 children with special educational needs.</p><p>  The terms of the scheme are applied equitably on a national basis. Children who are eligible for school transport and who hold valid Medical Cards (GMS Scheme) travel free on school transport services.</p><p>  The 2013 allocation to my Department for the provision of School Transport is almost &euro;170m. Any proposal to reduce the qualifying distance for establishing eligibility or to provide a free school bus service as suggested by the Deputy would significantly increase operating costs. For this reason, it is not intended to change the current eligibility criteria for school transport services. </p></reply>

It contains a comprehensive range of measures to build the domestic supply of ICT graduates, in the short, medium and long term, including through the roll out of the ICT graduate skills conversion programmes. </p><p>  The targets in the Action Plan were developed on the basis of research and forecasts of industry demand and graduate output carried out in 2011. The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs is in the process of updating the expected industry demand and skills supply over the coming years. The results of this research will be available shortly and will form the basis for any updates to the targets and measures outlined in the Action Plan. </p><p>  As part of the Action Plan almost 1,500 places have been provided for graduate jobseekers under two the rounds of the ICT graduate skills conversion programmes that have issued to date. More than 400 people have already graduated from these programmes and a further 300 are due to graduate before the end of this year. In addition, more than 3,700 people have enrolled on ICT programmes under the first two rounds of the Springboard reskilling initiative and a further 2,000 ICT Springboard places have been made available under the third phase of Springboard which was launched in June 2013. </p><p>  The Plan has helped to raise awareness of employment opportunities in ICT. Technology courses accounted for 20.5% of all honours degree level first preference applications through the CAO this year. The increase in demand from students for technology courses, including a 50% increase in first preference applications for computing over the past 5 years is very positive in building the future supply of graduates. </p></reply>

These links should significantly reduce the number of documents required from applicants themselves.</p><p>  In addition the staff resources recommended by the review have already been sanctioned. The resources include three additional management posts and some 23 (whole time equivalent) additional processing staff. This will help to ensure that qualifying students have their applications assessed as quickly as possible. SUSI has also significantly developed its training programme to meet the training needs of new and existing staff.</p><p>  In addition, the closing date will be a month earlier to facilitate earlier application and decision on a grant application.

They are informed by consultation with key education partners and by the findings of recent research. </p><p>  The guidelines provide practical guidance to post-primary schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. </p><p>  The Guidelines have been developed to bring coherence to and build upon the multitude of practices that are already in place in schools to promote well-being. They emphasise the need to integrate all elements by using a coordinated whole-school approach in the promotion of positive mental health. This involves building and integrating school self-evaluation processes, implementing the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, developing the whole-school guidance plan, adopting the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support, and building effective inter-agency relationships. Support for schools will be integrated into existing CPD work plans for the SPHE support service and will be coordinated nationally in collaboration with NEPS and HSE to ensure a streamlined approach. Copies of the Guidelines have been circulated to schools authorities.</p><p>  In addition in the same period I had published, along with my colleague, Minister Fitzgerald, an Action Plan on Bullying which sets out twelve actions to help prevent and tackle bullying in primary and second level schools. I have ring-fenced &euro;500,000 to support implementation of these actions this year.</p><p>  Officials from my Department have already commenced work on the implementation of the actions. In particular, an awareness raising initiative on cyber bullying targeted at young people is already underway and my Department is supporting the Stand Up! Awareness Week Against Homophobic &amp;amp; Transphobic Bullying in second level schools which took place in March. </p><p>Work has also commenced on developing new anti-bullying procedures for schools in consultation with the school management bodies, teacher unions and national parents councils. These new procedures are due to issue to schools for the start of the next school year. Preliminary work has commenced on other aspects of the Action Plan on Bullying. Implementation will continue in the coming months.</p><p>  In addition, the Framework for Junior Cycle, published in October 2012, is underpinned by 8 principles one of which is &quot;Wellbeing&quot;, Through Wellbeing &quot;the student experience will contribute directly to their physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing and resilience. Learning takes place in a climate focused on collective wellbeing of school, community and society&quot;. The Framework contains 24 Statements of Learning which students should experience. One of these statements aims to ensure that the student &quot;takes action to safeguard and promote his/her wellbeing and that of others&quot;. </p><p>  In addition, there are six key skills required for successful learning by students across the curriculum and for learning beyond school. One of the six key skills of Junior Cycle is &quot;Staying Well&quot;.</p><p>As part of the revised Junior Cycle, short courses are being prepared by the NCCA not only in PE but also in SPHE and will be available for schools from September 2014. These courses may be assessed as a part of the School Certificate in the new Junior Cycle.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of the legislation is to implement the proposed pay reduction for public servants earning annual salaries of &euro;65,000 or more, and the parallel reduction in public service pensions over &euro;32,500. </p><p>  Contingency measures that may be deployed to secure the necessary reductions in the public service pay and pensions bill are also included in the legislation, including provision for a universal freeze on pay increments. The Act also affirms that the person, which may be a line Minister or other public service body, that has the power to determine terms and conditions of employment may exercise that power to reduce non-core rates of pay or to increase hours worked. However, under the legislation, a facility is provided for unions and representative associations to conclude collective agreements with their public service employers. </p><p>  Where a union has signed up to a collective agreement, now called the Haddington Road Agreement, it will avoid the need for those contingency measures to be used. It is a matter for public servants and their representative unions and associations to decide if they wish to conclude a collective agreement with their employers. Non-union members are not included in the balloting process undertaken by unions but the legislation or the public service as an employer does not distinguish between those employees who are members or not members of unions and changes in terms and conditions are applied on a grade basis.</p><p>  With regard to those grades represented by a union who do not conclude a collective agreement under the Act, as well as the increment freeze that will apply directly under the terms of the Act, the relevant decision maker will have to take the necessary measures to meet their targeted paybill savings in 2013 and following years.  <i></i></p></reply>

The Bill will provide a single overarching framework protecting whistleblowers  in all sectors of the economy by ensuring that safeguards exist where reprisals are taken against them by their employers. The objective is to encourage workers to raise genuine concerns concerning potential wrongdoing in the workplace with a view to ensuring that employers can take ameliorating action at the earliest possible opportunity.</p><p>  The Bill establishes a broad range of potential wrongdoings to which the disclosure must relate and a number of distinct disclosure channels including to an employer, a prescribed person, the Minister responsible for a public body, a legal adviser or otherwise potentially to the public domain. Special disclosure channels will apply in the case of external disclosures relating to law enforcement, security, intelligence, defence and international relations matters. The Bill will therefore provide a detailed and comprehensive statutory framework for the protection of, and securing redress for workers, who suffer penalisation at the hands of their employer for having made a protected disclosure.   <i></i></p></reply>

In this regard, Minister of State Brian Hayes is working with Senator Feargal Quinn to develop the Senator's private member's Construction Contracts Bill into a robust piece of legislation. The Bill has passed Committee Stage.</p><p>  The key objective of the Construction Contracts Bill is to ensure that cash flows down the supply chain on all construction contracts. This issue is addressed in the Bill by providing statutory arrangements in relation to payments under construction contracts, including providing for interim payments. These minimum conditions of contract are provided for in Section 3 and the accompanying schedule to the Bill. The Bill also provides the means for subcontractors to enforce these rights; by suspending their labour and the provision of statutory adjudication. </p><p>  My officials are developing a Code of Practice for the adjudication process. The Deputy will appreciate that the Bill has not passed all stages in both Houses and therefore further work will be required before such a Code could be finalised. This is a complex area and as such it is essential that these complex issues are properly assessed so as to avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory or cost burdens on parties in dispute, the State or others. In this regard, it is likely that a brief consultation with the relevant stakeholders will be required. This legislation is a priority for Government and whilst every effort is being made to have the legislation and ensuing regulation passed as quickly as possible it is important to put in place, one which is robust and effective.  <i></i></p></reply>

They are not required to pass this information to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p><p>  However the Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC) has had a monitoring process in place since 2008, and a sample is taken of significant public works contracts completed.  The sample assesses the effectiveness and impact of the Construction Procurement Reform Initiative, focusing on comparing measures such as; contractual fixed price lump sum figures and final outturn costs, contractual delivery periods and actual time for delivery. </p><p>  To summarise, there were 165 sample projects monitored by the GCCC, which included 91 Building projects and 74 Civil Engineering projects; the initial contract value for the works contracts amounted to &euro;971.8m with a 7.3% deviation from tender price at completion stage (8.9% on Civil Engineering projects and 2.9% on Building projects), which the Deputy should note is based on both actual and projected final account figures.  The information is not available on a yearly basis.  Change orders accounted for some of the deviation from tender price (3.7% on Civil Engineering projects based on information available on 16 projects from the above sample; and 2.8% on Building projects based on 49 projects).  Change orders may be issued for any of the following three reasons: (i) for legitimate and acceptable reasons, (ii) a result of inadequate planning and design before contract award and (iii) scope changes.  Contracting authorities were not required to include specific reasons for the deviations where they occurred.  <i></i></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-02a.955.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070200077#WRU02600"><p>Under EU law, public contracts above a certain values must be advertised EU-wide and awarded to the most competitive tender in an open and objective process. The aim is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.</p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS), which will be transferring into the new Office of Government Procurement (OGP), has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service's buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have a number benefits that include: cash savings;  administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise;  improved consistency; and  enhanced service levels. </p><p>  In some instances the take up of the NPS arrangements has been low. In order to increase the usage of a limited number of NPS framework arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements. Last year my Department issued Circular 06/12 which implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. These national arrangements will secure best value for money and facilitate contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.  </p><p>  Where a mandatory framework arrangement exists, any public service body intending to make a purchase other than through the NPS framework arrangement will need to ensure that it can explain the rationale for not using the NPS arrangement by providing a value for money justification that takes account of the full costs including those incurred in managing its own procurement process. </p><p>  While the key purpose of Circular 6/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money, it is worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, these need not be accepted as the norm. The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring on-going cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions.  </p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide. Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.</p><p>To summarise: we in government want better value for money for our substantial procurement spend.  To ensure the reform process takes account of the needs of stakeholders further consultations will be undertaken with industry representative associations, employees and workers' representatives as the new Office of Government Procurement is established.  We are committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged in the process and will be encouraged, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work.  <i></i></p></reply>

The introduction of a Code of Practice is intended to achieve such a balance taking into account the interests of all stakeholders in the grocery goods sector including the interests of the consumer and the need to ensure that there is no impediment to the passing-on of lower prices to consumers.</p></reply>

If a company fails to comply with the Section, the company and every officer of the company who is in default shall be guilty of an offence.</p><p>A company may be struck off the register for failure to file an annual return. If a company is struck off, the assets of the company become vested in the Minister for Finance, and if the business continues to trade, the members will no longer enjoy the benefit of limited liability and so are personally responsible for any debts incurred as long as the company remains struck off.</p><p>Any person, who was a director of a company at the date of sending to that company of a strike off notice due to the non-filing of annual returns, may be disqualified from acting as a director by the High Court, where the company is struck off leaving outstanding liabilities. Such order may be made by the Court on the application of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p><p>The Registrar of Companies may prosecute companies and/or directors in the District Court for failure to file annual returns and accounts on behalf of their companies. In addition, she may also apply to the High Court for an order directing the filing of outstanding annual returns and accounts within the period specified in the order and she may seek to have all the costs of and incidental to that application, borne by the defaulting company or its officers.</p><p>There are also other sanctions in relation to the failure to file or the late filing of annual returns. A late filing penalty of &euro;100 becomes due in respect of an annual return on the day after the expiry of the filing deadline, i.e. 28 days after the effective date of the return. A daily penalty amount of &euro;3 accrues thereafter up to a maximum penalty of &euro;1,240 per return. This penalty is in addition to the standard fee for filing the return.</p><p>A company with a record of persistent late filing may also be subject to an on-the-spot fine and/or summary prosecution of the company and/or any officer in default. Fines of up to &euro;1,904.61 can be imposed on conviction for breach of the annual return filing requirements. In addition, a company cannot avail of the exemption from the requirement for a statutory audit if its annual return for the current year or the previous year was not filed on time.</p><p>In 2011 the Company Law Review Group, the statutory body which advises me on Company Law matters, published its examination of certain aspects of the late filing penalty regime.  The Group noted that prior to 2001, only 13% of companies filed their annual returns on time, whereas in 2010 only 12% of companies were late filing their returns. It recommended that no changes should be made to the current system.</p><p>I have no plans to expand the range of penalties attaching to the late filing of annual returns.</p></reply>

A main element to the process is the delivery of a &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; service from an integrated office location in line with best international practice.<i>  </i>  The delivery of over 60 Intreo Offices is a major logistical property project for the Department and the Office of Public Works who are responsible for the provision of the Department&rsquo;s property requirements, including refurbishment and fit out works.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s Intreo initiative is being progressively rolled out to its national network of local offices. The new service comprises a number of elements, the main components being: activation measures such as client profiling, early group engagement and one-to-one meetings which focus on customised employment supports and monitoring of each client&rsquo;s progress; an integrated decision-making process leading to swifter throughput of decisions; and an integrated reception providing a one-stop-shop incorporating all strands of the Department&rsquo;s employment and income support services are part of the new service.</p><p>It is important to note that elements of the service, described above, are proceeding across the Department&rsquo;s network of offices - before individual offices are fully developed to Intreo specifications.  Therefore it is intended to implement the integrated decisions and systematic activation process in all offices during 2013.</p><p>In addition, the Intreo roll-out is being supported by a training and development plan for all offices to equip staff and management to deliver this new service.</p><p>The most important criteria with the project to deliver Intreo offices nationwide is to ensure that the Department is providing accommodation that is of a quality standard for both customers and for staff, while ensuring that the Department is achieving value for money.   While 14 offices were originally scheduled for completion in 2012, 10 offices were completed and works had commenced on a further 2 offices, which since have been completed.  Delays to the project included issues concerning: significant IR issues around the removal of glass from the Integrated Reception areas which went to arbitration and required an independent assessment by Health and Safety Consultants; upgrading the broadband connectivity to each office to cater for the delivery of the Intreo service; additional space requirements to improve the service and integrate staff from three separate areas into one location; twelve offices are now providing the full Intreo service; and a list of these offices with a breakdown of costs is shown in the attached table.  At present works are underway at Loughrea, Achill and Clifden and these are due for completion by the end of July.  Works are due to be completed in the Tullamore and Kilkenny offices by the end of August.  The Intreo roll-out operates on a rolling programme and is heavily weighted towards a significant number of offices completed by the end 2013.  Preparations are underway in other offices and it is expected that a total of 43 offices will be delivering the Intreo service by the end of 2013.</p><p>Some of the Department&rsquo;s existing buildings require minor structural works, while other buildings, because of their condition, health and safety issues or limited space availability will either need major structural works or replacement offices to be sought.  It is not possible to list the work specifications for all offices as each office is different and depending on the individual assessment and briefs, they will have different specifications.  However, in relation to work specifications, the works at an Intreo Office typically include: provision of an integrated reception; a Group Engagement Room; public Services Card stations; adequate number of interview rooms; and new external and internal signage</p><p>In addition, provision has to be made for electrical and mechanical works, furniture, fittings, installation of CCTV and queuing systems, as required.  Expenditure on the rollout of Intreo offices to date in 2013 is estimated at almost &euro;2m.

I accept that there may be some circumstances where an education sector internship experience would not be affected by the academic holidays.  </p><p>  However, it would not be feasible to review and examine all placements advertised within the education sector on a case by case basis. Therefore, a clear and transparent operational decision was made that all such placements must coincide with the academic year.  Deadlines have been introduced, before which and after which education sector internships will not be approved.  These deadlines have been clearly advertised on the home page of the JobBridge website since August 2012.  All affected Host Organisations have been written to by the Department and have been requested to further remind their interns of the closing date for these internships.    </p><p>  The Department works with stakeholders to make JobBridge as easy to administer as possible but the first concern has to be for interns, to ensure that they are not idle or deprived of the high quality real workplace internship experience that they deserve and that is in the interests of the taxpayer as well as the jobseeker in maximizing their future employment opportunities.  The Department will however review the position in respect of the internship referred to by the Deputy. </p></reply>

The recommendations referred to by the Deputy are contained in the European Commission's <i>Economic Adjustment Programme for Ireland - Winter 2012 Review</i>. </p><p>  With regards to redeployment of staff, it is true that the  implementation of a more intensive and rigorous case management will require additional resources to be devoted to the activation process.

A target to redeploy three hundred staff in the current year has been set and the Department is currently in the process of planning this redeployment. I expect that the redeployment will be completed on target by the year end.</p><p>  With regards to outsourcing activation functions, the Pathways to Work initiative launched last year signalled the potential of contracting with third party providers to complement the existing capacity of the department to deliver employment services.  The potential contribution of such contracting and the design of a contracting approach has since been considered by the Department working with an Interdepartmental group, comprising representatives of this department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the National Economic and Social Council, the Offices of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor. The Department also availed of expert international advice. Arising from this evaluation, the Cabinet Committee on Pathways to Work approved in principle a proposal to tender for the provision of employment services and agreed to the issue of a Prior Information Notice (PIN) which was published on 28 June. This notice formally notifies the market that the State intends to procure employment services. A PIN is a discretionary and exploratory first step in a procurement process.  The publication of a PIN will enable the State to engage with potential vendors and other interested parties to gauge the level of market interest and assist in finalising tender/contract design.  </p><p>  With regards to the reform of employment support schemes, the Department conducted an extensive review of employment support in 2012 which was published by the Minister in January of this year and followed up by a stakeholders' conference in February which the Minister convened. The stakeholder forum canvassed the views of stakeholders on review recommendations and was a very important step in the review process and all inputs were recorded and published in a separate review available on www.welfare.ie  . The Department has now moved to the implementation phase and work will be on going through 2013. The process of re-aligning work schemes into community support and activation focused strands has commenced and will gather momentum later in the year, following a review of existing administrative processes and the roll out of a revised childcare programme. The selection of community employment scheme participants is now the responsibility of DSP case officers and this change will facilitate the implementation of further changes.</p></reply>

Typically, these workers provide services in rural and less densely populated areas but larger urban centres may also have a cohort of part-time workers. Retained fire-fighters who are otherwise unemployed are entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment in respect of days that they are engaged in fire-fighting or training.  They are, however, required to satisfy the statutory conditions for the receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment of being available for and genuinely seeking work.  Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions is not entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.   Taking account of the unusual circumstances of retained fire personnel the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 carried amendments to both jobseekers benefit and jobseekers allowance that put the treatment of retained fire fighters on a legislative basis.  The legislation and associated regulations will allow retained fire-fighters a reasonable and fair level of access to the schemes in future.  The revised provisions will apply only to claims received on or after enactment of the relevant legislation. </p></reply>

However, the Department has taken initiatives to raise mental health awareness among its staff.</p><p>  Since 2010, Mental Health Ireland has assisted in the delivery of a one-day training course to staff in the Department to raise awareness of mental health issues.  356 staff members have received this training to date.  Local mental health support organisations, such as AWARE, have also been invited to talk to staff where a need is identified.</p><p>  In addition, following feedback from frontline staff and management, a need was recognised to support staff in dealing with customers who identify themselves as having thoughts of suicide. Over the past year, with assistance from the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP), the Department has provided &lsquo;safeTALK&rsquo; training to 82 frontline staff.  This training programme helps prepare participants to identify persons with thoughts of suicide and connect them to suicide first aid resources.</p><p>  Also this year, the NOSP has provided access to the ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills) training workshop to the Department&rsquo;s staff.  This two-day workshop trains participants to reduce the immediate risk of a suicide and increase the support for a person at risk.  A small number of staff has received this training to date.</p><p>  The Department will continue to provide these mental health training supports to frontline staff and management.</p></reply>

There are 13 cycles in a 52-week CE project year.<b></b> Community Employment (CE) Sponsors are required to pay the participants (employees) on a weekly basis (current week).  At the end of each 4-week cycle, the Sponsor can claim a grant from the Department towards the cost of wages paid over the previous four weeks.  Wage grants are therefore paid in arrears and only on receipt of the correctly completed claim forms.</p><p>  To assist Sponsors with cash flow prior to the start-up date of the CE project, voluntary sector Sponsors can claim an Initial Grant equivalent to eight weeks advance of employee wages.  Public Sector Sponsors can claim an advance equivalent to four weeks wages.  This once-off advance is intended to ease any cashflow difficulties that may otherwise be encountered in the first weeks of the project and can be used to cover participant wages, Supervisor wages, materials or training expenses.  The advance payment will be recouped or &quot;clawed-back&quot; by DSP in instalments over the remainder of the project (Cycles 3 to 12).</p><p>  After each cycle, the wage claim is sent in the form of an Application for Wages and Supervision (AWS), signed by the Sponsor to the DSP Officer with responsibility for the project. The Officer signs off electronically on the AWS sheet via the Community Service Management System (CSM) and sends it for approval via the CSM to the local DSP Manager. Once approved by the Manager, it is automatically processed for payment by the Department's Accounts Section. Claims received on a Wednesday to Tuesday are paid on the next Wednesday, so the delay can be as little as 1 working day for payment to issue (electronically) and is usually no more than 5 working days. Delays may occur if the AWS claim is incomplete or incorrect on submission.</p><p>  The 13<sup>th</sup> (final) cycle is held for payment pending the receipt of the audited accounts/final reconciliation for the project to date, as per the CE Operating Procedures. If there are delays in furnishing satisfactory audited accounts by the Sponsor, this can delay the final payment until the matter is resolved. In emergencies, the Department does have flexibility where a Sponsor is having major financial difficulties to facilitate a wage claim payment.</p></reply>

In July 2014, the age of the youngest child threshold is being reduced to 7 years of age for new entrants and from 2015 for existing recipients.  Transitional arrangements will apply during the period between 2013 and       2015 &ndash; depending on the date that a recipient first claimed the OFP payment.  By 2015, the maximum age limit of the youngest child will be 7 years for all OFP recipients.</p><p>  In 2013, it is expected that up to 9,300 recipients will exit the OFP scheme &ndash; with up to 8,000 of these in July.  These numbers reflect the maximum number of cases who may lose entitlement in 2013.  Some of these customers may have continued entitlement to OFP, as the relevant saver clauses included in the legislation will apply.  These include OFP recipients who are in receipt of domiciliary care allowance (DCA) in respect of one of their children as well as customers who are recently widowed.  The Local Offices are reviewing all cases as appropriate.</p><p>  The reforms to the OFP scheme are predicated on activation and on getting customers who may have experienced recurring poverty and social exclusion traps back into the workforce once their children have reached an appropriate age.  They aim to provide the necessary supports to lone parents by assisting them participate in education and training, develop their skills set and ultimately, attain financial independence and social well-being for both themselves and their families by securing employment.</p><p>  The majority of those who will lose their entitlement to the OFP payment on foot of the reductions to the age threshold of the youngest child are likely to fall into one of the following three categories:</p><p>i.   Customers who are in receipt of the family income supplement (FIS) will transition to a re-rated FIS payment that will partly compensate for the loss of the OFP.</p><p>ii.  Customers who are in receipt of a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance payment will transition to a full-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance payment that will partly compensate for the loss of the OFP.</p><p>iii. The majority of the remaining customers are expected to apply for the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA).  Of this group, customers whose youngest child is aged under 14 years can avail of the JA transition arrangement.</p><p>  The JA transition arrangement is provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2013 and is a specific measure for lone parents transitioning from OFP to JA, whose youngest child is under 14 years of age. Customers who avail of this arrangement will be exempt from the JA conditionality that requires them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  They will also be exempt from having to prove unemployment and be able to work part-time without restrictions and still receive the JA payment &ndash; subject to a means test.</p><p>  The JA transition arrangement recognises the difficulty of parenting alone and will ease the transition of former OFP recipients with children of primary school age onto the JA scheme.  Without it, it is likely that many former OFP recipients would not have qualified for the JA payment as their caring responsibilities may have prevented them from being available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  Significantly, the JA transition arrangement will still require that this group of customers fully engage with my Department&rsquo;s full activation process. This is the same requirement that applies to all other jobseekers.</p><p>  The availability of the JA transition payment to this group of customers reduces the need for child care support as parents in these circumstances can remain at home and take care of their children.  However, if a lone parent in this situation does wish to avail of an employment opportunity, they are eligible to apply for the after-school child care subsidised scheme.  </p><p>  The after-school child care subsidised scheme will provide 6,000 subsidised after-school child care places for low-income families and social welfare income support payment recipients who enter employment and have children of primary school age.  The pilot, which was introduced in seven designated Social Welfare Local Offices, commenced on 29 April, 2013, and will be rolled out nationally by September, 2013.</p><p>  Lone parents who transition to the JA scheme will qualify for the full range of activation supports that are currently available to all jobseekers. This includes being able to access a wide range of education, training and employment programmes through my Department. </p></reply>

Following completion of the exercise a separate map based on electoral divisions (EDs), which are the smallest administrative areas used for statistical purposes in the country, was developed.  Where an ED was completely or substantially served by existing service providers it was excluded from the NBS.  Broadband services under the NBS are available since October 2010 from the NBS service provider, &ldquo;3&rdquo;, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in all of the designated NBS Electoral Divisions.  In Cavan 48 out of the 93 EDs were identified as eligible for inclusion in the NBS, which are shown in the table below.</p><p>In July 2011 the Government launched a separate broadband initiative, namely the Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS).  The RBS was established to enable a basic broadband service to be provided to individual rural premises, which were not capable of obtaining a broadband service from existing Internet service providers.  45 applicants from County Cavan received offers from service providers participating in this Scheme of which 11 accepted an offer of service.</p><p>With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services.</p><p>In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.</p><p>In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  A comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector is being undertaken to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband services over the coming years.</p><p>The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment so as to deliver on the targets for high speed broadband contained in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p><b>National Broadband Schemes (NBS)</b></p><p><b>Electoral Divisions (ED) covered by the NBS in County Cavan</b></p><p><table><tr><th>ED Name</th><th>ED Reference No.</th></tr><tr><td>ARDUE</td><td>ED 27001</td></tr><tr><td>BALLYMACHUGH</td><td>ED 27009</td></tr><tr><td>BALLYMAGAURAN</td><td>ED 27010</td></tr><tr><td>BAWNBOY</td><td>ED 27011</td></tr><tr><td>BENBRACK</td><td>ED 27014</td></tr><tr><td>BILBERRY</td><td>ED 27015</td></tr><tr><td>CANNINGSTOWN</td><td>ED 27018</td></tr><tr><td>CARN</td><td>ED 27019</td></tr><tr><td>CARRAFIN</td><td>ED 27021</td></tr><tr><td>CASTLERAHAN</td><td>ED 27022</td></tr><tr><td>CASTLESAUNDERSON</td><td>ED 27023</td></tr><tr><td>COOTEHILL RURAL</td><td>ED 27027</td></tr><tr><td>CORR</td><td>ED 27029</td></tr><tr><td>CORRANEARY</td><td>ED 27030</td></tr><tr><td>CROSSBANE</td><td>ED 27031</td></tr><tr><td>CROSSDONEY</td><td>ED 27032</td></tr><tr><td>DERRYLAHAN</td><td>ED 27037</td></tr><tr><td>DERRYNANANTA</td><td>ED 27038</td></tr><tr><td>DIAMOND</td><td>ED 27039</td></tr><tr><td>DOOGARY</td><td>ED 27040</td></tr><tr><td>DRUMANESPICK</td><td>ED 27042</td></tr><tr><td>DRUMCARN</td><td>ED 27044</td></tr><tr><td>DRUMLUMMAN</td><td>ED 27045</td></tr><tr><td>DUNMAKEEVER</td><td>ED 27047</td></tr><tr><td>KILBRIDE</td><td>ED 27052</td></tr><tr><td>KILCOGY</td><td>ED 27053</td></tr><tr><td>KILGOLAGH</td><td>ED 27055</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Gate 3 Direction to System Operators (CER/08/260), published in December 2008, sets out the list of projects to receive grid connection offers.  As explained in the Direction, Gate 3 was designed to ensure the 40% target for renewable electricity by 2020 could be achieved, and this was based on an assumption that 5,800MWs of renewable generation would be required.  Gate 3 followed Gates 1 and 2, and provided for additional grid connection offers totalling almost 4,000MWs. </p><p>  Due to changes in economic conditions since the publication of the Gate 3 Direction in 2008, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland estimated for the First Progress Report on the National Renewable Energy Action Plan that the amount of MWs needed to meet the 40% renewable electricity target has fallen to approximately 4,000MWs. </p><p>  As regards the take up of connection offers under Gate 3 to date, EirGrid, the Transmission System Operator, has informed my Department that 13 entities have taken up transmission offers in Gate 3.  They include 2 conventional generators and 11 wind farm projects.  In addition, EirGrid inform me that a significant number of Gate 3 transmission connection offers are under consideration at present. ESB Networks, the Distribution System Operator, states that 32 offers have been accepted under Gate 3 for connection to the distribution system.</p><p>  Under Gate 3 rules, generators must accept a grid connection offer within 50 business days of receipt of the combined connection offer and constraint report.  On this basis, Gate 3 acceptances are scheduled to complete in October this year. </p><p>A decision on any potential future Gate has not yet been taken.  Any definition of a future Gate will take account of the outcome of the Gate 3 process.   </p></reply>

Under the terms of the contract which my Department has in place with &#8220;3&#8221;, the NBS service provider, the NBS mobile wireless service is required to offer minimum download and upload speeds of 2.3Mbps and 1.4Mbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 18:1.  The NBS satellite service, which is utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, offers minimum download and upload speeds of 3.6Mbps and 384 kbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 48:1.  The NBS satellite service was upgraded in July 2012 and there are no further upgrades foreseen within the NBS contract.</p><p>  As regards service quality, my Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on &#8220;3&#8221;, with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.  The NBS contract also provides that where NBS customers do not receive the minimum guaranteed service, as set out in the terms and conditions of their contract, they are entitled to service rebates.</p><p>  Should any NBS customer experience problems with the NBS service, they are advised to contact 3's customer care centre, 24 hours a day 7 days a week, by phone at 1913 (free of charge), via email to    or by post to 3 Customer Services, Hutchison 3G Ireland Limited, PO Box 333, Dublin 2.</p><p>  My Department has a role where customers have fully utilised the established complaints process and consider that their complaint has not been resolved.

The report was published in June last.  It compares marketed headline speeds for broadband services compared to the speeds experienced by users over cable, fibre and fixed lines in the EU 28, Iceland and Norway.</p><p>  The comparison across the 30 countries surveyed demonstrates, as a general rule, a common practice of marketing a headline speed of &#8220;up to X Mbps&#8221;, as a maximum speed which customers can expect.  The actual speed available varies for a number of reasons, including the amount of traffic online at any time, any consequential network congestion and distance from any individual premises to the nearest exchange.  The actual speeds experienced can also vary depending on the manner in which connections are configured within customers' premises.</p><p>  The average download speed accessed in Ireland was above the EU average of 19.47 megabits per second (Mbps) or 74% of marketed speeds.  The average upload speed available in Ireland was below the EU average of 6.2 Mbps or 88% of the marketed speeds.  Since the survey was undertaken, UPC has rolled out download speeds up to 150 Mbps and upload speeds up to 10 Mbps across its network.  More recently, eircom has launched broadband services to make download speeds up to 70 Mbps and upload speeds up to 20 Mbps accessible at 1.2 million premises by 2015.  The speeds available in Ireland are therefore increasing since the survey was completed. </p><p>  The marketing of broadband services in Ireland is governed by the law generally applicable to the sale of goods and services. There is no legislation specific to the marketing of broadband services.  The Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland, following consultations with the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), and the National Consumer Agency, published guidelines in 2008 on the marketing of broadband services which can be accessed on-line at <font color="#004080">. </font> In addition, ComReg is concluding a procurement process to launch a Broadband Speed Information Initiative later this year, which will compile data in respect of actual broadband speeds being experienced by users compared to the speed advertised for individual broadband packages.  </p></reply>

Under Section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981, a fire authority is required to make provision for the delivery of fire services in its functional area, including the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of premises. Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each county and city manager is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authority for which he or she is responsible. </p><p>  My Department supports fire authorities through setting of general policy, training support and issue of guidance on operational and other related matters, and the provision of capital funding. </p><p>  I recently adopted and published the policy document <i>Keeping Communities Safe</i> (KCS), which sets the future direction of fire services in Ireland. This is intended to ensure that Ireland continues to manage its fire risk effectively and that our success in reducing fire fatalities, at their lowest level for four decades in 2012, continues.   </p><p>  The KCS policy document was prepared by my Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management through a collaborative approach betwe en central and local government.   The national standards that are contained in KCS are in keeping with international good practic e and are crucial to a consistent approach across fire services in Ireland. The fire service response is based on the particular incident type at the location given. The PDA   (Pre-Determined Attendance) is the initial automatic turnout, but can be varied by the officer in charge. The PDAs are set down by the Chief Fire Officer for each fire authority. However, there is now detailed , at Appendix A to the KCS policy document , a set of nationally d etermined PDAs which relate to different categories of incident types.  It is expected that each fire service, Dublin Fire Brigade included, will review their PDAs in the light of Appendix A and make any necessary adjustments. </p></reply>

Where any borrower, either from a local authority or from a private financial institution, is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, they should engage proactively and constructively with the lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution. The services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service are also available to such borrowers and support is available through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme. Local authorities have long been the lenders of last resort servicing the housing loans needs of less affluent members of society. In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears.<br />  Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases. In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based upon the Central Bank&rsquo;s first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.<br />  To reflect the content of the Central Bank&rsquo;s revised Code of Conduct &ndash; which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt &ndash; my Department issued updated guidance in June 2012 to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association. This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.<br />  In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, presents borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, including those referred to, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case. This process features a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent. Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices.   The introduction of these revised guidelines standardises the approach across the whole sector, introduces a systematic structure to this area and provides borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution.</p><p>The total number of forced and voluntary repossessions obtained by local authorities in 2010, 2011 and 2012 are set out in the table:</p><p><table><tr><th><br /><br />Repossessions</th><th><br /><br />2010</th><th><br /><br />2011</th><th><br /><br />2012</th></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Forced</td><td><br /><br />16</td><td><br /><br />54</td><td><br /><br />73</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Voluntary</td><td><br /><br />73</td><td><br /><br />49</td><td><br /><br />64</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Local Development Companies (LDCs) are independent companies with their own board of management and memoranda and articles of association. My Department has no role in the internal operations of LDCs and, therefore, does not have a role in relation to staff or employment matters, which are for the Board of the company, as the employer, to manage.   </p><p>  The objective of the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government, and its agencies, and people in disadvantaged communities. It is a key tool of Government in providing supports for the &lsquo;harder to reach&rsquo; in the most disadvantaged areas and communities.  The funding provided under the LCDP may, however, be used towards statutory redundancy costs in certain circumstances. Also, the Department has made a separate Technical Assistance Budget available on two previous occasions, in 2009 and 2011, to fund statutory redundancy costs arising within the Local and Community Development Programme.</p><p>  In the context of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) each Local Development Company is permitted to spend 20% of its total Programme expenditure on administration and overhead costs including any employment related overheads. There is no additional funding allocation outside of this to cover administration costs and in the context of the RDP there are no plans to introduce any further funds at this time. </p><p>  However the Government recognises that like all other sectors of our economy, the community and voluntary sector has had to deal with reduced funding and financial shortages in recent years.  Issues have arisen around the capacity of the sector to pay redundancy payments.  The Government is considering a cash limited scheme to address this issue.  Discussions between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are on-going in that regard and an appropriate memorandum will be brought to Government in due course.

The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.  The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.</p><p>  When I published the statement I announced a set of indicators which will be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed.  These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness in Ireland and, in quantifying its on-going extent, will support the bringing forward of realistic and practical solutions.</p><p>  While it is clear that a proportion of funding must be used to provide sufficient bed capacity to accommodate those in need of emergency accommodation, it is equally important that resources are channelled to deliver more permanent responses in a more focused and strategic way.  The arrangements for devolving homelessness funding to the lead housing authority in each of the 9 regions in 2013  seek to ensure that the measures being pursued by housing authorities reflect the housing-led approach, that actions are in place towards achieving the target of ending long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 and that evidence to support progress will be presented through the reports on the indicators.</p><p>  While I acknowledge that the approach to all forms of homelessness, including child, youth and adult homelessness should be fully integrated, my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is currently overseeing a review of the Youth Homelessness Strategy.</p></reply>

Contrary to the view put forward in the correspondence referred to in the Question, the new arrangements will have not have a detrimental effect on local development services or constrain the delivery of those services.  Rather the establishment of Socio-Economic Committees in each local authority area will facilitate a more strategic, joined-up approach to local and community development locally.  Socio-Economic Committees will bring key local and community development actors together in partnership, with a focus on outcomes rather than organisational boundaries, thus enabling collaborative leadership at local level and, ultimately, improving services for citizens and communities.</p><p>  Putting People First envisages an enhanced role for local government in local and community development.  There is no intention to divert resources from local development to local authorities.  Instead, the aim is to facilitate a joint consideration locally as to how those resources might be deployed through more collaborative and co-ordinated approaches, supported by a reformed and enhanced local government sector.</p><p>  Similarly, there is no intention to undermine the expertise and staffing of local development companies.  As key partners on the Socio-Economic Committees, local development companies will continue to have an important role in the delivery of programmes for which they are contracted by my Department and others. Independent of alignment reforms, however, the level of funding for local development programmes is a key issue for implementing bodies, and this remains to be decided as part of the Government's estimates process and in the context of EU budgets.</p><p>  With regard to LEADER, the attempt to draw a distinction between community-led arrangements and local authority-led arrangements is unhelpful and misleading.  The LEADER or community-led local development methodology, under which an element of Rural Development Programme funding is delivered, envisages 'bottom-up' implementation of local development programming through a partnership of public and private sector socio-economic interests.  Local authorities are considered essential partners to such an approach.  All LEADER implementation arrangements across EU Member States must and do have a significant local authority involvement.  Indeed, in other Member States, local authorities are key enablers and drivers of the LEADER approach.  </p><p>  At this stage, management and implementation arrangements for future LEADER programmes in Ireland are being considered by an Alignment Working Group, comprising local government and local development representatives. While the Group has to complete its work, any new implementation arrangements for LEADER and other community-led local development initiatives will be entirely consistent with EU requirements and will seek to secure optimum outcomes for citizens and communities.  Any interpretation to the contrary is a misunderstanding of what we are seeking to achieve.</p></reply>

There has been a significant increase in the number of these types of projects over the last 12 to 18 months and there are currently 42 projects in the Department at various stages of assessment. The assessment of these higher value projects usually involves detailed consultations between my Department and the relevant LDC.  Many of these projects have been submitted with insufficient documentation or with documentation that requires some level of clarification.</p><p>Projects submitted with incomplete documentation are now immediately returned to the LDC for completion and are categorised as rejected until full documentation is submitted. Prior to this change, my Department worked closely but informally with LDCs to assist them in ensuring that projects submitted were ready for assessment. As many of the consultations with regard to required documentation were informal and primarily within the context of providing assistance to the LDC, a precise percentage of the number over &euro;150 ,000   projects that would have been considered incomplete is not available.</p><p>It is estimated, however, that up to 80% of the projects that have been submitted to my Department for final approval to date have required some level of consultation with the LDC regarding the provision of additional information in order to facilitate a full assessment.</p><p>It is difficult to give a specific timeframe for completion of the approvals process as it varies on a case by case basis , but generally , once full documentation has been received and all queries on an individual project have been addressed, the assessment process proceeds quickly.

These programmes were not awarded to Marketing English in Ireland (MEI) and in that regard there are no public procurement issues arising.</p><p>  It is Government policy to develop Ireland's international education services industry, of which the English language tuition sector is an important component.  The strategy is overseen by the High Level Group on International Education on which my Department is represented, as indeed is MEI, in its capacity as the largest umbrella body for the language schools.  My officials will also regularly meet representative bodies and indeed individual institutions. </p><p>  At different points MEI highlighted the need to develop the Turkish market for language courses of which Ireland had a negligible share and also to see what might be done in terms of creating a fresh impetus in the very large Chinese market.  My Department was supportive of these developments.  In 2011 and 2012 pilot programmes in respect of English Language were developed jointly between  the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and MEI for the Turkish and Chinese markets respectively. </p><p>  Extensive reform of student immigration had taken place in recent years aimed at tackling the abuse of this channel as a facilitator for economic migration.  A key element of the pilot programmes therefore was the focus not on numbers but on quality.  They sought to target high quality, motivated English language students and aimed to develop the markets in a sustainable way.  The programmes focus on a particular student profile, i.e. students with a clearly defined study plan to attend university, university graduates and executive level employees in firms where the candidates position would benefit from strong English language skills.  The programmes are designed to significantly contribute to the development of Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a premier destination for Chinese and Turkish students to achieve a high standard in English language education.  Special administrative arrangements were put in place for the programmes with MEI, including monitoring student progress. </p><p>  These programmes represent additional student immigration offerings but all of the normal student immigration channels for language and other courses remain open also.

However, what is most important now is that nothing be said which would in any way risk the possibility of prejudicing any criminal proceedings.<b><font color="#000080">    </font></b></p><p>  The Deputies will be aware that a number of Garda investigation files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions as have several files from the parallel investigation taking place under the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Three persons are currently charged with offences under the Companies Acts and a number of files remain with the DPP awaiting her independent directions.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the investigation into the former Anglo-Irish Bank has been one of the most complex investigations of its kind ever undertaken in the State, and as part of which the Garda have obtained an enormous range of documents and recordings.   Immediately upon taking up office I sought and was given assurances that there were sufficient resources available to these investigations and have made it clear to the Commissioner that if at any stage he believed that additional resources were required I would respond immediately.  Furthermore, shortly after taking up office I moved to introduce additional powers contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2011, to assist the Garda in obtaining information in complex investigations such as these.  </p><p>  Insofar as the details of the management of the investigations, and of any current or future prosecutions are concerned, including matters relating to the preparation of books of evidence, the Deputies will appreciate that I have no role in this regard, nor would it be appropriate to disclose what evidence the Garda have in their possession in relation to any criminal investigations which they are conducting.  I have no function in relation to determining the origin of the tapes referred to and cannot comment on this, other than to say I have no grounds for believing that the material emanated from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

This is a fair system for meeting the needs of asylum seekers in a cost-effective manner. It is line with asylum seeker reception arrangements in other EU countries and indeed, in some cases, it is of a much higher standard.</p><p>  Over the years, the direct provision system has been open to scrutiny by many international bodies.  Centres have been visited by various UN bodies, including the UNHCR, I appeared before the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva in connection with its scrutiny of Ireland under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Process In October, 2011 . No recommendation was made in relation to the Direct Provision system in the Committee's subsequent UPR report on Ireland. </p><p>  All accommodation centres under contract to the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department are obliged to ensure that their premises comply with and operate in accordance with all relevant statutory requirements of local authorities in relation to planning, building, bye-laws, bedroom capacity, food, food hygiene, water supply, sewage disposal, fire precautions, and general safety.</p><p>  More broadly, the rights of residents in RIA centres are, put simply, protected in three ways:</p><p>(a) RIA's House Rules and Procedures which set out the type and standard of service that an asylum seeker should expect whilst residing in direct provision accommodation.  The Rules set out the entitlements and obligations placed on centre management and on residents and, in the event that these aren't being met, a complaints procedure to be invoked by either party.  This complaints system is considered by RIA to be broadly in line with the guidelines set out by the Office of the Ombudsman for &lsquo;internal complaints systems&rsquo;. </p><p>(b) Over and above the House Rules themselves, the interests of asylum seekers are protected through regular 'clinics' in centres where residents can speak directly to RIA headquarters staff without local centre management being present. </p><p>(c) Inspections take place in centres, by RIA staff and by QTS, to ensure that centres are adhering to their contractual obligations.  It cannot be emphasised enough that all inspections are unannounced.  Inspections are not to be confused with ordinary day-to-day visits to centres by RIA staff in connection with operational, health or educational matters where management would know of their arrival in advance.</p></reply>

Officers were appointed from the open competition run by the Public Appointment Service (PAS) for temporary clerical positions in the Public Service. Appointments were for periods ranging from 9 to 12 weeks.</p><p>  The competition runs in compliance with the Code of Practice for Appointment to Positions in the Civil Service and Public Service. It is broadly confined to Citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA) States. Some exclusions apply, for example those who availed of the incentivised scheme for early retirement are precluded under that scheme from applying for another position in the same employment or the same sector.  Civil/Public Servants in receipt of pensions other than from the above incentivised scheme pensions are not precluded from participating, however, pension abatement rules would apply.</p><p>  Thirty eight appointments were made in 2013, twenty six in 2012 and twenty eight in 2011. Information on whether any of the officers appointed in 2011/ 2012 were retired Civil/Public Servants is not readily to hand. I can, however, say that only one of those appointed in 2013 is currently in receipt of a Civil/Public Service pension. Two others have preserved pensions in respect of previous service.</p><p>  Pension policy is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. It is worth noting, however, that the age profile of the thirty eight appointed in 2013 showed a broad range of ages with fourteen aged 18 to 25, thirteen aged 26 to 35, five aged 36 to 45 and six aged 46 or over. I am advised by the Human Resources Division in my Department that this would be broadly consistent with previous years.</p></reply>

I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review.</p><p>  In the context of that review, Clones courthouse was identified as a venue that should be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case. Through this process the Service has established a general framework within which such venues are being assessed taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.</p><p>  A consultation process in relation to the future of Clones courthouse, which included consultation with the judiciary, the Legal Aid Board, the Monaghan Solicitors Bar Association, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service and Clones Town Council was completed.  The Minister has been informed that following the consultation process the Building Committee of the Courts Service Board decided to recommend closure of Clones Court to the Board. As part of the consultation process all those who had been consulted previously were informed of the recommendation of the Building Committee and were invited to make further submissions which would be placed before the Board for consideration. In addition, a senior official from the Courts Service met a delegation from Clones Town Council on 28 June 2013.  I am informed that additional submissions have been received from local interests and these together with all previous submissions will be taken into account in the decision making process in which, as the Deputy is aware, I have no role as it is a matter for the Courts Service Board under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998.</p><p>  I am informed that the matter of Clones Court was due to be considered at a meeting of the Board which was to be held yesterday and in that context I have asked the Courts Service to advise the Deputy of the outcome as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Work is now well underway on further major reforms to the fine payment and recovery system in Ireland.  The Fines (Amendment) Bill, which I expect to publish this term will, when enacted, make it easier for people to pay a fine and where they fail to do so, there will be sufficient options available to the courts in the form of, for example, attachment of earnings, community service, or recovery orders. I believe these measures, taken together, will substantially reduce the incidence of committal to prison for the non-payment of fines.</i></p></reply>

It reflects my promise to the women who resided and worked in the Laundries to see justice done.</p><p>  The process I initiated resulted in an unprecedented trawl of papers and records held by the State and State agencies to assist in establishing the facts about the Magdalen laundries and gave everyone a unique opportunity to detail what they knew.  The work of the Inter-departmental Committee chaired by Dr. McAleese provided the platform for the apology made by the Taoiseach on 19 February 2013 and for the Government decision to ask Judge Quirke to devise a scheme.</p><p>  It is clear that Judge Quirke focused on the needs of the women he meet during the examination he was asked to conduct by the Government. The recommendations contained in his report, which the Government approved in full, centre around the provision of payments and benefits best suited to meeting these individual needs.</p><p>  His most immediately significant recommendation in the report is that the women in question should all receive cash payments in the range &euro;11,500 (duration of stay 3 months or less) to &euro;100,000 (duration of stay of 10 years or more).  If the cash payment due is above &euro;50,000, Justice Quirke recommends that it should paid in the form of a lump sum of &euro;50,000 plus an annual payment related to the notional remaining lump, sum to be paid weekly.  The amount to be paid depends on the duration of stay of a resident in a Magdalen home.</p><p>  The traditional approach in this jurisdiction has been for the payment of a once off lump sum.  Judge Quirke in his report took a different approach and recommended a lump sum payment combined with a series of ongoing benefits and payments.  As regards income payments in particular he stated:</p><p>&quot;<i>The Commission is concerned to protect, for the benefit of those vulnerable women, the resources which they will acquire when they receive monetary payments arising out of the proposed Scheme.  It has been necessary for the Commission to seek to balance the needs and interests of those elderly vulnerable women with the needs and interests of the many other Magdalen women who are younger, healthier, more energetic and more independent.  In order to achieve that balance the Commission has taken the view that the needs and interests of the Magdalen women would be best addressed by making any ex gratia payments in excess of &euro;50,000 payable to the women as tax free weekly income for the remainder of their live</i>.&quot;</p><p>  His other recommendations cover a range of issues including:</p><p>-  the provision of an extensive range of community based health and social services to each individual woman;</p><p>-  all Magdalen women who have reached pensionable age should have an income equivalent to the State contributory pension;</p><p>-  all Magdalen women who have not reached pensionable age should have an income of at least &euro;100 per week;</p><p>-  cash payments should be exempt from income and other taxes and should not be taken into account for the purposes of means testing.</p><p>  Mr Justice Quirke is to be thanked for taking on this task.  The report itself is very thorough and impressive.  I know that he consulted widely on the issue.  He and the people who assisted him did an excellent job in devising a scheme that meets the particular needs of the women in question and which the Government had no hesitation in approving Judge Quirke's recommendations are interconnected.  </p></reply>

However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.</p><p>  A vetting disclosure is made in response to a written request and with the permission of the person who is the subject of that request.  Garda vetting disclosures are issued to specified organisations registered with GCVU for that purpose in respect of a particular post or employment.  The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.</p><p>  The disclosure is made to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.  Each time a new vetting application is received, a full vetting check is conducted to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.  The non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the certificate protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service. It also affords the registered organisation the facility to assess suitability based on the most up to date information available on the applicant.</p><p>  I remain in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner as to how best the service can continue to be delivered and improved upon, while at all times protecting the integrity of the process. Clearly, the protection of children and vulnerable adults is the primary objective of the Garda Central Vetting Unit and this must remain the case.</p><p>  The possibility of introducing an e-vetting system has been assessed and the Garda authorities are now in the process of developing a system which will enable vetting applications to be submitted electronically through a secure web service.  In addition, the system will facilitate the checking and monitoring of applications.  The relevant work is being pursued on a priority basis and it will be completed as quickly as possible.</p><p>  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that there are currently 1 Superintendent, 3 Sergeants and approximately 136 civilian personnel assigned to the Garda Central Vetting Unit.  This civilian complement includes 23 staff recently transferred from Department of Agriculture. In addition, a further 31 have been assigned to the Vetting Service from various other locations in the public service.  These staff members are currently undergoing training with the first cohort due to have completed their training by 15 July and the last by mid-September.</p><p>  When these staff have been fully trained on the vetting process I expect there will be a positive effect on vetting times.  My Department is also examining the scope for the redeployment of additional personnel from within the public service to the Unit.</p></reply>

For example, in Turkey and Abu Dhabi the average waiting period is 1 to 2 weeks with a success rate of 93% and 88% respectively. Applications made in Beijing and London take on average 20 days to process with a success rate of 88% in Beijing.</p><p>  I am advised that these processing times compare favourably with international standards. The issue here of course is balancing the need to maintain sensible immigration controls with the requirement to facilitate as quickly as possible bona fide applications.  In the circumstances, a turn around time on decision making on these cases within a few weeks is not excessive and should be weighed against the fact that individual decisions are often life changing events for very many applicants.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that not all international students are visa required, many originating from within the EU.  Visa applicants are advised to apply eight weeks before the intended date of travel, however, this advice is mainly precautionary.  Although the processing time for dealing with visa applications can vary depending on the particular circumstances of each individual case and the level of investigation required, it would be quite rare for a straightforward visa application to take eight weeks to process.  The timescales for study visas as outlined above demonstrates this.</p><p>  Regarding the Deputy's request for the monthly breakdown of the processing times, I am advised by my officials in the Visa Division of my Department that compilation of the detailed information requested by the Deputy would involve a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources which could not be justified in the circumstances.</p></reply>

In my address, I focused on the key security challenges facing the European Union.  Noting that the international security environment has changed profoundly in recent decades, I stated that active and positive engagement is required by all in order to safeguard the security of individual Member States and that of the Union.  I stated that threats like terrorism, uncontrolled migration, cyber attacks and people and drug trafficking are not purely military and, therefore, an overarching or comprehensive approach is required to tackle security issues.  I stated that, throughout Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the issues of security challenges and threats facing the Union were discussed, in particular in relation to Maritime Security and Cyber Security.  In relation to Maritime Security, I highlighted the importance of building EU-wide consensus and cooperation in relation to security and surveillance in the maritime domain.  I noted that the many threats and challenges to the maritime domain have the potential to impact adversely on the security and safety of the Union as a whole and on our citizens and economies.  To understand the risks, challenges and vulnerabilities that we face in this regard, it is necessary to have a full picture of what is happening at sea &ndash; an integrated maritime picture.</p><p>  In relation to Cyber Security, I stated that this is an area that imposes existential and internal threats with regard to terrorism, protecting industry and essential utilities and Government information that is of a confidential nature.  Cyber security is a complex issue that requires cooperation across all sectors to ensure the safety of our networks and infrastructures.  I referred to the dramatic increase in cyber crimes/incidents.  I stated that in relation to cyber security, it is appropriate to say that the challenge is how Ministers, policy makers and the private sector can collectively develop a multilateral and multi-dimensional approach to address the challenges that we face in cyber security from a technical, operational and policy perspective. </p><p>  I welcomed the recent publication of the European Commission&rsquo;s Cyber Security Strategy entitled &ldquo;An Open, Safe and Secure Cyber-space&rdquo;.  I noted that it is incumbent upon everyone to fully support implementation of these strategies and agreements.  To fail to co-operate in the area of Cyber would be to undermine our collective security and to fail to understand the escalating threat that we face.  We are stronger together and safer together.  To successfully counter this emerging cyber threat, cooperation between national law enforcement, defence, and technical incident response organisations, within and between Member States, needs to be encouraged.  I concluded that it is incumbent on us all to take both personal and collective responsibility to address this crucial and critical issue.</p><p>  En marge of the Conference, I took the opportunity to meet informally with some of my Ministerial colleagues from other Member States. I also received a briefing from Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador to France on Defence and other issues.</p></reply>

Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council established the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, known as MINUSMA, for an initial period of twelve (12) months.

A review by the Defence Forces into 156 non-service related deaths among members of the Defence Forces in the period January 2000 to December 2010 shows that 25 were apparently of self-inflicted injuries.  Of these, only one is recorded by a coroner as being &#8220;suicide&#8221;.  Of these 25 deaths by self-inflicted injury, 9 had previously been prescribed Lariam.  There is no evidence in any coroners' inquests, nor any other evidence whatsoever, linking these deaths to Lariam.  Moreover, according to expert advice, given the limited period of time during which Lariam remains in the bloodstream after a person stops taking it, it is extremely unlikely that Lariam could have been a contributory factor in practically all of these cases.  Of the 25 deaths by self-inflicted injury, 16 were not prescribed Lariam and 4 of these had not served overseas.&#8221;</p><p>  I am not in a position to disclose any information about individual deaths due to the relatively small number of individuals involved because it could lead to potential identification (or misidentification) of deceased service members.</p><p>  RT&Eacute; were informed that at least some of the information they sought is not easily accessible and has to be drawn from multiple databases.  They were also told that it is not possible without manual checking to eliminate accurately multiple tours of duty.  This would involve significant resources which are not available.

The agreement represents a package of measures that will set the framework for the development of the EU agri-food sector up to 2020.  I believe this is a well balanced package, that will maintain sustainable and competitive farming in the EU, and is a very good outcome for Irish farmers.  Direct payments are maintained providing stability to farmers against market uncertainties and 30% of a farmer&rsquo;s payment is made conditional on meeting greening criteria thus contributing to environmental sustainability.  More targeted support is provided for under Rural Development and market management mechanisms are also retained to support the market, particularly in time of crisis. </p><p>  Overall I am satisfied that the reformed policy will secure strong and sustainable growth in the agriculture and food sectors into the future delivering sustainable intensification of production, environmental stewardship and the maintenance of a vibrant rural economy.</p></reply>

The EU legislation has been transposed into national legislation via S.I. No. 357 of 2011 - European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011 (as amended).  Regulation 504/2008, which came into effect on 1 July 2009, provides that if an equine animal has not been identified within six months of the date of its birth, or by the 31st  of December in the year of its birth, whichever date occurs later, it cannot be admitted to the food chain.  It also provides that all equine animals registered from 1 July 2009 must be identified with a passport and a microchip. However, equines identified prior to this date were not required by previous EU legislation to be microchipped and it is not open to me to impose such a requirement. The exemption of equines registered prior to 1 July 2009 from the microchip requirement is in line with normal practice in relation to EU legislation that animals which have been correctly identified in accordance with existing legislation are not obliged to be re-identified under new legislation. </p><p>  With regard to horses which were registered late but are micro chipped and have passports, the position is that, as stated above, these horses are ineligible for the human food chain. I have no plans to introduce a cull scheme for these horses. It is the responsibility of horse owners to ensure the welfare of horses in their care and to provide for their disposal.  The Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council (FAWAC) has recommended the option of humane disposal of an equine where an owner can no longer adequately provide for it or where the equine can no longer fulfil the purpose for which it was bred as such action will help prevent the emergence of long-term animal welfare problems. My Department supports this advice as the most appropriate means of dealing with unwanted horses and I would ask owners of unwanted horses to avail of this option.</p></reply>

These powers include the making of bye-laws for the control and welfare of horses in the local authorities&rsquo; functional area, together with provisions on licensing of horses within control areas and seizure and detention of stray or abandoned horses.</p><p>My Department agreed a protocol with Local Authorities in 2012 which outlined the need for greater uniformity in how Local Authorities apply the Control of Horses Act in their respective areas with a view to achieving savings and efficiencies in implementation of the Act.  The protocol recommended that all local authorities amend their bye-laws to allow persons five days to reclaim their horse(s) and, if not reclaimed within that period, the Local Authority should be permitted to re-home or euthanize the animal. The reasoning behind the five day retention was to reduce costs but also to emphasise to individuals who abandon or allow their horses to stray that animal welfare depends on frequent human attention and animals should be inspected frequently to avoid suffering. In my view, responsibility for ensuring that horses do not stray rests with their owners and owners who do not reclaim their horses within 5 days cannot be considered to be responsible owners.</p><p>My Department provides extensive funding to assist Local Authorities in control of horses operations. Some Local Authorities operate their own Pounds and others engage private contractors to carry out control of horse activities which sometimes involves humane disposal of horses. In view of this, it is not possible to determine an exact cost for euthanizing per horse, as veterinary expenses, transport etc differ between local authorities.</p><p>The table below, which is based on the information provided to me by local authorities &ndash; shows the number of horses seized and euthanazed under the Control of Horses Act in the period 2008 &ndash; 2012.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Horses Seized</th><th>Horses Euthanazed</th></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>1069</td><td>284</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>1467</td><td>104</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>2418</td><td>659</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>2936</td><td>1592</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>2969</td><td>2123</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In excess of 200 marine sites have been designated by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) under the EU Habitats Directive and Special Protection Areas (SPAs) under the EU Birds Directive (&lsquo;Natura 2000&rsquo; sites).  Multiple &lsquo;Natura 2000&rsquo; sites are located in some bays and some sites are located offshore and not associated with any particular bay.</p><p>The European Court of Justice declared in case C418/04 that, by failing to take all the measures necessary to comply with Article 6(3) of Directive 92/43 (Habitats Directive) in respect of authorisation of aquaculture programmes, Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under that Directive.</p><p>In the negotiations to address the judgment a process was agreed with the European Commission which would lead to full compliance by Ireland with the relevant EU Directives.

Analysis of the data, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, enables all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.</p><p>Conservation Objectives had been set for over forty &lsquo;Natura 2000&rsquo; sites and Appropriate Assessments are being progressed taking account of the need to facilitate the use of scientific and other resources on a flexible basis across the full range of bays.  At present, Appropriate Assessments have been carried on four bays (Castlemaine Harbour, Dundalk Bay, Roaringwater Bay and Lough Swilly).  The first aquaculture licence determinations in respect of &lsquo;Natura 2000&rsquo; sites have recently been made with over 40 licence determinations being made in respect of applications located in Castlemaine Harbour SAC/SPA.</p><p>In parallel with the work done in relation to &lsquo;Natura 2000&rsquo; sites significant progress was made in 2012 on licensing in non-Natura areas. 115 licence determinations were made in 2012 and depending on the availability of Appropriate Assessments and other measures it is expected that overall determinations well in excess of this figure will be possible in 2013.</p><p>Addressing the issue of aquaculture licensing in Natura 2000 areas is a key priority for my Department and the Deputy can be assured that every effort is being made to expedite the completion of the overall process having regard to all the complexities involved.</p><p>TABLE</p><p><table><tr><th>Castlemaine Harbour</th><th>Tralee Bay</th><th>North Dublin Bay</th></tr><tr><td>Roaringwater Bay</td><td>Ballysadare Bay</td><td>Carlingford Lough</td></tr><tr><td>Blacksod/Broadhaven</td><td>Blaskets</td><td>Glengarriff Harbour</td></tr><tr><td>Lough Swilly</td><td>Boyne Estuary</td><td>Duvillaun Islands</td></tr><tr><td>Clew Bay</td><td>Carnsore Point</td><td>River Nanny Estuary</td></tr><tr><td>Kenmare River</td><td>Cumeen Strand</td><td>Inishboffin and Inishark</td></tr><tr><td>Dungarvan Harbour</td><td>Drumcliff Bay</td><td>Inishkea Islands</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford Harbour</td><td>Gweedore Bay and Islands</td><td>Horn Head and Rinclevan</td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk Bay</td><td>Hook Head</td><td>Achill</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow Reef</td><td>Kerry Head</td><td>Baldoyle Bay</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow Head</td><td>Kilkieran Bay and Islands</td><td>Ballymacoda</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford Estuary</td><td>Killala Bay/Moy Estuary</td><td>Ballyness Bay</td></tr><tr><td>Tramore Backstrand</td><td>Malahide Estuary</td><td>Ballyteigue Burrow</td></tr><tr><td>Long Bank</td><td>Shannon Estuary</td><td>Barleycove</td></tr><tr><td>Bannow Bay</td><td>Broadmeadow/Swords Estuary</td><td>Blackhead</td></tr><tr><td>Blackwater Estuary</td><td>Mulroy Bay</td><td>Bunduff Lough</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal Bay</td><td>Rutland Island and Sound</td><td>Carrowmore</td></tr><tr><td>Galway Bay</td><td>Saltee Islands</td><td>Clonakilty Bay</td></tr><tr><td>Inner Galway Bay</td><td>Slyne Head and Islands</td><td>Courtmacsherry</td></tr><tr><td>Trawbreaga Bay</td><td>Valencia Harbour/Portmagee Channel</td><td>Connemara Bog Complex</td></tr><tr><td>North Inishowen</td><td>Bull Island</td><td>Great Island Channel</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Harbour</td><td>Inisheer Island</td><td>Inishmaan Island</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkee</td><td>Ladys Island</td><td>Lambay Island</td></tr><tr><td>Lough Hyne</td><td>Rathlin O'Birne Island</td><td>Rogerstown Estuary</td></tr><tr><td>Sheephaven</td><td>Slieve League</td><td>Slieve Tooey</td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin Bay</td><td>St. Johns Point</td><td>Streedagh Point</td></tr><tr><td>Tory Island</td><td>Tranarossan &amp;amp; Melmore Lough</td><td>West of Ardara/Maas Road</td></tr><tr><td>Ballycotton Bay</td><td>Ballycotton Bay</td><td>Lough Foyle</td></tr><tr><td>Mid Clare Coast</td><td>Ballinskelligs Bay and Inny Estuary</td><td>Mannin Bay</td></tr><tr><td>Slaney R.

Firstly, Howth Fishery Harbour Centre is first and foremost a working fishery harbour, one of 6 operated by the State, each of whose primary purpose is to provide facilities and services for the fishing industry and fisheries-related activities.  Funding for operating, management and development costs in the fishery harbours is ring-fenced in the Fishery Harbour Centres Fund, which is the only source of revenue available for that purpose.  </p><p>  Capital investment in the Fishery Harbour Centres in recent years has underpinned both fisheries activities and their expanding use for leisure and marine tourism and other maritime enterprises.  In the current economic climate, the State must be fully committed to maximising the return on that investment.  </p><p>  Moreover, my Department is required to ensure that the Fishery Harbour Centres are run on a financially-sound basis.  The 500+ parking spaces within the boundaries of the Harbour would assist in balancing the books, and in providing funding for re-investment that would not otherwise be available.</p><p>  A wide range of groups use the parking facilities of Howth Fishery Harbour - harbour business customers, yacht club members, sport fishermen, Dart users, tourists, walkers and many others.</p><p>  This combination of uses and the range of users of the Harbour brings its own inherent dangers and safety must be a paramount consideration.  A consequence of the large volume of cars using the Fishery Harbour Centre has been huge pressure on parking, and that pressure has on a number of occasions led to a situation where emergency access to the Harbour area has been seriously compromised.  The Harbour authorities have in the past received specific complaints from elements of the emergency services in that regard - fortunately no serious incident has arisen yet.</p><p>  There was widespread public consultation when pay parking at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre was originally examined in detail in 2007 in conjunction with Fingal County Council.   All of the various views that were expressed and submissions and analyses that were made then are still available and I am well aware of and acknowledge their concerns.  I have received new correspondence on this matter from a wide range of harbour users.  My officials have consulted with officials of Fingal Council, and with An G&aacute;rda S&iacute;och&aacute;na<font color="#004080">,</font> about this and related matters, and my Department's engineers have met some of the Harbour's business tenants individually about new traffic management and road markings etc.  My officials also attended the Harbour Users Forum in February where pay parking was on the agenda and heard the views of the harbour users at first hand.</p><p>  I am examining all aspects of the matter at present.  I can assure the Deputy that the views of the various harbour users, the potential earnings, the possible impact on the harbour businesses and on recreational users, the impact on the local economy and local jobs, and the impact on overall traffic management within the Fishery Harbour, are all matters that I will take into account in coming to a decision.  I can also assure the Harbour users in Howth that I am committed to continuing investment in and development of Howth for the future.</p></reply>

At that point supply will be a matter between the producer and the purchaser and, subject to contractual arrangements with milk purchasers, beef farmers or others who wish to switch to dairying, will be unconstrained by the quota system. </p><p>  My Department has in recent years operated a number of support measures to facilitate beef and other farmers who wish to change to dairying.</p><p>  These include the allocation to new entrants of 14 million litres of milk quota per annum, that is one quarter of the 1% quota increase allocated to Ireland under the Commission&rsquo;s Milk Quota transition arrangements. To date 56 million litres have been allocated to just over 300 new entrants and a further 14 million litres will be allocated to about 75 applicants this autumn. </p><p>  In addition, at the beginning of the year my Department introduced a new Development Programme for Dairying, which was aimed at new entrants to dairying among others, to encourage them to join local Dairy Discussion Groups. Earlier Department support for such groups under the Dairy Efficiency Programmes has shown these gatherings to be a very effective method of information transfer. My Department also operates a Dairy Equipment Grant Scheme, which has among its objectives the encouragement of new entrants in dairying by providing them with support to meet capital costs associated with establishment of their enterprise. New entrants must have a minimum number of production units in order to be eligible. In addition Teagasc run a series of courses aimed specifically for new entrants to dairying. </p><p>  As milk quotas and the current phase of the CAP come to a close, my Department is at present engaged in a consultation and evaluation process to determine the measures that might be co-financed under the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) that will run to 2020. While this exercise is still ongoing, I expect that support for new entrants to dairying after April 2015 will be among the items that will be discussed.</p></reply>

The 116000 Missing Children Hotline website (www.missingchildrenhotline.ie) was launched on the 5th of June 2013, the day of the official launch of the service.</p><p>  ISPCC staff and volunteers have worked to disseminate posters in local areas and posters have been distributed nationally to Garda stations.  </p><p>  The ISPCC will now escalate the promotion of this service, which will include promotion in schools.  The Project Team will be kept informed on an on-going basis of the ISPCC's plans and activities related to awareness raising.</p><p>  The Missing Children Hotline has been operating on a full-time basis since end April, 2013.  Reliable data on calls is not available prior to this point.  The ISPCC will submit quarterly activity data to my Department, which will include information on the number of calls received by the service.  It is expected that data on calls to the service since its establishment on a full-time basis will be available in the next quarter, and henceforth on a quarterly basis. </p></reply>

My Department, through its focus on youth policy and youth work, is contributing to addressing this challenge on a range of levels.  Through the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, my Department has met all targets in relation to actions outlined and is firmly committed to maximising the role the youth sector can play in this area.  On a European level, we have ensured that the theme of youth work and its contribution to youth employment is central to our Presidency Programme.  This has been a keynote of all our Presidency events (EU Youth Conference, Structured Dialogue Process, Ministerial Council etc) and has resulted in the adoption of Council Conclusions and, in the last two weeks, has informed a Dublin Declaration on the contribution of youth work to youth employment.</p></reply>

These include occupational role descriptors with associated qualification levels.</p><p>- The establishment of an agreed set of national standards for all awards in early childhood care and education (incorporating core knowledge, skills, competencies and work experience) across all relevant levels of the National Framework of Qualifications in Ireland.  These were published by FETAC in 2011.</p><p>- Access to flexible, affordable and nationally accredited learning opportunities at all levels of qualification for pre-service and in-service professional development.</p><p>- The necessity to ensure consistent quality of ECCE courses nationally across a range of variables including content, delivery and work placement.</p><p>It was envisaged that the cost of delivering on the key objectives could be accommodated within existing resources.</p></reply>

An administrative arrangement is not mandatory for intercountry adoption between countries that are both signatories to Hague.  However some contracting states, including Ireland,  may determine that in some instances co-operation in the field of intercountry adoption is best served by the development of such arrangements.</p><p>  The Adoption Authority  is continuing its work to establish administrative arrangements with a number of Hague countries in relation to intercountry adoptions, as provided for under section 72 of the Adoption Act 2010.  The Authority has travelled to a number of jurisdictions in order to make contact with the Central Authorities, advise of our processes and procedures, assess the need for additional administrative arrangements or agreements; and to glean as much information as possible of relevance to prospective adopters from those countries.  The visits also provide opportunities to streamline processes on both sides and obtain up-to-date information for prospective adopters on developments in these countries.</p><p>  In relation to intercountry adoption with Bulgaria the AAI has advised me that referrals for the adoption of Bulgarian children by Irish applicants have commenced.  In September 2012 the Adoption Authority and the Vietnamese Central Authority for Adoption signed an administrative arrangement for intercountry adoption.  The administrative arrangement is the first international arrangement for intercountry adoption entered into by the AAI and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam since both countries ratified the Hague Convention.  The Adoption Authority accredited Helping Hands for activities in relation to facilitating adoptions from Vietnam and Helping Hands has recently received confirmation from the Vietnamese authorities of its approval to operate there.  I met recently with representatives of Helping Hands who informed me that they expect adoptions to commence shortly.</p><p>  A delegation from the Adoption Authority made an official visit to the US State Department in Washington in 2012.  Following this visit administrative arrangements in relation to intercountry adoption between the United States of America and Ireland were drafted by the AAI.  The AAI and US State Department have recently finalised these administrative arrangements.  The AAI has information on its website (www.aai.gov.ie) in relation to intercountry adoption from the USA, including information in relation to the arrangements and the criteria which must be met before the adoption process can proceed.  These criteria will apply to all adoptions taking place between Ireland and the United States of America with immediate effect.</p><p>  In March I lead a delegation to India which included the Chair of the Adoption Authority of Ireland and a departmental official.  The visit, which was in conjunction with representing the Irish Government at official functions in India for St Patrick's Day, afforded me the opportunity to assess the position in relation to intercountry adoption in India and to clarify issues in relation to the requirements of the Indian authorities in that regard.  I was advised that registration is now open with CARA (the Indian Central Authority) only for special needs cases; this includes children with intellectual or physical disabilities, siblings including twins, and children over 5 years of age.  It was explained that Indian currently operates intercountry adoption with other Hague countries without the need for any specific administrative arrangements of the type in place with Vietnam.  In order for adoptions, other than special needs cases to reopen, an Irish accredited agency will need to be approved by CARA to work in India.</p><p>  Work has also been undertaken in terms of agreements on adoption from non-Hague countries.  Russia and Ethiopia are not signatories of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.  As such, future adoptions from Russia and Ethiopia would require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and these countries.  I  travelled to Moscow, accompanied by Dr Geoffrey Shannon, Chair of the Adoption Authority, in order to discuss at a diplomatic level issues in relation to the potential for a bilateral agreement with Russia.  My officials are in active discussions with officials in the Office of the Attorney General and in the Department of Foreign Affairs on advancing a draft agreement for consideration by the Russian authorities.  I have invited the Russian authorities to visit Ireland in September in order to finalise consideration of this aspect of the draft bilateral agreement.</p><p>  The Adoption Authority delegation visit to Ethiopia in April last year was an initial part of the Authority's deliberations on the feasibility and suitability of entering into discussions with Ethiopia on a bilateral adoption agreement.  The Authority is examining the compatibility of  the Irish and Ethiopian adoption legislation.  As intercountry adoption is a constantly changing landscape, the most up to date information on individual countries can be found on the Adoption Authority website (www.aai.gov.ie).</p></reply>

The Government decided that it was essential and appropriate that child welfare and protection services transfer from the Health Service Executive to a new, dedicated Agency.  From its establishment the Agency will have service responsibility for:</p><p>- Child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services;</p><p>- Child and family-related services for which the HSE currently has responsibility including pre-school inspections and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services;</p><p>- The Family Support Agency which currently operates as a separate body under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and will be merged into the new Agency;</p><p>- The National Educational Welfare Board which also currently operates as a separate body under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and will be merged into the new Agency;</p><p>- Community-based psychology services (this does not encompass psychologists operating within acute, disability, mental health or other specialist settings).</p><p>The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health are working jointly on an impact analysis of proposed future arrangements for this service as they relate to children and family services covered by the Child and Family Agency and to services provided by the HSE.</p><p>  The establishment of a single agency incorporating key children's services will provide a focus for the major reforms already underway within Children and Family Services.  These reforms include:</p><p>- the continued and urgent implementation of a comprehensive change programme to improve the quality and consistency of child welfare and protection services.  This change programme is addressing the quality and consistency of child welfare and protection services, and is being led by the Chief Executive designate of the Child and Family Agency.  This change process will continue into the new Agency;</p><p>- the separation of children and family services within the HSE from other health and personal social services, with discrete management responsibilities and budgets, providing transparency and accountability for the use of resources to meet national priorities;</p><p>- the development of dedicated children and families responsibility and accountability at area, regional and national management team levels;</p><p>- commencement of external inspection by HIQA of the child welfare and protection services.</p><p>  Extensive work is ongoing in the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs and Health, and in the HSE to prepare for the establishment of the Child and Family Agency.  The preparations are designed to allow for the Agency to assume full statutory responsibility for services for children and families upon establishment.  </p><p>  Drafting of the Child and Family Agency Bill is at an advanced stage.  This legislation will be published and debated by the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity.  A precise target date will be set when consideration of the legislation is advanced.</p><p>  In addition to this large scale structural reform programme, the HSE Child and Family Directorate is also implementing a significant programme of ongoing reforms.  These reforms at operational level respond in detail to many identified gaps and changes needed to ensure a more consistent, effective and quality service delivery.  They include, for example:</p><p>- Development of a National Child Care Information System to comprehensively address issues of record keeping and data management;</p><p>- Improvements in respect of social worker assignment and care planning;</p><p>- The preparation of a business case for a National Out of Hours Social Work Service;</p><p>- The recruitment of 260 additional social workers proposed in the Ryan Report Implementation Plan.</p><p>  Over 1,400 social workers are employed in Children and Family Support Services and the introduction of 260 additional social workers represents a significant strengthening of the work force.   Arrangements for the induction, training and supervision of these staff have been put in place.  Support for all staff includes the introduction of national guidance, such as Child Protection and Welfare Practice Handbook, and supervision of the implementation of this guidance.</p><p>  The development of the legislation to establish the Child and Family Agency is part of a suite of legislative developments to strengthen child protection in accordance with the Programme for Government. Another significant piece of legislation relates to the Children First guidance.  Following publication of the Draft Heads and General Scheme for the Children First Bill, 2012, consideration by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children of the Bill and related submissions, my Department has further considered a range of policy and operational issues, and the preparation of revised policy proposals is currently under way.</p><p>  My Department has a range of other legislation also in train in the area of adoption and is also reviewing scoping further legislative requirements as may arise from the Children's Referendum.  Together with the programme of reform of structural governance and the operational change programme, I believe this represents one of the most challenging agendas of reform of any sector across the public services.</p></reply>

Under the Regulations the HSE has responsibility for the inspection of pre-school services.  While pre-school inspections are necessary to ensure compliance with the regulations, it is important to realise that inspections alone are not the answer to improving quality.  What is required is a multifaceted approach, and since this Government came to office we have been working to ensure issues relating to child protection and welfare are put front and centre.  The establishment of a Department of Children and Youth Affairs was recognition of the huge body of work which needs to be done in this area.</p><p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, driving the early childhood care and education quality agenda is one of my key objectives.  I believe we can achieve this objective by taking a number of steps in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, including the adaptation of the existing pre-school inspection system to provide a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for preschools, moving to a greater focus on outcomes for children.</p><p>  The Government has approved the Heads of the Child and Family Agency Bill and has also agreed to the priority drafting of this Bill.  The necessary legislative and organisational preparations are being prioritised so that the Agency can be established as soon as possible.  The Agency, upon establishment, will assume full statutory responsibility for a range of child and family services currently provided by three separate agencies; namely the HSE which will include the services provided by the Childcare Inspectorate, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.</p><p>  The majority of preschools in this country are participating in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and providing a free pre-school year to almost 68,000 pre-school children each year.  The programme is subject to terms and conditions which are strictly implemented to ensure that quality pre-school care and education services is provided to qualifying children.  To ensure compliance by participating services, Pobal who assist my Department with the implementation of the programme, carry out annual compliance visits and will also engage further with services when required.</p></reply>

As set out in the General Scheme, the Bill will largely focus on the technical task of bringing together the functions of the three &ldquo;source&rdquo; agencies (the HSE, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board).  Particular care is required in respect of the disaggregation of the functions from the HSE to ensure that there are no unintended consequences (for either the Agency or the Directorates remaining within the HSE framework) in the separation of functions, either in legal terms, or in terms of the practical operation of day-to-day services for children and their families or HSE clients across the life cycle.</p><p>  A key task in drafting the legislation will be to ensure that the Agency operates within a strong framework of public accountability.  Other important features of the legislation relate to the need to create the correct platform for interagency arrangements, shared service arrangements and a robust process for the commissioning of services from a range of providers.  In addition to creating a framework for the future, the Bill also has to take account of the transitional arrangements which will inevitably have to be prescribed.  These are potentially complex against the backdrop of changing governance and structural arrangements in the context of the wider Health Reform programme.  It is my intention to introduce the Child and Family Agency Bill to the Houses of the Oireachtas in this session.</p></reply>

The North South Ministerial Council meets in Sectoral Format to oversee co-operation in agreed areas/sectors.  At these Sectoral meetings the Irish Government is represented by the Minister or the Minister of State responsible for that Sector, and the Northern Ireland Executive is represented by two Ministers nominated by the First Minister and deputy First Minister on a cross-community basis.</p><p>  Following a North South Ministerial Council Plenary meeting in February 2008, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety [DHSSPS] and the then Office of the Minister for Children (now DCYA) established a Cross Border Group on Child Protection, comprising officials from relevant departments to intensify cooperation on Child Protection including:</p><p>- early progress on an all-island Child Protection awareness campaign;</p><p>- the identification of other medium/long term measures to improve Child Protection, including an examination of an all-island approach to child protection, focusing in particular on vetting and exchange of information;</p><p>- any areas for co-operation on children's services emerging from the North South Feasibility Study on health and social services.</p><p>  The cross border group is co-chaired by DCYA and DHSSPS. In June, 2008, it was agreed to take forward <b>5 initiatives</b> through a sub-group structure, in areas where co-operation, shared learning and best practice could be of benefit to both jurisdictions, and to meet every six months to review progress.  The first five sub-groups were:</p><p><b>(i) Vetting and Barring Protocol</b></p><p><b>(ii) Research and Knowledge Transfer in Child Protection</b></p><p><b>(iii) Internet Safety</b></p><p><b>(iv) All-Ireland Media Awareness</b></p><p><b><i>(v) Inter-Jurisdictional Protocol for the Transfer of Child Care cases between Northern Ireland and Ireland</i></b></p><p>  The Steering Group agreed that since the work of the first five sub-groups had largely been completed and they were accordingly stood down and a new work programme developed.  The group, in July 2012, explored a number of areas of potential co-operation and recommended that a future programme of work be taken forward through five specific work streams focussing on:<b>Work Stream 1 - Knowledge Exchange Forum,</b> designed to promote continued learning through use of research and evidence based practice.</p><p><b>Work Stream 2 - Quality and Effectiveness,</b> to build work-force capacity and improve the quality and effectiveness of social work and social care work interventions and practice.</p><p><b>Work Stream 3 - Deaths of Children in Care,</b> contribute to learning in relation to deaths of children in care by developing an overview and analysis of the features of deaths of children in care in both jurisdictions.</p><p><b>Work Stream 4 - Cultural Competence in Safeguarding,</b> to assist the development of common guidance for practitioners working with other cultures and to develop a publication of Good Practice Notes for work with new communities.</p><p><b>Work Stream 5 - Specialist Services,</b> to assess the opportunities to develop specialist services on a cross-border basis to assist in meeting the needs of those children and families where there is a requirement for a high volume of expertise.</p></reply>

Following Initial Assessment decisions will be made on the type of intervention required, including the drawing up of a child protection plan, family support interventions, as well as decisions regarding supervision orders or whether a child may need to be taken into care for a short term or longer period.  The Child Protection Plan will have identified the key risk factors in the case such as:- the risk itself; how it will be reduced, including specific actions; how the agencies working with the family will measure the reduced risk  within a specific timescale.  A supervision order is sought from the Court if the family do not cooperate with the Child Protection Plan.</p><p>  The Child Care Act, 1991 provides that the HSE may apply to the Court for a supervision order.  Section 19 (1) provides:</p><p><i>Where, on the application the Health Service Executive, with respect to a child, the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that--</i></p><p><i>(a) the child has been or is being assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused, or </i></p><p><i>(b) the child's health, development or welfare has been or is being avoidably impaired or neglected, or</i></p><p><i>(c) the child's health, development or welfare is likely to be avoidably impaired or neglected, and it is desirable that the child be visited periodically by or on behalf of the Health Service Executive, the court may make an order (in this Act referred to as a &#8220;supervision order&#8221;) in respect of the child.&quot;</i></p><p>  A supervision order gives the HSE the authority to visit and monitor the health and welfare of the child and to give the parents any necessary advice. It also allows the Judge to give directions as to the care of the child directly to the parent . The order is for up to a maximum of 12 months but may be renewed. A supervision order is often the first step in proceedings where the HSE believes that while further action is required, it is not necessary to apply to the Court to take the child into care. Supervision orders may also be used  when a child who has been in care is returning to its family.  The HSE has informed me that it is not common practice to apply for a supervision order without informing the parent(s) or guardian(s) as supervision orders are generally aimed at outlining, in specific terms the areas of action for a parent(s) in implementing a child protection plan.</p></reply>

In line with the Programme for Government, my Department has made a significant commitment to maintaining this universal programme.  The ECCE programme has been extremely successful to date with the number of children availing of the free pre-school provision consistently high each year since the programme was introduced in 2010.  In the current pre-school year, 2012/2013, approximately 68,000 children, or an estimated 95% of the eligible cohort, are participating in the free pre-school year.  Access to quality and affordable childcare has a major impact on the lives of children, and this programme has been particularly important for those children who may be socially or economically disadvantaged and would not otherwise be in a position to avail of quality pre-school care and education.</p><p>  In each year some 3 to 4 thousand eligible children do not participate in the pre-school year and we are aware of some of the reasons for this.  For example, over 1,500 children within the age cohort participate in the Early Start Programme run by the Department of Education and Skills and I am aware that some children with disabilities attend special preschools funded by the HSE.  To date no research has  been carried out on the factors impacting on decisions made by parents in relation to participation.</p></reply>

First of all, the Ombudsman outlines issues experienced by her office in dealing with complaints relating to St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  The points made in relation to the procedure for handling complaints from children in St Patrick's Institution are a matter for the Irish Prison Service in the first instance.</p><p>  The second issue mentioned by the Ombudsman&rsquo;s annual report relates to her concern that progress is made with the Oberstown capital project, which is to expand the detention places and facilities on the Oberstown campus.  This project is required in order to give effect to the Programme for Government commitment to end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities.  I have outlined my commitment to this project on many different occasions and it remains at the top of my agenda.</p><p>  To date, I have put in place the required funding package for the project and my officials have, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, completed the design process and secured planning permission for the proposed development.  The tender process is ongoing at present and this is being overseen by a steering group of officials from my Department and the Office of Public Works.  A further announcement on the outcome of the tendering process will be made shortly.  </p><p>  There is legal provision under the Children Act 2001 for 24 male bed spaces in Trinity House School, 8 female bed spaces in Oberstown Girls School, and 20 male bed spaces in Oberstown Boys School. However, only 16 of the certified 24 male bed spaces in Trinity House School are currently available for use due to staffing shortages.  The Irish Youth Justice Service, which is based in my Department, is currently in discussions with management and staff on the Oberstown campus on an initiative to reorganise the detention capacity for males and female bed places, in order to meet the increased demand for male bed places from the courts.  This is being progressed at present.</p><p>  Work and accommodation conditions on the Oberstown campus are governed by a range of criteria, legislation and operational policies.  The campus is subject to inspection by  the Health Information and Quality Authority.  The campus is also under the remit of the Ombudsman for Children and is periodically reviewed by international organisations such as the Council of Europe.  The campus is subject to a range of care policies which are communicated to staff and management and published on the website of the Irish Youth Justice Service.  </p><p>  The new campus staffing roster was implemented on 25 February 2013 following protracted negotiation and agreement between staff and management at the Labour Relations Commission.  The operation of the campus roster is currently the subject of discussions between management and staff representatives, in line with the provisions of the LRC agreement.  An independent review of the operation of the roster is to commence shortly.  This is the first time all care staff on the campus are operating under a set of harmonised conditions for hours worked, taking of breaks and flexibility of staff deployment between each of the three children detention schools.  I wish to acknowledge the cooperation of staff with the implementation of the LRC agreement to date.</p><p>  A number of issues have been the subject of consideration in conjunction with implementation of the campus wide roster, such as the need to ensure that all certified bed capacity is available for use, training needs, harmonisation of care procedures, clarification of procedures for the taking of breaks and the interpretation of the agreement provisions on flexibility  of deployment.  These are being addressed as part of the ongoing industrial relations process on the campus.  Further discussions are also likely on the issue of how the Haddington Road Agreement provisions for working hours will be incorporated into the campus roster.</p></reply>

This figure include 3,144 children age 0-1, 14,135 aged 1-3 and 65,854 aged 3-5.  The remaining 16,087 were availing of after-school care. </p><p>  My Department currently provides funding to support three childcare programmes - the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme - which provide a range of supports to parents of preschool children and also after-school care for children older than 6 years.  </p><p>  The ECCE programme provides for a free preschool year to all eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  Almost every preschool service (more than 4,300) in the State is participating with over 68,000 children, which is estimated to be almost 95% of the eligible age cohort, availing of free preschool this year.  </p><p>  The CCS programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments or on low or relatively modest incomes. These supports are available to both preschool and after school children and it is estimated that in the region of 25,000 children are supported under the CCS each year. </p><p>  The CETS<b></b>  programme provides &euro;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places to participating childcare services in both the community and commercial sectors for qualifying F&Aacute;S and VEC trainees and students with students on part-time courses funded on a pro rata basis. It is estimated that the number of children supported under the CETS programme is in the region of 5,500 annually. </p><p>  A new After-school Childcare Programme was announced in Budget 2013 and will be fully rolled out in September 2013. This programme represents a full year investment of &euro;14 million, and will provide important support to parents in low income families wishing to take up employment, by ensuring that some 6,000 quality after-school care places are provided to support children's development. It is anticipated that a small number of the places available will be utilised by children in the age cohort referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Some of the provisions  in the Health (Amendment) Bill 2013 fall into this category while others do not.  As the Health (Amendment) Bill is a combination of budgetary, charging and general policy matters, the position regarding RIAs is different, depending on the issue concerned.  </p><p>  Of the three main areas covered by the Bill the position in relation to RIAs is as follows: amendment of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 - RIA undertaken.  Arrangements are being made to have this RIA placed on my Department's website.  Charges for public in-patient and long-term residential care services - Summary explanatory RIA undertaken for sole purpose of Government Memorandum.  Charges for private in-patient services - No RIA undertaken.</p><p>  With regard to private in-patient charges, the Government decided as part of Budget 2013 that all private patients using public hospital facilities and resources would be charged the economic cost of providing those services. The Government believes that the charge for private care in public hospitals should cover the hospitals' costs of providing the service, including the non-consultant hospital doctors, nursing staff, medical and surgical supplies, diagnostics, operating theatres, administration and support staff. Given that a private patient is using resources that cost, on average,  in excess of &euro;1,000 per day, it is clear that the current situation represents a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and an indirect subsidy of about &euro;200 million to private insurance companies.  This is equivalent to the cost of running a medium-sized public hospital. Budget 2013 provided for an additional &euro;120 million to be raised in a full year in 2014 from applying charges to all private patients in public hospitals.   The charges set out in the schedules to the Bill have been calculated with a view to raising this amount in a full year.</p></reply>

From a policy perspective it is important to have a regulatory framework in place to support the development of new medicines. Clinical trials are essential for the development of new medicines and the Clinical Trials Proposal currently being negotiated at EU level, which was a key priority for my Department during the Irish Presidency of the EU Council, is designed to make Europe a more attractive place to carry out clinical trials on new and innovative therapies.</p><p>  The first step for a medicine to be placed on the Irish market involves the manufacturer seeking an authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) or in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A determination on the application for authorisation is based on a rigorous scientific assessment of the application against legal and regulatory requirements. </p><p>  Once authorised, applications for the inclusion of new medicines in the GMS and community drugs schemes are considered in line with procedures and timescales agreed in 2012 between the Department of Health, the HSE and the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA).  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducts a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) which provides detailed information on the potential budget impact of the medicine. It also assesses whether the medicine is cost effective at the price quoted by the company in question.</p><p>  In October 2012 a new deal on drug costs was agreed between the IPHA, the HSE and my Department resulting in major savings on the cost of drugs. The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be used to fund new drugs to patients over this period.</p></reply>

I am concerned about the level of smoking in Ireland and it remains my objective that Ireland moves towards being  a tobacco free society.  The tobacco control measures which have already been introduced and future planned measures will, in my view, make a significant contribution to the reduction in the numbers of people smoking in Ireland, in particular the numbers of children and young people who start to smoke.</p><p>  In parallel with these tobacco control measures the Revenue Commissioners are responsible for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products.  They attach a high priority to tackling this trade because of the threat that it poses to society.   Revenue&rsquo;s &ldquo;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013)&rdquo; includes a range of measures designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for illicit cigarettes and other tobacco products. My Department and the HSE strongly support this Strategy.  I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the intention is to put a further strategy in place, when the current one comes to an end, to act as the strategic focus for the ongoing extensive work against the smuggling and sale of illicit products.</p></reply>

However, in an emergency admission if a private designated bed is not available and a private in-patient is accommodated in a public bed, the maintenance charge is currently not levied, although the private in-patient continues to pay the fees of his/her hospital consultant.</p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has reported that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying private-designated beds.  This situation represents a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and an indirect subsidy to private insurance companies, who cover most private patients.  I believe that this situation cannot continue and that the new charge makes sense. Up to now insurers have enjoyed a significant subsidy, where these private patients have only paid a standard &euro;75 charge per day to the hospital even though they have seen and paid their consultant privately.</p><p>  The gap between the cost of providing this service to private in-patients and the amount that public hospitals are currently allowed to raise from those private patients is estimated to be about &euro;200m per year. The subsidy is equivalent to the cost of treating over 30,000 public patients every year or operating a medium size public hospital. While everyone is entitled to use a public hospital, some people chose to be treated privately, in which case they have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital. The Government believes that users of private services should pay for the costs of providing these services even when they are provided by a public hospital.</p><p>  As part of Budget 2013, the Government announced that it would raise &euro;60m in 2013 under this heading, and &euro;115m in a full year. This represents a modest phasing in of the charge &ndash; as called for by the insurers themselves - and is a relatively modest extra cost on an industry that pays out some &euro;2 billion in claims costs every year.</p><p>  The Health (Amendment) Bill 2013 is presently before the D&aacute;il and provides for charges to be levied on all in-patients who are treated privately by their consultant, irrespective of where the patient is accommodated in the hospital and regardless of whether they are admitted directly or through emergency departments.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-02a.1584.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070200088#WRFF03500"><p>In recent years, a number of changes to the pricing and reimbursement system have been successfully introduced in Ireland. These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines.</p><p>  Following intensive negotiations involving the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.</p><p>  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nominated EU member states in which the medicine is then available. The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 November 2012 and further price reductions were implemented on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.</p><p>  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years. Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.</p><p>  The Department and the HSE also finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. Under this Agreement, from 1 November 2012, the HSE will only reimburse generic products which have been priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE will require a generic price to be priced below the originator price. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate.</p><p>  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which was commenced on the 24 of June, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. The Act provides that when the HSE is setting a reference price for, or reviewing a reference price set for, a relevant group of interchangeable medicinal products it shall take into account the following criteria: the ability of suppliers to meet patient demand for the relevant item; the value for money afforded by the relevant item; the equivalent prices of the relevant item in all other Member States where the product is marketed; the prices of therapeutically similar items; and the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>  It is important to balance achieving best value for money for the taxpayer with assuring continuity of supply for critical medical products, particularly in a small market like Ireland. Consequently, the Act aims to achieve value for money while avoiding disruption in the availability of medicines on the Irish market. This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients.</p><p>  At present, pharmacists are not required to publish their dispensing and other fees.  However, under the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland&rsquo;s (PSI) Code of Conduct, pharmacists are required to provide honest, relevant, accurate, current and appropriate information to patients regarding the nature, cost, value and benefit of medicines provided by them. Every pharmacist has an obligation to comply in full with the statutory Code of Conduct. </p><p>  The PSI advises patients that their pharmacist should be in a position to provide them with whatever information or clarification they require about prescribed medicines, including information about the pricing of those medicines. The Department of Health has asked the PSI to examine how greater price transparency can be achieved. It should also be noted that the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 provides patients with an incentive to seek products priced at or below the reference price.  </p><p>  It is the view of the HSE and the Department of Health that there should be total transparency provided when any pharmaceutical service is accessed by a member of the public. </p></reply>

This Act provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. It also sets out statutory procedures governing the supply, reimbursement and pricing of medicines and other items to patients under the GMS and community drug schemes.  The key aim of the legislation is to ensure value for money in the supply of medicines; therefore, the medicines that will be reviewed first by the Irish Medicines Board are most costly to patients and the Exchequer. The IMB will review an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines.   They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.  The drugs involved are:- </p><p>  Atorvastatin</p><p>  Anastrozole </p><p>  Candesartan </p><p>  Clopidogrel </p><p>  Esomeprazole </p><p>  Lansoprazole</p><p>  Lercanidipine </p><p>  Losartan </p><p>  Olanzapine </p><p>  Omeprazole </p><p>  Pantoprazole </p><p>  Perindopril </p><p>  Pravastatin </p><p>  Quetiapine </p><p>  Rabeprazole </p><p>  Ramipril </p><p>  Risperidone </p><p>  Rosuvastatin </p><p>  Simvastatin </p><p>  Valsartan </p><p>It is expected that the first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, will be published in mid-August. The IMB will publish subsequent lists for other groups of medicines on an ongoing basis. From the end of the year onwards, hundreds of thousands of prescriptions will be subject to generic substitution, which will offer choice and reduced prices to patients.   </p></reply>

Firstly, I wish to extend my deepest sympathies to the family of the child involved. The loss of a loved one is hard for family and friends at any time, but the sudden and unexpected death of a young child is particularly difficult.</p><p>  In relation to this incident, the facts are that, at 1.16 am on 18 June 2013, an emergency call was received for a baby who was reported as not breathing. The National Ambulance Service (NAS) was initially unable to obtain sufficient details of where help was needed, which led to a delay in reaching the incident.  The first emergency resource arrived at the scene 30 minutes after the initial 999 call.  The patient was subsequently pronounced dead. </p><p>  The incident has been the subject of a systems analysis, as is routine in cases where a death occurs, to ascertain whether call-taking protocols were followed.  Following an examination of the facts, the HSE is satisfied that systems and processes operated correctly and there are no plans to carry out any further review.  However, interrogation has been strengthened to try and mitigate the impact of a call where the incident location cannot be identified. In addition, HSE Communications has been requested to run a publicity campaign to improve public awareness of the need to communicate precisely the locations of incidents.  In the interest of respecting the dignity and grief of the family, I wish to make no further comment on the specific incident.</p><p>  A significant reform programme has been underway to totally reconfigure the way the HSE manages and delivers pre-hospital care services, to ensure a clinically driven, nationally co-ordinated system, supported by improved technology.  The National Control Centre Reconfiguration Project, which is endorsed by HIQA and which represents international best practice, will reduce the number of ambulance control centres to a single national control system, with significant investment in new voice, data and mapping technologies.  The project is also a key element of Future Health:  A Strategic Framework for Health Reform in Ireland 2012-2015. </p><p>  Both HIQA and the NAS have had concerns over control and dispatch structures at some control centres leading up to the development of the national control system.  Accordingly, the NAS moved the Cork and Tralee centres to its Townsend Street centre on an interim basis in May, to mitigate such concerns pending completion of the national centre.  Detailed preparations took place to ensure the safety of services during the move of the Cork and Kerry operations.  The NAS provided additional staff, training, technology and equipment to assist this process. 112/999 calls from those areas are now answered in Dublin using improved technology.  The NAS is satisfied that Townsend St, while not appropriate to the needs of the overall reconfiguration project, is nevertheless suitable and infrastructurally sound for the interim accommodation of these centres. </p></reply>

The inclusion of young children with disabilities in mainstream pre-school settings is an integral part of the Government&rsquo;s policy on mainstreaming which advocates that mainstream public services should serve people with disabilities alongside other citizens.  It is with this in mind that the HSE&rsquo;s Intellectual Disability Services in Co. Donegal have embarked on a project to facilitate the inclusion, where appropriate, of children with an intellectual disability in mainstream pre-schools. </p><p>  A Project Team has been established to determine the supports that will be required in mainstream pre-schools to accommodate these children.  The overall aim of the Project is to ensure that these children can be educated in their own communities and with their own peers, rather than being segregated in specialist disability services, unless a child is assessed as requiring specialist care.  I am advised no more than 5% of cases of children with a disability should require specialised pre-school provision to the extent that integration in a mainstream pre-school setting is not feasible.    </p><p>  There are currently two specialised pre-schools in Co. Donegal:  St. Agnes pre-school in Donegal town and Ballaghderg pre-school in Letterkenny.  The HSE has assured me that it has no immediate plans to close Ballaghderg pre-school and this pre-school will continue to deliver services until 2015.  The position in respect of St. Agnes pre-school in Donegal town is that it will close at the end of 2014.  The HSE arrived at this decision very recently and it was made following consultation with the parents concerned.  There are currently four children at the pre-school.  One of these children is due to commence school in September 2013 and the remaining three children will continue to avail of specialist pre-school services at St. Agnes until they are due to commence school in September 2014.</p><p>  The HSE has given assurances that it will continue to engage with parents as this Project develops with a view to ensuring the children in question receive the best possible support in the most appropriate setting.  The Framework for Action for the Inclusion of Children with Special Needs in Early Childhood Education Settings was developed as a research project by Mary Immaculate College in Limerick, having been commissioned by the Department of Education and Skills.   In that context, I have been advised that the framework is used primarily as a teaching tool by those delivering courses on inclusion of children with special needs.</p></reply>

The procurement of infrastructure projects via PPP involves a tendering process, whereby consortia are invited to Design, Build, Finance, Maintain and Operate a particular piece of public infrastructure.  The consortium, which must be in a position to secure private debt financing and private equity to support its bid,  is also subject to an extensive financial due diligence process by the private funding providers prior to loan approval.  </p><p>As a consequence of this financial structure, the impact of the infrastructure investment on the General Government Balance is gradual rather than up-front, thereby allowing the Government cost of financing infrastructure to be spread over the lifetime of the asset.   The Public Private Partnership (PPP) process   involves a large element of up-front funding by the private sector. The &euro;115m referred to in the July 2012 Stimulus Package announcement is the public sector's best estimate of what it could cost the private sector to deliver the PPP bundles.   This indented &euro;115m is not public funding which can be allocated to the direct-build capital programme.</p><p>  The delivery of primary care infrastructure is a dynamic process and must take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementing the delivery of the centres by means of lease, direct- build or PPP.   GP engagement and agreement to deliver primary care services from primary care centres is central to delivery of the necessary infrastructure.  Regardless of the method of delivery or deprivation ranking, locations cannot be progressed unless there is committed GP engagement.</p></reply>

The level of health services to be delivered within the available funding for 2013 has been set out in the HSE National Service Plan for 2013, which I approved in January.  I have made enquires of the HSE in relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific queries regarding the current expenditure on autism across the country.   However, the HSE has advised it is not in a position to provide a breakdown of the funding currently being spent on autism services in Ireland.  This is due to the manner in which funding is allocated between broad categories such as services for older people, primary care and disabilities in general.  Disability services are provided based on the needs of the individual, rather than by the actual type of disability.  The Executive also explained that people with autism may attend autism-specific services, or may obtain services from a service provider who provides services for a wide range of intellectual disabilities, including autism.  The HSE will provide in the order of &euro;1.5 billion in 2013 to fund health services for children and adults with disabilities, including autism.  This represents approximately 11.5% of the &euro;13.3billion health budget for 2013.  It should also be noted that while the HSE provides a range of services to adults and children with disabilities, the majority of this funding is distributed through non-statutory agencies who deliver over 80% of all disability services.</p><p>  The HSE National Review of Autism Services: Past, Present and Way Forward Report (2012) and the Progressing Disabilities Services for Children and Young People (0-18s) Programme set out the policy context for the provision of autism services to children and young people.  The objective of the Progressing Disabilities Programme is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services so that there is a clear pathway to the services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability.  This Programme aims to remedy the variations in service provision that currently persist around the country.  </p><p>  To assist in addressing some of these variations, I announced the allocation of &euro;1m in funding for autism and early intervention services in 2012.  Based on a report prepared by the HSE, I approved &euro;300,000 of this funding, which equates to five therapists posts, for Beechpark services in Dublin, north of the Liffey, to address the pressing needs of its catchment area, with a particular emphasis on reducing waiting times.  The report also proposed an allocation for Beechpark in the Dublin Mid-Leinster region which was to be rolled out in year two (i.e. Dublin south of the Liffey, Kildare and Wicklow).    </p><p>  I also established an Independent Review Group in 2012, to look at the Beechpark model of services and how resources could be used in the best and most effective way, in light of the HSE Review of Autism Services and the re-organisation of services underway in line with the 0-18's Programme.  Further funding in relation to Beechpark and other regions of the country, was put on hold, pending the outcome of this Review.  I understand that this Review is expected to be concluded shortly.</p><p>  Following ongoing discussions on the best way forward in relation to Beechpark Autism Services, the HSE has confirmed that the funding approved will be allocated to HSE Dublin North East in 2013 for Beechpark in order to address the waiting list for services in Dublin North East.  This will provide, in the first instance, for the recruitment of the necessary five therapy staff.   I am very aware, however, that addressing the significant pressures in Dublin North East is only a starting point. The balance of funding for autism and early intervention services nationally will be made available.  The issue of the allocation of these further resources will be required to be looked at, in light of the findings of the Independent Review.  </p></reply>

The HSE aims to ensure that therapy resources, such as Speech and Language Therapy services, are used to best effect.   There has been significant investment in the area of speech and language therapists in recent years and a range of new approaches have been developed and used in many Speech and Language Therapy services across the country.  These include providing structures and training to parents or carers so that they can work with the individual child to improve their speech and language.  Therapy is also delivered in group settings, where appropriate.  </p><p>  The policy context for the provision of autism services to children and young people is set out in the HSE National Review of Autism Services: Past, Present and Way Forward Report (2012) and the Progressing Disabilities Services for Children and Young People (0-18s) Programme.  The objective of the Progressing Disabilities Programme is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services so that there is a clear pathway to the services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability.  This Programme aims to remedy the variations in service provision that currently persist around the country.  </p><p>  As the particular issue raised by the Deputy relates to an individual case, this is a service matter for the HSE.  Accordingly, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-02a.1694.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070200090#WRHH02800"><p>The communication of information on cancer risk and carrier probability is not straightforward.  There is a degree of uncertainty with respect to the probability of inheriting a predisposing genetic mutation, of gene penetrance and hence of developing cancer.  People who are concerned about a family history of breast cancer may require information to help them deal with the complex medical and social choices linked with different levels of breast cancer risk management options, and support to cope with the associated uncertainty and anxiety.  It is therefore not appropriate to develop a general population based screening programme for the presence of genetic mutations.  </p><p>  Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer diagnosed in women in Ireland.  A comprehensive symptomatic breast service is available for women in the eight designated cancer centres.  Most cases of breast cancer arise in women with no apparent close family history.  The majority of people with a family history of breast cancer will not be at substantially increased risk.</p><p>  However, five to ten per cent of all breast cancers are explained by the presence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.  The lifetime risk of breast cancer in these women may be as high as 80%.  However, not all familial clusters can be explained by known breast cancer susceptibility genes such as BRCA1 or BRCA2.</p><p>  The National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) established a National Hereditary Cancer Programme in 2011 with the National Centre for Medical Genetics in Crumlin Hospital.  Additional genetic testing clinics have been established in St James's and the Mater Hospitals in Dublin - with a similar service due to be opened in Cork University Hospital in the coming months.  In 2012 the new clinics in the Mater and St James's Hospitals assessed and tested almost 200 women (with breast or ovarian cancer) for the BRCA gene mutation.  This represents more than a 100% increase in the numbers of women tested nationally compared with 2011.</p><p>  There are two groups of women involved &ndash; those who have been diagnosed with cancer and those who have a family member who has been found to carry a gene mutation.  Testing is undertaken on the basis of agreed medical criteria and is always preceded by genetic counselling.  The NCCP and National Centre for Medical Genetics are continuing to work to ensure that the service is expanded to meet national needs.  </p><p>  Accurate predictive breast cancer genetic testing on a healthy woman with a family history of breast cancer is not clinically useful, unless a specific gene alteration has been identified in an affected family member.  Well women without a personal history of breast cancer who are concerned about their family history should in the first instance discuss their concerns with their family doctor.  The GP will want to know details of the family history and any information available in relation to genetic testing of relatives.  The GP may then refer the patient to a specialist secondary care service such as a Symptomatic Breast Disease Unit, if there are features highly suggestive of familial disease, for more detailed assessment.</p></reply>

A comprehensive symptomatic breast service is available for women in the eight designated cancer centres.  Most cases of breast cancer arise in women with no apparent close family history.  The majority of people with a family history of breast cancer will not be at substantially increased risk. </p><p>  Women at increased risk of breast cancer due to their family history have a specific range of strategies currently available to reduce their risk.  For those for whom risk-reducing surgery is unsuitable or unacceptable, chemoprevention using drugs such as tamoxifen and raloxifene may represent a more acceptable means of risk reduction. </p><p>  Tamoxifen and raloxifene reduce the risk of breast cancer for women without a personal history but who have an increased risk of the disease.  As they are not currently licensed for chemoprevention in well women with a family history of breast cancer in Ireland, they can only be prescribed by a doctor following professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision and documenting informed consent from the patient.  It is not appropriate to offer them to all women aged over 35 years with a family history of breast and related cancers.  Drug licensing in Ireland is the responsibility of the Irish Medicines Board. </p><p>  All drugs have side effects and risks which are particularly important when they are being used to prevent other diseases.  Discussion and information should include the side effects of drugs, the extent of risk reduction, and the risks and benefits of alternative approaches, such as risk-reducing surgery and surveillance.  Discussion in relation to risk of cancer of the lining of the womb, or blood clotting and in relation to bone health are of particular importance for tamoxifen and raloxifene.</p><p>  The communication of information on cancer risk and carrier probability is complex.  There is a degree of uncertainty with respect to the probability of inheriting a predisposing genetic mutation, of gene penetrance and hence of developing cancer.  People who are concerned about a family history of breast cancer may require information to help them deal with the complex medical and social choices linked with different levels of breast cancer risk management options, and support to cope with the associated uncertainty and anxiety. </p><p>  The National Cancer Control Programme will be examining the most recent guidance, published this month, on Familial Breast Cancer from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK in relation to the management of chemoprevention and other aspects of the care of patients with a family history of breast cancer.</p></reply>

Under the GMS contract, GPs receive a range of fees and allowances, including an annual capitation payment in respect of each medical card and GP visit card patient on their GMS list.</p><p>  Under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009, an 8% reduction in a range of GP fees and allowances was introduced in 2009, which effected full year savings in the region of &euro;34 million.  Further reductions to a range of fees and allowances were introduced in 2010, which effected full year savings in the region of &euro;44 million.  This equates to an approximate additional reduction of 9%.</p><p>   Following a further review and having due regard to Section 9 of the FEMPI Act 2009, the Minister for Health has decided to apply further reductions to the fees and allowances payable to GPs which equate to an overall reduction of 7.5%.  This will amount to a saving of some &euro;38 million in a full year.  Regulations are being prepared to give effect to the Minister's decision.</p><p>  The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new GMS GP contract with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams.  The appropriate payment arrangements will be considered as part of the new GMS contract.</p><p>  Capitation fees are paid to General Practitioners where a person has eligibility for a Medical/GP Visit Card. Fees are not paid where eligibility no longer exists e.g. following an assessment of their means, emigration or death. Under the Health Act 1970, there is an obligation on all card holders to notify the HSE of any change in their circumstances, which would put them above the Medical Card/GP Visit Card income guidelines.</p><p>  In addition to the normal three-yearly review of eligibility on expiration of a medical card, targeted reviews of eligibility were introduced during 2012, in relation to medical cards which had been inactive for more than 12 months. In such cases, medical card holders were formally contacted to confirm that they were still resident in the State. In cases where no response was received, eligibility was removed and the payment of capitation fees ceased.  A person whose eligibility is under review who appeals a decision regarding their eligibility retains their original eligibility until an Appeal decision is reached.</p></reply>

In recent years, a number of changes to the pricing and reimbursement system have been successfully introduced in Ireland. These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines.</p><p>  Following intensive negotiations involving the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including </p><p>- significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs,</p><p>  - a lowering of the drugs bill to the State,</p><p>  - timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and</p><p>  - reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.</p><p>  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nominated EU member states in which the medicine is then available. The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 November 2012 and further price reductions were implemented on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.</p><p>  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years. Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.</p><p>  The Department and the HSE have successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. Under this Agreement, from 1 November 2012, the HSE will only reimburse generic products which have been priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE will require a generic price to be priced below the originator price. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate.</p><p>  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which was commenced on the 24th of June, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. The key aim of the legislation is to ensure value for money in the supply of medicines; therefore, the medicines that will be reviewed first are most costly to patients and the Exchequer.   The consultation process for the first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, started on the 26th of June. It is expected that this list will be published in mid-August at which time generic prices will fall by 20%.</p><p>  It is important to balance achieving best value for money for the taxpayer with assuring continuity of supply for critical medical products, particularly in a small market like Ireland. Consequently, the Act aims to achieve value for money while avoiding disruption in the availability of medicines on the Irish market. This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients.</p><p>  It is not possible, at this juncture, to provide accurate figures regarding potential savings resulting from the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing, as these depend on various factors including prevailing prices, number of competitors, availability of substitute products, and market dynamics.</p><p>  The Department is committed to establishing high-level annual targets by the end of September for the share of generic penetration over the medium-term. These targets will be informed by the ESRI report <i>Pharmaceutical Prices, Prescribing Practices and Usage of Generics in a Comparative Context,</i> which was published on the 27th of June.</p></reply>

The aim is to address the needs of individuals in the following ways, through:</p><p>  - Health-funded rehabilitative or life-skills training;</p><p>  - Health-funded day services;</p><p>  - F&Aacute;S-funded vocational training, or;</p><p>  - Extension to education placement for a specified time.</p><p>  Vocational training which prepares people, including young people with disabilities, for employment in the open labour market is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills and F&Aacute;S. Rehabilitative training, which has no connection with the open labour market, is the responsibility of the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE). The purpose of rehabilitative training is to develop the individual's life skills, social skills and basic work skills. Approximately 3,000 people with disabilities avail of rehabilitative training each year, some of whom then progress to vocational training, other training or employment. Some young people with disabilities, depending on their individual needs and abilities, require continuing supports from the HSE.</p><p>  The HSE report <i>New Directions: the report of the National Working Group for the Review of HSE-funded Adult Day Services</i> , which was published in 2012, is guiding the reconfiguration and modernization of day services and will underpin the flexible and innovative approach required when addressing the future requirements of school leavers with disabilities who require continuing support. The <i>New Directions</i> report recommends the development of alternative models of day service based on the provision of individualised supports, rather than centre-based set programmes. The new model will enable young people with disabilities to lead self-directed lives through a range of personal supports.</p><p>  A Working Group was established under the auspices of the National Consultative Forum to ensure the <i>New Directions</i> implementation plan is progressed through a collaborative approach. One of the work-packages currently being progressed by the Working Group is the development of draft standards for day services, in association with National Disability Authority. The draft standards will form part of a consultation process with service providers, service users and parents due to take place in September 2013. A revised Implementation Plan for <i>New Directions</i> will also form part of the consultation. Following the consultation process, the Interim Standards will be made available to service providers along with an audit tool. The Interim Standards are seen as essential in order to ensure a consistent and measurable approach to the reconfiguration and modernization of HSE-funded day services and supports.</p><p>  The demand for services for young people with disabilities completing their education or life-skills training continues to grow. The HSE are currently finalising their figures for 2013 but expects that over 700 new places will be required.  Service providers and the HSE are working closely together to identify how these needs can be met within available resources. This year, despite a 1.2% cut in the disability budget, an additional &euro;4m has been ring-fenced in the HSE's National Service Plan for new places. This funding is being allocated to each HSE Region based on its percentage of population. Both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of the available resources in a creative and flexible manner, so as to be as responsive as possible to the needs of this cohort.</p><p>  I have asked to be kept informed of progress in finding appropriate training places and day services for this year's school-leavers on an ongoing basis and I have recently met with the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies and the HSE on this issue. I have also asked the HSE to ensure that a plan is put in place immediately to communicate with families and give them some certainty as to the placements or supports which will be available to their children in September.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants. Donegal County Council has been allocated over &euro;22.4 million from my Department to supplement its own input for 2013.  My Department recently launched a pilot Community Involvement Scheme for works on regional and local roads.   This scheme is aimed at works on local roads which would only be considered for funding towards the end of a Council&rsquo;s road programme after more heavily trafficked routes had been dealt with.   This is a voluntary scheme and is available to give local communities the opportunity to have these works completed where they would not normally be considered for funding. Applications closed earlier this year and allocations have been made.  Its uptake will be examined later this year and assessed for its potential to continue beyond 2013.  With regard to private roads, the improvement and maintenance of these roads are in the first instance a matter for the landowner.   Local authorities may however provide assistance to the public for these private roads under the Local Improvements Schemes.   Local authorities may use up to 7% of their Discretionary Grant towards such schemes should they wish.  It is important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement Councils like Donegal County Council in their spending in this area.  I have regular discussions with my colleagues in Government in relation to the road network and road grants and this has included both the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as well as the Minister of State at that Department.</p></reply>

The NTA is also the lead agency with responsibility for implementation of the recommendations of the Taxi Regulation Review Report 2011.</p><p>  The NTA carried out a consultation on vehicle standards as part of the Taxi Regulation Review in 2011 which recommends strengthening vehicle standards.  Action 10 of the Review Report recommended that the 9 year vehicle age limit should apply at licence issue or renewal for all new taxi or hackney vehicles entering the fleet.   Vehicle licences issued since January 2009 have been on the basis of a 9-year age limit on the vehicle.  Existing vehicles in the fleet licensed prior to 1 January 2009 can operate up to 14 years of age subject to 6-monthly NCT testing and NTA licence renewal assessment.</p><p>  The aim of these measures is to promote vehicle standards so as to improve passenger and road safety.   It is envisaged that, over time, all vehicles older than nine years will be removed from the taxi and hackney fleet.  The NTA made revised vehicle standards regulations in this regard under Statutory Instrument No. 48 of 2013.</p></reply>

This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.</p><p>  To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA) with effect from 1st April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.  I am well aware of the very valuable work done by RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community.   However, given that resources are limited and the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.  Current structures are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved.  If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.  Work has been underway over the last six months to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective.  This has involved consultations with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the County and City Managers Association and the Rural Transport Network.</p><p>  The NTA have made recommendations to me for a new structure which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.  I will announce my decision in the next couple of weeks.  I am ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector.  Decisions surrounding matters such as door-to-door transport will continue to be made at local level and with the input of the voluntary and community sector.  Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.</p></reply>
