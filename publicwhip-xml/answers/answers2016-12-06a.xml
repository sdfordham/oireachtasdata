Of the 42,372 addresses in County Cavan, over 24,000  are  to be included in the State Intervention Area. In County Monaghan about 19,500 of the 33,465 addresses are earmarked for State Intervention.  </p>  <p>  The Department is now in a formal procurement process for the State Intervention.   </p>  <p>  Separately, my Department&rsquo;s Trading Online Voucher Scheme is specifically designed to support small and micro enterprises to trade online. As the digital economy grows, it is essential that the benefits are felt in every city, provincial town and rural area.  Through training, mentoring and networking, coupled with financial support, the scheme is helping small businesses to grow and diversify their markets.  </p>  <p>  Some 2,700 small businesses, including 31 businesses in County Cavan and 46 businesses in County Monaghan have, to date, successfully applied for a trading online voucher.  Furthermore, 6,000 or so businesses have benefitted from training and advice delivered by the Local Enterprise Offices under the scheme. </p>  <p>  According to surveys of the enterprise impacts of the scheme, businesses grow on average by 21%, employ 35% more people and 60% export for the first time.  Digital trade is contributing to sustainable regional economic development, with urban and rural based businesses benefitting equally from the online opportunity.</p>  <p>  In the recent Budget, I secured &euro;3m for the continuation of the scheme in 2017.  I am also looking at ways to build on the success of the scheme, putting Ireland further ahead of our European counterparts in realising the benefits of selling goods and services online.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-06a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120600058#WRC00300"><p>I welcome the interest reflected at the Sustainability Gathering 2016 and indeed note the participation of relevant officials from my own Department in the discussions that took place.  It will be important to continue this dialogue as I have responsibility for a number of key areas where policy is being progressed consistent with, and in support of, sustainable development.</p>  <p>  Sustainability is an important policy principle supporting on-going climate-action related work.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, 2015 provides statutory recognition of the 'national transition objective' &ndash; the goal of pursuing a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050.  In order to facilitate the achievement of this objective, the 2015 Act provides for the development and submission to Government of national mitigation plans and adaptation frameworks which must take account of, inter alia, the need to promote sustainable development in performing functions related to these measures.</p>  <p>  I intend shortly to initiate a public consultation on a new Clean Air Strategy for Ireland.  The initiatives on climate action and air quality are key steps in progressing national policy in support of transition to a low-carbon, competitive and environmentally sustainable future.</p>  <p>  The Energy White Paper, Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030, sets out a long-term vision to guide Irish energy policy and actions to be taken in the energy sector from now until 2030, in order to transform Ireland into a low carbon society and economy by 2050 and reduce our fossil fuel dependency.  The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes in place to accelerate the development and diversification of renewable energy in Ireland including the REFIT schemes which underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies.  Two new renewables support schemes are also under development including a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) aimed at increasing renewables in the heat sector and a Renewable Electricity Support Scheme aimed at providing support for renewable electricity.</p>  <p>  Concerning waste, my Department is actively engaged in the on-going discussions on the EU action plan on the circular economy.  The circular economy aims to replace the &lsquo;take-make-dispose&rsquo; model of production with a more sustainable one that champions recycling and renewables, the reduction of emissions and waste, minimum extraction of virgin raw materials and the reuse of valuable components and materials.</p>  <p>  Finally, Our Sustainable Future &ndash; the Framework for Sustainable Development in Ireland, which was launched in June 2012, identifies some 70 measures to be implemented across Government and tasks a high-level inter-departmental group with ensuring that the vision set out in the policy document is translated into clear and effective action.  The report on implementation of the framework published last year described how Ireland continues to move in the right direction generally across the spectrum of sustainable development goals.  As economic activity increases, maintaining the focus on sustainability in parallel with economic recovery and growth will be critical.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-06a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120600058#WRC00600"><p>In October, I signed Regulations which will allow ComReg to auction spectrum in the 3.6GHz band (Wireless telegraphy (3.6GHz Band Licences) Regulations, 2016 (S.I.  532 of 2016)).  The liberalisation of this band is an EU requirement and the release of spectrum in this band will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and/or fixed wireless services, leading to better quality voice and data services to customers across Ireland.</p>  <p>  ComReg is independent in its functions and I have no role in the process for allocating the spectrum which is now underway.  Having regard to the independence of ComReg in the matter and the fact that a process is underway, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time.  I would note however that the allocation process followed extensive public consultation by ComReg over almost a two year period.</p>  <p>  The National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to deliver high speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland.  The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p>  <p>  The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State Intervention Area comprising over 750,000 premises in Ireland, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland and is intended to offer wholesale services to retailers.</p>  <p>  In line with State Aid Guidelines for deployment of high speed broadband the procurement process is technology neutral.  All three bidders involved in the competitive dialogue process are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the&ndash;home network solution to connect rural Ireland.  This is their choice of technology.  It is however possible that wireless technology may be part of the solutions proposed and this is a matter for bidders.  Furthermore, as the network to be built will offer wholesale services, on an open-access basis, it will be open to existing wireless retailers to offer services on the new network.  Wireless operators can also connect their technologies to the network if they can meet the high speed broadband specifications set out in the Plan, which includes a minimum of 30 megabits per second download speed and 6 megabits per second upload speed.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-06a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120600058#WRC00900"><p>The licence fee is distributed in accordance with Section 123 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, to both RT&Eacute; and TG4 in order to facilitate the pursuit of their public service objectives.  In addition, 7% of the revenue goes towards the Broadcasting Fund, which is operated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  The schemes established under this Fund provide funding in support of high quality programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience, programmes to improve adult literacy, and archiving of programme material.  Revenue from this fund can be applied for by independent producers and broadcasters for specific projects of a public service nature.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious that while the TV licence fee model has provided a measure of stability to date, the rapid changes in technology altering the traditional way in which television is watched, together with economic pressures generally, means that a serious question mark exists over the ability of the current funding model to be able to provide continued stable funding for public service media in the longer term.  My Department is currently examining a number of actions to strengthen the current model.</p>  <p>  The issue of funding public service media in the longer term is one that requires extensive engagement with all stakeholders including the commercial and community sectors.  With that in mind, I recently asked the Joint Oireachtas Committee to consider the issue.  I am happy to say that the Committee has responded positively to my request and has launched a public consultation and initiated engagement with all stakeholders in early November 2016.</p>  <p>  I look forward to receiving the Committee's Report in due course which will help to inform my decisions on this important issue.</p></reply>

The provision of stable and adequate funding is essential to ensuring the continued delivery of their role in this regard.  I am very much aware, however, of the challenges that face the existing TV Licence system, including the current unacceptable levels of evasion.  While the rate has fallen from 15.3% at the end of 2013 to the current rate of 13.75% it is still very high.</p>  <p>  In that context, my Department has been working with An Post and RT&Eacute; on an on-going basis so that all steps are being taken to ensure the system is working as effectively as possible.  Measures such as marketing campaigns, more evening and weekend inspections and appointment of additional temporary Inspectors are just some of the initiatives that have been utilised to enhance sales and improve compliance rates.</p>  <p>  My Department is also currently examining a number of additional actions that might be taken with the aim of strengthening the system including legislative amendment to provide for the tendering of Licence fee collection.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-06a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120600058#WRC01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 59 together.</p>  <p>  For each year between 2013 and 2020, Ireland has a Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) emissions reduction target under the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) No. 406/2009/EC.  For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The 2013 target is based on the average of emissions for the years 2008-2010.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year.  The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005.</p>  <p>  In March 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions at that stage could be in the range of 6 - 11% below 2005 levels.  On a cumulative basis over the period 2013 - 2020, Ireland is projected to have a deficit of between 3 and 12 Megatonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO2e).</p>  <p>  According to the latest GHG inventory published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in November 2016, emissions for 2015 are estimated at 59.84 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq), which is 3.7% higher than emissions in 2014.</p>  <p>  The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, 2015, which was enacted in December 2015.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low carbon economy by 2050.  Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Act.</p>  <p>  I intend to launch an initial non-statutory public consultation process shortly to inform preparation of a draft National Mitigation Plan.  This draft Plan will then be subject to a further statutory consultation, followed by submission of a final plan to Government for approval by June 2017.  Work is well underway on the development of the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway, identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce GHG emissions, and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.  The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020, but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures can be put in place beyond this date and out to 2030.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the efforts outlined above to address the challenge to comply with the 2020 targets, in the likely event that a gap to target still exists in 2020, retirement of Annual Emissions Allocations and units from the Kyoto Protocol Flexibility Mechanisms carried forward from 2008-2012 can be offset against the deficit.  If this does not fully address any potential deficit, further carbon units could be purchased.  It is not possible to accurately quantify the cost to purchase  notional carbon units at this stage as the cost is dependent on both the quantum and price of carbon units to be purchased at the time.  Should the need to purchase carbon units arise, funding options will be considered in due course and will have regard to a number of matters, including the need to comply with the fiscal rules.</p></reply>

Ireland aims to meet this target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles (EVs) also making a small contribution.  In 2015, 5.7% of the energy in transport was from renewable sources.</p><p>Since 2011, the Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme has been supporting and incentivising, through grants of up to &euro;5,000, the deployment of EVs in Ireland.  These grants are in addition to tax incentives such as the Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) reliefs of up to &euro;5,000, which apply to EVs and Accelerated Capital Allowances (ACA), which allows companies to offset the cost of investment in qualifying technologies including EVs.  Budget 2017 extended the relief from VRT on EVs for a further 5 year period and on Hybrid vehicles for 2 years.<b></b>The purchase of 1,702 new EVs has been supported since the Grant Scheme commenced.  Of these, 615 have been grant aided to date this year which is an increase from 2015 when 555 were grant aided over the full year.</p><p>The ESB, through its ecars programme, has installed almost 900 publically accessible charge points for electric vehicles.  These include 79 DC fast chargers, most of which have been installed mainly on the inter-urban roads.  The location of these charge-points is available on the &lsquo;ecars&rsquo; section of the ESB&rsquo;s website at<i></i>.  In addition, ESB ecars has installed over 1,900 charge points in domestic and commercial premises.</p><p>In accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government, my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport are establishing and will co-Chair a Low Emissions Vehicles Task Force involving relevant Government Departments and agencies.  The first meeting is scheduled for later this month.  A key task will be to examine as a matter of priority what further actions are necessary to further stimulate EV sales and other low emission vehicles to 2020 and beyond.  In addition, the Task Force will look at actions to ensure sufficient and effective charging infrastructure exists as the EV fleet develops.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and through a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p>  <p>  The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll out a new high-speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area, comprising over 750,000 premises, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  Householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 megabits per second but potentially up to 1000 megabits per second with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids.  In addition, bidders need adequate time to get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one that will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century.</p>  <p>  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.

In July, I established the Taskforce, together with Minister Humphreys, which aims to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services.  The Terms of Reference of the Taskforce state that it will identify and recommend practical actions that can be taken to improve mobile reception and broadband access.

Recognising the roles of climate change plans, both mitigation and adaptation, and their interaction with the areas of energy, agriculture, transport and flood risk management, the Programme for Government identifies the key measures to be pursued on a cross-sectoral basis which also address key areas of environmental protection.</p>  <p>  Environmental sustainability is, of course, a core principle of this Government's work and is at the heart of the policies and schemes that are implemented by my Department, particularly given Ireland's objective of achieving a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050.  In this regard, the important role of the Environmental Protection Agency should also be highlighted in terms of its primary responsibilities covering licensing and enforcement, and monitoring and reporting on the environment.</p>  <p>  Within my own remit I am currently initiating a number of key priority actions which are relevant to climate action and environmental protection:</p>  <p>  -  Tomorrow I will present Ireland's first Annual Transition Statement as required under our Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, 2015.</p>  <p>  -  In the coming days, I intend to initiate a preliminary public consultation to inform the preparation of Ireland's first draft National Mitigation Plan so as to ensure our citizens can contribute to the process of its preparation.  Economic analysis to underpin the plan is on-going and will be finalised in the Spring.</p>  <p>  -  Both of these actions I see as being key components of Ireland's National Climate Dialogue which I intend to formally launch early in 2017.</p>  <p>  -  I am also prioritising a National Adaptation Framework to ensure we address climate resilience in terms of our long term planning out to 2050.  An economic framework for costing adaptation will be a key aspect of this work.</p>  <p>  -  I will shortly publish an initial consultation paper on a Clean Air Strategy for Ireland.  This strategy will seek to ensure on-going compliance with EU legislation, while bringing about improved health outcomes and wider environmental benefits.</p>  <p>  -  An increased budget in 2017 of over &euro;100m will help expand the Better Energy Scheme and introduce new measures such as the Renewable Heat Incentive.  A record &euro;25m in grants will be ring-fenced for projects that bring our communities together to engage in collective energy efficiency activity through the Better Energy Communities scheme.</p>  <p>  -  A new Public Sector Energy Efficiency Action Plan has been developed to draft stage with publication, subject to Government approval, due to take place before the end of this year.</p>  <p>  -  Significant work has taken place in the development of a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme, with a further consultation to take place in early 2017 followed by finalisation of the scheme subject to State aid approval from the European Commission.</p>  <p>  As Minister for the Environment, I also have responsibility for making allocations from the Environment Fund, which is ring-fenced for environmental purposes.  Allocations totalling &euro;40.5million were made from the Environment Fund in 2016 and targeted, inter alia, waste schemes, environmental research and development, the Local Agenda 21 Scheme, and support for Environmental Non-Governmental Organisations, all which have relevance for climate action and protecting our environment.</p>  <p>  The range of actions being pursued by my Department, and other key Departments and Agencies, is evidence of the cross-Government commitment to protect Ireland's environment and manage effectively the transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable future.</p></reply>

There is no retrospective element to this legislation.</p><p>While the report referenced in the question puts forward the view that a retrospective provision should be inserted in the 2014 Act, attempting to intervene in the operation of a media business when no merger is planned would be difficult and, given that the purpose of the legislation is to safeguard media pluralism, is also likely to be counter-productive.</p><p>Applying a retrospective element to the legislation could, effectively, mean empowering a Government Minister to determine the fate of any media organisation at any given time.  This would raise a number of difficult questions about preserving the freedom and independence of the press, even before one considers the legal and constitutional complexities associated with retrospective action of this kind.</p><p>An important part of the current regime is the requirement on the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) to prepare, every three years, a report on the ownership and control arrangements of media businesses in Ireland.  In June of this year, I published the first such report, the Report on Ownership and Control of Media Businesses in Ireland 2012-2014.  In this report, which is available on my Department's website, the BAI concludes that there has not been a material reduction in media plurality in the State due to the limited changes in ownership and control in the period 2012-2014.</p><p>Furthermore, the international expert group Sustainable Governance Indicators ranked Ireland 9.0/10 in <i>Media Freedom</i>and 8.0/10 in <i>Media Pluralism</i>, noting that Irish media <i>is independent, with a pluralist ownership structure</i>.</p><p>In my view, the reforms introduced in the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 have struck the correct balance in this area and are working well and, as a result, I am confident that we have a robust and effective set of measures in place to support and encourage a plural and diverse media.</p></reply>

The specific details of the contribution to this 40% to be made by each Member State, including Ireland and the UK, in respect of the non-ETS sector was the subject of a European Commission proposal published in July 2016.  The full implications of this proposal from a domestic perspective are currently being examined.</p>  <p>  In conjunction with the coordinated EU response to climate change, my Department also engages with the Northern Executive on a range of environmental areas, including air quality, cross-border waste management and environmental protection (including climate change).  On matters relating specifically to climate change, I am aware that officials from my Department are continuing to liaise with their counterparts in Northern Ireland on a range of areas of mutual interest covering both mitigation and adaptation.</p>  <p>  The North-South Ministerial Council, established under the Good Friday Agreement, facilitates good cooperation on environmental issues, and I look forward to continued cooperation with the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs on matters of mutual interest, as referenced in the Programme for Partnership Government.</p></reply>

This framework has, in my view served consumers well over several decades and ensured that householders can get an affordable fixed voice service, regardless of where they are located.</p>  <p>  Currently there are no universal service obligations (USO) for high speed broadband provision in Ireland and the European Telecommunications Framework does not facilitate the imposition of a high speed broadband USO.  The National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high speed broadband to every premises in the country, through a State intervention in areas where such networks are not available.  The winning bidder(s) in the procurement process will be required to build out a wholesale, open access, high speed broadband network.  Under a 25 year contract with the Department, they will be required to connect any premises within the Intervention area that requires a high speed connection.</p>  <p>  Thus National Broadband Plan will deliver the network which will be required, to connect all premises.  While USO alone could not be expected to deliver new high speed broadband networks of this scale, I am of the view that where high speed broadband networks are available, USO could provide a very useful tool to ensure that all premises within a network area can get a connection.  This is particularly relevant in cities and towns, where commercial operators have already deployed high speed networks, but for technical or other reasons, some premises still may not be able to obtain services.</p>  <p>  I am in discussion with ComReg as to whether a universal service obligation (USO) may be a viable instrument in such instances, i.e. in areas where a high speed network is available but individual premises cannot access such services at an affordable price.  This is similar to the arrangements which are already in place for fixed voice.</p>  <p>  I have also raised the issue of a USO for high speed broadband at EU level.  In September, the European Commission published an ambitious proposal for the regulation of the European telecoms sector, which aims to incentivise and encourage increased investment in high speed broadband networks.  I have asked the Commission to consider a specific provision in the new framework that will allow Member States to apply a USO for high speed broadband, where such networks are available.</p>  <p>  There are no provisions in European or national regulation for a USO in relation to mobile voice services.  Mobile operators are however rolling out 3G and 4G networks across Ireland following ComReg&rsquo;s 2012 Multiband Spectrum auction, with at least one operator now having over 90% population coverage of 4G services.  The Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce is considering issues which will facilitate better delivery of mobile voice and data services.  In October, I signed regulations which will allow ComReg to allocate spectrum in the 3.6GHz spectrum band.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.</p>  <p>  In my Department's estimates for 2017 I have secured an &euro;8m provision for RT&Eacute; to allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to auction this spectrum, to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.</p>  <p>  I intend to discuss with ComReg, how the allocation of spectrum in the 700MHz band could facilitate greater penetration of mobile voice and data services.</p></reply>

Teagasc has also produced a report setting out a number of conclusions on proposed pathways towards carbon neutrality in 2050 entitled Carbon Neutrality as a horizon point for Irish Agriculture: a qualitative appraisal of potential pathways to 2050.  Both these analyses will inform the definition process and ultimately feed into Ireland's mitigation planning in the future.</p>  <p>  Regarding the definition of sustainable food production, Ireland's Food Wise 2025 agri-food strategy sets out a vision for the sustainable growth of the food production sector, in line with the European Union Council Conclusions of July 2014 on the 2030 Climate and Energy Framework.  In an Irish context, environmental protection and economic competitiveness are considered as equal and complimentary.  One cannot be achieved at the expense of the other.  Improving productivity, while using natural resources in a manner which protects them into the future, requires on-going strong commitment from the sector to adapt through embracing and applying the latest innovations, new techniques and processes.</p>  <p>  The extent of Ireland's challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, 2015, which was enacted in December 2015.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low carbon economy by 2050.  Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Act.</p></reply>

This commitment builds on the 2015 Energy White Paper which recognised the long-term strategic importance of diversifying Ireland's energy generation portfolio. While Biomass will have a role to play in this regard, I am also aware that the use of biomass in the energy mix can lead to an increase in emissions particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).  Thus, measures will be needed to minimise the risk of exacerbating air quality issues through the use of appropriate technology standards and fuel quality.</p><p>The REFIT 3 (Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff) scheme, which closed at the end of 2015, was designed to incentivise the addition of 310 MW of renewable electricity from biomass technologies to the Irish electricity grid. Technologies included electricity from solid biomass and the co-firing of biomass in peat powered stations. A number of projects will receive support to 2030 under REFIT3 including some producing electricity from the combustion of biomass.</p><p>My Department is currently working on the development of a new renewable electricity support scheme (RESS). As part of this process, a range of renewable energy technologies are being assessed, including electricity from biomass. The first Technology Review public consultation on the new renewable support scheme was published in 2015 and following the completion of detailed economic analysis on the viability and cost effectiveness of supporting a range of renewable technologies a second public consultation will be published in early 2017. Details of the next public consultation will be advertised on the Department's website <i>.</i></p><p>While the future supports for biomass in the electricity sector will be decided in the context of the new support scheme, a 2015 Government-commissioned technical analysis considered biomass usage and concluded that Ireland&rsquo;s limited biomass resource would be more efficiently deployed in the heating sector. In this context, biomass is expected to be supported as part of the new Renewable Heat Incentive which will be introduced in the second half of 2017.</p></reply>

No. 524 of 2008) provide for the certification of historic unlicensed waste disposal sites, registration of these facilities, the conduct of a risk assessment by local authorities and the determination of necessary remedial measures.  Sites also require a certificate of authorisation from the EPA.  Such a certificate determines the adequacy of the risk assessment and specifies any further necessary measures to ensure the protection of the environment.</p>  <p>  To assist local authorities with risk assessment and to ensure a consistent approach, the EPA has developed a Code of Practice for Environmental Risk Assessment for Unregulated Waste Disposal Sites as well as an online tool for local authorities to record the detail of the risk assessments.</p>  <p>  The Waste Management Planning Regions are now developing a work plan for the investigation, assessment and remediation of the landfills with priority attaching to the sites of highest risk.  My Department is working with the Planning Regions to ensure that we maximise the number of high-risk historic landfills that can be progressed towards remediation in an appropriate timeframe.  These are complicated projects so we must also ensure the projects are well-planned and well-executed, mindful of the environment and adjacent communities.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>It is estimated that up to 70% of premises in Ireland will have access to  commercial high speed broadband services provided by telecommunications operators, while the  remaining 30% consisting of just over 750,00 premises will fall within the proposed State led intervention under the National Broadband Plan.  Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband from commercial service providers.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at shows the extent of the State Intervention area: </p><p>-  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services. </p><p>-  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p><p>There are 1.6 m premises in the BLUE area of which approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can now get high speed broadband.  My Department is actively monitoring the deployment in the BLUE areas to ensure that all premises can get access to services. In this regard, direct feedback from consumers is important and if customers cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at <i>,</i>quoting their address and Eircode and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services.</p><p>My Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area comprising over 750,000 premises, covering 100,000 km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. </p><p>Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  Householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 megabits per second but potentially up to 1000 megabits per second with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds.</p><p>Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP. The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process. The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids. In addition, bidders need adequate time to get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process. It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed. I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process. I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. </p><p>During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage. I expect to publish the report of the Taskforce  in the coming weeks.</p><p>I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed in early 2017 to allocate spectrum in the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band. This will provide an 86% increase in total  spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.  </p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the removal of barriers to assist in commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.</p><p>These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.</p><p>While the Government&rsquo;s Capital Investment Plan includes an initial provision of &euro;275m for the NBP up to 2021, the level of  exchequer funding required for the NBP will only be known after bidders provide their estimates of cost and subsidy requirements.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-06a.84.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120600059#WRD01400"><p>The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan (NBP), which was published in August 2012 by the then Minister, outlined Government&rsquo;s commitment to deliver high speed broadband availability across the country and reflects Government and European objectives to deliver high speed broadband services to all citizens. Specifically it committed to a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, there have been updates provided in respect of progress.  In April 2014, the Government decided that it needed to scale up the ambition of the plan. This was a consequence of the mapping process, which had been underway since 2013, and which demonstrated that there was a significant fibre-deficit across Ireland which would require a major network build to address. It also recognised new State Aid Guidelines published in 2013, a significant ramp-up in demand for data services nationally and internationally, and accelerated industry investment following regulatory and policy decisions, which included legislation to allow ESB to enter the telecoms market.  </p><p>Facilitating commercial investment continues to be a critical element of the Plan and industry is now delivering to approximately 1.4m premises across Ireland, which represents an increase of at least 400,000 more homes and businesses than had originally been anticipated. Telecoms operators are also rolling out fibre-to-the-home services in Ireland - a technology which was not envisaged on any scale in 2012. At least two operators have announced ambitious fibre-to-the-home roll-out plans, one of which involves the use of the ESB network, which was facilitated by legislation introduced by my Department as part of the broader NBP policy.</p><p>Following the Government's decision to scale up the ambition of the plan, significant additional resources were brought to bear on the project. Since then, my predecessor and I have held media briefings to flag key milestones in the development of the Plan. These include: </p><p>-  November 2014 - the publication of the High Speed Broadband Map and launch of a public consultation.</p><p><font color="#1F497D">  -  </font>June 2015 - the publication of the draft Intervention Strategy along with 7 expert reports which are supporting the delivery of the procurement.</p><p>-  December 2015 - the publication of the updated High Speed Broadband Map and formal launch of the procurement process, with the publication of a detailed Project Information Memorandum and Project Information Notice in the Official Journal of the EU. </p><p>-  July 2016 - the decision by Government in relation to the ownership model for the network to be built and the shortlisting of three companies to be brought forward as bidders in the procurement process. </p><p>-  July 2016- the establishment of a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to consider immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.  </p><p>I am sure that the Deputy will agree that regular progress reports on the development of the plan, at the key milestone stages outlined, is important in order to inform the public of progress.</p><p>The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll<font color="#1F497D">-</font>out a new high speed broadband network to over 750,000 premises in Ireland, covering 100,000 km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland.</p><p>Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP. The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process. The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process. Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process. It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed. I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given that discussions are ongoing in the procurement process. I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. </p><p>During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids. As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and / or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage. I expect to publish the report of the Taskforce in the coming weeks. </p><p>I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed in early 2017 to allocate spectrum in the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band. This will provide an 86% increase in total  spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.  </p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the removal of barriers to assist in commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.</p><p>These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5 bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>It is estimated that up to 70% of premises in Ireland will have access to  commercial high speed broadband services provided by telecommunications operators, while the  remaining 30% consisting of just over 750,00 premises will fall within the proposed State led intervention under the National Broadband Plan.  Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband from commercial service providers. </p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at<i></i><i></i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>-  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services. </p><p>-  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.</p><p>There are 1.6 m premises in the BLUE area of which approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can now get high speed broadband.  My Department is actively monitoring the deployment in the BLUE areas to ensure that all premises can get access to services. In this regard, direct feedback from consumers is important and if customers cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at , quoting their address and Eircode and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services. </p><p>My Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area comprising over 750,000 premises, covering 100,000 km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. </p><p>Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  Householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 megabits per second but potentially up to 1000 megabits per second with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds. </p><p>Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP. The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process. The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.

The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 commenced its second stage reading in the D&aacute;il on 5 October. When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights. Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.</p>  <p>  Work is under way on drawing up the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification. The Bill will address issues such as the Convention's requirements in relation to reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty. The General Scheme of the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is available on the Department of Justice and Equality website. The Bill is at the final stages of drafting and while I am not in a position to give an exact date, I expect the Bill to be published very shortly so as to facilitate early ratification of the Convention.</p></reply>

These are bodies established for the management of such areas, the membership of which comprise the owners of residential units within the development.</p>  <p>  As regards service charges, the position is that section 18 of the 2011 Act requires each OMC to establish and maintain a scheme of annual service charges to fund the costs of insurance, maintenance, cleaning, waste management and other common or shared services in respect of the development concerned. These service charges must be calculated on a transparent basis, be apportioned on an equitable basis between residential unit owners and be approved by the OMC members themselves at a general meeting of the OMC. In short, the Act gives residential unit owners themselves a role in determining the level of annual service charge, the level of services to be funded and the manner in which such services are to be provided.</p>  <p>  I should add that service charges in multi-unit developments form part of the contract the unit owner enters into when purchasing the property.  Consequently, there is no link between the service charge and the Local Property Tax which is charged on all residential properties in the State.  Policy responsibility for the Local Property Tax rests with the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.</p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 237 members assigned to the Garda Divisional Drugs Units, of whom 5 were assigned to the Waterford Divisional Drug Unit.</p><p>It is important to note that all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences or otherwise.  I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pro-actively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime in this jurisdiction. The Garda National Drugs Unit works closely with dedicated Divisional and District Drug Units and other national units, including the Organised Crime Unit, as well as the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates. I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response.</p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.

A company as a litigant possesses a legal personality in its own right and accordingly requires representation by a practising solicitor. Consequently no individual, whether director, shareholder or otherwise of a company, may represent that company. This principle equally extends to the examination of court records held on court files, access to which is restricted to solicitors representing a company in a case. In addition, those records are not subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. The Courts Service has informed me that it is not aware of having received an FOI request to access documents as mentioned. However, if additional details are supplied, the Courts Service will make further enquiries into the matter.</p>  <p>  The Deputy makes reference to the individual concerned not being allowed to attend a court case. The Constitution provides that justice shall be administered in public, save in such special and limited cases as may prescribed by law, and members of the public are therefore permitted access to court hearings dealt with in public.</p></reply>

Details of solicitors who hold a current practising certificate and professional indemnity insurance in Meath are available on the Society's website www.lawsociety.ie.</p>  <p>  I presume that when the Deputy refers to &ldquo;a voucher for a legal board office solicitor&rdquo; he is referring to a voucher for free legal advice issued under the Abhaile scheme.</p>  <p>  In this context, in October 2016, I launched Abhaile, the Government&rsquo;s Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service. An important component of this scheme is that free legal advice is available to insolvent borrowers who are in danger of losing their family home.  The free legal advice scheme operates on the basis that persons make applications to their local Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) office to avail of the Scheme. There are no means or merits criteria applicable although a person must meet three criteria for admission to the scheme:</p>  <p>  The person is insolvent (as defined under s. 2 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012: i.e. the borrower is &lsquo;unable to pay his or her debts in full as they fall due&rsquo;), and </p>  <p>  The person is in mortgage arrears on the home in which they ordinarily reside (their &lsquo;principal private residence&rsquo; (PPR)  as defined by s. 2 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012), and</p>  <p>  The person is at risk of losing that home (i.e. they have received from the mortgage lender repossession proceedings, a letter indicating that such proceedings will issue, a letter indicating that they are deemed non-cooperating, or an invitation to consider sale, surrender or other loss of all or part of the home).</p>  <p>  If a person is admitted to the scheme, they will be given free financial advice either from the MABS office, a MABS dedicated mortgage arrears advisor, a PIP, or an accountant. If the MABS office or their financial advisor identifies that they would also benefit from free legal advice, they are given a voucher and a list of solicitors who have agreed to provide free legal advice under the scheme. </p>  <p>  If a person who has been issued a legal advice voucher is having difficulty identifying a solicitor or redeeming a voucher they should contact the Legal Aid Board. It is important to note that while the Legal Aid Board administers this free legal advice service, the solicitors who provide services under this scheme are private practitioners and do not work in Legal Aid Board offices (law centres). </p>  <p>  The scheme covers legal advice but does not extend to legal aid in the sense of representation in court.  However, a duty solicitor service at county registrars&rsquo; courts is available as part of the Abhaile scheme.  The duty solicitor cannot come on record for the borrower nor may they draft the court documents needed to defend repossession proceedings. The duty solicitor may speak on behalf of the borrower but the applications they can make are limited to seeking an adjournment so that the borrower can either apply to a Legal Aid Board law centre for civil legal aid or obtain representation privately.  </p>  <p>  If such a person applies for services to a Legal Aid Board law centre in connection with the defence of repossession proceedings, the application will be considered under the normal criteria that apply under the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 to 2016.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p><p>The Commissioner has advised that it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises. In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural - has its own concerns and expectations. In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. </p><p>I am further informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. It is expected that Community Policing and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the tables below show the number of Community Garda&iacute; by rank assigned to Coolock, Swords and Malahide Garda Stations which form the Coolock Garda District, as of November 2013, November 2014, November 2015, and 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available.<div><table><tr><th colspan="5"><div>Coolock Garda District number of  Community  Garda&iacute; by rank as of 30 November, 2013</div></th></tr><tr><td>STATION</td><td><div>INSP</div></td><td><div>SERGEANT</div></td><td><div>GARDA</div></td><td><div>TOTAL</div></td></tr><tr><td>COOLOCK</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>13</div></td><td><div>15</div></td></tr><tr><td>SWORDS</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>13</div></td></tr><tr><td>MALAHIDE</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr></table></div><div><table><tr><th colspan="5"><div>Coolock Garda District number of  Community  Garda&iacute; by rank as of  30 November 2014</div></th></tr><tr><td>STATION</td><td><div>INSP</div></td><td><div>SERGEANT</div></td><td><div>GARDA</div></td><td><div>TOTAL</div></td></tr><tr><td>COOLOCK</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>14</div></td><td><div>16</div></td></tr><tr><td>SWORDS</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>10</div></td><td><div>11</div></td></tr><tr><td>MALAHIDE</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr></table></div><div><table><tr><th colspan="5"><div>Coolock Garda District number of  Community  Garda&iacute; by rank as of  30 November 2015</div></th></tr><tr><td>STATION</td><td><div>INSP</div></td><td><div>SERGEANT</div></td><td><div>GARDA</div></td><td><div>TOTAL</div></td></tr><tr><td>COOLOCK</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>14</div></td><td><div>16</div></td></tr><tr><td>SWORDS</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>9</div></td><td><div>9</div></td></tr><tr><td>MALAHIDE</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr></table></div><div><table><tr><th colspan="5"><div>Coolock Garda District number of  Community  Garda&iacute; by rank as of  31 October 2016</div></th></tr><tr><td>STATION</td><td><div>INSP</div></td><td><div>SERGEANT</div></td><td><div>GARDA</div></td><td><div>TOTAL</div></td></tr><tr><td>COOLOCK</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>12</div></td><td><div>14</div></td></tr><tr><td>SWORDS</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>9</div></td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td>MALAHIDE</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr></table></div></p></reply>

To build on this early success I was pleased to announce last week that I am sending our fourth mission to Lebanon to arrange for a further 260 refugees to come to Ireland. This is in addition to an earlier commitment of 260 refugees due to arrive in the first half of 2017. The total additional commitment of a further 520 refugees in 2017 in effect doubles our original commitment to resettle refugees under this two year programme. </p>  <p>  This latest decision reflects the Government's commitment to welcome vulnerable refugees fleeing war and conflict and is another positive step towards meeting our overall commitment to accept 4,000 persons.  It also takes account of the slower than anticipated arrival of asylum seekers from Greece and Italy as a result of operational difficulties experienced by all countries in the initial establishment of the Relocation strand of the IRPP in those countries. However, following a highly productive visit by Irish officials to Greece earlier this year the frequency and numbers of arrivals has increased and is continuing to improve. Ireland has provided the Greek authorities with a full timetable for the acceptance, by end September 2017, of the entire cohort of asylum seekers allocated to Ireland under the relevant Council Decisions. Ireland has to date accepted 131 persons under the relocation strand. A further 127 persons are scheduled to arrive later this month with regular substantial monthly arrivals from Greece thereafter. The Greek programme is now working very well and Ireland expects to meet its full obligations to Greece. </p>  <p>  The relocation of asylum seekers from Italy to Ireland has been hampered by technical issues which have been the subject of discussion up to ministerial level. It is hoped that the issues can be resolved in the near future which will allow the numbers being taken in under the IRPP to increase further.</p>  <p>  An All Party D&aacute;il motion approved by Government on 10 November last called on the Government to work with the French authorities to identify up to 200 unaccompanied minors previously living in the unofficial migrant camp in Calais and who have expressed a desire to relocate to Ireland.  My Department is working with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on all matters arising from the commitments agreed in the recent D&aacute;il motion. Both the French and British authorities and relevant NGOs have been contacted and information is awaited from NGOs in respect of children identified as wishing to relocate to Ireland. It is essential, if Ireland is identified as a location of choice for these young people, that services are in place and can cope with any such arrivals. We must ensure that we maintain the highest standards of international protection and care. The legal pathway for entry must also be robust to ensure that our actions fully comply with international best practice and protection law. </p></reply>

Following a Referendum of the Irish people, the 27th amendment to the Constitution changed the situation in relation to entitlement to Irish Citizenship.  As a result, Section 6 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 was amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004.  The changes came into effect on 1st January 2005.  As of that date a person born in the island of Ireland is not entitled to be an Irish citizen, unless that person's parents have been resident in the island of Ireland for a total of three years during the four years preceding that person's birth.  Periods of unlawful residence, periods of residence which were for the sole purpose of having an application for refugee status determined or periods of residence where permission was granted for the purposes of study are excluded from the determination of periods of reckonable residence.</p>  <p>  Where a child born in the State did not at birth have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, the parent or guardian or person who is in loco parentis to the child may lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of the child if and when the conditions for naturalisation are satisfied, including a requirement to have a total of 5 years residence in the State.  This ensures that, even where a child born in the State did not have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, there is a path to obtaining Irish citizenship through naturalisation.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to amend the legislation.</p></reply>

The recent alterations that have been announced to the macroprudential rules, including the changes to the minimum Loan-To-Value ratios for first-time buyers, do not materially alter the main policy aims of the Help to Buy incentive.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the changes proposed from 1 January next year, securing a deposit to qualify for a mortgage will remain a challenge for many first-time buyers.  This is particularly true for those with lower incomes or those paying high rents and as a result, struggling to save.  The other main aim of the incentive was to encourage the building of additional new homes.  By focusing the scheme solely on new builds and self builds, it is hoped that this will encourage the building of additional properties and thereby increase the overall housing stock.</p>  <p>  For these reasons I remain committed to the Help to Buy incentive.  However, the Deputy will be aware that I have agreed that an independent impact assessment of the scheme will be undertaken and completed by the end of September 2017.</p></reply>

The Central Bank sought to conduct a broad examination of tracker mortgage-related issues covering, among other things, transparency of communications with and contractual rights of tracker mortgage borrowers.</p><p>This review is currently underway, and the Central Bank is working with the banks to conduct a comprehensive examination of customer mortgage accounts with regard to tracker rates, including any instances where banks may have failed to deliver on their obligations to customers.  Such instances may include cases where the bank was not sufficiently clear with customers on their terms and conditions, or where they have failed to honour contractual commitments.</p><p>The Central Bank has laid out a detailed and rigorous process for each institution to follow.  The identification of affected customers, implementation of any appropriate rectification actions, as well as the calculation of any appropriate interest redress or compensation, are all processes currently being worked through by the banks.  The review also involves oversight of each bank's work by an independent third party, and the establishment of an independent appeals process.  Further, the Central Bank continues to review and monitor each institution's progress at every stage.  It is possible that different banks will progress through the review process at different speeds.</p><p>I expect that the Central Bank, and each of the institutions involved, will provide information periodically on steps taken and progress made.  The tracker mortgage review is an ongoing process involving the banks, their regulator and any affected customers; I have no direct role in its implementation.  It is therefore not possible, nor appropriate, for me to speculate at this time on the number of customers that may be affected and the deputy will appreciate that this information is not held in my Department. </p><p>The table is a brief update from each of the banks in which the State is a shareholder:</p><p><b>AIB</b></p><p>&quot;AIB is conducting a comprehensive review of customer mortgage accounts with regard to tracker rates.  This process is ongoing. AIB s review has found the bank fell short on its  obligations to some customers.  In order to prevent further detriment for the customers identified to date, AIB has in the first instance begun correcting interest rates on these accounts and writing to customers to outline their new interest rates and repayment amounts.  Approximately 50% of the impacted customers are EBS and the remainder AIB.  You will note that AIB s CEO Bernard Byrne recently told the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach that, based on an assessment of the work done to date, 14 customers may have lost their homes as a result of having the incorrect rate applied to their mortgage accounts.  AIB is contacting these customers to agree appropriate compensation measures.  The process involved an examination of tens of thousands of accounts and is being conducted in accordance with Central Bank of Ireland guidelines.  As the review progresses, AIB is commencing refunds to customers who overpaid interest and is paying compensation.  Details of a set payment towards the cost of independent professional advice will also be made available to customers and the bank will establish an independent appeals process.  An independent third party, KPMG, is reviewing key aspects of AIB s work.  The overall review will take some time to complete.  AIB has put in place a customer Freephone Helpline 1800 235 460 (Mon-Fri, 8:00am-7:00pm) to assist with any queries its customers may have.&quot;</p><p><b>PTSB</b></p><p>&quot;On 28 July 2015, Permanent TSB Group announced details of its Mortgage Redress Programme (MRP).  The MRP was established to address failures by Permanent TSB and Springboard Mortgages Limited (a Group subsidiary) in respect of 1,372 Tracker mortgage accounts.  The Group determined that of this population, had the Group s failure not occurred, 22 customers (all Permanent TSB accounts) may have avoided losing ownership of their property.  In making this determination, the Bank considered all relevant information available to it, including information relating to the customers affordability as set out by them in any completed Standard Financial Statements, the repayments that the customer was making to their mortgage at the time, the repayment amount which would have been due had the appropriate Tracker interest rate been applied to the mortgage account, the suitability of any alternative repayment arrangements and any other relevant information held by the Bank.  Of these 22 accounts, 10 were Home Loan accounts and 12 were Buy To Let accounts.  All of these cases (bar one where the property was repossessed having been abandoned) were customer led sales or voluntary surrenders.  Each loss of ownership customer was offered a comprehensive redress and compensation package, which included the redress of the mortgage account, a significant minimum compensation amount (&euro;25K for BTLs and &euro;50K for Home Loans) and the compensation may also have included a write-off of any outstanding shortfall balance on the account, a refund of any repayments made to the account since the loss of ownership, a payment in respect of any increase in the property value from the date of sale and in the case of certain Home Loan customers additional supports where the customer is approved for a new mortgage which would be on the appropriate Tracker interest rate.  Each Loss of ownership Customer also has the right of appeal to an Independent Review Panel.PTSB is also participating in the industry wide Tracker Review as detailed by the CBI earlier this year. PTSB is fully co-operating with the review which is currently underway.&quot;</p><p><b>BOI</b></p><p>&quot;In 2015 the Central Bank of Ireland announced that it would conduct a Tracker Mortgage Examination with all lenders in Ireland.  This examination is underway, and Bank of Ireland is co-operating fully with it.&quot;</p></reply>

Lenders have referenced publically restoring approx. 3,500 customers to tracker rates.  Notwithstanding the work previously undertaken to restore customers to tracker mortgage rates, the Central Bank remained concerned that there may be other tracker-related issues which could be impacting on consumers across the system and as such it decided that a system wide review was necessary.  This Central Bank examination is covering among other things transparency of communications with and contractual rights of tracker mortgage customers. </p>  <p>  All lenders are currently carrying out internal reviews of their mortgage books, to identify any customers who may have been impacted by a failure to honour a customer's contractual entitlements, or comply with the regulatory requirements regarding disclosure and transparency of information. </p>  <p>  While all lenders are currently in the process of carrying out their internal reviews it is important to note that some lenders may have their internal reviews completed sooner than others depending on the size of their mortgage books and the complexities associated with them completing the examination.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that it will provide an update on progress on the examination before the year end and as part of this update it will be publishing figures on impacted customers identified to date.  The Central Bank has also indicated that it can provide a copy of this update to the Deputy.</p></reply>

These activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection. There are over 860 Revenue staff currently serving in the Border, Midlands, West Region.  </p>  <p>  Revenue has an appropriate enforcement presence at all key airports and ports and at other strategic locations throughout the country and places particular emphasis on developing an intelligence-based focus at both national and regional level, deploying resources to areas of highest risk.  Enforcement strength at particular locations is regularly augmented with additional personnel on a risk assessment basis or when particular operations are taking place against illegal activity.  I am assured by Revenue that they attach a high priority to combatting the smuggling of controlled drugs and are very active, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, in targeting this criminal activity and those responsible for it. </p>  <p>  Revenue deploys two Customs Cutters, two large-scale X-Ray scanners and several mobile scanners.  Revenue currently deploys seventeen detector dog teams, nine of which have drug detection capabilities.  I am advised by Revenue that the cost of training a dog is estimated at &euro;25,000 and the time to train a team is 8 weeks.  The number of dog units is a matter that is kept under ongoing review by Revenue in light of intelligence and overall assumption of risk by them.</p>  <p>  As part of the risk focused approach to the discharge of its role in relation to illegal drugs importations, harbours and inlets along the coastline are monitored and evaluated on an ongoing basis from the point of view of the potential for smuggling.  This work is supplemented by Revenue's Customs Drug Watch Programme, aimed at encouraging members of the public, coastal and local maritime communities etc. to notify Revenue in confidence of suspect or unusual movements at sea or around the coast through a confidential 24/7 Drugs Watch free phone facility.  This is a highly valued and successful programme, as evidenced in October 2016 by the seizure of a large quantity of drugs near Liscannor, Co. Clare following a report through the Drugs Watch Programme.</p>  <p>  As regards Killybegs Port, I am advised by Revenue that for operational reasons they are not in a position to comment in detail on the matters referred to by the Deputy as regards this location.  However, I am assured by Revenue that the post is fully encompassed by their risk and intelligence focused assessment and intervention programmes.  Where necessary, an officer from Donegal Town attends at Killybegs by appointment if physical presence is needed for any particular transaction.  Patrols of the port and of the related coastline have appropriate regard for available intelligence and emerging smuggling trends.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue are allocating their resources to areas of greatest risk, including the detection of drugs.  I would urge the Deputy to provide to Revenue any specific information or intelligence he has which would assist in combatting the threat posed by drugs smugglers.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-06a.209.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120600061#WRF02700"><p>Revenue has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs intended to be smuggled or illegally imported into the State but there is a high degree of cooperation between all of the enforcement agencies of the State in the fight against the importation of illicit drugs.  In particular, Revenue attaches importance at national level to having good working relationships with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Naval Service.  A Joint Task Force arrangement is in place to enhance and support these relationships and there is regular contact and cooperation between these agencies.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the number of their officers assigned permanently to airports represents only a small part of the overall effort made by them in conjunction with the other State agencies.  Revenue places a strong emphasis on a strong intelligence-led risk analysis focus at regional, national and international level and it deploys whatever resources are required to the areas of highest risk.  The Joint Task Force fully supports this flexible approach.</p>  <p>  In line with best practice in customs administration worldwide, Revenue regards the development of information and intelligence as critical to the detection of evasion and smuggling, including drug smuggling.  This is very important in the case of Ireland and other EU Member States where the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to a significant degree by the introduction of the Internal Market and the related principles of freedom of movement within the EU.  Of specific relevance are the abolition of routine and systematic Customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the EU.  The approach has of necessity been to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling.</p>  <p>  Revenue has assigned a Europol Liaison Officer to Europol Headquarters, a Revenue attach&eacute; in London and a Country Liaison Officer to the Maritime Operations and Analysis Centre Narcotics in Lisbon.  At national level Revenue has signed over forty-three Memoranda of Understanding with various organisations and with international travel and trade service providers. </p>  <p>  This pooling of intelligence between the agencies at national and international level accords with best worldwide practice and enhances the focus on counteracting drug trafficking and the dismantling of drug organisations. Revenue has a permanent resource at the main airports comprising officers, trained sniffer dogs and technological supports such as scanners.  These are supplemented by specialist staff and supported by Gardai as required.  At regional airports and smaller airfields, there are regular, random and targeted interventions, based on information from the intelligence network described above.  Overall, Revenue staff are flexibly deployed to airports and other demands as needed, so that the effective resource is much larger than the 214 staff who are permanently assigned to the main airports.  Revenue is satisfied that their staffing and organisation are satisfactory and are effective to the highest international standards.</p></reply>

In order to ensure that all corporate entities are in a position to comply with this statutory instrument, the Companies Registration Office has circulated relevant information in an electronic communication to all registered companies.  The circular informed companies of the new requirement to obtain and hold information on their beneficial ownership. </p><p>As mentioned above, the completion of the transposition of Article 30 is a two step process and a further statutory instrument to establish a central beneficial ownership register will need to be completed by the end of June 2017.  My officials are responding to queries on a case by case basis and are actively planning to work with key stakeholders in advance of the establishment of the central register for beneficial ownership information.  My Department cannot provide legal advice on specific cases as the onus ultimately rests on companies and other relevant legal entities to comply appropriately with these new EU transparency measures.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that tax reliefs and exemptions have costs which have to be paid for and their introduction must be considered only where there is a clear economic and social policy need to be addressed.</p>  <p>  The report of the 2012 Thornhill group, on which the design of the local property tax (LPT) was based, proposed a tax system that would contain limited exemptions and reliefs.  The report cautioned that reliefs create costs which have to be paid for, either by taxpayers who do not benefit from the relief or by reductions in public expenditure.  The report specifically recommended against providing reliefs for those who had paid stamp duty.  The reasons given were that such relief would not be targeted on need; that the tax structure was known to house purchasers at the time of purchase; that the selling price of the property may have been affected by the stamp duty paid and that the stamp duty revenues would have been spent on the provision of public services.</p>  <p>  While some taxpayers had a significant Stamp Duty liability, they may have been able to claim mortgage interest relief on interest of up to &euro;20,000 per annum.  Individuals who took out qualifying mortgages from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2012 can continue to claim mortgage interest relief until end 2017.  This relief ceased at end 2012, and no new mortgages taken out from 1 January 2013 have qualified for the relief.  The Deputy will also be aware that there is a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government, which I confirmed in my Budget 2017 speech, to retain mortgage interest relief beyond the current end date on a tapered basis.  As legislation currently provides for the relief to continue to end-December 2017, the details of the extension will be set out in Budget 2018. </p>  <p>  A system of deferral arrangements is available where there is an inability to pay LPT and certain specified conditions are met, whereby a person may opt to defer, or partially defer, payment of the tax.  Where a person qualifies for a full deferral then 100% of the liability can be deferred.  Where a person qualifies for partial deferral then 50% of the liability can be deferred and the balance of 50% of the tax must be paid.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  I have made enquiries into the matter and have been advised that the child in question has not previously been brought to the attention of NEPS.  I would advise therefore that her parents should raise their concerns, in the first instance, with the Principal of her school with a view to raising them with the assigned NEPS psychologist and discuss the appropriate intervention in this situation.</p></reply>

This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.

The HEA allocates this funding to the institutions and the internal disbursement of funding is then a matter for the individual institution. </p>  <p>  The HEA has been closely monitoring the financial position of all of the IoTs and in particular are working closely with those Institutes, such as GMIT, that are experiencing financial difficulties in order to ensure appropriate mechanisms are put in place to eliminate any deficit as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  The HEA has a policy framework in place for engaging with vulnerable IoTs which requires Institutes to submit a three year plan to return them to a balanced budget situation.  If the Institute is unable to demonstrate how a return to a balanced budget can be achieved within this timeframe, or if actual performance deviates significantly from the plan, then the HEA will seek the appointment of an independent financial expert to work with the Governing Body and Executive Management Team to agree a revised plan and programme of remedial action.  The first of what is expected to be a series of meetings is scheduled for this week  between the GMIT executive and the HEA to discuss a number of issues relating to the financial position of the Institute including those which are specific to the Castlebar campus.</p>  <p>  My Department and the HEA are aware of the financial difficulties being experienced by a number of the IoTs.  The Financial Review of the Institutes, recently undertaken by the HEA in order to provide an overview of the financial health of the IoT sector, to consider capacity issues and to examine the challenges for the institutions given their respective plans for the future, makes a number of recommendations on how some of the issues which contribute to funding problems in the IoT sector can be addressed.  These policy recommendations will feed into the work being undertaken on developing a sustainable funding model for the sector. </p>  <p>  Funding overall for the higher education sector is a key concern for me particularly in light of the additional pressure that will fall on the system over the next decade or so.  In seeking to address the issue in the short term, I have for the first time in nine years secured as part of Budget 2017, additional funding for the sector.  In 2017 additional funding of &euro;36.5m will be made available with &euro;160m additional over the next three years. </p>  <p>  The Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education, published in July, clearly outlines the funding challenges and offers a number of approaches and recommendations for consideration for the medium term.  As committed to in the Programme for Government, the report has been referred to the Oireachtas Education Committee and this consultation will form part of the process of formulating a plan for the future of the sector. </p>  <p>  In addition, in Budget 2017 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I, announced a policy review with the aim of designing and implementing a sustainable and predictable multi-annual funding model for higher and further education and training involving increased Employer and Exchequer contributions from 2018.  The review will be undertaken as part of the overall response to meeting the anticipated skills needs in the economy over the coming years, in line with the policy framework set out in the National Skills Strategy.</p>  <p>  It will include an analysis of the business case for enhanced investment in the higher and further education and training sectors.  In this context it will identify key elements of the new funding model and of the expected impacts including those on employers.  The review will include consultation with stakeholders.  The policy review will be published by the end of April 2017, and will complement the ongoing work by the Oireachtas Committee in relation to the Cassells report.</p></reply>

In that regard, it is intended that the property in question will be the permanent location for the second school, referred to by the Deputy.  In the interim, it is expected that the first school, referred to by the Deputy, will be located on the property concerned on a temporary basis pending the delivery of its permanent accommodation. </p>  <p>  To assist parents and in the interests of minimising disruption to pupils, my Department has written to the various school Patrons in the school area concerned advising of the possible enrolment requests that they may receive and the circumstances associated with such requests and requesting that any pupils who apply to their schools be accommodated where this is feasible.  As my Department does not operate a centralised application system for schools, the standard school application procedure applies.  Data held by my Department indicates that there are sufficient places within the school planning area and locality to accommodate the current cohort of children in the school that is closing.

The brief was to provide an extension and refurbishment work on a phased basis with a partial decant of classrooms on the existing site.  The project was included in the five year construction programme 2012-16 and was scheduled therein to commence construction in 2014. </p>  <p>  Planning permission was granted in January 2014.  Since then the Board of Management and its design team have presented a number of proposals to the Department to change the brief to one which involves a single decant and a single phased delivery during construction.  This has led to significant delays in the progression of the project.  The most recent decant option, which included the provision of significant levels of new temporary accommodation on site involved an additional cost for the project in the region of &euro;2 million &ndash; an increase in the overall cost of the project of around 40%.</p>  <p>  The additional &euro;2 million cost for the project arising from the Board of Management's single phase decant and construction proposal raised serious questions as to the viability of the project.</p>  <p>  A meeting was convened by my Department recently, to which the Board of Management and their Design Team were invited in order to resolve any outstanding issues in this regard to enable Stage 2b to be finalised.  </p>  <p>  That meeting was held on the 11th November and agreement was reached in relation to a scaling back of the temporary accommodation costs which should now allow the project to progress to the completion of the design stages. </p>  <p>  When the revised Stage 2(b) submission has been submitted and approved, my Department will revert to the Board of Management with regard to the further progression of the project to tender and construction stage.

Institute of Technology Carlow (ITC) and Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT).  The TUSE consortium made good progress initially and submitted a Stage 1 expression of interest in 2012.  However, following this initial promising start, the consortium encountered a series of challenges and difficulties and did not succeed in finalising a Stage 2 Plan prior to the decision by WIT to suspend merger activities in October 2014.</p>  <p>  Following meetings with both Institutes, in early November 2014, the then Minister for Education and Skills announced the establishment of a new process of engagement and consultation, with the governing bodies, staff and students of both Institutes, together with the wider community in the South-East.  This process was conducted by Mr. Michael Kelly who met with stakeholders in all of the counties of the region including Local Authorities, Chambers of Commerce, Employers, the Enterprise Development Agencies, Social and Community Groups as well as public representatives.  In all some forty meetings took place.  The then Minister met with Mr. Kelly on 2 July 2015 and received his report on the outcome of the engagement and consultation process.  The total cost incurred in the preparation of this report was &euro;32,782.65 including VAT.  The cost of this Report was met by the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  The Minister met with the Chairs and Presidents of the two institutions on 21 July 2015 to discuss the findings and recommendations in the report.  The report was then published on 27 July 2015.   </p>  <p>  As outlined at the time of publication, it was agreed that a project plan for a process of facilitation would be developed by mid-August 2015 for consideration at ITC and WIT Governing Body meetings planned for end-August 2015.  The facilitation process was recommended by Mr. Kelly.  The Governing Bodies of both institutions held meetings at the end of August and agreed to engage in the proposed facilitation process.  The facilitator (Ms. Jane Williams of SIA Partners) was proposed by the Department of Education and Skills and agreed to by the Chairs and Presidents of both institutions.</p>  <p>  This facilitation process commenced in September 2015 and was finalised in May 2016.  I attach a copy of the final report of this facilitation process for your information.  As outlined SIA Partners conducted the facilitation process and have been paid for their work by the Department of Education and Skills.  The total amount paid to SIA Partners was &euro;12,779 including VAT.  There were no other costs incurred in respect of this facilitation process.</p>  <p>  Facilitation Process:</p>  <p>  There was strong engagement in the process by both parties and this facilitation process has been an important building block in terms of building trust between the parties and in developing a strong working relationship between the Presidents and Chairs of both institutions.  As part of this process, the Presidents of the two institutions, have jointly developed an initial work-plan to support the development of a joint TU proposal. </p>  <p>Actual costs incurred to date in respect of TUSE:   </p>  <p>  Actual costs to end 2015 by the South East TU consortium amounts to &euro;495,655 which includes funding of &euro;170,000 provided by the HEA thus far to offset costs from the HEIs own resources.  The costs incurred during 2016 are being tabulated and will be finalised in early 2017.</p></reply>

As part of the S&amp;S scheme finalised at this time a limited group of teachers were allowed to opt-out of the duties in return for a pay reduction. Department Circular 0006/2014 states that with effect from the beginning of the 2013/14 school year, participation in the Supervision and Substitution scheme will be compulsory for all teachers, save for those who avail of the opt-out arrangement.</p>  <p>  The ASTI directive instructed its members to withdraw from the Supervision and Substitution Scheme. The opt-out is an element of the S&amp;S scheme and ASTI directed all members to withdraw from that scheme in its entirety. Therefore, the &lsquo;opt-out&rsquo; provided for under the scheme did not apply to ASTI members who were subject to the directive while that directive was in force. ASTI suspended its directive following one day of withdrawal from the S&amp;S scheme (on 7 November 2016). The S&amp;S scheme is being operated by ASTI members since the date of suspension and accordingly, the opt-out is again being applied to ASTI members since that date.</p>  <p>  Where schools were forced to close to students as a result of ASTI member teachers&rsquo; withdrawal from the S&amp;S scheme, ASTI members who did not make themselves available for S&amp;S will not be paid for those days.</p>  <p>  It is normal industrial relations practice that, where workers in industrial action withdraw from core elements of their work, resulting in the closure of the workplace, those workers would not be paid for those days.</p></reply>

It included an examination of the impact of decline in the State grant in the years since 2008 and looked at projections assuming a static State funding environment. It has made a number of policy recommendations which will feed into the work on developing a sustainable funding model for the sector.</p>  <p>  The HEA has a policy framework in place for engaging with vulnerable IoTs which requires Institutes to submit a three year plan to return them to a balanced budget situation. If the Institute is unable to demonstrate how a return to a balanced budget can be achieved within this timeframe, or if actual performance deviates significantly from the plan, then the HEA will seek the appointment of an independent financial expert to work with the Governing Body and Executive Management Team to agree a revised plan and programme of remedial action.</p>  <p>  My Department and the HEA are aware of the financial difficulties being experienced by a number of the IoTs. The Financial Review by the HEA was based on the assumption that static Exchequer funding coupled with continuing growth in student numbers could make a number of Institutes unsustainable. The Report recognised the need to examine the underlying sustainability issues that existed across the sector and highlighted the need for a review of how funding is being allocated given the significant changes that are occurring in the higher education sector. It makes a number of recommendations on how some of the issues which contribute to funding problems in the IOT sector can be addressed. The Report clearly identified the need for a review of the present funding model and I have asked that this be completed as a matter of urgency. </p>  <p>  Funding overall for the higher education sector is a key concern for me particularly in light of the additional pressure that will fall on the system over the next decade or so. In seeking to address the issue in the short term, I have for the first time in nine years secured as part of Budget 2017, additional funding for the sector. In 2017 additional funding of &euro;36.5m will be made available with &euro;160m additional over the next three years. </p>  <p>  The Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education, published in July, outlines the funding challenges and offers a number of approaches and recommendations for consideration for the medium term. As committed to in the Programme for Government, the report has been referred to the Oireachtas Education Committee and this consultation will form part of the process of formulating a plan for the future of the sector. </p>  <p>  In addition, in Budget 2017 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I, announced a policy review with the aim of designing and implementing a sustainable and predictable multi-annual funding model for higher and further education and training involving increased Employer and Exchequer contributions from 2018. The review will be undertaken as part of the overall response to meeting the anticipated skills needs in the economy over the coming years, in line with the policy framework set out in the National Skills Strategy.</p>  <p>  It will include an analysis of the business case for enhanced investment in the higher and further education and training sectors. In this context it will identify key elements of the new funding model and of the expected impacts including those on employers. The review will include consultation with stakeholders. The policy review will be published by the end of April 2017, and will complement the ongoing work by the Oireachtas Committee in relation to the Cassells report.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the 30 September 2015.  The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. </p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy submitted an application for consideration by the Appeals Board at its October meeting under the Small Schools criteria.  The requirements set out in the staffing circular under this criteria state that the school must have the required enrolment on 30th September 2016 for the appointment of an additional teacher for September 2017 in order to be granted an appeal post for this school year.  In the case of this school, an enrolment of 19 was required on 30th September 2016 to meet this criteria.  As the school had an enrolment of 17 on that date, the Appeals Board determined that the appeal did not satisfy all of the published criteria as set out in Circular 0007/2016.  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>  <p>  The measure announced in Budget 2017 provides a capacity for one teacher mainland schools to make an appeal to the Staffing Appeals Board for an extra teacher, where the single teacher has children across 6 or more class groups.  Before a school can make an appeal to the Staffing Appeals Board it must have a minimum enrolment of 15 pupils.  The detailed arrangements for this measure will be set out in the staffing schedule Circular for the 2017/18 school year i.e. the date this measure is effective from.  The circular will be published early in 2017.</p></reply>

Consequently, since 1 April 2011, RAS tenants are now considered to be in receipt of social housing support and should not generally remain on housing waiting lists for new applicants for social housing.  In recognition that RAS tenants may have had reasonable expectations in regard to retaining access to traditional local authority rented accommodation, guidance issued by the Housing Agency in 2011 recommended that there should be a special transfer pathway for pre- 2011 RAS tenants to other forms of social housing support.  The arrangement effectively allows these households to be designated as a &lsquo;transfer&rsquo; applicant and to maintain their position for allocation as they had on the main waiting list.</p>  <p>  Where a vacant property arises, it is a matter for individual housing authorities, in accordance with their allocation schemes, to determine whether the allocation is made to a household on the main waiting list, or to a transfer applicant, such as a household from RAS, and the method of such allocation.  It is open to housing authorities to specify in their allocation schemes the proportion of allocations which will be reserved for transfers, and within this, how many may be reserved for households seeking transfers to other forms of social housing support.</p></reply>

In response to this particular recommendation, I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and Categorisation was published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland in January 2013. I.S. 398-1:2013 is a national standard which provides the means by which dwellings, which may be affected by pyritic heave, can be tested and categorised; it is this standard, not the Report of the Pyrite Panel, which introduced the concept of Building Condition Assessments and the means by which Damage Condition Ratings could be assigned.</p><p>In this regard, the definition of significant pyritic damage as set out in section 4 of the is also consistent with the meaning provided in I.S. 398-1:2013 and with the traffic light system used by the Pyrite Panel as a means of prioritising pyrite remediation works in recognition of the expensive and intrusive nature of pyrite remediation and the unpredictability of pyritic heave.  Dwellings with a Damage Condition Rating of 1 (with progression), which is consistent with pyritic heave and where the hardcore is susceptible to significant or limited expansion, fall within the meaning of significant pyritic damage as do those with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  This is equivalent to the &ldquo;red category&rdquo; used by the Pyrite Panel to signal that remediation works should be carried out. </p><p>The Act provides the statutory framework for the establishment of the Pyrite Resolution Board and for the making of a to be implemented by the Board with support from the Housing Agency.  The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  In this context, section 14(4) of the Act explicitly provides that the Board may exclude dwellings with a damage condition rating of 1 (with progression).  This ensures that, having regard to available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave.</p></reply>

Local authorities deduct PRD from the salaries of their employees and to date have retained the amounts collected as part of their income, using this income to help fund the services they provide.   This approach was adopted by agreement in the interests of administrative efficiency and to avoid creating a circular flow of funds to and from the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  The Lansdowne Road Agreement introduced changes to the PRD exemption thresholds, resulting in a reduction in PRD income being retained by local authorities and, therefore, impacting the overall level of funding available to the local government sector.  It is expected that &euro;18.6m in dedicated funding will be paid to the local government sector in 2016 as a once-off measure to mitigate the impact of reduced PRD income. </p>  <p>  For 2017 onwards, an adjustment is being made to the Local Property Tax (LPT) baseline of each local authority, which will now include an additional amount equivalent to the PRD income retained by local authorities in 2014.  The inclusion of PRD in increased LPT funding baselines helps protects local authority income in the future.  It means that, from 2017 onwards, local authorities will no longer retain PRD locally, thus reversing the previous approach.  I am satisfied that this decision reduces the risk to local government funding that would otherwise arise from declining PRD income.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.  I have no function in relation to the operational matters of the Board.</p><p>The Act provides that landlords in the sector must apply to register the tenancy of a dwelling with the RTB within one month of the commencement of the tenancy.  There are currently over 325,500 tenancies registered with the RTB, comprising over 174,500 landlords and over 516,500 tenants.  Details of the numbers of tenancies registered each year are provided in the RTB Annual Reports available at</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>A study by DKM economic consultants commissioned by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) and published in 2014, reported that the majority (65%) of landlords own just one property, a further 17% have two properties, 9% own three properties and 10% own more than three properties.  The results of Census 2016, when available, will assist in providing an updated overview of housing tenure in Ireland, including the rented sector.</p><p>In relation to the numbers of properties owned by individual landlords registered with the RTB, my Department does not hold or collate the information requested.  The Clerk of the D&aacute;il has requested that arrangements be put in place to facilitate the provision of information by State Bodies to members of the Oireachtas.  Following the issue of Circular LG (P) 05/16 on 20 September from my Department, the RTB have set up a dedicated email address for this purpose at .</p><p>In 2015, the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) received 4,023 applications for dispute resolution and a total of 1,260 (32%) of these related to rent arrears or rent arrears and over-holding.  This was the most common issue in dispute in 2015, followed by Invalid Notice of Termination at 23% and Deposit Retention at 22%.</p></reply>

Following the necessary preparatory work the new Scheme came into operation on 1 January 2016.  The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having been in receipt of social housing support for a minimum period of one year and having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum.  The minimum reckonable income is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act.  In its determination of the minimum reckonable income housing authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, additional to employment income.</p><p>It is essential that the income of an applicant under the scheme is of a long-term and sustainable nature, to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring ownership of and responsibility for the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p><p>Consequently, a number of social welfare payments, including Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, are disregarded for the purposes of determining the reckonable income. A list of these payments can be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>In line with the commitment given in the Programme for a Partnership Government, and reaffirmed in Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, I intend to undertake a review of the scheme following the first 12 months of operation and to bring forward any changes to the terms and conditions of the scheme which are considered necessary based on the evidence gathered at that stage.  I expect this review to be completed during the first quarter of 2017.</p></reply>

The Strategy remains in force and as a result of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010, its statutory role and influence has been strengthened by new requirements for local authority and regional plans to align with the NSS and any successor.  Bearing in mind the elapse of time as well as the changed circumstances and new challenges that have emerged in the planning arena since the NSS was adopted, work is underway on the preparation of a successor to the NSS, the National Planning Framework, for which a roadmap on its preparation is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:</p><p>.</p><p>Consultation is a critical element in the transparent design and delivery of the National Planning Framework.  Successful preliminary consultation with key stakeholders was undertaken in June 2016.  A national public consultation strategy is currently being devised to run in early 2017.</p><p>The National Planning Framework will act as the strategic planning context for relevant Government policies and investment in housing, water services, transport, communications, energy, health and education infrastructure, as well as the preparation by the three new Regional Assemblies of their new regional spatial and economic strategies, and for planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In this context, I am consulting with colleagues in other Departments and agencies in order to inform the National Planning Framework, in recognition of the whole-of-Government approach and the challenges and opportunities that exist to better align place making, investment priorities, employment and environmental strategies.</p><p>It is intended that an emerging draft National Planning Framework will be prepared by the first half of 2017 for submission to the Oireachtas for approval.  It would be inappropriate at this early stage to comment on the likely content of the Framework, until sufficient preparatory and consultative work has been undertaken.</p></reply>

My Department does not fund any service directly but provides funding to lead housing authorities on a regional basis.  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.  The purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.  Under Section 10 funding arrangements, housing authorities must provide at least 10% of the cost of services from their own resources.  Housing authorities may also incur additional expenditure on homeless related services outside of the Section 10 funding arrangements.  Accordingly, the specific amounts incurred by individual housing authorities in relation to B&amp;B type accommodation are a matter for the housing authorities concerned.</p></reply>

I understand that the European Court of Justice very recently ruled that there was no discrimination involved in the case.</p>  <p>  Entering into a marriage or civil partnership is a legal act, which confers both rights and obligations on both parties.  Widows, widowers and surviving civil partners who become bereaved, therefore, in addition to the personal loss of their life partner, also lose someone who had legal duties towards them, and depending on the circumstances, may suffer financial loss as a result of that bereavement.  It is on this basis that the social welfare code provides a pension to them, subject to certain conditions. </p>  <p>  This scheme has evolved over time.  While originally just for widows, an equivalent payment was subsequently introduced for widowers.  More recently, with the introduction of civil partnership, my Department extended an equivalent support to surviving civil partners from 2011, when the provisions of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 came into force.  The scheme now also includes bereaved spouses of legally married same-sex couples.  </p>  <p>  While the introduction of marriage equality legislation is a welcome step forward, it cannot have the effect of making previous relationships, which ended through bereavement before its introduction, marriages in the legal sense.  It is not possible legally to retrospectively marry people, or to make them civil partners after the death of one of the couple.</p>  <p>  There is no age criteria attached to the Widows, widowers and surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension, or criteria requiring such a marriage or civil partnership to have been entered into before a certain age.  Provided a person was legally married or in a civil partnership at the time of the bereavement, and provided the other conditions such as PRSI are met, a person may qualify for a payment.</p>  <p>  As regards the State pension, a pensioner&rsquo;s partner may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult if they are wholly or mainly maintained by them.  This payment can be made regardless of whether they are married, in a civil partnership, or simply cohabiting.  A cohabitant is one of two adults (whether of the same or opposite sex) who live together as a couple in an intimate and committed relationship and who are not close relatives. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These principles are an integral part of the day-to-day work of my Department.  Where overpayments of benefit or assistance arise, my  Department seeks full recovery as quickly as possible.  </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Consolidation Act) 2005 makes provision for the recovery of any sum overpaid from the estates of deceased persons.  In seeking recovery from the estate, the circumstances giving rise to the overpayment are taken into account by my Department, together with any views expressed by the personal representatives and/or family of the deceased persons.  A social welfare debt will not become statute barred for recovery under these statutory provisions.  Any person who has a material interest in such cases and who is dissatisfied with a decision giving rise to an overpayment of benefit or assistance, has a right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>  <p>  Sections 335(a) and (b) of the Act provides that any benefit or assistance overpaid is repayable and that this obligation extends to any other person to whom the benefit was paid on behalf of that person, or the personal representative of that person.  In general, the personal representative or the solicitor of the deceased person&rsquo;s estate will contact my Department to arrange settlement of the outstanding overpayment.  In every case the value of the estate is reduced by the funeral and legal expenses for which the estate is liable and recovery of the overpayment is then sought from the remaining assets.  The issue of apportionment does not arise.  Where insufficient assets are available to repaid the outstanding sums, the Department has powers to consider the write-off or write-down of the balance of the outstanding overpayment to reflect the circumstances.</p>  <p>  In the event that the monies are not recovered by agreement, Section 339 (4) of the 2005 Act provides that civil proceedings can be taken within 6 years from the date on which the notice of intention to distribute the estate or the schedule of assets was received.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-06a.537.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120600068#WRN01100"><p>The overall concern in recent years has been to protect the value of weekly social welfare rates.  Expenditure on pensions, at approximately &euro;7 billion each year, is the largest block of expenditure in my Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approximately 35% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.</p>  <p>  There are three main pensions paid by my Department to people aged 66 and over, namely the State pension contributory (which is based on PRSI contributions), the State pension non-contributory (which is based on means), and the Widows/Widowers/Surviving Civil Partners Contributory pension (which is based on PRSI contributions, and is also payable at a lower rate before 66).</p>  <p>  The State pension contributory (previously called the Old Age Contributory Pension) was introduced in 1961, and is funded by PRSI contributions, on a pay-as-you go basis.  Since its introduction, the rate of payment has been based on the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; test.</p>  <p>  These rates are banded, and those bands have been amended from time to time, most recently in 2012.  There have been no changes in the structure of the bands since then, aside from increases in the rates, which are passed on pro-rata to the reduced rates.</p>  <p>  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced.  This resulted in one of bands (in respect of those with a yearly average of 20-47 contributions), being replaced with three bands (in respect of yearly averages of 40-47, 30-39, and 20-29 respectively).  The changes did not impact upon whether someone qualified for a pension, nor whether they would qualify for the full rate.  These additional bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life are likely to benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.</p>  <p>  Prior to these changes, in the period from 2000-2012, someone with a yearly average of 47 contributions qualified for the same rate of payment (98% of the maximum rate) as someone with a yearly average of 20 contributions, despite generally their much more significant PRSI record, and this was regardless of their means.  A person with an average of 48-52 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 more than someone with a yearly average of 20 PRSI contributions.  Aside from the lack of equity involved, this was a significant disincentive to longer working, as in most cases, contributions paid by people in their sixties had no impact upon the rate of their State pension upon retirement.</p>  <p>  The principle that the rate of a State pension contributory should reflect the PRSI contributions paid over a working life needs to be adhered to so that we can fund such pensions into the future.  Given the requirement to make savings in recent years, it was considered more equitable to address this disparity, than to reduce the rate of payment for all pensioners by an across the board cut in payment rates.  Such a cut would not just have penalised those who had paid into the system over the course of their lives, but it would also have reduced the incomes of the most vulnerable pensioners, who do not generally receive reduced rate contributory pensions, but rather receive a non-contributory pension, or a maximum rate contributory pension if they have the required contributions.</p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a full rate State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;222, or just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if a person&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;209, which is just less than 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory).</p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cost of reverting to the rate-bands which existed between 2000 and 2012 would be over &euro;50 million in 2017, and that this will rise at a rate of some &euro;10 m annually.</p>  <p>  In 2008, the maximum personal rate of the contributory pensions was &euro;223.30, and the maximum rate for the non-contributory pension was &euro;212. Despite negative inflation in the intervening period, these payments have already been increased by &euro;10, before taking into account a further &euro;5 increase next year.  While reverting to the 2008 rates of payments would be of benefit to pensioners who have significant other means and who contributed less to the Social Insurance Fund, it would be of no benefit to those who contributed to the system all their lives, nor would it be to that half of our elderly who rely solely on the State pension for their income.  I am satisfied that the across the board increases, which benefit everyone, have been a more appropriate approach in Budget 2017.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The strategic policy direction of my Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support scheme. Under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to those with a long-term housing need will transfer to local authorities, under the auspices of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government (DHPCLG).</p>  <p>  From 1st December 2016, the HAP scheme is now operational in 28 of the 31 local authority areas, having commenced on a statutory basis in nine further local authority areas; Cavan, Kerry, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Roscommon, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow. It is expected that HAP will be fully rolled out to the remaining Dublin areas from 1 March 2017.</p>  <p>  In local authority areas where HAP is in place, new applicants assessed as requiring social housing support will be considered for HAP rather than rent supplement. Under HAP the local authority pays the rent directly to the landlord and the HAP recipient will then pay a rent contribution to the local authority. The rent contribution is a differential rent, which is set by the local authority based on income and the ability to pay.</p>  <p>  DSP will continue to provide rental support, under the rent supplement scheme, to those with a short-term need, generally because of a temporary loss of employment.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the HAP is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the Social Housing Strategy 2020 and the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness &ndash; Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; which has committed to an accelerated target of 15,000 HAP tenancies in 2017.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-06a.570.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120600068#WRN03300"><p>The overall concern in recent years has been to protect the value of weekly social welfare rates. Expenditure on pensions, at approximately &euro;7 billion each year, is the largest block of expenditure in my Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approximately 35% of overall expenditure. Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.</p>  <p>  There are three main pensions paid by my Department to people aged 66 and over, namely the State pension contributory (which is based on PRSI contributions), the State pension non-contributory (which is based on means), and the Widows/Widowers/Surviving Civil Partners Contributory pension (which is based on PRSI contributions, and is also payable at a lower rate before 66).</p>  <p>  The State pension contributory (previously called the Old Age Contributory Pension) was introduced in 1961, and is funded by PRSI contributions, on a pay-as-you go basis.  Since its introduction, the rate of payment has been based on the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; test.</p>  <p>  These rates are banded, and those bands have been amended from time to time, most recently in 2012.  There have been no changes in the structure of the bands since then, aside from increases in the rates, which are passed on pro-rata to the reduced rates.</p>  <p>  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced. This resulted in one of the bands (in respect of those with a yearly average of 20-47 contributions), being replaced with three bands (in respect of yearly averages of 40-47, 30-39, and 20-29 respectively).  These additional bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life are likely to benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.</p>  <p>  Prior to these changes, in the period from 2000-2012, someone with a yearly average of 47 contributions qualified for the same rate of payment (98% of the maximum rate) as someone with a yearly average of 20 contributions, despite generally their much more significant PRSI record, and this was regardless of their means.  A person with an average of 48-52 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 more than someone with a yearly average of 20 PRSI contributions.  Aside from the lack of equity involved, this was a significant disincentive to longer working, as in most cases, contributions paid by people in their sixties had no impact upon the rate of their State pension upon retirement.</p>  <p>  The principle that the rate of a State pension contributory should reflect the PRSI contributions paid over a working life needs to be adhered to so that we can fund such pensions into the future.  Given the requirement to make savings in recent years, it was considered more equitable to address this disparity, than to reduce the rate of payment for all pensioners by an across the board cut in payment rates.  Such a cut would have reduced the incomes of the most vulnerable pensioners, who do not generally receive reduced rate contributory pensions, but rather receive a non-contributory pension, or a maximum rate contributory pension if they have the required contributions.</p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a full rate State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;222, or just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if a person&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;209, which is just less than 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory).</p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cost of reverting to the rate-bands which existed between 2000 and 2012 would be over &euro;50 million in 2017, and that this will rise at a rate of some &euro;10 m annually.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-06a.576.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120600068#WRN03700"><p>The funding standard provides the regulatory mechanism for ensuring that a defined benefit (DB) pension scheme can live up to the promised level of pension benefits and a benchmark against which the health of a scheme can be tested.  The funding standard is a wind-up standard, and is intended to approximate the monies needed to secure the benefits if the scheme was wound up and the accrued benefits bought out.  Any reduction in the funding standard would not improve a scheme&rsquo;s ability to pay the benefits as they fall due.</p>  <p>  In the first instance it is the responsibility of the trustees of a pension scheme to ensure compliance with the funding standard and other obligations set out in the Pensions Act 1990, as amended.  The existence of the funding standard is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded.  The responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed.</p>  <p>  Public companies are obliged to report on any defined benefit schemes in their annual financial statements.  The basis of these calculations is defined in the relevant accounting standards and is independent of the Irish funding standard.</p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority is the independent body responsible for regulating the funding standard.  If a scheme does not meet the funding standard, a funding proposal must be submitted to the Authority in accordance with the time limits detailed in the Pensions Act.  It should be noted that the Irish funding standard is less demanding in comparison to almost all other European countries.  Accordingly, I have no plans to review it.</p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority requires that, in setting investment policy, the trustees of a DB scheme must have regard to the need to satisfy at regular intervals the minimum funding standard set down in the Pensions Act.  However a number of steps have been taken to reduce the risks to pension scheme members caused by market volatility.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012 required a DB scheme to hold additional funding in the form of a &lsquo;risk reserve&rsquo; by 2023.  This function of this &lsquo;risk reserve&rsquo; is to provide some protection and long term stability for scheme members against future volatility in financial markets.  Additionally, and in appropriate circumstances, the regulator may approve scheme funding proposals that provide for the recovery of their schemes funding over longer periods that was previously the case.</p>  <p>  In order to provide increased investment options for pension schemes the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2010 and 2011 introduced the option for trustees to purchase sovereign annuities.  Pension schemes that purchase sovereign annuities or the underlying bonds benefit from a reduction in their liabilities under the funding standard.  Buying sovereign annuities for the pensioners has the effect of reducing pensioner liabilities under the funding standard and provides additional funds for the other members of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The situation of defined benefit funding is being actively monitored by the Department and the Pensions Authority.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-06a.598.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120600069#WRO02200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251 to 254, inclusive, together. </p>  <p>  Ms Nadia Murad, a survivor of the Daesh atrocities against the Yazidis, visited Ireland and met with a number of Deputies, and the T&aacute;naiste as well as senior officials in my own Department in my absence on official business.  I want to pay tribute to Ms Murad&rsquo;s extraordinary bravery and her leadership in campaigning to protect and uphold the rights of her people. </p>  <p>  I wish to record my absolute and unreserved condemnations of the vile and criminal acts committed against the Yazidis by the terrorist group Daesh.  These crimes continue to this day, against Yazidis held captive by Daesh. </p>  <p>  In September 2015, Ireland addressed UN Human Rights Council on the findings of the UN Commission of Inquiry report which stated that the crime of genocide had been committed against the Yazidis, saying &ldquo;the Commission&rsquo;s report details unimaginable crimes. The suffering of the victims of Daesh&rsquo;s terrorism and hatred is laid bare before this Council in the report. This Council and the membership of the United Nations have an inarguable duty to end these crimes and work to achieve justice and accountability for the victims of these crimes.</p>  <p>  Ireland has long made clear its full support for referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. Together with over 50 Member States of the United Nations, Ireland co-sponsored a proposed resolution to this effect in 2014. Ireland regards the failure of the proposed resolution as a breach of the Security Council&rsquo;s obligations under the UN Charter. Ireland repeats its call for the Security Council to uphold international law and act on this report by referring the situation in Syria to the Court. It is intolerable that the terrorist perpetrators of the most heinous crimes would be granted impunity by the action of any member of the United Nations.</p>  <p>  Ireland urges that all States engaged in countering Daesh in Syria and Iraq should place the protection of civilian populations, especially minorities at particular risk from Daesh&rsquo;s murderous ideology of hate, as a priority in their instructions to members of their security forces  .&rdquo;</p>  <p>  I have previously informed the Oireachtas that it is our policy that the responsibility for a legal determination of the crime of genocide is a matter for a legally competent and internationally recognised court.  I regard the report of the Commission of Inquiry and its findings of genocide as authoritative and I repeat our long-standing demand that the Security Council fulfil its obligations under international law and act to ensure that the Yazidis can seek accountability for Daesh&rsquo;s crimes before the International Criminal Court or another legally competent international tribunal.  There can be no impunity for the horrific crimes committed against the Yazidis. </p>  <p>  Given the continuing conflict and the ongoing threat of terrorism in Sinjar and Nineveh, the resettlement of the Yazidis and other minority populations in their ancient homelands remains too dangerous to implement immediately.  However, this must be a priority for Ireland and its international partners, together with international action to ensure the protection of these populations after their return to their homes. </p>  <p>  Funding from the Irish Aid programme, managed by my Department, has been provided to meet the urgent needs of the most vulnerable people inside Iraq, particularly in besieged and hard-to-reach areas, and those who have been displaced internally, or who have fled to neighbouring countries.  Funding is channelled through Irish Aid&rsquo;s NGO partners and UN organisations, who are best placed to respond, and is used to provide humanitarian supplies and urgently needed access to food, health, water and sanitation services, with a particular focus on the protection of children, women and the most vulnerable. </p>  <p>  So far in 2016, Ireland has provided &euro;1.5 million to Iraq, channelled through the UN Iraq Humanitarian Pooled Fund, to provide life-saving assistance to the estimated 10 million people affected by violence in Iraq.  The Humanitarian Pooled Fund supports the implementation of the Iraq Humanitarian Response Plan, which aims to meet the critical needs of displaced people. In Erbil and Dahuk Governorates, in particular, this includes members of the Yazidi community. </p>  <p>  In addition, in October, the Irish Government dispatched 80 tonnes of humanitarian relief supplies under the Rapid Response initiative.  The relief items, which included blankets, jerry cans, cooking sets, water tanks, tarpaulins and shelter kits, at a total approximate value of &euro;462,813, were donated to Oxfam for distribution to conflict-affected communities. </p>  <p>  During 2015, Ireland also provided &euro;1 million to the Iraq Humanitarian Pooled Fund and &euro;250,000 in support of UNICEF&rsquo;s Iraq Strategic Response Plan, which prioritised the protection of civilians displaced by conflict, as well as &euro;330,000 to Christian Aid Ireland to support activities promoting the protection of displaced women and girls in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, where the Yazidi population is concentrated.   </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to closely monitor the situation in Iraq, and given its complexity and severity, it is likely that further support will be provided to affected communities in the coming months.</p></reply>

Ireland is deeply concerned by the persecution of Christians.</p>  <p>  Ireland will also continue to raise the issue of the persecution of Christians, through its official bilateral contacts with Pakistan, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect all citizens and minorities, irrespective of their religion or belief.</p></reply>

We support the aspirations of the countries involved in the accession process, including Serbia, Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>  <p>  Ireland welcomed the publication by the Commission of the latest annual progress reports on each of the five candidate and two potential candidate countries on 9 November.  The detailed reports give a &lsquo;state of play&rsquo; assessment on the preparations for Union membership in each accession country across the acquis communautaire and set out guidelines on reform priorities.</p>  <p>  Serbia was granted candidate status for EU membership in March 2012, and accession negotiations were opened in 28 June 2013, during the Irish EU Presidency.  To date, four chapters have been opened, including the two &lsquo;fundamentals first&rsquo; chapters on Judiciary and Fundamental Rights (Chapter 23) and on Justice, Freedom and Security   (Chapter 24) in July of this year.  It is expected that further chapters will be opened before year-end. Serbia has finalised rule of law action plans, reached key agreements with Kosovo, and been pro-active in developing regional co-operation with its neighbours.  It has also embarked on an ambitious economic reform agenda.</p>  <p>  We are pleased with the substantial progress made by Serbia so far on its European path, and we agree with the Commission&rsquo;s report that there is still a need for further reform, including in the areas of public administration and the business environment.  The Serbian government has demonstrated their commitment to EU accession at political level by making it a priority goal in their programme for government.</p>  <p>  Montenegro was granted candidate status in 2010.  Accession negotiations began in 2012, and 24 chapters have been opened.  The Commission&rsquo;s report recognises the considerable work on alignment with and preparation for the implementation of the acquis, which has already taken place.  It acknowledges the constructive role which the country plays in enhancing regional cooperation.  Advances in the rule of law have been made and the legal and institutional framework have been strengthened.  The report recommends that Montenegro should now focus on its economic and monetary policy.</p>  <p>  The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as it is called in the EU negotiations (though we use the name &ldquo;Macedonia&rdquo; in our bilateral relations) has been a candidate country since 2005.  However, the opening of accession negotiations has been stalled, first as a result of difficult bilateral issues with neighbours and then by the ongoing political crisis.  It is now contingent on the continued implementation of the Pr&zcaron;ino agreement (2015) and substantial progress in the implementation of the "Urgent Reform Priorities".  Having been postponed twice already this year, elections are now scheduled to take place on 11 December.  We hope they will be free and fair and that the renewed opportunity they represent for the country to mitigate the divisive political culture in Macedonia and enhance its capacity to implement much needed reforms will be seized. </p>  <p>  Iceland applied for EU membership in 2009 and was granted candidate status in 2010.  However, negotiations were halted after elections in 2013 and in March 2015 the then government requested that "Iceland should not be regarded as a candidate country for EU membership".  Elections took place in October 2016 and no change in Iceland&rsquo;s EU aspirations has yet been signalled by the new government.</p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s progress reports are still being examined in detail at official level and it is hoped that Ministers will be able to reach agreement on an appropriate response at the General Affairs Council on 13 December.  For the sake of completeness, the countries which will be under consideration, in addition to those mentioned in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, are Turkey and Albania (candidate countries), together with Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina and Kosovo (potential candidates).</p></reply>

Since 2012, Ireland has provided more than &euro;62 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria and the region.  This is Ireland&rsquo;s largest response to any humanitarian crisis ever. </p>  <p>  Of the &euro;20 million in assistance provided by the Government so far in 2016, &euro;14 million has been delivered through the Irish Aid programme, managed by my Department, and &euro;6 million through the Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s support to the World Food Programme&rsquo;s Syria response. </p>  <p>  Irish Aid funding seeks to meet the needs of those inside Syria, particularly in besieged and hard-to-reach areas, and those who have fled to neighbouring countries. Funding is channelled through NGO, UN and International Red Cross and Red Crescent partners.  These partners provide supplies and urgently-needed health, education, water and sanitation services, as well as implementing measures to protect children and vulnerable families. </p>  <p>  In addition, members of Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps have been deployed to the Balkans and Middle East, providing much needed additional capacity to UN agencies responding to migration challenges resulting from the Syrian conflict. </p>  <p>  At a political level, both Minister Flanagan and I have focused on this crisis in discussions in recent months at the EU, UN, and with our civil society partners.</p>  <p>  The crisis in Syria is a regular item on the agenda of the EU Foreign Affairs Council.  Minister Flanagan and his colleagues held extensive discussions with the UN Special Envoy de Mistura on 17 October, underlining continuing strong support for his work.  The crisis was discussed again at the meeting of the Council on 14 November. </p>  <p>  In September, the European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Christos Stylianides, visited Dublin and briefed Minister Flanagan on the EU&rsquo;s Humanitarian Initiative for Aleppo.  Minister Flanagan also had an opportunity to discuss the Syrian conflict with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on 30 October, and he addressed efforts to renew the political process during his recent trip to the Gulf, where he met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates and the Deputy Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia. </p>  <p>  On 21 November, the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, visited Dublin and provided us with an update on his organisation&rsquo;s critical humanitarian work in Syria, which is strongly supported by Ireland. </p>  <p>  I also met with the CEOs of Ireland&rsquo;s 10 largest development NGOs in the last two weeks, many of whom receive funding from my Department to respond to the crisis in Syria, and assured them of our continued commitment.  </p>  <p>  We continue to monitor the situation in Syria very closely and are ready to provide further assistance to the Syrian people in the coming months.</p></reply>

The meeting was very cordial and underscored the strength and range of the many links between Ireland and France.  Mr Ayrault made a particular point, both in the meeting and at the following press conference, of thanking Ireland for its solidarity in response to the terrorist attacks suffered by France over the past two years.</p>  <p>  We discussed Brexit at some length, and agreed that while we both wished to ensure the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, our primary objective was the maintenance of the unity and integrity of the Union itself.  We both looked forward to greater clarity from the UK side in regard to its negotiating objectives.  I took the opportunity to underline once ago the particular challenges Ireland faces in relation to the Common Travel Area, Northern Ireland and North-South connections.  Mr Ayrault made clear his understanding of the importance and sensitivity of these questions and his support for maintaining the many gains of the peace process.</p>  <p>  We agreed that the European Union needs to re-connect with citizens through the effective implementation of concrete commitments already made, but also through more positive messaging. </p>  <p>  We also discussed a number of international issues, including the possible implications of the recent election of US President-elect Trump; Ukraine and Russia; and Syria.  Mr Ayrault briefed me on the French initiative on the Middle East Peace Process and his plans for a possible further meeting before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  We also reviewed some issues concerning the United Nations.</p>  <p>  I brought the Minister up to date on the work under way in regard to the implementation of the recent D&aacute;il motion concerning the transfer to Ireland of some of the unaccompanied minors recently taken from the irregular encampment at Calais.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-06a.622.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120600069#WRO04600"><p>Full and timely implementation of the Agreement is a key priority for the Government and this is reflected by its inclusion in the new Programme for Government.  The Government continues to work closely with all relevant stakeholders in this regard. </p>  <p>  Progress on implementing the provisions of both the Fresh Start and Stormont House Agreements are considered at periodic review meetings.  These are attended by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the First and deputy First Ministers and, where relevant to her portfolio, the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice.  I represent the Government at these meetings.</p>  <p>  The last review was held on 29 June 2016, and the next meeting is scheduled for 14 December.  These review meetings are important in providing political direction and momentum for the full implementation of the Agreements.</p>  <p>  There has been sustained progress with the implementation of the Fresh Start Agreement over the last year, with each administration actively pursuing the necessary work to fulfil the respective commitments. </p>  <p>  Together with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, I hosted a trilateral ministerial meeting on enhancing law enforcement co-operation on the island, as envisaged by the Fresh Start Agreement, in Farmleigh on 21 December 2015.  This meeting, which included the two Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive, also launched the Joint Agency Task Force on cross-border crime.</p>  <p>  The Joint Agency Task Force quickly became fully operational and is progressing its work to tackle cross-jurisdictional organised crime and bring to justice those involved in it.  The Task Force builds on existing operational arrangements to tackle organised crime, including that linked to paramilitarism, on a cross-border basis.  The Task Force reports on its work to the two Justice Ministers within the framework of their regular meetings under the Inter-Governmental Agreement on Criminal Justice Co-operation, as provided for in the Fresh Start Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Government is meeting its commitments as regards infrastructure projects under the Fresh Start Agreement.  This includes a contribution of &euro;25 million from the Irish Government in 2019 for the upgrading of the A5 Western Transport Corridor road project, which is in addition to the &euro;50 million previously committed.  The Government&rsquo;s committed funding of &euro;2.5 million to the North West Development Fund has been provided and is to be matched by the NI Executive.  Discussions are continuing at senior official level with the Northern Ireland Executive regarding co-operation on other infrastructure projects, including the Narrow Water Bridge project and the Ulster Canal and exploring financing options for future border infrastructure projects.</p>  <p>  As provided for in Fresh Start, a three-person Panel was appointed last December to recommend the elements of a strategy for the disbandment of paramilitary groups.  This panel, comprising Lord John Alderdice, Monica McWilliams, and John McBurney, made over forty recommendations.  The Northern Ireland Executive updated the June review meeting on its then draft Action Plan to take these recommendations forward.  In July, the Northern Ireland Executive published its Action Plan on Tackling Paramilitary Activity, Criminality and Organised Crime. </p>  <p>  On 13 September, I signed an international agreement with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to establish the Independent Reporting Commission (IRC).  The Fresh Start Agreement provides that the IRC will report annually on progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland.  These reports will inform future Northern Ireland Executive Programme for Government commitments through to 2021.  The Government will shortly bring forward legislative proposals before the Oireachtas to establish the IRC in law.  The aim is to get the IRC established and up and running as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  The NI Executive and the British Government are also proceeding with implementation of their respective commitments under the Fresh Start Agreement.  The Executive signed off on the 2016-17 Budget last December and the Welfare Bill implementing the relevant provisions in the Agreement passed into UK law on 25 November 2015.  The UK Treasury has also approved the release of monies from the Stormont House Agreement funding to support integrated education. </p>  <p>  The institutional reforms provided for under the Fresh Start Agreement have also been implemented, including the reduction in the number of Executive Ministries from 12 to 9 and the option for parties entitled to a place in the Executive to instead designate as part of the formal opposition in the Assembly.  This option was taken up by both the UUP and SDLP following the Assembly election last May. </p>  <p>  In June, the Co-Chairs and members of the Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition Commission were appointed by the Northern Ireland Executive and the Commission is now progressing its work, as foreseen in the Stormont House Agreement and reiterated in Fresh Start. </p>  <p>  With regard to the establishment of a framework for dealing with the legacy of the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement but on which final agreement could not be reached during the Fresh Start Agreement talks, the Government remains committed to the full implementation of these commitments. </p>  <p>  I am continuing to engage with the Secretary of State and with the Northern Ireland Executive and other parties in Northern Ireland, to see how we can to find a route to a final agreement on legacy issues.  While there remain a number of outstanding issues, there is an urgent need to achieve progress - so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and support broader societal healing and reconciliation.  I am therefore working to secure the necessary political agreement to get the legacy bodies established and up and running as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The term &quot;worker&quot; in this case includes employees, contractors, agency workers, people gaining work experience, and trainees.

However, in bringing forward evidence of malpractice or policy failure in the public service, a number of reporting channels are open to them. For example, in cases of suspected fraud or criminality, the matter can be reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Various regulatory bodies, such as the Data Protection Commissioner, the Health and Safety Authority, and the Health Information and Quality Authority, are empowered to investigate and sanction inter alia public bodies for legislative or regulatory breaches in their respective sectors. </p><p>In addition, under the statutory framework governing his office, the Ombudsman can also initiate an investigation to ensure that problematic issues in a particular sector are addressed and/or matters of significant public interest are brought to the attention of the public.  Furthermore, as well as assisting workers seeking to make protected disclosures under the Act, Transparency International Ireland's 'Speak Up Helpline' also offers information, referral advice and advocacy support for other witnesses and victims of corruption and other wrongdoing on a confidential basis.</p></reply>

Measures specifically designed to improve access for SMEs and start-ups include:-  financial capacity criterion is now less demanding; it is generally limited to twice contract value; </p><p>-  eprocurement; </p><p>-  the discretion to divide public contracts into lots, with the proviso that opting not to divide a contract into lots must be explained in the procurement documents; and </p><p>-  provision for &quot;consortia bidding&quot; to encourage SME involvement.</p><p>A number of these measures had been accelerated into policy in 2014 in advance of the transposition of the new Directives by Circular 10/14, issued by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP).  The reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.  The OGP works with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.  It does this by facilitating quarterly meetings of an SME Advisory Group, chaired by my colleague, Minister of State Eoghan Murphy who has responsibility for public procurement, so that the voice of Irish SMEs (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) can be heard by Government.  SMEs are also encouraged to register of the Government's etenders portal so that they can be notified of upcoming tendering opportunities.</p><p>The OGP works with the SME industry representative bodies as well as the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, InterTrade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to promote the engagement of SMEs in public procurement.  Evidence of the work and co-operation in the area can be seen in some of the following events organised by InterTrade Ireland and supported by the OGP in 2016:</p><p>-  thirteen &quot;Go-2-Tender&quot; workshops attended by 179 businesses; and  </p><p>-  two &quot;Meet the Buyer&quot; events were held in 2016, one in Belfast and a new Regional/Opportunity driven approach was piloted in Cork.  These events were attended by over 900 businesses and buyers from across the public sector, North and South, which focused on the opportunities for SMEs with major public sector buyers across the island</p><p>Similar events took place in 2015 and more are planned for 2017.  </p><p>Minister of State Murphy launched the OGPs in September.  The data analysed indicates that 95% of the State's expenditure is with firms within the State and the majority of the spend analysed is with SMEs.  Equally important, in terms of SME access to government business, is the report's highlighting that, in the majority of spend areas, the typical tender value is less &euro;100,000.  The OGP has also conducted an analysis of the 94 Framework Agreements it has concluded to date.  The data shows that 68% of Framework members are SMEs and 63% of the Frameworks had multiple lots, facilitating SME access.  These findings show that SMEs are successful in Public Procurement competitions in Ireland and the initiatives outlined will ensure they continue to compete and be successful in future Public Tendering opportunities.</p></reply>

The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE has confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.</p><p>The HSE has recently completed its most recent round of negotiations with the manufacturer.  On foot of this, the HSE&rsquo;s Drugs Committee, having considered the NCPE recommendation and other expert advice, is in the process of sending its latest recommendation on the cost-effectiveness of Orkambi to the HSE Directorate.  The HSE Directorate will then make a decision, taking into consideration the manufacturer&rsquo;s latest price offer.  This decision will be made on objective scientific and economic grounds, in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>I share the HSE's disappointment that the manufacturer in this case has maintained a very high price in negotiations on the potential reimbursement of Orkambi for Irish patients.</p><p>I appreciate that this is a very stressful time for cystic fibrosis patients and their families.  However, I want to assure them that I do not consider this to be the end of the process.  I would strongly urge the manufacturer in this case to fundamentally reconsider its position and to table a pricing proposal that can facilitate the provision of Orkambi for Irish patients, at a price that represents value for money for the health service and the taxpayer.</p><p>I would also like to inform the Deputy that I have written to the Health Ministers in England, Scotland, Canada and Australia, asking them to collaborate to try and make progress on accessing Orkambi at a cost effective price for cystic fibrosis patients in each of their countries.</p></reply>

Over the coming months it is essential that the health service plans effectively for expected surges in emergency care demand.  My Department, working with the HSE, has been driving a range of measures to improve patient ED experience times. </p>  <p>  Following the formation of Government an additional &euro;40 million was provided to assist in the management of winter pressures.  Utilising this additional funding the HSE developed the Winter Initiative Plan 2016 &ndash; 2017 which was published in September.  Key aspects of this plan are being implemented at hospital and community services level across the country.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by the HSE that as of 2 December 2016, the remaining balance of the winter initiative to be spent is &euro;6.6m.  The HSE are confident the remainder of the funding will be fully spent by the end of the year in order to help as many patients as possible. </p>  <p>  One of the key targets of the Winter Initiative is to reduce delayed discharges nationally from 638 at the commencement of this initiative to less than 500 by the end of the year.  The HSE is on course to meet this target with the number of delayed discharges nationally now at 525, as of end November.  Over 4,100 patients have availed of Community Intervention Team services, meaning that these patients were able to avoid hospital or be discharged earlier from hospital. </p>  <p>  Also under the Initiative, over 3,300 patients have availed of aids and appliances, enabling them to be discharged from hospital sooner.  420 additional homecare packages have been made available and 190 additional transitional care beds have been approved since early October.  These have enabled patients to be discharged from hospital back to their homes or to alternative transitional care centres.  In addition, 18 step-down beds have opened in the Mercy Hospital in Cork.</p>  <p>  On 1 December the HSE convened a Winter Initiative Health Summit where I met with Hospital Group CEOs, as well as hospital and Community Health Organisation managers, to reinforce the importance of driving key performance improvements across primary, acute and social care to reduce ED overcrowding and to plan for expected surges in demand in our EDs in the New Year.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that there is a very strong focus on reducing ED overcrowding in all my interactions with the HSE, hospitals and the wider health service.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-06a.770.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120600072#WRR02500"><p>Significant progress has been made on implementation o<i>f A Vision for Change</i>, underpinned by the substantial additional funding provided by Government since 2012.  Including funding agreed in the recent Budget, the HSE budget for mental health services will be in the region of &euro;850m next year for mental health.  All aspects of adult and child and adolescent services are being developed, including acute and community based services, along with  forensic mental health services.  Detailed service improvements are reflected each year in the HSE National Service Plans and the HSE Mental Health Division Operational Plans, available on the HSE website. </p><p>The HSE National Forensic Mental Health Service provides specialist forensic services to those referred from the Irish Prison Service, and the Youth Justice Service.  It also provides consultation and advice to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Courts Service of Ireland.  Every effort is made to ensure that forensics mental health care provision is in accordance with the recommendations of <i>A Vision for Change</i>, including legal considerations and person-centred and recovery-based approaches on an inter-agency basis.</p><p>In relation to Recommendation 15.1.1, all prisoners are medically assessed on committal to prison.  This includes a mental health assessment which can be employed to develop an individual care plan.  Where clinically indicated, the prisoner is referred to a forensic clinician who, subject to his/her findings, may make certain recommendations to the Governor for the care of the prisoner.  Prisoners on release, are entitled to be referred to the HSE  mental health services in the normal way. </p><p>In regard to 15.1.2, the National Forensic Mental Health Service (NFMHS) at the Central Mental Hospital (CMH) at Dundrum provides a Mental Health Prison In-Reach and Court Diversion Service (PICLS) programme to the Irish Prison Service.  The diversion system ensures as far as possible that those people presenting before the courts, or indeed at an earlier stage of the criminal justice system, where the infraction is a reflection of an underlying mental illness, are referred and treated appropriately.  This approach has reduced the number of mentally ill people committed to prison, under sentence.  An Interdepartmental Group is looking at what further improvements can be made on the issue of persons with mental illness and their interaction with the Criminal Justice System. </p><p>The recommendation reflected  in 15.1.3 refers to increasing community based forensic mental  health teams.  Full multi-disciplinary teams will be established in 2017 connected to Castlerea, Limerick and Cork prisons.  </p><p>Planning permission for a new modern Forensic mental health facility in Portrane to replace the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, was granted in June 2015.  Phase 1 of the project comprises a new 120-bed hospital, as reflected in Recommendation 15.1.4, along with a new 10-bed Child and Adolescent Mental Health unit (Recommendation 15. 1.6) and a new 10-bed Mental Health Intellectual Disability unit (Recommendation 15.1.7).  I was pleased to secure the significant additional capital funding in Budget 2017, to allow construction to commence on Phase 1 early next year, with a view to the new facilities coming on-stream in 2019.  Phase 2 of the project envisages the provision of regional Intensive Care Rehabilitation Units, as resources allow over the longer term.</p><p>In relation to 15.1.5, there are a number of prison based multi-disciplinary groups that provide information and support in the area of mental health to prisoners.  There are consultant-led forensic mental health in-reach teams in all the prisons in Ireland at present except for Castlerea where it is hoped to provide an appropriate service in early 2017.  The Irish Prison Service (IPS) is seeking to advance a robust system that would see integration and further development of services with statutory and voluntary partners.  Mental health service provision in prisons must form part of the overall community response to this cohort of prisoners.  Current arrangements with the Central Mental Hospital are a good example of collaborative working.  In addition to healthcare input, the IPS Psychology Service provides ongoing evidence informed therapeutic approaches to those referred to the service who are suffering from mental health difficulties.</p><p>The implementation of Recommendations 15.1.8 and 15.1.9 are being progressed on a joint basis by the health and judicial systems.  This involves, for example, the HSE National Forensic Mental Health service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service.  The NFMHS provides regular training to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda training college at Templemore also delivers training as part of the training of all new Garda trainees.  The Forensic service provides an advisory service to the Garda negotiation team, and has established links to local garda&iacute;.  In 2017 it is planned to develop structured links to Divisional garda&iacute;.  Good progress has been made in recent years, arising from the significant additional funding given to mental health, including the modernisation of the NFMHS and by progressing the work of the Interdepartmental Group on those with mental health issues coming into contact with the criminal justice system.</p><p>I recently commenced a review of all aspects of <i>A Vision for Change</i>, to help inform policy and service development in the future.  In this regard, I will bear in mind the issues raised by the Deputy.</p></reply>

In addition to an authorisation from the HPRA, clinical trials also require a positive opinion from an ethics committee that is recognised by the Department of Health, prior to being commenced.  The types of trials authorised range from first-in-man trials for new medicines to studies with medicines which already have marketing authorisations.</p>  <p>  Clinical trials in Ireland are governed by the European Communities (Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products for Human Use) Regulations 2004, S.I. No. 190 of 2004.  These Regulations transposed into Irish law the provisions of Council Directive 2001/20/EC and superseded the Control of Clinical Trials Acts 1987&ndash;1990 for clinical trials using medicinal products.  </p>  <p>  The Regulations require that all clinical trials covered by the provisions of the Regulations are designed, conducted and reported in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP), a set of internationally recognised ethical and scientific quality requirements that must be observed for clinical trials involving human subjects.  Compliance with GCP provides assurance that the rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects are protected, and that the results of the clinical trials are accurate and credible.  </p>  <p>  As the competent authority for the Regulations, the HPRA may carry out GCP inspections of trial sites in order to establish compliance with relevant legislation and guidelines.  A trial site can be defined as any location where trial-related activities are conducted.  Therefore, an inspection can occur at an investigator site, sponsor company site, laboratory site, manufacturing site or at other establishments deemed appropriate by the regulatory authority.  The HPRA also requires that an annual safety report is submitted for any trial which is ongoing in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Any member of the public who has concerns over the conduct of a specific clinical trial for a medicinal product should contact the HPRA in the first instance.

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.</p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.  NIAC recommended that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.</p>  <p>  Gardasil is the HPV vaccine used in Ireland in the context of the HSE schools immunisation programme.  By January 2016, over 200 million doses of Gardasil had been distributed worldwide.  In Ireland over 620,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and over 220,000 girls have been fully vaccinated against HPV since it was introduced in 2010.</p>  <p>  The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is a decentralised agency of the European Union responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the EU.  It would not be appropriate to comment on data submitted by manufacturers of a medicinal product to the EMA as part of their market authorisation processes or monitoring of its safety following authorisation for use.</p>  <p>  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the statutory regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.</p>  <p>  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, with healthcare professionals and patients encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.</p>  <p>  In addition, pharmaceutical companies are obliged, as a condition of the authorisation to market a medicine, to submit reports of adverse reactions received directly, to the HPRA.  At EU level, regulators continuously monitor this cumulative reporting experience as part of the ongoing assessment of the safety of HPV vaccines.  In accordance with its reporting obligations, the HPRA provides anonymised details of reports received to the EMA, the WHO and to the relevant pharmaceutical companies.</p>  <p>  The fact that a suspected adverse reaction has been reported does not necessarily mean that the vaccine has caused the observed effect, this may also been caused by a new disease the patient developed.  Further data are usually needed to complete the picture.  In the context of monitoring the safety of vaccines, new information on a possible risk is called a signal.  Signals may arise from various data sources, including spontaneous reports, clinical trials and epidemiological studies.  Once a signal has been identified, investigations are undertaken to consider the likelihood that a medicine may have caused or contributed to the effect, try to identify risk factors and estimate the frequency of occurrence.  Following the assessment, a decision on the most appropriate regulatory action is taken by the competent authorities.  The regulatory action is communicated to healthcare professionals, patients and the general public through established channels, and timelines reflect the degree of urgency.</p>  <p>  The EMA completed its detailed scientific review in November 2015 of the evidence surrounding reports of two conditions.  In line with its initial recommendations, the EMA confirms that the evidence does not support a causal link between the HPV vaccine sand development of the two conditions studied.  Therefore there is no reason to change the way the vaccines are used or to amend the current product information.  The Agency&rsquo;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use concurred that the available evidence and did not recommend any changes to the terms of licensing or the product information for these medicines.  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusions of the EMA, that there is no change to the way HPV vaccines are used, or to amend the current product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all members states.</p>  <p>  The review recognised that, at that time, more than 80 million girls and women worldwide have now received these vaccines, and in some European countries they have been given to 90% of the age group recommended for vaccination.  Use of these vaccines is expected to prevent many cases of cervical cancer (cancer of the neck of the womb, which is responsible for over 20,000 deaths in Europe each year) and various other cancers and conditions caused by HPV.</p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services.  The HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.</p>  <p>  I am aware of media reports that the authorities in Demark and Japan have taken some measures concerning HPV immunisation in their countries. However, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the arrangements put in place by the health authorities these countries.</p>  <p>  The benefits of HPV vaccines outweigh the known side effects.  The safety of these vaccines, as with all medicines, will continue to be carefully monitored and will take into account any future new evidence of side effects that becomes available.   I encourage the parents of all eligible girls to ensure that their daughters receive this important cancer preventing vaccine.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-06a.879.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120600074#WRT02700"><p>The National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland (2014 - 2018) recommended that an Oversight Implementation Group of relevant stakeholders, including patients' groups, be established to oversee and monitor implementation of the plan's recommendations.  This group was established by my Department  in 2015 and it has met on a number of occasions. </p>  <p>  One of the principal recommendations in the Plan was the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases.  This programme was to be responsible, over time and among other functions, for assisting with mapping and  developing care pathways for rare diseases; facilitating timely access to centres of expertise &ndash; nationally and internationally; and developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In line with this recommendation, a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was established in 2013 under the National Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division of the HSE.  The programme is a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  This clinical programme is a channel for assisting with the advancement of a number of other recommendations in the plan, such as those on National Centres of Expertise for rare diseases; and in this vein, the programme designed a framework for the designation of Irish Centres of Expertise in cooperation with HSE Acute Hospitals Division in line with the recommendations stipulated in the national plan.</p>  <p>  The Rare Diseases National Plan also recommended that &lsquo;the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases through a National Office for Rare Diseases develop the clinical and organisational governance framework that would underpin care pathways and access to treatment for rare disease patients, particularly in the context of transition from paediatric to adult care'.</p>  <p>  As such the National Clinical Programme has developed a draft transition model of care which will be entering a consultation stage very shortly.</p>  <p>  The National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health encouraged designated Centres of Expertise to participate in European Reference Networks (ERNs) for Rare Diseases in line with the national plan.  ERNs are European networks connecting health care providers and centres of expertise so that international expertise on specific rare diseases may be pooled together for the benefit of patients.  Any centre applying for membership of an ERN must have strategies in place to ensure that care is patient-centred; that patients' rights and preferences are respected; and must show a research component to their work. </p>  <p>  Hence, the recommendations in the national plan that related to empowering and protecting patients and carers, and research on rare diseases will be fulfilled in part through this process.  It is expected that ERNs will have a major structuring effect by linking thematic expert centres across the EU. </p>  <p>  With the encouragement of the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases, Acute Hospital Divisions in the HSE and the Department of Health, five centres of expertise were designated in June this year during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks.  Three of these designated centres applied for membership of ERNs.</p>  <p>  In 2014, the Minister for Health announced &euro;850,000 for investment into charity-led research priorities, which particularly benefits rare disease research.  Five charities were to provide matching funding bringing the total investment to &euro;1.9 million.  They were to share &euro;850,000 in State funding to take part in international research into rare medical conditions.  In 2016, the next cohort of projects was funded by the State with &euro;1.686 million, matched by charity funding of &euro;1.224 million.  The total funding of &euro;2.91 million is shared between 14 charities.  The next round of this joint funding initiative will open in 2017.  The EU commission now intends to explore the possibility to further strengthen the collaboration between Member States and the Commission in the area of research on rare diseases.</p>  <p>  The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) featured prominently in the recommendations of the Rare Disease plan.  The national office was established by the HSE in June 2015.  Its work is currently led by the NCPRD Clinical Lead, supported by an Information Scientist, part-time Administrative Officer, part-time Genetic Counsellor and by a 0.2FTE Consultant Geneticist.  It is, among other functions, providing up-to-date information regarding new treatment and management options, including clinical trials.  In addition, the post of Information Scientist for the office is being funded jointly by the HSE and the EU Commission. </p>  <p>  The NRDO has already performed a preliminary situation analysis of the existing rare disease registries and is in the process of assigning these known registries on our national Orphanet site, which is the international rare disease reference and information portal funded by the EU.  The EU Commission has started the development of a European Platform on Rare Diseases Registration.  Its principal goal is to enable sharing and use of rare diseases' patient data across Europe, among the multitude of existing patient registries, within and across rare diseases. </p>  <p>  A number of recommendations about access to appropriate drugs and technologies were contained in the plan.  One chief recommendation in this regard refers to the HSE developing a Working Group to bring forward appropriate decision criteria for the reimbursement of orphan medicines and technologies; and that the approach should include an assessment system similar to that for cancer therapies established under the National Cancer Control Programme.  The HSE has advised my Department that its Acute Hospitals Division is developing the terms of reference, required membership and reporting relationship for this committee which will parallel the National Cancer Control Programme Technology Review Committee.</p>  <p>  This Committee will also be supported by the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases Clinical Advisory Group. </p>  <p>  The national plan for Rare Diseases recommended that the Health Identifiers Bill and the Health &amp;amp; Patient Safety Bill be published.  The former was published in 2013 and enacted in 2014.  It is now being implemented by the HSE.  A revised and much expanded General Scheme of a Health Information and Patient Safety Bill was approved by the government in November 2015 and published on the Department's website. </p>  <p>  Two recommendations referred to training in rare diseases for healthcare professionals.  The Department of Health has contacted formally the various healthcare representative and professional bodies about implementing these recommendations.</p>  <p>  Finally, rare diseases have already been tabled on the agenda for North-South meetings. Therefore, future work to deepen cooperation between both jurisdictions on rare diseases is anticipated.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p>  <p>  The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p>  <p>  -  Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;</p>  <p>  -  Bed and board;</p>  <p>  -  Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and</p>  <p>  -  Laundry service.</p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home. </p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, e.g. social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing.  In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income.  The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).  An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.</p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home.  This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.  The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.</p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes.  The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.</p></reply>

Utilising this additional funding the HSE developed the Winter Initiative Plan 2016 &ndash; 2017 which was published in September.  Key aspects of this plan are being implemented at hospital and community services level across the country.</p>  <p>  South Tipperary General Hospital is one of nine hospitals which have been targeted in this year&rsquo;s Winter Initiative. In order to alleviate ED overcrowding at the hospital, a range of specific measures have been put in place.  These include the expansion of access to Community Intervention Teams services to support the hospital by facilitating hospital avoidance and timely discharge.  Additional home care packages are also being provided; from 3 October to the 5 February, an additional 3 home care packages per week will be provided in the South Tipperary area.  Additional access to aids and appliances to support timely discharge will also be provided. A tender process to establish a National Framework Agreement for Temporary Accommodation is currently being evaluated.  Based on the outcome of this process, the HSE will consider options, to provide additional capacity at the hospital.</p>  <p>  Last week the HSE convened a Winter Initiative Health Summit and I met with Hospital Group CEOs, as well as hospital and Community Health Organisation managers, to reinforce the importance of driving key performance improvements across primary, acute and social care to reduce ED overcrowding and to plan for expected surges in demand in our EDs in the New Year.</p>  <p>  In relation to this particular query, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.</p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.  These issues include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  This work is currently underway and the IFA has made a submission in this context to the Interdepartmental Group which is overseeing the Review.  Changes arising from this Review may require legislative implementation.  There are no plans at present to review the terms of the NHSS financial assessment more generally.</p></reply>

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe.  Lyme disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe.</p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE collects and collates surveillance data on notifiable infectious diseases. Lyme borreliosis is notifiable in Ireland since 2012; the notifiable entity being the more severe neurological form of LB: Lyme neuroborreliosis.</p><p>The number of annual neuroborreliosis notifications over the last few years is as follows: </p><blockquote>-  2012 &ndash; 8 cases; <br /><br />-  2013 &ndash; 13 cases; <br /><br />-  2014 &ndash; 18 cases; <br /><br />-  2015 &ndash; 12 cases.</blockquote><p>This gives an average annual incidence rate of neuroborreliosis in Ireland of about 2.7 neuroborreliosis cases per million population. </p><p>Since 2013, the HPSC has held an annual &lsquo;Lyme Awareness Week&rsquo; at the beginning of the tick biting season, the purpose of which is to draw attention - particularly in the media - to Lyme disease and the ticks that can spread this disease. The week beginning May 2nd was designated as Lyme Awareness Week this year. </p><p>The literature on the HPSC website points out that campers, walkers and certain occupational groups such as forestry workers, conservation workers, deer cullers and farmers are at particular risk of exposure to ticks (and therefore LB).  That said, anyone walking or hiking in the countryside is at risk of biting ticks.  The ticks responsible for LB are generally hard-bodied ticks (Ixodidae).  Ixodes ticks are hosted by a wide range of mammals including deer, sheep and cows, and occasionally birds; their tiny size (less than 2mm unfed) means they can remain undetected for long periods.</p><p>Ixodes ticks are most likely to be found in:</p><blockquote>-  Shady and humid woodland clearings with grass; <br /><br />-  Open grassland, walking paths (especially those bordered by long grasses); <br /><br />-  Wooded and forested areas; <br /><br />-  Vegetation close to lakes and seaside beaches; <br /><br />-  Parkland areas; and <br /><br />-  Open fields and bushes.</blockquote><p>They are present in both urban and rural environments and are active from spring to autumn. Lyme cases tend to appear in Ireland with greater frequency after April, hence the choice of this time of year for Lyme Awareness Week. </p><p>Both the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and Tick Talk Ireland provide guidance on protection against contracting Lyme borelliosis.  The best protection is to prevent tick bites, when walking in grassy, bushy or woodland areas, particularly between May and October:</p><blockquote>-  Arms and leg should be covered; wearing long trousers tucked into socks or boots, and long-sleeved shirts with cuffs fastened is advised.  Shoes or boots should be worn rather than open-toed sandals.<br /><br />-  The use of insect repellent on clothes is recommended, or on limbs if it is not practicable to cover up.  DEET or permethrin (insect repellents) can be used &ndash; advice can be obtained from pharmacies.<br /><br />-  Skin and clothing should be inspected for ticks every three to four hours and children's skin and clothes checked frequently.<br /><br />-  Ticks should be removed as soon as they are seen attached to the skin.  Further advice on tick removal can be obtained from the HPSC website.<br /><br />-  It is not recommended that antibiotics are given to prevent the transmission of Lyme disease following a tick bite.  Only if the area becomes inflamed may treatment be required; and advice should be sought from a doctor.<br /><br />-  People should see their doctor if they develop a rash or become unwell with other symptoms, letting the doctor know of exposure to ticks.</blockquote><p>Further advice can be obtained from the HPSC website () and the HPSC produced a leaflet on &ldquo;Protecting Yourself Against Tick Bites and Lyme Disease  &rdquo; which is available for the public to download.</p><p>In addition, a Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee has been established to look at methods of raising awareness especially in those areas (including recreation areas) where Lyme carrying ticks can be most expected to be found.</p></reply>

The Scheme was voluntary and women did not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition to participating in the Scheme.

Almost &euro;500 million of investment over the six year programme period will facilitate an increase in forest cover by almost 44,000 hectares over the period of the Programme. The level of afforestation grant and premiums, allied to the tax treatment of income from forests provide good incentives for landowners to plant a proportion of their holding. Forests established in the period since 1990 are forecast to remove up to 4.5m tonnes per annum of carbon dioxide over the period 2021&ndash;2030.</p>  <p>  All applications are considered under the afforestation scheme where approvals are subject to minimum productivity thresholds, a public consultation process and adherence to environmental guidelines. However, marginal land is best suited for forestry as it is generally less productive for agriculture. Where farmers are under utilising their land the Department encourages planting on the more marginal fields while maintaining the herd size which is left to graze on the remaining fields. In this way agricultural output is maintained and a valuable asset with environmental benefits is established.  </p>  <p>  The development of marginal land for forestry has been positively impacted by two recent initiatives. The first of these is the introduction of a new approach to land classification system from a forest productivity perspective and the second is a full review and consolidation of environmental requirements for afforestation. Both of these developments should help increase planting on marginal sites in line with good environmental practices.</p></reply>

One of the key objectives of this Act is to set out an approach to carbon neutrality that does not compromise our capacity for food production.  As required by the Act, the National Mitigation Plan (NMP) is currently being prepared and I understand that this will be released shortly for a period of public consultation by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. Agricultural sectorial mitigation measures have been prepared for input to the NMP.</p>  <p>  A range of actions are currently being undertaken to make Irish farming more environmentally sustainable,  including measures under the Rural Development Programme (RDP) which is worth almost &euro;4 billion over seven years.  The Programme is strongly targeted towards environmental benefits, including Knowledge Transfer (KT) programmes, which will bring the latest innovative sustainability research and practices direct to farmers.</p>  <p>  The RDP also includes the Green, Low-Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS), which offers opportunities to support emission reductions and carbon sequestration through various actions such as hedgerow and tree planting, minimum tillage and encouraging the sustainable management of upland peatlands, while at the same time addressing other environmental threats such as biodiversity and water quality.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is directly targeted at the climate emissions of 30,000 beef farmers.  Its objective is to lower the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions by improving the quality and efficiency of the national beef herd.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the establishment and maintenance of landscape features (for example, Ecological Focus Areas and maintenance of permanent pasture under CAP Pillar I) can assist with achieving other environmental objectives which are expected of land, such as water and biodiversity management, in addition to carbon sequestration benefits.</p>  <p>  All of these efforts are being implemented alongside an extensive afforestation scheme.  Afforestation is the main cost effective land based climate mitigation tool available to Ireland, followed by the above mentioned mitigation technologies in agriculture itself.  Climate change mitigation by forests, forest fuels and wood products is one of the principal drivers of the policy to expand forest cover out to mid century. </p></reply>

The International Council of the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) considers sprat to be a data limited stock. In order to try and address that paucity of accurate information in respect of sprat stocks in the waters around Ireland, a three year research project, partially funded by industry, began in October 2014 under the auspices of the Marine Institute in cooperation with Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.</p>  <p>  This project aims to develop an accurate and detailed understanding of the stock structure of sprat around Ireland.  It will determine whether the sprat in Irish coastal waters is one stock or several separate stocks and it aims to increase our understanding of their role in the broader marine ecosystem.  This data will in turn contribute to the ICES assessment of the vulnerability or otherwise of sprat in the waters around Ireland.</p>  <p>  The central objective of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is to ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term through the conservation and sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources and the management of fisheries and fleets exploiting such resources.</p>  <p>   Available scientific information is that sprat in Ireland spawn from January to June with a fishery normally taking place from October to Christmas.  This is a fortuitous situation, allowing some degree of reproductive output as the fishery takes place after the fish have been able to spawn.  The Marine Institute advise that there is no evidence that spawning sprat are or ever have been targeted in Irish fisheries nor is there evidence that sprat actually spawn inshore.  That of course is not to deny that they are easily targeted inshore when they occur there.</p>  <p>  I have also been informed  that the Marine Institute is actively pursuing the addition of sprat to the species covered under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Marine Biodiversity Scheme, in 2017.  This would allow for more intensive data collection to enhance scientific knowledge and underpin any future efforts at management.</p></reply>

Controls have been enhanced at both EU and national level to mitigate the chance of any recurrence.  This is a major reputational issue for the food sector generally and the meat trade in particular.  In the light of this recent history, there are no current legislative proposals within the EU to allow horses be slaughtered for entry into the food chain beyond those which are allowed currently, whether on foot of blood tests or other means.</p>  <p>  In relation specifically to the use of medicinal products in animals destined to enter the food chain it should be noted that this is strictly governed by both EU and national legislation with a requirement to test for these substances as part of our National Residues Control Plan.  Some medications have no maximum permitted residue limits set and thus there is no scientific basis on which meat from animals in which these have been used can be considered safe.  Additionally, where there has been treatment with certain specific equine medications the passport must be endorsed by the veterinarian administering the medication and there is a minimum six month period before the animal can be slaughtered for human consumption.  My Department, based on current scientific knowledge, ensures that EU legislation in this regard is implemented in full and in doing so ensures that there is full consumer confidence in what is permitted to enter the food chain.</p></reply>

This Act prescribes the functions of the Minister and details the requirements, rights and obligations in relation to Felling Licences.</p>  <p>  The Department promotes Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) as a central principle of Irish forest policy, whereby forests are managed to provide economic, social and environmental benefits on a sustainable basis for both current and future generations.  All proposed forestry operations that are licensed must be carried out to ensure the implementation of SFM in Ireland.  There are many factors taken into consideration in the process to determine whether or not a licence will be granted, including compliance with environmental legislation and good forest practice.</p>  <p>  Until recently the majority of clear felling and replanting has been concentrated in the public estate.  A significant portion of the private forest estate, particularly conifers, that were afforested in the 1980s and the early 1990s are now approaching a stage where forest owners are considering the best time to fell.  In some cases forests will be thinned and other case clearfelled depending on a variety of different reasons such as site and market conditions.</p>  <p>  The age at which it is best to harvest a forest depends on many things, including volume production, the risk of windblow, sawmill requirements regarding log sizes and current market prices.  Forest owners may wish to fell early, delay felling or in some cases not fell at all for their own reasons.  In some cases the landowner may apply for a licence to fell early if it is felt that the stand of trees is susceptible to windblow.  Felling licences would normally be granted in such cases.  What is of utmost importance for the Department is to ensure through the felling licence system that the felling and replanting is carried out in a manner that accords with sustainable forest management principles.  A licence application that does not accord with sustainable forest management principles may be refused or have conditions added to the licence to ensure that it would accord with sustainable forest management principles.</p></reply>

This is because the levels of Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and the quotas for Ireland will, as usual, be determined at the Council meeting, due to be held on 12 and 13 December.  This will involve intensive negotiations with Member States and the EU Commission.  The final quotas for all EU member states will not be known until these negotiations are concluded.</p>  <p>  The information we have to hand regarding the 2017 quotas are based on the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposal, which was published on 27 October, as well as a number of updates that issued throughout November.  While a full sustainability impact assessment is underway on these proposals, it is fair to say that a number of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals are very concerning for Ireland.  These include a proposed cut of 68% for Celtic Sea Cod and a 9% cut for our vital prawn fishery.</p>  <p>  There&rsquo;s no doubt the December Council will be challenging and I will be doing my utmost to ensure a positive and balanced package for our fishing sector.</p>  <p>  In relation to the medium-term strategy for the Irish fishing industry, Food Wise 2025, the Report of the 2025 Agri Food Strategy Committee, sets out a cohesive, strategic plan for the development of agri-food and fisheries sector over the next decade.  The Committee has identified that opportunities will arise as a result of significant population growth and greater access to international markets.  It identifies over 400 recommendations to achieve sustainable growth and these will require a concerted and coordinated approach by all stakeholders.  In light of the UK decision to leave the EU, Brexit is now a standard item on the agenda of the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee.</p></reply>

Only the EU Commission may propose changes and any such proposal must be adopted under the co-decision process by the EU Parliament and EU Council.  Member States, in consultation with the Commission, Member States affected and stakeholders are permitted to introduce non-discriminatory measures for the conservation and management of fish stocks within the 12 mile zone subject to compliance with policy and procedures set down in CFP Regulation.  However, access to the 12 mile zone is set down in the CFP Regulation and may not be changed by an individual Member State.</p><p>All foreign fishing vessels, on the north-west coast, are precluded from Ireland&rsquo;s 12 mile fishing zone, other than for transit purposes and all foreign pelagic fishing vessels, including pelagic factory vessels, are also precluded from Ireland&rsquo;s 12 mile fishing zone on  the west coast.  In addition, Irish fishing vessels equal to or greater than 36.58 m (120 ft) in length, are precluded from Ireland&rsquo;s 12 mile zone.  Under the Voisinage arrangement Northern Ireland vessels were given access in respect of the six mile fishing zone.  However, in light of the recent Supreme Court judgement on this matter, access for Northern Ireland vessels is not currently provided for in domestic law.</p><p>Under the Common Fisheries Policy, Council Regulation (EC) No 812/2004 of 26/4/2004 sets down measures concerning incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries.  The Regulation requires that, <i>inter alia</i>, member states design and implement monitoring schemes for incidental catches of cetaceans using observers on board the vessels flying their flag and with an overall length of 15 m or more, for defined fisheries.  The fisheries subject to this requirement includes pelagic fisheries.</p><p>The Regulation does not require that every vessel carries an observer and the Regulation puts the obligation on the Flag Member State (the state in which the vessel is registered) to design and implement the scheme rather than the vessel or the coastal state in whose waters the fishing takes place.  It is a matter of competence for the Flag Member State of the vessel concerned to ensure that observers are onboard where required under their national scheme.</p></reply>

That function is exercised through the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional and Rural Affairs.</p>  <p>  However, my Department has been active in developing agri-environment measures under the Rural Development Programme targeted at farmers in these areas which are designed to  incentivise farming practices and interventions which will benefit the hen harrier.  Farmers with hen-harrier land already have priority access to  GLAS and I have also provided that such farmers will be automatically approved for GLAS Plus, should they be farming sufficient area of habitat.  In this way, Farmers can earn up to &euro;7,000 per annum through a combination of GLAS and GLAS Plus payments.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently in negotiations with the EU Commission regarding a further scheme of assistance by means of a locally led Agri-Environment measure.  This will mean that farmers in areas which have been designated for the hen harrier, and particularly those managing large tracts of hen-harrier habitat, will be able to avail of further assistance over and above what is available to them under GLAS.  In so far as this differs from what was discussed previously, the main difference is that payments under the new scheme will be calculated on the basis of actions and results, rather than calculated on area.  This is a requirement of measures like this brought in under Article 35 of the Rural Development Regulation, which allows much more flexibility on the ground than GLAS.  As a result, the new scheme can actually be designed and developed at local level across all hen harrier areas, working closely with farmers and their representatives on the ground.</p></reply>

There was no National Reserve in 2016 as all available funding had been utilised under the 2015 scheme.  In order to provide for a National Reserve in 2017 funding is required to replenish the Reserve.  The two priority categories are Young Farmer and New Entrants.  EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that funding for the replenishment of the National Reserve may be obtained by means of surrender of entitlements that remain unused by farmers for two consecutive years and by clawback derived following the sale of entitlements without land.  It is envisaged that funding derived from these two sources in 2017 will be very limited.  The Regulations also provide for the option of a linear cut to be applied to all farmers entitlements to replenish the Reserve.</p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to the National Reserve for 2017 will be considered once the position on potential funding has been established.  Consultation between Department officials and the Direct Payments Advisory Committee comprising members of the main farming organisations, agricultural education and farm advisory bodies takes place annually as part of the decision making process for the National Reserve.</p></reply>

This sector is a very important area in the agricultural economy but it has been a challenging year both in terms of market returns and variable weather conditions experienced during the harvest.</p>  <p>  I know the Deputy will be aware that I recently chaired a meeting with the main stakeholders in the tillage sector.  As I said at the time and I wish to repeat here again this meeting provided a platform for the stakeholders to express their views and concerns on the challenges they are facing but equally to discuss the opportunities that lie ahead for the industry.</p>  <p>  At that meeting, I outlined that one of my chief priorities was to provide low-cost more flexible finance and in this regard I was happy to announce on Budget Day, my plans for a &euro;150 million Agri Cash Flow Loan Support Scheme.  This has been developed in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), by leveraging EU and Exchequer funding totalling &euro;25m from my Department, to deliver a total loan fund of &euro;150 million, which will support highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000.  The interest rate applying is 2.95% and the product will be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  Loans to tillage and horticulture farmers will be provided in line with the EU&rsquo;s agriculture State Aid de minimis requirements. </p>  <p>  This is a cash flow support facility, to improve the working capital position of farmers and other viable primary agriculture SMEs.  The loans will be unsecured and are primarily to pay down expensive forms of credit such as merchant credit and other short-term financing facilities such as overdrafts. I recently welcomed the SBCI &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial intermediaries to deliver the Scheme.  The SBCI is targeting that the loans will be available in the market in January 2017.  I am encouraging farmers to consider their cash flow and borrowings situation now and, if appropriate to their circumstances, to be prepared to apply for these loans when they become available.</p>  <p>  The loan scheme is part of a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; in response to income volatility that I announced in the recent Budget, along with additional tax measures and farm payments.  Among the tax measures, I agreed with my colleague the Minister for Finance, for an adjustment to the current &lsquo;Income Averaging&rsquo; system, which will allow for an opt-out in an exceptional year.  This will be available immediately, for this year&rsquo;s tax liability, and this will go some way towards addressing current cash flow concerns. </p>  <p>  As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, I also confirmed that advance payments would be made this year in respect of the Basic Payment and Greening Payment schemes.  Advance payments commenced on the 17th October last, the earliest possible date by which payments can begin under the governing EU Regulations, with balancing payments from the 1st December.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore Balancing Payments commenced on 1 December and to date &euro;1,126 billion has been paid out to 120,926 farmers and payments are ongoing.  I was also pleased to note that the processing of the Areas of Natural Constraints payment scheme is on schedule and payments have already commenced during the third week in September.  It is expected that approx 96,500 will fulfil the scheme eligibility requirements.  My Department will also be opening a measure under the TAMS Scheme specifically for the Tillage Sector.</p>  <p>  While there is no specific funding available for losses due to poor weather conditions I wish to confirm that at Agriculture Council I have repeatedly called for the situation on agricultural markets to be kept under ongoing review, and have said that we should be ready to deploy support measures if the circumstances require it. At the October Council Minister of State Doyle followed this up with a specific request that market support efforts be extended to the cereals sector. </p>  <p>  I also stressed at the recent Tillage stakeholders meeting and I want to restate my view that in this changing landscape we need to take a fresh look at our tillage industry to ensure that it is best positioned to withstand possible future threats and to avail of the new opportunities which may present themselves.</p></reply>

To satisfy the requirements of the EU package, applicants must be engaged in primary agricultural production and must also engage in one of these activities:</p><p>- Application of environmental and climate friendly production methods</p><p>- Implementation of quality schemes or projects aiming at promoting quality and value added</p><p>- Implementation of cooperation projects</p><p>- Training in financial instruments and risk management tools.</p><p>I announced last month that the SBCI had invited financial institutions to take part in the Scheme.  There were a number of applications submitted by the closing date of 25 November and these will now be the subject of a formal approval process. </p><p>The normal lending criteria of the participating financial institutions will also apply.  This is a cash flow support facility to improve the working capital position of viable businesses.  The loans are primarily to pay down expensive forms of credit such as merchant credit and short-term facilities such as overdrafts.  The loans may not be used for:</p><p>- Refinance of existing term loans</p><p>- The refinance of undertakings in financial difficulties (as opposed to cash flow difficulties, as defined in EU guidelines)</p><p>- New investments.</p><p>However, by improving the cash flow position of their business by using this facility, many will be in a better position to negotiate and restructure existing loan commitments. </p><p>More operational details will be available when the Scheme is launched.</p></reply>

The immediate impact of Brexit has been seen in our currency exchange rates and has affected our primary major export market.  Beef production is also up here and in the UK in 2016. </p>  <p>  Looking at the market outlook for the remainder of the year it is estimated that the total number of cattle available for slaughter at export plants for the year 2016 is expected to be between 70,000 and 80,000 greater than 2015.  Figures for the year so far to the week ending 27th November 2016 show that approximately 74,000 extra cattle have been slaughtered so far this year compared to the same period in 2015, an increase of 5.3%.</p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the impact that the expansion in the national dairy herd will have on the Irish beef herd and this matter was discussed by all stakeholders at the most recent meeting of the Beef Roundtable.  The true impact any increase in the number of cattle in the national herd will have on the beef market will be determined by different factors such as slaughter dates which will vary depending on the system of production on different farms.  I have also asked Teagasc to undertake some analysis on the routes to market for the increased number of dairy calves and they have recently completed this work. We will now analyse it with the relevant stakeholders and consider some next steps.</p>  <p>  I am also very conscious of the vital role that live exports play in providing an alternative market outlet for Irish farmers especially in an environment where the number of calf births has increased in recent years.  The recent opening of the Turkish market for live cattle exports has seen over 12,300 cattle make the trip so far, a number which will increase further by the end of 2016.  I also note that exports of live cattle to Libya have recommenced which is a positive and welcome development.  My Department is also currently actively examining the possibilities of bilateral health certificates for the export of cattle to Kazakhstan, Montenegro and for breeding cattle to Morocco.  I remain actively committed to ensuring that Irish beef producers have the option of exporting to as many markets as possible.</p>  <p>  At this moment my Department has no intentions to introduce any scheme to cull Friesian or other dairy breed male cattle.</p></reply>

This management is carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), the State Agency with statutory responsibility for inland fisheries.  </p><p>Management is based on the fact that each of Ireland&rsquo;s 147 salmon rivers, sections of rivers etc., has its own unique stock of salmon which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn and create the next generation of fish exclusive to that river.  Each individual stock is assessed annually and those fisheries meeting their individual conservation limit may be opened to harvest.</p><p>IFI is advised by the Standing Scientific Committee for Salmon (SSC) comprising scientists from IFI, the Marine Institute, the Loughs Agency, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (Northern Ireland) other State bodies and third level institutions. </p><p>The underlying primary consideration is the health of the individual stocks, regardless of geographic location of the home river.  However, fishing opportunities in the wider Shannon Fisheries District were available in 2016.</p><p>The conservation imperative demands that great care must be taken to ensure that the current salmon stocks are not further eroded by mismanagement or inappropriate exploitation, whether that is via angling, commercial fisheries in rivers or through the operation of mixed stock fisheries in estuaries. </p><p>The annual Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations, made pursuant to Sections 69 of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010, provide for the annual management of Ireland's wild salmon and sea trout fishery by IFI.  These Regulations are revised on an annual basis, taking account of advice from IFI, the annual assessment of the SSC and any submissions received from a 30 day public consultation for the following season.  I have already commenced the 30 day public consultation for the 2017 Regulations.</p><p>A copy of the draft regulations, is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.dccae.gov.ie</i>, and is open for public inspection at the offices of the Department in Cavan and also at the offices of Inland Fisheries Ireland.  Any person may submit observations on the draft regulations during the consultation period which concludes on 11 December, 2016.</p></reply>

The main channel and all major sub-catchments were surveyed to assess fish status. A total of 119 sites in 20 tributary streams (Aughnavaud, Burren, Clashganny, Cushina, Douglas, Duiske, Figile, Greese, Lerr, Mountain, Owenass, Pollmounty, Slate, Stradbally, Triogue, Tully, Fushoge, Gowran, Madlin and Monefelim) were electrofished.  A total of 33 sites were surveyed on the main river channel between Rathcoffey near Mountmellick, Co. Laois and St. Mullins, Co. Carlow. </p>  <p>  Dace, salmon, roach, minnow, perch, gudgeon, brown trout, pike, eel, stone loach, roach x bream hybrids, 3-spine stickleback and flounder were recorded during the survey. Roach and dace were dominant in many sections of the main channel, while juvenile salmon were common in the upper reaches. In general brown trout and salmon were the most common fish species in the tributary streams. </p>  <p>  Following the extensive field work a considerable amount of laboratory work and data analysis to verify and collate results was required  in order to prepare and publish a report of the survey works and its outcomes. It is expected that the final report will be available for dissemination at the end of next month.</p></reply>

The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low carbon economy by 2050. Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Act. </p>  <p>  Work is well underway on the development of the first statutory National Mitigation Plan (NMP), required under Section 4 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, 2015. The primary objective of the first NMP is to track implementation of measures already underway, identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce GHG emissions, and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050. The first iteration of the NMP   will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020, but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures can be put in place beyond this date and out to 2030.</p>  <p>  The first NMP is being developed having regard to the low carbon transition vision set out in the National Policy Position, Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the current Effort Sharing Decision No 406/2009/EC, the Paris Agreement, and any likely future EU and international obligations that may arise, including new national targets to be agreed under the 2030 Climate and Energy Package. A key part of developing the NMP has been the preparation of appropriate technical, environmental and economic analysis to inform the decision-making process as to what should be included in the plan. These analyses are still on-going as part of the iterative approach to the development of the plan. </p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to Ireland's response to the global challenge of climate change, this is driven by the Paris Agreement which entered into force on 4th November 2016. Ireland signed the Agreement in April of this year and completed the ratification process last month. The Agreement aims to tackle 95% of global emissions through 188 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). At COP21 in Paris, the Taoiseach announced that Ireland will provide at least &euro;175 million in public funding to climate finance, mainly for adaptation in developing countries by 2020. Ireland is also making a &euro;2m contribution to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) this year with further contributions to follow in 2017 and subsequent years.</p>  <p>  Ireland will contribute to the emission-reduction objectives of the Paris Agreement via the NDC tabled by the EU on behalf of its Member States which commits to 40% reduction in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. The specific details of the contribution to this 40% to be made by each Member State in respect of the non-ETS sector was the subject of a European Commission proposal published in July 2016. The full implications of this proposal from a domestic perspective are currently being examined, with Ireland being ambitious to make a contribution that is technically feasible, cost-effective and fair in terms of sharing the low carbon transition effort among Member States.</p></reply>

This builds on the Energy White Paper published in December 2015 and recognises that solar also has the potential to provide a community dividend, thereby also enhancing citizen participation in Ireland's energy future.  With this in mind, Solar Photovoltaics (PV) is one of the technologies being considered in the context of a new support scheme for renewable electricity generation which is under development. It is widely recognised that solar PV technology is rapidly becoming cost competitive for electricity generation, not only compared with other renewables but also compared with conventional forms of generation.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority. This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  The State Intervention is being managed in accordance with EU state aid rules.</p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. Over the past 5 years, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>It is estimated that up to 70% of premises in Ireland will have access to  commercial high speed broadband services provided by telecommunications operators, while the  remaining 30%, consisting of over 750,00 premises, 100,000 km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland,  will fall within the proposed State led intervention under the National Broadband Plan. Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband from commercial service providers. </p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i><i></i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention.</p><p>There are around 1.6 million premises in the BLUE area of which approximately 1.4 million premises in Ireland can now get high speed broadband.  My Department is actively monitoring the deployment in the BLUE areas.</p><p>On 5 July, I announced that my Department identified that up to an additional 170,000 premises which are currently marked BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map are unlikely to get access to services. My Department is conducting further analysis with a view to identifying and locking down the Map for the remainder of the procurement process. This work will conclude shortly and will be reflected in a further update to the High Speed Broadband Map. </p><p>Direct feedback from consumers continues to be important and if customers cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at broadband@dccae.gov.ie, quoting their address and Eircode and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services. </p><p>My Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. </p><p>The procurement process for the State Intervention aims to identify an entity or entities to build, roll out, operate and deliver high speed broadband of at least 30 Mbps upload and 6 Mbps download speeds to all premises within the intervention area.</p><p>The three bidders in the procurement process have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution under the State Intervention meaning that much higher broadband speeds are possible. In cases where fibre is not viable, the bidders might opt for alternative technologies.</p><p>In parallel with the procurement, and in accordance with commitments in the Programme for Government, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage. I expect the Taskforce to report by end 2016. </p><p>I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band, to provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. </p><p>I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services. </p><p>Together, these initiatives should assist in significantly improving the quality of broadband and mobile phone services across Ireland, putting Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity.</p></reply>

On 5 July the Government selected the Commercial Stimulus Model as the optimum ownership model for the network that will be part-funded by the Exchequer. The Department has completed detailed costings, down to every individual premise in the Intervention Area and, on that basis, has modelled the likely cost of various technologies and ownership models. It would not be appropriate to publish the expected cost of building the network or the likely cost to the State while a major public procurement process is underway. I do not intend therefore to indicate the overall estimated Exchequer funding parameters. Ultimately, the costs will depend on the price that bidder(s) quote in the tender process. </p>  <p>  On 29 September 2015, the Government's 6 year Capital Plan, Building on Recovery, was published. It includes an allocation of &euro;275m for the National Broadband Plan (NBP). This allocation provides the initial stimulus required to deliver the Government's intervention and it is expected that further funding will be available over the lifetime of any contract(s). </p>  <p>  The Department commenced the Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase of the procurement process in July and is engaged in the formal dialogue process with the three qualifying bidders. Following the conclusion of the Dialogue Phase and an invitation to bidders to submit detailed draft proposals, the Department will issue final tender documentation to bidders. When final tenders have been submitted a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy. </p>  <p>  The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of qualified bidders and the complexities that may be encountered during the procurement process. It must be noted that bidders will need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at these stages of the process.</p>  <p>  In preparation for the procurement stage of the process my Department investigated how different technical solutions could be used to deliver high speed broadband. In line with EU State Aid rules, the process must be "technology neutral" and it is not therefore possible to specify what technology should be used to build the network. Notwithstanding, the three bidders in the procurement process have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution under the State Intervention. In cases where fibre is not viable, the bidders might opt for alternative technologies.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to remove barriers to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks. The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn to support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services. </p>  <p>  I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services. </p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in significantly improving the quality of broadband and mobile phone services across Ireland, putting Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity.</p></reply>

The regulation of telecommunications operators is the statutory responsibility of the ComReg, which is independent in its functions. </p>  <p>  Both policy and regulation have contributed substantially to the roll out of high speed broadband networks in the last number of years. ComReg's NGA decisions in 2013 created the framework to drive accelerated investment in high speed broadband, which is now available to approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland. ComReg's multiband spectrum auction in 2012, has also allowed the extensive roll-out of 4G networks with at least one operator now having in excess of 90% population coverage. From a policy perspective the National Broadband Plan is also driving investment, and legislation passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas to allow ESB to use its network to deliver high speed broadband services, has resulted in fibre-to-the-home services being rolled out currently in 17 regional towns. </p>  <p>  In October, I signed Regulations which will allow ComReg to auction spectrum in the 3.6GHz band (Wireless telegraphy (3.6GHz Band Licences) Regulations, 2016 (S.I.  532 of 2016)). The liberalisation of this band is an EU requirement and the adoption of the 3.6 GHz EC Decision is mandatory for all EU Member States, including Ireland. This Decision is service-neutral, technology-neutral and expressly obliges Member States to allow the use of the entire 3.6GHz band fixed and mobile services. The release of spectrum in this band will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and/or fixed wireless services, leading to better quality voice and data services to customers across Ireland. </p>  <p>  ComReg is independent in its functions and I have no role in the process for allocating the spectrum which is now underway. Having regard to the independence of ComReg in the matter and the fact that a process is underway, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time. I would note however that the allocation process followed extensive public consultation by ComReg over almost a two year period. I have no reason to believe that the process being currently undertaken by ComReg will not result in the fair allocation of any future spectrum assignment and I expect the outcome of the process to provide a level of certainty and transparency for all stakeholders. A policy direction is neither necessary nor appropriate in the circumstances.</p>  <p>  Investment decisions by the commercial telecommunications networks providers in the electronic communications market, including investment decisions on the roll-out of Next Generation Access (NGA) are taken purely on commercial grounds by each network operator, having regard to the predicted investment cost and the anticipated revenue returns from any such investment. The State can only intervene in this market in cases of clear market failure. In this regard the National Broadband Plan aims to bring competitively priced quality services to rural areas, through a State intervention to build a new high speed broadband network. It is envisaged that this network will offer wholesale services to multiple retailers, who can in turn offer competitive, affordable and high speed broadband to users. </p>  <p>  The Plan aims to deliver high speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland. The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p>  <p>  The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll out a new high speed broadband network in the State Intervention Area comprising over 750,000 premises in Ireland, covering 100,000 km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. The procurement process is technology neutral. All three bidders involved in the competitive dialogue process are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the&ndash;home network solution to connect rural Ireland. Wireless technology may also play a role in part of the overall solution. It is a matter for the bidders in the process to put forward the technologies they believe are most appropriate to meet the NBP objectives.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I do not propose, nor do I see any necessity, to issue any policy direction to ComReg in this regard.</p></reply>

This role includes the allocation of radio spectrum, the award of spectrum licences and the associated application of terms and conditions and obligations. ComReg is independent in the exercise of this spectrum management function.  In October, I signed Regulations which will allow ComReg to allocate spectrum in the 3.6GHz band. The allocation will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. The liberalisation of this band is in accordance with EU rules, and will allow the band to be used for a combination of mobile and wireless services, providing better quality voice and data services to customers across Ireland. </p>  <p>  I have no role or function in the delivery of the allocation process, which is a matter for ComReg. I am aware that ComReg has recently concluded its consultation process on the award process for the 3.6GHz spectrum band, including from parties who may wish to provide fixed broadband services and others who may see this band as an opportunity to provide new services. ComReg has considered the views of all respondents and its decisions on this band must accord with its own statutory functions, objectives powers and duties. </p>  <p>  The aim of the National Broadband Plan is to bring competitively priced quality services to rural areas, through a State intervention to build a new high speed broadband network.

It is however possible that wireless technology may be part of the solutions proposed and this is a matter for bidders. Furthermore, as the network to be built will offer wholesale services, on an open-access basis, it will be open to existing wireless retailers to offer services on the new network. Wireless operators can also connect their technologies to the network if they can meet the high speed broadband specifications set out in the Plan, which includes a minimum of 30 Mbps download speed and 6 Mbps upload speed.</p></reply>

The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter transport target also being legally binding. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has calculated that 25.3% of electricity, 6.5% of heat and 5.7% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2015. The SEAI analysis also shows that 9.1% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirements in 2015 were met from renewable sources and that this avoided &euro;286 million of fossil fuel imports.</p>  <p>  The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and although good progress towards the target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging. My Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and a new Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) Scheme, designed to assist us meeting our RES-E and RES-H targets. The introduction of any new scheme - including the overall costs and technologies to be supported - will be subject to Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission. </p>  <p>  In the transport sector, Ireland aims to meet its renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.  Further increases to the obligation rate in the Biofuels Obligation Scheme will take effect from 1 January 2017 when the rate will increase to 8% by volume. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-06a.1151.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120600079#WRY03500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 442, 445, 446 and 451 together.</p><p>Climate-action related work is progressing in the context of:</p><p>- the high-level National Policy Position (2014) to pursue the transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050;</p><p>- the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, which provides for the development and submission to Government of national mitigation plans and national adaptation frameworks in order to pursue the national transition objective; and</p><p>- our international and EU obligations.</p><p>In relation to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction, Ireland has a target for each year between 2013 and 2020 under the 2009 EU Effort Sharing Decision (ESD). For the year 2020, the target set is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. This is  the most demanding 2020 target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg. The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year. The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005. </p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reported that emissions for 2015 are estimated at 59.84 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent, which is 3.7% higher than emissions in 2014. According to the EPA, these figures indicate that Ireland will be in compliance with its 2015 annual limit set under the ESD. However, the Agency has cautioned that the 2015 emissions data suggests that achievement of our long-term mitigation goals will be difficult. Moreover, the most recent EPA projections (March 2016) indicate that emissions for 2020 could be in the range of 6% to 11% below 2005 levels depending on whether or not additional policies and measures, beyond those already in place by the end of 2014, are implemented. </p><p>At international level, Ireland will contribute to the 2015 Paris Agreement via the Nationally Determined Contribution tabled by the EU in March 2015 on behalf of Member States, which commits to at least a 40% reduction in EU-wide emissions by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels). This is based on reductions in the ETS and non-ETS sectors of 43% and 30% respectively. The specific details of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to this overall EU 30% reduction in the non-ETS sector, as well as the contributions to be made by other Member States, are the subject of negotiations between the EU and Member States in the context of the European Commission Effort Sharing Regulation<b></b>Proposal, which was published on the 20 July 2016. The outcome of these deliberations will determine Ireland&rsquo;s contribution, which needs to reflect a level of ambition that is technically feasible, cost-effective and fair, to the overall EU 2030 effort.</p><p>In terms of putting in place the first of a series of plans to manage our transition to a low carbon economy and to meet our international and EU targets, a national mitigation plan will be submitted to Government for approval by June 2017 in accordance with the 2015 Act. The preparation of the plan is designed to be a <i>&lsquo;whole-of-government&rsquo;</i>approach to tackle emissions and each Minister with responsibility for the largest emitting sectors has been requested by Government to develop sectorial mitigation measures. The primary objective of the mitigation plan, when finalised, will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional actions in the longer term to reduce emissions and progress the overall transition agenda to 2050. In advance of the statutory consultation on a draft mitigation plan, which will take place in Spring 2017, I intend to publish a document shortly for an initial non-statutory public consultation. The outcomes of the consultations will inform the preparation of the final National Mitigation Plan. </p><p>Mirroring the mitigation effort, the 2015 Act also provides for the making and submission to Government of iterative national adaptation frameworks which will specify the national strategy for the application of adaptation measures in different sectors, and by local authorities, in order to reduce the vulnerability of the State to the negative effects of climate change and to exploit any beneficial opportunities that may arise. Work is progressing in relation to the first national framework, which must be submitted to Government for approval no later than 10 December 2017. </p><p>While the extent of the challenge presented by climate change, and the scale of the transformation required if Ireland is to move to a low carbon and climate resilient economy, are evident, there is a clear and long-term global and national climate change policy direction in place, supported by a well-defined national statutory framework. Work is progressing to convert this policy ambition into actions to bring about the transformation required if we are to decarbonise our economy and build resilience to the inevitable impacts of global warming.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority. This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.</p><p>My Department is now in the formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network throughout the State Intervention Area.</p><p>The procurement process for the State Intervention aims to identify an entity or entities to build, roll out, operate and deliver high speed broadband of at least 30 Megabits per second upload and 6 Megabits per second download speeds to all premises within the intervention area. The procurement process also requires that the solution be future proofed. This is important if we are to find a solution which works for the 25 years of the contract.</p><p>The three bidders in the procurement process have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution for rural Ireland under the National Broadband plan intervention meaning that much higher broadband speeds of up to 1,000 Mbps may be achievable.</p><p>Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded. The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process. The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids. In addition, bidders need adequate time to get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process. It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed. I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process. I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. </p><p>During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the State Intervention. As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage. I expect to publish the report of the Taskforce in the coming weeks.</p><p>I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed in early 2017 to allocate spectrum in the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band. This will provide an 86% increase in total  spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the removal of barriers to assist in commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.</p><p>These initiatives should assist in significantly improving the quality of broadband and mobile phone services across Ireland, putting Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity.</p></reply>

ComReg monitors compliance in this regard by means of biannual drive tests.  However, given ComReg&rsquo;s independence, I have no statutory function in the matter of auditing mobile coverage.</p>  <p>  I am critically aware of the frustration currently being experienced across Ireland, where mobile networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  Mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  The rate of demand for data services has however increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally. </p>  <p>  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government, a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  In July, I established the task force, together with Minister Humphreys, which aims to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services.  The Terms of Reference of the task force state that it will identify and recommend practical actions that can be taken to improve mobile reception and broadband access.  The task force and its various subgroups has already met approximately 20 times, with a number of helpful initiatives emerging in the areas of planning, local authority engagement, and consumer information and engagement. </p>  <p>  The task force involves Government Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with ComReg and telecoms operators.  I anticipate that we will bring a report later this month, on foot of its work.  This report will set out specific timelines for the delivery of the recommendations and actions.</p>  <p>  Under the Programme for Government, Minister Humphreys has also established two regional action groups to work with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies in helping accelerate the roll-out of broadband and mobile services at local level. </p>  <p>  In addition, I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in my Department's estimates for 2017 I have secured an &euro;8m provision for RT&Eacute; to allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum, to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage. The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.  </p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland, and particularly in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  In parallel, the National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland, through private investment and a State intervention in areas where commercial investment have not been fully demonstrated.  The procurement process is underway and the three bidders in the process have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution for rural Ireland.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is ongoing, with a view to putting in place contract(s) that will deliver the NBP network and put Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity.</p></reply>

These grants are in addition to tax incentives such as the Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) reliefs of up to &euro;5,000, which apply to EVs and Accelerated Capital Allowances (ACA), which allows companies to offset the cost of investment in qualifying technologies including EVs.  Budget 2017 extended the relief from VRT on EVs for a further 5 year period and on Hybrid vehicles for 2 years.  The purchase of 1,702 new EVs has been supported since the Grant Scheme commenced. Of these, 615 have been grant aided to date this year which is an increase from 2015 when 555 were grant aided over the full year.</p>  <p>  The roll-out of the charging infrastructure is an operational matter for the ESB and I do not have any function in this regard.  I am aware, however, that the ESB, through its ecars programme, has been rolling out both publicly accessible charging infrastructure and domestic charge points for electric vehicles. I am advised that almost 900 public charge-points have now been installed nationally including 79 DC fast chargers, most of which have been installed mainly on the inter-urban roads. The location of these charge-points is available on the &lsquo;ecars&rsquo; section of the ESB&rsquo;s website at www.esb.ie.  In addition, I understand that ESB ecars has installed over 1900 charge-points in domestic and commercial premises.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government, my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport are establishing and will co-Chair a Low Emissions Vehicles Task Force involving relevant Government Departments and agencies.  The first meeting is scheduled for later this month.  A key task will be to examine as a matter of priority what further actions are necessary to further stimulate EV sales and other low emission vehicles to 2020 and beyond.  In addition, the Task Force will look at actions to ensure sufficient and effective charging infrastructure exists as the EV fleet develops.</p></reply>

The procurement process also requires that the solution be future proofed, this is important if we are to find a solution which works for the 25 years of the contract.  </p><p>The three bidders in the procurement process have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution for rural Ireland under the National Broadband plan intervention meaning that much higher broadband speeds of up to 1000 Megabits per second may be achievable.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband task force with Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.  I expect the task force to report by end 2016. </p><p>I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, to provide an 86% increase in total  spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.  </p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the removal of barriers to assist in commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.</p><p>These initiatives should assist in significantly improving the quality of broadband and mobile phone services across Ireland, putting Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity.</p></reply>

Using Eircodes helps the National Ambulance Service (NAS) provide speedier access to care.  The NAS integrated Eircodes into their Computer Aided Dispatch system (CAD) in February 2016.  This means that callers to the ambulance service can give the patient&rsquo;s Eircode, which is validated in the CAD system. The call taker can then locate the patient&rsquo;s property and direct the nearest available ambulance to the correct location.</p>  <p>  Ambulance emergency requests often come from isolated rural locations. NAS considers the Eircode information to be very important in the rapid identification of these rural addresses &ndash; in particular, responding to calls from any of the 35% non-unique addresses in the state which caused significant operational challenges in the past.  On foot of the campaign, call takers in the National Ambulance Service noticed a big improvement in the elderly population knowing and keeping their Eircode close to the phone.</p>  <p>  While there is no requirement to reference the Department in a public service announcement, my Department did approve the public awareness campaign.</p>  <p>  As stated in the reply to Question No [38884/16] Eircode employ rigorous quality assurance and validation check processes on the assignment of all Eircodes to each postal address and its corresponding geo-location.</p></reply>

As part of the overall reform package, my Department has been liaising with other stakeholders, including the Coach Tourism and Transport of Ireland, with a view to agreeing the most appropriate mechanism and institutional arrangements to effect this change, as well as other related reforms to the bus regulatory regime.

While the application of the exemption from charges is at the discretion of the State concerned, the policy and general practice at international level is to exempt such flights from charges.  Ireland, in common with the vast majority of Eurocontrol's 41 member states, subscribes to this practice.  The exemption does not cover terminal charges such as landing fees consequently no reimbursement occurs for these charges. </p><p>The total amount paid to the IAA in 2015  in respect of exempt services was &euro;2.5 million.  This amount includes the cost of US military and State flights and exempt flights from other States.

The Regulations clearly state that the service provider must ensure that their staff meet this standard.  </p>  <p>  This section of the regulations took effect on 30th June 2016 for services registering after that date and for all other services it will take effect on 31st December 2016.  </p>  <p>  My Department introduced this regulatory change following many years consultation with the sector.  Mindful of the challenge that it would present to the sector, my Department introduced the following supportive measures:</p>  <p>  - Learner Funds to provide sector workers with an opportunity to upskill to a Level 5 qualification.</p>  <p>  - The Regulations provide an exemption for certain existing childcare staff who intend to retire from the sector in the near future, do not hold the minimum qualification and who do not wish to undertake a course of training at this stage.  The option to apply for an exemption, which was first publicised through the City/County Childcare Committees in 2014 applies up to September 2021.  The Regulations stipulate that persons seeking to avail of this exemption must, by 30th June 2016, have signed the necessary declaration and be in possession of a letter from the Minister confirming that the exemption had been granted.</p>  <p>  - A qualifications assessment procedure, put in place by DCYA in the latter half of 2015, allows for applications to be made for individual qualifications assessment.  This is conducted by DCYA in consultation with the Early Years Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills, and is available to anyone who applies.  Each application is dealt with on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  Staff who have completed a relevant award at NFQ Level  5 or above by the 31st of December, or who were granted an exemption before the 30th June 2016, will meet the regulatory standard.  Staff who are currently undergoing education to achieve a Level 5 award will not meet the regulatory standard until that award has been achieved.  </p></reply>
