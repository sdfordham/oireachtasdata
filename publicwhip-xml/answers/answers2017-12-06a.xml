Indeed, this has received strong legislative endorsement through the provisions of the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act of 2004 which provides for the inclusive education of pupils with special educational needs.</p><p>This has required a very substantial expansion in both special education teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). </p><p>In total, the number of SNAs available is currently 13,990, which represents an increase of over 32% since 2011, when 10,575 posts were available. </p><p>There are now over 34,000 children receiving the support of SNAs.  Almost 60% of these children are supported to participate in mainstream schools. We have also more than doubled the number of special classes, where 20% of the children are supported, while the remainder are supported in special schools.  </p><p>SNA support is provided to ensure that all pupils who have care needs can participate in education, including pupils attending special schools, or special classes, or who may be attending mainstream education and need additional support.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is an independent body which has responsibility for allocating SNA support to schools, in accordance with the criteria set out in my Departments Circular DES 30/2014.  </p><p>The NCSE decides how much SNA support is required in each school and makes allocations to schools.</p><p>The NCSE are carrying out a comprehensive assessment of the SNA scheme aimed at providing better outcomes for students and ensuring we are making the best additional investment for children with special educational needs. This Government is committed to ensuring the best possible results for the children and students in this area. This process is the best way to deliver on that.</p><p>I have therefore asked the NCSE to conduct a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and this review is due to be completed early next year.</p></reply>

We are successfully filling the posts that we are making available.</p>  <p>  The latest figures obtained by my Department from the higher education institutions offering post graduate initial teacher education programmes indicate that there are currently 21 students studying to qualify as teachers of Physics in these programmes.  In addition, the Deputy should note that teachers of physics can qualify through a number of undergraduate initial teacher education programmes. Data on the numbers of students currently taking physics in these programmes is not readily available.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note also that, according to my Department&rsquo;s records, approximately 540 schools are offering Physics as a leaving certificate subject in 2017 and there are 1,058 post primary teachers in total registered with the Teaching Council with Physics as their first subject. 40 teachers were registered for the first time by the Teaching Council as qualified to teach Physics as their first subject in 2017.</p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the STEM Strategy I am determined to deliver increased teacher supply in key priority areas.  My officials are gathering and analysing baseline data.  We are also assessing specific policy initiatives which can accelerate supply in critical areas.  This would include measures to deliver a  higher proportion of those entering initial teacher education at undergraduate or masters level in the priority areas; to upgrade the skills of existing teachers; to identify possible sources of qualified persons who are not now teaching.</p></reply>

The decision by the Congregation of Christian Brothers to dispose of land owned by the Congregation is a matter for the Brothers.</p>  <p>  In July 2017, the Congregation advised my Department in writing that the lands concerned were sold and that the Congregation had signed a legally binding contract with the purchasers and the Congregation could not reverse this transaction.</p>  <p>  My Department understands that the Board of Management or members of the Board of Management may be taking legal proceedings against the Congregation of Christian Brothers relating to the sale of the fields.</p></reply>

The independent review of the Fund was conducted by RSM UK Consultants as part of the implementation of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-19. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the review was to evaluate the role of the Fund in supporting access and participation in higher education by students with disabilities. The overall finding of the review is that this Fund has played and continues to play a vital role in supporting the provision of services and supports enabling the participation of students with disabilities in higher and further education.  </p>  <p>  This review finds that, since 2008, over &euro;70 million has been allocated through the Fund thus enabling the participation of over 38,000 students with disabilities in further and higher education. The number of students supported by the Fund has grown from 3,800 in 2008 to almost 10,500 last year. &euro;9.6 million will be allocated through the Fund in 2017.</p>  <p>  The review makes fourteen recommendations including the need for a more robust model of allocation; the extension of the Fund to part-time students and, in the longer term, the transfer of the further education element of the Fund from the HEA to Solas.</p>  <p>  A HEA implementation group will be established in the first quarter of 2018 to progress these recommendations.  The implementation of the recommendations will lead to improvements in the management and allocation of the Fund and support more students with disabilities in realising their potential through further and higher education.</p></reply>

These will include the Action Plan for Education, Better Outcomes Brighter Futures and targeted new initiatives that have both local and national benefits for citizens.</p><p>In September 2016, I launched the first Action Plan for Education, covering the period 2016-2019. This sets out our ambition to make the Irish education and training service the best in Europe by 2026. </p><p>The Action Planning process recognises that our success will be achieved by the implementation of hundreds of actions across the sector in its entirety. </p><p>The Action Plan 2016-2019 was the beginning of an annual process. More detailed actions, with quarterly delivery dates, are identified in updated annual plans. These Plans are based on the original five high-level goals:</p><p>1. Improve the learning experience and the success of learners</p><p>2. Improve the progress of learners at risk of educational disadvantage or learners with special educational needs</p><p>3. Help those delivering education services to continually improve</p><p>4. Build stronger bridges between education and the wider community</p><p>5. Improve national planning and support services</p><p>Progress is monitored through the publication of End of Year Review reports and quarterly progress reports. All of these are available on the Department&rsquo;s website (www.education.ie) and show the extent to which we are delivering what we said we would. They also help to ensure that attention is focused on areas where progress has not been as expected, in order to drive further change. </p><p>In addition, we are currently working on developing a range of indicators, based on national and international benchmarks, to enhance our monitoring arrangements.</p><p>Cumulatively, the Action Plans and monitoring process will ensure that we achieve our ambition of having the best education and training services in Europe by 2026.</p></reply>

This Framework will set out the objectives which Government is setting for our Higher Education Institutions for the period 2018 &ndash; 2020, together with the high level targets to be achieved in this period. This very ambitious programme of work will require a close alignment between the various elements which together form the higher education system in Ireland.</p></reply>

Subject to meeting these minimum thresholds, schools have flexibility in allocating time to subjects. </p>  <p>  Most subjects in the new Framework for Junior Cycle will require a minimum of 200 hours of timetabled student engagement over three years, that includes teaching, learning and assessment activity. This minimum equates to three forty-minute class periods per week. English, Irish and Mathematics will each require a minimum of 240 hours of timetabled student engagement. It is anticipated that schools will typically allocate 4 to 5 forty-minute class periods per week for these subjects. 100 hours of timetabled student engagement are required for each Junior Cycle short course.</p>  <p>  There is currently no minimum or maximum time requirement for the various Junior Certificate subjects. </p>  <p>  In addition, schools from September of this year offer a Junior Cycle Well-being programme to students, which begins with 300 hours of timetabled engagement in 2017 and will build up to 400 hours by 2020 as the new Junior Cycle is implemented fully in schools. I am satisfied that the timetable requirement for the Well-being programme will not impact negatively on the time available for other subjects. This is because well-being is built on a number of pillars, which include subjects already offered, including PE, SPHE and CSPE. Learning in other subjects and short courses that are clearly linked to learning in Well-being can also be included in this time allocation.</p></reply>

This is a substantial allocation of hours for a school of this size. </p><p>Whereas the profiled allocation had indicated a need of 102.50 hours for this school, based on its school profile and size, and relative to the profiled needs of all other schools, the school was allocated 115.25 hours, which was equivalent to the allocation the school received in 2016/17. </p><p>There has therefore been no reduction or cut to the allocation of special educational needs teaching support for this school and no cut to the allocation in this school.</p><p>Under the new allocation model, schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p><p>Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.</p><p>It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model. By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations. </p><p>Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p><p>In March of this year, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published details of an appeal process for schools. </p><p>Schools were advised that this appeal would consider circumstances where schools considered that their school profile was calculated incorrectly, using the data set out in DES Circulars 0013 and 0014 of 2017. An appeal could be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. </p><p>Schools who wished to submit an appeal on this basis were asked to do so by March 31st 2017. These appeals have been processed and this appeal process has now concluded. </p><p>A second process has been put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in DES Circular 17/2017 (Primary School Staffing Schedule) and DES 10,11,12/2017 (Post Primary School Staffing Schedule).</p><p>Schools who qualified of additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualified for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>Schools were also advised that it acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>The NCSE has now published details of how schools can seek a review of their allocations, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>Should a school consider they fulfil the criteria for a review on the grounds of exceptional circumstances, they may request such a review at: </p><p><i></i></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-12-06a.70.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017120600071#WRC03800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 84 together.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to have been in a position to significantly expand the recruitment of teachers at primary and post primary levels. Some 2,300 new teachers were recruited in 2016-2017 and 2,900 are being recruited in 2017-2018. The figure of 2,900 is 21% more than the number announced in budget 2017, so we have in fact been able to recruit more new teachers than we have announced. All of the 2016-2017 posts have been successfully filled and the process for filling the additional posts in the current year is almost complete. We are successfully filling the posts that we are making available.</p>  <p>  However, I am aware that some schools have reported difficulties in recruiting substitute teachers at primary level and in certain subjects at post primary level, and I am committed to examining all possible means of addressing these issues.</p>  <p>  Regarding issues around finding substitute teachers at primary level, there are strong career opportunities in teaching and the numbers of permanent full-time positions are currently increasing at over 1,000 per year in 2016/2017 and 2017/2018. Due to the additional permanent positions being created, young teachers have greater opportunities to take on permanent positions, and as a result some schools may be experiencing issues in hiring teachers to fill temporary or substitute roles, which arise in schools for a number of reasons, including covering sick leave and career breaks.</p>  <p>  I have also undertaken measures to increase the pool of teachers available to schools in particular to fill short term vacancies. My Department informed all teachers retiring in 2017 that in order to remain eligible for employment in a state funded teaching post for a period of more than five consecutive days or to supervise the State examinations, a teacher must maintain his/her registration with the Teaching Council. My Department also increased the limits for employment while on career break at primary level to a maximum of 90 days in a school year. In addition, as a longer term measure, under my Department&rsquo;s Gaeltacht Policy, an RFT is currently being developed for a new Irish-medium B.Ed. (primary teaching) ITE programme.</p>  <p>  At post primary level I have taken certain initiatives to address some of the supply pressures in particular subject areas. These include, as part of the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education, increasing from 2018/19 the number of places available on the existing Irish medium post primary initial teacher education programme in NUIG, to which I have granted two additional posts from September 2017. This measure will strengthen the Irish-language proficiency of newly qualified teachers across a range of subjects and, it is anticipated, also increase the supply of Irish language teachers. I have also increased from 85 to 101 the number of students admitted to St Angela&rsquo;s, Sligo to follow the Home Economics ITE programme in the current year, with further expansions in future years being considered.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the report of the Technical Working Group on teacher supply, &lsquo;Striking the Balance&rsquo; which, while focussing on the development of a model of primary teacher supply, outlined the work which will be required to establish a long term model of post-primary teacher supply.  The Teaching Council, which has an advisory role in this matter, recently convened a consultative forum on teacher supply with relevant stakeholders with the aim of producing teacher supply proposals and I look forward to seeing the report from this forum which will further inform our thinking in this matter. </p>  <p>  I am reviewing a number of options in order to incentivise students to undertake the two year Professional Masters in Education, including financial incentives.  Specifically, in the recently launched STEM and Foreign Languages in Education Implementation Plans, my Department has committed to undertake baseline data collection and analysis to inform policy on the supply of STEM and foreign language teachers and to develop policy actions to support the supply of teachers of these subjects.</p></reply>

In this context, the strengthening and deepening of co-operation in education to achieve effective and efficient delivery of educational services for the benefit of all the people of this island remains a primary goal.  </p>  <p>  Work to date has included developing, within the framework of the North-South Ministerial Council, common policies in the designated areas of special education needs, educational underachievement, teacher mobility and school, youth and teacher exchanges. </p>  <p>  Departments North and South have also been mandated to explore the potential for further areas of co-operation in education not within the existing NSMC framework. To that end there has been significant engagement and cooperation at Ministerial and official levels on higher education and skills issues in recent years covering higher and further education strategies and policies; legislative and institutional reform; funding of higher and further education; access/student mobility issues; cross-border student flows; research; and possible collaboration on EU funding programmes.</p>  <p>  At institutional level, there is a broad range of cross-border collaboration particularly in research and innovation, which has been supported by EU funding programmes and national research funding programmes in Ireland. I will work to support the continuation of this valuable collaboration.</p>  <p>  A key challenge for future North-South engagement will be how we manage the impacts of Brexit on our respective education systems in such areas as cross-border access to education; teacher and academic mobility and future collaboration on the island in research and innovation programmes. </p>  <p>  In this context consultation is fundamental to my approach and I had already met and discussed these issues with the then Northern Ireland Minister for Education and the UK Secretary of State for Education. In addition my Department met with UK and Northern Ireland officials on a bi-lateral basis earlier this year and ongoing contacts are being maintained with NI and UK officials. </p>  <p>  It is my aspiration that, with an eventual agreement in Northern Ireland on the restoration of the power-sharing executive, we can regain the momentum on North-South cooperation in higher and further education.</p></reply>

We are successfully filling the posts that we are making available.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, last week I launched a STEM Policy Statement and Implementation Plan, which aims to make Ireland the best in Europe in STEM by 2026. This Policy Statement focusses on the many strengths in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education in Ireland while providing a roadmap to address the areas for development. </p>  <p>  Some schools have reported shortages in recruiting teachers in specific subjects at post primary level, including in STEM. The reasons for this are complex. Part of the reason is due to an imbalance in the availability of teachers in certain subjects &ndash; for example a large proportion of teachers training as Geography teachers and a small proportion choosing to train in subjects such as Physics. </p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the STEM Strategy I am determined to deliver increased teacher supply in key priority areas.  My officials are gathering and analysing baseline data.  We are also assessing specific policy initiatives which can accelerate supply in critical areas.  This would include measures to deliver a higher proportion of those entering initial teacher education at undergraduate or masters level in the priority areas; to upgrade the skills of existing teachers; to identify possible sources of qualified persons who are not now teaching.</p></reply>

In addition, children explore how to care for and respect animals and how to take action to protect their environment. Through the science curriculum, children also come to recognise that people, plants and animals depend on each other.</p>  <p>  In the course of their work, teachers in different disciplines use various support materials produced by bodies such as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Compassion in World Farming and other national Animal Welfare Charities who provide either free primary school programmes to schools or facilitate educational visits from schools.  I currently have no plans to introduce a separate module on animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.</p></reply>

To date 9 new apprenticeship programmes are operational and registrations across these schemes this year currently stand at 302. Two further programmes in ICT have been validated by Quality and Qualifications Ireland and are scheduled for their first intake of apprentices early in 2018. </p>  <p>  We have a strong pipeline of apprenticeships in development the meet the Action Plan targets for future years. In addition, the two programmes with a second intake in 2017 both showed increased registrations over their year one figures.  This pattern of the initiating programmes with smaller numbers and building registrations in subsequent years is likely to continue and provides a solid basis to meet registration targets as the programme base grows.</p>  <p>Earlier this year a second call for apprenticeship proposals issued to industry and education and training providers in order to refresh the pipeline of apprenticeships in development already established through the first call.  The second call closed on the 1st   September with 77 proposals received from a range of sectors and occupations. Since the call closed the Council has been assessing the proposals received and the results of the second call will be published shortly. </p>  <p>  In addition, a digital campaign to promote apprenticeship is now underway with a dedicated Twitter feed #Generation Apprenticeship, a new apprenticeship website www.apprenticeship.ie, an Apprenticeship Ireland Facebook page and a LinkedIn page. The campaign is designed to promote the value of the apprenticeship model to both employers and to prospective apprentices.</p></reply>

I also believe that it is unfair that some parents, who might otherwise not do so, feel pressure to baptise their children in order to gain admission to their local school.</p>  <p>This is why I ran a public consultation process from 24th January to 20th   March 2017 on this matter, to which I received almost 1,000 submissions. I also held a public forum last May on the role of Religion in Primary School Admissions which was attended by 121 individuals. </p>  <p>  I have outlined my intention to make changes in the first instance in respect of the primary school system. It was noted in the consultation paper that any changes need only apply in respect of oversubscribed schools (approximately 20% of schools). In respect of all other schools, the practice is to admit all applicants. This will become law following the enactment of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill &ndash; when schools will be required to admit every child who applies.</p>  <p>  Last June during Committee Stage debate on the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill I advised that my preference is to make changes to the Equal Status Act, 2000 that would remove the capacity for state-funded denominational primary schools, where they are oversubscribed, to use religion as a criteria in admissions process. In my proposal I also made it clear that I was anxious to deal with the position of minority religions. </p>  <p>  My officials are currently engaging with the Office of the Attorney General on the development of legislative proposals on this matter which I hope to bring forward to Government for approval shortly.</p></reply>

These actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying, including cyberbullying, are addressed. </p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the Action Plan anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools, which include a specific reference to cyberbullying, were published at the beginning of the 2013/14 school year. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils and in dealing with any negative impact within school of bullying behaviour that occurs elsewhere. They include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.</p>  <p>  My Department has also supported the development of anti-bullying training materials for parents, teachers and Boards of Management and is supporting a number of anti-bullying initiatives aimed at young people such as the Stand Up! Against Homophobic and Transphobic bullying campaign, organised by BeLonG To, and the Europe-wide initiative, Safer Internet Day.  In addition, a new National Anti-Bullying website, www.tacklebullying.ie, has been launched to provide a single point of information and support for young people, parents and teachers affected by bullying. </p>  <p>  Awareness on internet safety for schools is carried out by the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST- Technology in Education) in partnership with the Safer Internet Ireland Project. Webwise, an internet safety initiative established by the PDST Technology Team, promotes the autonomous, effective, and safer use of the internet by young people through a sustained information and awareness strategy targeting parents, teachers, and children themselves with consistent and relevant messages including guidance on acceptable usage in schools.  Since 2013 new resources to tackle cyberbullying &ldquo;UP2US&rdquo;, &ldquo;My Selfie and the wider world&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lockers&rdquo; have been launched through Webwise. On Safer Internet Day 2017 Webwise launched a new online Parenting Hub: Webwise Parents. The PDST Technology Team also develop and disseminate resources that help teachers integrate internet safety into teaching and learning in their schools.</p>  <p>  Internet safety issues are also covered in the curriculum. One of the statements of learning identified in the Junior Cycle is being responsible, safe and ethical in using digital technology. In addition, the NCCA has developed a Junior Cycle short course on Digital Media Literacy. This short course aims to extend and refine students&rsquo; ability to use digital technology, communication tools, and the internet creatively, critically and safely, in support of their development, learning and capacity to participate effectively in social and community life.</p></reply>

The SEC has informed me that the openness and transparency of the Leaving Certificate examination place it among the most transparent globally, with published marking schemes, marked scripts made available for viewing by candidates prior to deciding on an appeal and an accessible multi-stage appeals process. Leaving Certificate examinations are marked in accordance with marking schemes which are published by the SEC following the marking of candidates&rsquo; work. Examiners are drawn from among the subject experts who apply for the positions. They are fully trained in the application of the marking scheme at a two-day training and standardising conference before they commence to mark candidates&rsquo; work. Examiners&rsquo; work is subject to ongoing review by more experienced examiners throughout the marking process and they must follow the advice of these more experienced examiners if any deviation from the marking scheme and national standard is identified.</p>  <p>  In a system as large as the Leaving Certificate in which the SEC generates 400,000 individual grades based on 900,000 items of candidates&rsquo; work, the SEC fully acknowledges that examiner error can happen. For this reason, the SEC has a robust and transparent appeals process in place. Before deciding whether to appeal a result, candidates, accompanied by a person of their choosing (generally their teacher in the subject), are encouraged to view their marked scripts. They are provided with the marking schemes used by the examiners which assists the candidate to identify if an error in marking has occurred, and candidates are invited to highlight any such errors when appealing. In the course of remarking the full script, the appeal examiner is also obliged to address and provide a written response to the points raised by candidates in this way. The appeal marking is undertaken by a different examiner to the earlier, Summer, marking and is subject to rigorous overview by more experienced examiners (again, different personnel to those involved in the Summer marking). Ultimately, candidates who continue to be unhappy with how their appeal has been processed by the SEC can have their case referred to a panel of Independent Appeal Scrutineers and, if they choose to raise specific issues of concern regarding the application of the marking scheme to their work, these must be fully addressed and answered by the Chief Examiner for the subject.</p>  <p>  The SEC issues almost 400,000 Leaving Certificate grades each year. In recent years the number of individual subject appeals has generally been around 9,800. There were approximately 1,400 upgrades awarded  on foot of the 2017 Leaving Certificate appeals process. Up to 2016 the successful rate of upgrade was approximately 18% of the appeals received. In 2017 this rate was 14.5%, which reflects the move to broader 10% grade bands in 2017, compared to the previous system of 5% sub-grades (when all original grades were within a maximum of 2.5% away from the next grade boundary). These rates compare very favourably with other examination systems, particularly in the UK, where the average rate of upgrade is 20% (based on 10% grading bands). The number of grades changing on foot of the Leaving Certificate appeal system this year represented 0.36% of all the grades awarded in the 2017 Leaving Certificate examination.</p>  <p>  The State Examinations Commission has assured me that it is satisfied that it operates a transparent, accessible and effective Leaving Certificate appeals system in which candidates can raise issues of concern regarding the marking of their work and have these fully and transparently addressed.</p></reply>

Since June 2017, my Department has engaged with relevant third parties with a view to negotiating an acceptable solution to the access issue.

I also believe that it is unfair that some parents, who might otherwise not do so, feel pressure to baptise their children in order to gain admission to their local school.</p>  <p>This is why I ran a public consultation process from 24th January to 20th   March 2017 on this matter, to which I received almost 1,000 submissions. I also held a public forum last May on the role of Religion in Primary School Admissions which was attended by 121 individuals. </p>  <p>  I have outlined my intention to make changes in the first instance in respect of the primary school system. It was noted in the consultation paper that any changes need only apply in respect of oversubscribed schools (approximately 20% of schools). In respect of all other schools, the practice is to admit all applicants. This will become law following the enactment of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill &ndash; when schools will be required to admit every child who applies.</p>  <p>  Last June during Committee Stage debate on the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill I advised that my preference is to make changes to the Equal Status Act, 2000 that would remove the capacity for state-funded denominational primary schools, where they are oversubscribed, to use religion as a criteria in admissions process, with an exception for pupils of minority religions. </p>  <p>  My officials are currently engaging with the Office of the Attorney General on the development of legislative proposals on this matter which I hope to bring forward to Government for approval shortly.</p></reply>

On this provisional basis, passports and passport cards issued have generated total receipts of &euro;48.6 million.The number of passports and passport cards issued and the provisional monthly revenue generated to date in 2017 are as follows:<table><tr><th></th><th>Passports</th><th>Cards</th><th>Revenue (&euro;k)*</th></tr><tr><td>January</td><td>34,175</td><td>1,526</td><td>4,351</td></tr><tr><td>February</td><td>67,097</td><td>1,908</td><td>4,357</td></tr><tr><td>March</td><td>84,143</td><td>2,190</td><td>4,974</td></tr><tr><td>April</td><td>87,032</td><td>3,049</td><td>4,787</td></tr><tr><td>May</td><td>103,030</td><td>5,044</td><td>7,790</td></tr><tr><td>June</td><td>95,901</td><td>4,917</td><td>5,525</td></tr><tr><td>July</td><td>77,872</td><td>3,982</td><td>4,299</td></tr><tr><td>August</td><td>66,733</td><td>4,328</td><td>3,777</td></tr><tr><td>September</td><td>49,549</td><td>3,591</td><td>4,558</td></tr><tr><td>October</td><td>40,633</td><td>3,263</td><td>2,777</td></tr><tr><td>November**</td><td>36,115</td><td>3,157</td><td>1,418</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>742,280</td><td>36,955</td><td>&euro;48,613,000</td></tr></table></p><p>* All figures for receipts are provisional only</p><p>** November 2017 receipts are not yet complete</p><p>These revenue streams are appropriations in aid and are remitted directly to the Exchequer.</p><p>The passport is a key travel and identity document.  The processing of applications by the Passport Service involves the deployment of significant resources, including to develop new business processes to modernise enrolment, checking and production systems and to improve customer service.  Software solutions and data analytics, including facial recognition, are also deployed to combat identity theft and maintain the integrity and high international reputation of the Irish passport.</p><p>A number of innovations have been introduced in recent years.  The world-first passport card gives adult Irish passport-holders the option of a credit card-sized travel document valid for travel to 31 countries in total, including the EU/EEA plus Switzerland.</p><p>Further, an online passport application service (www.dfa.ie/passportonline/) was launched in March of this year.  This award-winning service allows adult Irish citizens to submit their passport renewal applications online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, wherever they are in the world, without the need for paper forms, signatures or printed photographs.</p></reply>

The possibility of inviting both Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas to Brussels for such discussions has been under consideration for some time. I understand that President Abbas&rsquo;s availability to meet with EU Foreign Ministers at an early date is currently being explored.   The Middle East Peace Process is a very important issue for the EU. Ireland supports efforts to reach a comprehensive peace agreement to the Middle East conflict, and this is a priority for me personally. I have met with the US Middle East team to encourage their work, and to underline what the EU sees as the key parameters for an agreement. I have also taken an active role on this issue in the Foreign Affairs Council, urging my colleagues to continue our work to help preserve and create the political and physical space in which the two state solution can be achieved. I visited the region earlier this year and met with representatives of both parties, and I hope to do so again in the coming months.  </p>  <p>  This meeting will be an opportunity both to hear from Prime Minister Netanyahu, and to underline to him key EU messages and concerns about the Middle East.

As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government has a solemn responsibility to protect the Agreement, in all its parts, and the gains of the Peace Process. I am very conscious of the enormous benefit which the Agreement has brought to people and communities within Northern Ireland, across the island of Ireland and in Britain. The British Government has likewise confirmed its commitment to upholding the Good Friday Agreement, including in Prime Minister May&rsquo;s Article 50 notification to the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, in March.   The Government&rsquo;s programme of engagement with EU partners over the last eighteen months and more has ensured that Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns - including the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts - have been fully understood by the EU27 and have been reflected in the EU Negotiating Guidelines and Directives for the Article 50 process.  The support and solidarity of our EU partners for the unique challenges facing the island of Ireland has been strong and consistent throughout the Article 50 process. </p>  <p>  The Guiding Principles for the Dialogue on Ireland/Northern Ireland, published by the European Commission Article 50 Task force in September, form the basis for the EU&rsquo;s engagement with the United Kingdom in the Article 50 negotiations on the shared objective of protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and protecting the gains and benefits of the Peace Process.  </p>  <p>  The Guiding Principles affirm that, as an essential element of the withdrawal process, there needs to be a political commitment to protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, protecting the gains of the peace process and the practical application of this to the island of Ireland.  A number of principles guiding this approach are set out, specifically that:</p>  <p>  the interlocking political institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement will need to continue to operate effectively; </p>  <p>  the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland is central to protecting the gains of the Peace Process underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement;</p>  <p>  North South cooperation is a central part of the Good Friday Agreement and should be protected across all of the relevant sectors;</p>  <p>  with reference to the Good Friday Agreement provisions on Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity, the United Kingdom should ensure that no diminution of rights  is caused by the departure from the European Union, including the area of protection against forms of discrimination currently enshrined in Union law;</p>  <p>  full account should be taken of the fact that Irish citizens residing in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy rights as EU citizens;</p>  <p>  in relation to Union support to the Peace Process including through programmes such as PEACE and INTERREG, the United Kingdom and the Union need to honour their commitment under the current Multi-annual Financial Framework and examine how to ensure implementation in line with applicable European Union rules.</p>  <p>  The Guiding Principles also affirm the importance of the continued operation of the Common Travel Area to facilitating the mobility of people between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain and also between North and South.  The CTA also underpins the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, in particular the citizenship and identity provisions, including by enabling people of Irish identity not to have to assert British citizenship in Northern Ireland in order to enjoy their rights. </p>  <p>  While the Government is disappointed that there wasn&rsquo;t a full agreement reached on Monday between President Juncker and Prime Minister May, negotiations will continue and I hope that agreement can be found in time for the European Council on 14 and 15 December next.  </p>  <p>  The Government is working hard, as part of the EU27, to ensure that the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU does not in any way undermine the peace process and ensure that we preserve the effectively invisible border on the island of Ireland. The negotiations in the last number of months and the intensive discussions over the last number of days have seen a good political understanding develop on all sides of what will be required to achieve our shared objectives. We will continue to work closely with the Task Force and the UK Government in the coming days.</p>  <p>  As the negotiations continue into the future, the Government will continue to pursue, with our EU partners, an outcome to the Article 50 process that protects our headline priorities and Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental interests, including to ensure protection of and respect for the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.</p></reply>

The approach adopted is via the establishment of an escrow fund, in co-operation with Apple as this was identified as the method that delivers the best outcome for the State. </p>  <p>  As part of the establishment of the escrow fund, the NTMA, on my behalf, and Apple will jointly appoint (i) a third party escrow agent / custodian to hold the assets and administer the escrow fund and (ii) third party investment managers to manage the escrow fund.  These service providers will be appointed following competitive tender processes, which are currently ongoing. Given the NTMA&rsquo;s existing functions and expertise, and the scale and complexity involved, as Minister I appointed the NTMA as my agent under section 28 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000 to run the procurement processes on my behalf.</p>  <p>  Due to the ongoing procurement processes which are subject to commercially sensitive deliberations, I am not in a position to provide further information on the costs associated with the management of the escrow fund at this point in time. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on this complex issue and the establishment of an escrow fund, in compliance with all relevant Irish constitutional and European Union law requirements, is close to completion. The Deputy will be aware of a recent announcement on progress in this respect. Officials and experts from across the State have been engaged in intensive work to ensure that Ireland complies with all its recovery obligations as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  With regard to the costs in relation to the recovery process to date, approximately &euro;2 million (including VAT) has been spent by the State (including the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the NTMA, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office). This case has involved a significant degree of legal and technical complexity, and additional expertise has been engaged where required. As it is an important issue for the State, the recovery process will continue to be appropriately resourced. A provision for some expenditure in relation to this has been included in the 2018 estimates which will be used on an, as required, basis in relation to this process.</p></reply>

For PRSAs linked to occupational pension schemes into which Additional Voluntary Contributions have been made, the maximum lump sum is based on the scheme rules, the individual&rsquo;s length of service and final earnings, with 150% of final salary being the maximum lump sum available based on 20 years service. Under Chapter 1 of Part 30, retirements benefits from occupational schemes must be taken not later than age 70. </p>  <p>  In the case of an RAC, the retirement lump sum must be taken at the time an annuity becomes payable under the contract or the individual opts to transfer the balance of the fund after the lump sum to an Approved Retirement Fund or take the fund as a taxable cash sum. Both of these options are subject to the requirement that the individual transfers &euro;63,500 of the fund balance (or all of the balance, if less than &euro;63,500) to an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund, or uses it to purchase an annuity. In the case of a PRSA, the lump sum must be taken on the first occasion benefits are taken from the PRSA.     </p>  <p>  I am further advised that the maximum cumulative tax-free total of all retirement lump sums that an individual can take from all pension arrangements since 7 December 2005 is &euro;200,000. Any lump sums taken in excess of this cumulative life-time limit are subject to taxation at a ring-fenced rate of 20% on the next &euro;300,000, and at the individual&rsquo;s marginal income tax rate plus USC on any balance. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to change the current retirement lump sum rules in this area.</p></reply>

Provision 3.11 of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) requires that where a regulated entity intends to transfer all or part of its regulated activities to another regulated entity, it must:  </p>  <p>  - notify the Central Bank immediately; </p>  <p>  - provide at least two months&rsquo; notice to affected consumers to enable them to make alternative arrangements;</p>  <p>  - ensure all outstanding business is properly completed prior to the transfer; </p>  <p>  - inform the consumer of how continuity of service will be provided following the transfer; and </p>  <p>  - inform the consumer that their details are being transferred to the other regulated entity, if that is the case.</p>  <p>  In July 2015, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 (&ldquo;the 2015 Act&rdquo;) was enacted, which introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a &lsquo;credit servicing firm&rsquo;.  Under the 2015 Act, if the firm who bought the loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm then the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.  Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes of conduct issued by the Central Bank, such as the Code, the Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears 2013 and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015.</p>  <p>  Since the enactment of the 2015 Act, the original lender must now provide a consumer with at least 2 months&rsquo; notice before transferring all or part of a loan book covered by the Code to another person, including where the transferee is an unregulated entity.  Where the transferee is an unregulated entity, the Code now requires that the regulated lender also notify the consumer of the regulated entity that will be &lsquo;servicing&rsquo; the loan for the unregulated entity.  This was not the case before the enactment of the 2015 Act because servicing a loan was not a regulated activity requiring authorisation by the Central Bank.  In the event that the entity &lsquo;servicing&rsquo; a loan for an unregulated entity is to change, the existing credit servicing firm must also notify the Central Bank and the consumer in advance, in accordance with the timelines set out under Provision 3.11 of the Code. </p>  <p>  In relation to record keeping, the Central Bank has informed me that Chapter 11 of the Code provides that regulated entities must retain records for six years from the date on which the regulated entity ceased to provide any product or service to the consumer concerned.  In addition, a regulated entity must maintain complete and readily accessible records and, upon being required by the Central Bank to do so, provide to the Central Bank records evidencing compliance with the Code for a period which the Central Bank may specify (up to maximum period of six years).</p></reply>

Membership is compulsory for male established civil servants appointed on or after 1 January 1969 and female established civil servants appointed on or after 1 June 1981. Officers serving prior to the relevant dates were given options to join. Following discussions with staff interests, a &lsquo;revised&rsquo; scheme was introduced in 1984 which provides for a wider range of beneficiaries. The revised scheme was compulsory for all civil servants joining after 1 September 1984, while serving staff, including those who were members of the original scheme, had the option to join. </p>  <p>  I agree with the finding of the Commission on Public Service Pensions (2000) that public service spouses&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s schemes are structured on a group insurance basis and that member contribution rates take account of the fact that payment of benefits will not arise in respect of all members. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Civil Service Spouses' and Children's Contributory Pension Scheme meets the requirements of the Employment Equality Acts, 1998 &ndash; 2015 in relation to all of the grounds of discrimination set out in the legislation, including on grounds of disability.</p></reply>

We are successfully filling the posts that we are making available.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, last week I launched a STEM Policy Statement and Implementation Plan, which aims to make Ireland the best in Europe in STEM by 2026. This Policy Statement focusses on the many strengths in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education in Ireland while providing a roadmap to address the areas for development. </p>  <p>  Some schools have reported shortages in recruiting teachers in specific subjects at post primary level, including in STEM. The reasons for this are complex. Part of the reason is due to an imbalance in the availability of teachers in certain subjects &ndash; for example a large proportion of teachers training as Geography teachers and a smaller proportion choosing to train in subjects such as Physics. </p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the STEM Strategy I am determined to deliver increased teacher supply in key priority areas.  My officials are gathering and analysing baseline data.  We are also assessing specific policy initiatives which can accelerate supply in critical areas.  This would include measures to deliver a higher proportion of those entering initial teacher education at undergraduate or masters level in the priority areas; to upgrade the skills of existing teachers; to identify possible sources of qualified persons who are not now teaching.</p></reply>

It is also permissible for a school to seek payments in respect of extra-curricular activities provided such activities are not obligatory and individual pupils can choose whether or not to participate. No charge may be made, however, in respect of instruction in any subject of the school curriculum or for recreation or other activities where all pupils are expected to take part.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 prohibits the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions as part of the school admission process or for continued enrolment in the school. The Bill passed D&aacute;il Committee stage on the 28th June 2017 and will shortly proceed to Report Stage.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the burden which can be placed on parents by the costs associated with school attendance. That is the reason why I issued a circular to schools requiring a keen cost approach to the selection of items which could impose costs and requiring consultation with parents on the elements that can create costs. </p>  <p>  I believe that schools need to be accountable to parents and we need greater levels of communication, engagement and transparency in how schools serve their communities. Better information for parents, including information in relation to the collection and use of voluntary contributions, is an issue that I will be looking at in the context of my Department's work on a Parents' and Students' Charter.</p>  <p>  I recognise the need to improve capitation funding for primary and post-primary schools having regard to the reductions that were necessary over recent years.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Education aimed at making the Irish education and training service the best in Europe by 2026 outlines hundreds of actions to be implemented over the 3 year period 2016 to 2019 which include restoring capitation funding as resources permit.</p>  <p>  The process is underway for restoring grant funding that is used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff.  The ancillary grant was increased by &euro;6 in 2016 and &euro;5 in 2017 in order to enable primary schools implement the arbitration salary increase for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation.  A similar type approach in relation to improvements in grant funding was applied, as appropriate, at post-primary level. </p>  <p>  Capitation funding remains a priority for me to address during the lifetime of the Action Plan as resources permit.</p></reply>

It is impossible to even imagine what some people endured.   In recognition that survivors may need the help of counsellors, there is a National Counselling Service, run by the Health Service Executive which provides counselling services to those who have been abused in childhood, with priority given to those abused in residential institutional care.   Perhaps, this service may be of assistance. </p>  <p>  While there was a redress scheme in place for people who had suffered abuse in a number of scheduled institutions, it is no longer open to new applicants.   The Residential Institutions Redress Amendment Act, 2011 removed the Board's power to accept late applications. </p>  <p>  The  legislation removing the Board's power to consider late applications also required the Board to advertise this fact.  Given Ireland's pattern of immigration to the UK, the Board advertised in the Daily Mail and the Sun in the UK.  The Board also wrote to all solicitors on record and placed a notice on its website as well as advising the survivor groups and outreach centres in the UK. It also arranged for the Irish embassies to be advised of the closing date.</p>  <p>  Since 17th September 2011, the Redress Board has been closed for applications.</p></reply>

Nursing numbers remain relatively consistent with preceding years, while medical enrolments increased significantly.</p>  <p>  In other programmes, notable trends include the increases in social services (up 140%), combined health and welfare (257%), combined health (129%), pharmacy (57%) and childcare and youth services (57%).  A more modest increase was seen in therapy and rehabilitation (16%), while enrolments in dental studies and medical diagnostic and treatment technology declined (by 3% and 53% respectively).</p>  <p>  Provision of HE programmes is generally determined by the HSE setting quotas for the number of students that should be taken onto such education programmes.

Some 2,300 new teachers were recruited in 2016-2017 and 2,900 are being recruited in 2017-2018. The figure of 2,900 is 21% more than the number announced in budget 2017, so we have in fact been able to recruit more new teachers than we have announced. All of the 2016-2017 posts have been successfully filled and the process for filling the additional posts in the current year is almost complete. We are successfully filling the posts that we are making available.</p>  <p>  However, I am aware that some schools have reported difficulties in recruiting substitute teachers at primary level and in certain subjects at post primary level, and I am committed to examining all possible means of addressing these issues.</p>  <p>  Regarding issues around finding substitution at primary level, there are strong career opportunities in teaching and the number of permanent full-time positions are currently increasing at over 1,000 per year in 2016/2017 and 2017/2018. Due to the additional permanent positions being created, young teachers have greater opportunities to take on permanent positions, and as a result some schools may be experiencing issues in hiring teachers to fill temporary or substitute roles, which arise in schools for a number of reasons, including covering sick leave and career breaks.</p>  <p>  At post primary level I have taken certain initiatives to address some of the supply pressures in particular subject areas. These include, as part of the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education, increasing from 2018/19 the number of places available on the existing Irish medium post primary initial teacher education programme in NUIG, to which I have granted two additional posts from September 2017. This measure will strengthen the Irish-language proficiency of newly qualified teachers across a range of subjects and, it is anticipated, also increase the supply of Irish language teachers. I have also increased from 85 to 101 the number of students admitted to St Angela&rsquo;s, Sligo to follow the Home Economics ITE programme in the current year, with further expansions in future years being considered.</p>  <p>  I have also undertaken measures to increase the pool of teachers available to schools in particular to fill short term vacancies. My Department informed all teachers retiring in 2017 that in order to remain eligible for employment in a state funded teaching post for a period of more than five consecutive days or to supervise the State examinations, a teacher must maintain his/her registration with the Teaching Council. My Department also increased the limits for employment while on career break at primary level to a maximum of 90 days in a school year. In addition, as a longer term measure, under my Department&rsquo;s Gaeltacht Policy, an RFT is currently being developed for a new Irish-medium B.Ed.

To meet this demographic  challenge, my Department&rsquo;s Capital Investment Programme (2016-2021), details the school projects that are being progressed through the architectural planning process towards tender and construction including projects in Co Kildare. The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed.</p>  <p>  There is currently a review underway of the need for school places across our 314 school planning areas, which is expected to identify new needs due to the higher than expected population recorded census.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a building project for the school to which he refers is included in the 6 Year Construction Programme.</p>  <p>  A site visit to the school has been undertaken by my Department which involved an assessment of the school building. The outcome of the visit is currently being considered and this will assist in determining how the accommodation needs of the school will be addressed. This includes the formulation of the accommodation brief i.e. defining the extent of extension/refurbishment to be provided. My Department has been liaising with the school&rsquo;s Patron in this regard. When the brief formulation process has been completed, my Department will be in further contact with the Patron in relation to the next steps to be taken to initiate the architectural planning process for the project.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Education sets out the Government's ambitions for the Education system, including the commitment contained in the Programme for Government, towards the prioritisation of school educational infrastructure. </p>  <p>  Following the Capital Review, additional capital funding of &euro;332m will be available to the schools sector primarily from 2019 onwards, boosting investment in our primary and post-primary schools infrastructure. This significant investment reflects the priority which government has put on education on delivering on our ambition to deliver a fair society and a strong economy.</p></reply>

This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream. </p><p>Others may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.</p><p>There is therefore not one preferred educational environment for</p><p>children with ASD, rather there is a model which takes into account the assessed educational needs of individual pupils.</p><p>The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p><p>The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year, and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need.</p><p>Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of special classes by over 100% from 548 in 2011 to 1,302 for the 2017/18 school year. 1,042 of these are ASD special classes of which 151 are being newly established for this school year. </p><p>125 special schools also provide specialist education for those students with complex special educational needs, including students diagnosed with ASD. The number of students attending special schools has increased by 150 on average each year over the last 4-5 years, increasing from 6,848 in 2011/12 to 7,750 in 2016/17, an increase of 13%.</p><p>My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class or special school placements can access such placements.  </p><p>Parents/guardians of children with special needs who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) as soon as possible for information on available places. The local SENO contact details are available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p>  <p>  The demographic data for all school planning areas is being reviewed by my Department to take account of updated child benefit data and updated enrolment data.  It is anticipated that this exercise will be concluded shortly. </p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  Teacher allocations to primary and post primary schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements annually and are available on my Department website.</p>  <p>  In general, there have been no problems in relation to the recruitment of teachers.  In Budget 2017, we announced 2,400 new teachers whereas we are in the process of actually hiring 2,900 teachers - 21% more than the number announced. </p>  <p>  I am aware that some schools have reported difficulties in recruiting substitute teachers at primary level and in certain subjects at post primary level, and I am committed to examining all possible means of addressing these issues.</p>  <p>  At post primary level I have taken certain initiatives to address some of the supply pressures in particular subject areas. These include, as part of the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education, increasing from 2018/19 the number of places available on the existing Irish medium post primary initial teacher education programme in NUIG, to which I have granted two additional posts from September 2017. This measure will strengthen the Irish-language proficiency of newly qualified teachers across a range of subjects and, it is anticipated, also increase the supply of Irish language teachers. I have also increased from 85 to 101 the number of students admitted to St Angela&rsquo;s, Sligo to follow the Home Economics ITE programme in the current year, with further expansions in future years being considered.</p>  <p>  I have also undertaken measures to increase the pool of teachers available to schools in particular to fill short term vacancies. My Department informed all teachers retiring in 2017 that in order to remain eligible for employment in a state funded teaching post for a period of more than five consecutive days or to supervise the State examinations, a teacher must maintain his/her registration with the Teaching Council. My Department also increased the limits for employment while on career break at post primary level to a maximum of 300 hours in a school year and at primary level to a maximum of 90 days in a school year.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the report of the Technical Working Group on teacher supply, &lsquo;Striking the Balance&rsquo; which, while focussing on the development of a model of primary teacher supply, outlined the work which will be required to establish a long term model of post-primary teacher supply.  The Teaching Council, which has an advisory role in this matter, recently convened a consultative forum on teacher supply with relevant stakeholders with the aim of producing teacher supply proposals and I look forward to seeing the report from this forum which will further inform our thinking in this matter. </p>  <p>  I am reviewing a number of options in order to incentivise students to undertake the two year Professional Masters in Education, including financial incentives.  Specifically, in the recently launched STEM and Foreign Languages in Education Implementation Plans, my Department has committed to undertake baseline data collection and analysis to inform policy on the supply of STEM and foreign language teachers and to develop policy actions to support the supply of teachers of these subjects.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, third level institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for the day to day management and operational affairs of the institute, including the management of its staffing requirements. My Department allocates recurrent funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for direct disbursement to the HEA designated higher education institutions and the internal disbursement of funding (both public and private) is then a matter for the individual institution. </p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the moratorium on public sector recruitment, an Employment Control Framework (ECF) has been in place for the higher education sector which provides institutions with considerable flexibility to fill vacancies, through recruitment or promotions on the basis of meeting an overall ceiling of posts. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2015, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced that the existing ECFs and associated moratoriums would be lifted and replaced with a system of delegated sanction for recruiting and promoting up to Principal Officer level, subject to adherence by Departments to binding pay ceilings and ongoing compliance with Workforce Planning requirements. My Department is currently consulting with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to identify the most appropriate staffing model for the higher education sector.</p></reply>

Deprivation of liberty is a sensitive and important matter which goes to the heart of fundamental freedoms and human rights.   Legislative proposals in this area will have significant implications for families, the operation of the health services and the courts.  It is important the people fully understand what is being proposed.  These provisions are intended to provide safeguards for older people and persons with disabilities and certain categories of people with mental health illnesses to ensure that they are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty in residential facilities. </p>  <p>  This Government is making good progress with regard to making the Convention's requirements operational in Ireland in an appropriate manner. Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's full implementation of the Convention as set out in the 2015 roadmap.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity. Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 was reformed through a 2017 Act of the same name to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights. </p>  <p>  There are two further priority implementation issues: these are the enactment of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 and the commencement of the Assisted Decision Making Capacity Act 2015 which requires the Decision Support Service to be operational and ready to roll out the new decision-making support options. The 2018 Budget has provided an allocation of &euro;3 million for the establishment of the Decision Support Service. </p>  <p>  Finally, I am continuing to take a wide range of practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities.  The Report of the 'Make Work Pay Group' was published in April of this year and already action, as announced by the Minister for Health, has been taken on its recommendations. We have a Comprehensive Employment Strategy in place and 2017 has seen positive action measures being taken to support public sector recruitment of people with disabilities.  I also published the Disability Inclusion Strategy in July of this year containing wide range of practical commitments to improve the lives of people with disabilities.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  The Garda strength of the Cavan/Monaghan Division on 31 October 2017 was 324. There are 11 Reserves and 37 civilian staff attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 33 of whom have been assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan Division. I look forward to attending the graduation of another 200 trainee Garda on Friday which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - a net increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  </p>  <p>  I am also pleased that Budget 2018 maintains this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensures that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. This will see Garda numbers reach the 14,000 mark by the end of 2018. </p>  <p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Cavan/Monaghan Division, in the coming years. </p>  <p>  In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner. I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing. To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p></reply>

Sometimes referred to as "pay parity", this non-statutory linkage lapsed in 2010, when the values of pensions in payment were left unchanged notwithstanding salary cuts at the beginning of that year which affected all public servants, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, under the financial emergency legislation.</p>  <p>  Due to a grace period associated with the 2010 salary cuts, public servants and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who retired in the 26 months following those cuts, i.e. in the period to end-February 2012, had their pensions based on the higher pre-cut salary levels. This has led to the current situation whereby post-February 2012 retirees, on a like-for-like basis, mostly receive lower pensions than their earlier retired counterparts.</p>  <p>  The lapsing of pay parity along with the pension differential arising between pre and post-2012 retirees, has created the conditions under which the issue of how to adjust the post-award value of Garda and public service pensions, through appropriate pay or other linkages has required consideration.</p>  <p>  In that context, pension increase policy in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was considered by Government during the mid-2017 public service pay talks, which led to the recently ratified Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 (PSSA). </p>  <p>  Section 6.2 of the PSSA indicates that, over the duration of that agreement, policy on public service pensions in payment will be guided by the following three elements:</p>  <p>  - First, the need to adopt an equitable approach to the various public service pensioner cohorts differentiated by date of retirement (in particular pre and post end-February 2012) is affirmed.</p>  <p>  - Second, for those who retired or will retire post end-February 2012, to the extent that they retired or will retire on reduced salaries for pension award purposes, they will receive pension increases in line with pay increases received by their peers currently in employment in accordance with the terms of the collective agreement.</p>  <p>  - Third, when alignment is achieved between pre and post end-February 2012 pensioners, as will happen progressively for salary ranges up to &euro;70,000 in 2020 under the proposed collective agreement, pay increases will continue to benefit pensions in payment for the duration of the agreement.</p>  <p>  The essence of the Government&rsquo;s pension increase policy over the PSSA lifetime to end-2020 is that pensions in payment will increase in line with pay increases where that is necessary to ensure that underlying salary on which those pensions are based is equal to that of the salary on which new-award pensions of same-grade retiring staff are based.</p>  <p>  This effectively represents a limited resumption of the pre-FEMPI "pay parity" model, under which pension rates rose in line with pay increases, and will be applied within strictly controlled terms until end-2020 only.</p></reply>

These orders were complied with fully and the relevant documents were forwarded to the Tribunal in February, May and September 2017. In the course of making discovery, affidavits of discovery were requested by the Tribunal in respect of two of those orders, those in April and September. An official of my Department swore three affidavits in respect of these two discovery orders. </p>  <p>  The discovery orders concerned records of the O&rsquo;Higgins Commission of Investigation; documents related to two cases which had been considered by the Independent Review Mechanism; a copy of a representation to the then Minister which referenced Sergeant McCabe; a report of a GSOC investigation into a complaint that a Garda investigation of an alleged serious assault was not properly carried out; and records related to the allegation of contacts between the Garda&iacute; and TUSLA in relation to Garda Keith Harrison. </p>  <p>  The Department has also made voluntary disclosure of other matters including three protected disclosures, reports from the Garda Commissioner under section 41 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act and, most recently, the two email threads that were uncovered following a trawl of documents in the Department. In acknowledging receipt of the emails, the Tribunal made reference to my Department's already extensive discovery which has allowed the Tribunal to place the current documents in context. </p>  <p>  When the Disclosures Tribunal was established, my Department notified the Tribunal of the existence of a number of files which might come within the terms of reference of the Tribunal. These included some files relating to on-going civil litigation, in relation to which my Department had been advised that legal professional privilege applied. The Tribunal did not request discovery of these files. </p>  <p>  In an affidavit of discovery which related, in part, to records of the O'Higgins Commission of Investigation, my Department did claim legal professional privilege over 2 documents, one of which consisted of a memo from the Commission's senior counsel to the Commission and which contained legal advice. The second was a draft letter from the solicitor to the Commission for issue to one of the parties to the Commission. My Department was advised that these documents did attract legal professional privilege. In line with the standard format of an affidavit of discovery, the Tribunal was provided with sufficient information to identify the type of records in question. The Tribunal did not raise any issue with the affidavit. </p>  <p>  I should clarify that no officials of my Department (nor, indeed, my predecessor) have accessed the records of the O'Higgins Commission of Investigation in view of the statutory necessity to maintain confidentiality of those records. Therefore, to comply with the Tribunal's discovery orders my Department engaged documentary counsel to examine those records and to identify the relevant records for the purpose of the discovery order.</p></reply>

The overall objective of GRACE was to eliminate or substantially reduce the budget deficit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to demonstrate leadership willingness and capability to address immediate, medium and longer-term financial challenges, in collaboration with other agencies.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-12-06a.351.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017120600076#WRH05700"><p>Prior to the Companies Act 2014, a company could apply only to the High Court for an extension of time to file its annual return.  Where such an Order was given for an extension of the time, the company did not lose its audit exemption.  Separately, a company could apply to the Registrar of Companies for its late filing fees to be waived but it lost the audit exemption as it was still late filing its annual return. </p>  <p>  The Companies Act 2014 introduced the option, under section 343(7), for a company to also apply to the District Court for the extension of time to file its annual return and, if obtained, it retained its audit exemption.</p>  <p>  Section 343(7) was commenced on 1 June 2015 and since then concerns have arisen regarding its impact on timely filing of annual returns and financial statements by companies which is an important transparency measure and safeguard for third parties such as suppliers, employees and other creditors.  The number of Orders granted by the District Court in the course of 2016 was more than double the number of waivers granted by the Registrar in 2014 under the previous scheme. </p>  <p>  Section 9 of the Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017 repeals section 343(7) of the Companies Act 2014.  A new section 343A provides that a company may apply to the District Court for an Order waiving the fee required for the late filing of its annual return. This is similar to the position that obtained before the enactment of the Companies Act 2014, whereby a company could apply to the Registrar but that decision now falls within the remit of the District Court. </p>  <p>  The loss of audit exemption where an annual return is not filed on time was introduced as a policy response for such failure in the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003.  Compliance with filing deadlines were at 13% before that time.  Today the compliance level is at 90%, a dramatic increase that is associated with the introduction of the loss of audit exemption.  It has proved central to creating a culture of compliance and acting as a support to good corporate governance practices.  </p>  <p>  Companies have a considerable period of time, up to 10 months, to prepare and file their financial statements.  The vast majority of companies manage to file within this timeframe.  Any further delay risks making that information less meaningful to the third parties concerned. </p>  <p>  This is an important consideration as those third parties may also be small companies that supply or otherwise do business with that company.  Given the time allowed to companies to prepare their financial statements, the fact that the financial reporting obligation has been simplified and reduced in the Companies (Accounting) Act 2017 and that this Act also made more companies eligible for the audit exemption, I consider that proposals in the Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017 to be a proportionate measure to protect the interests of users of company financial statements.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be familiar with the background to the closure of both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes in February 2013.  Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.</p>  <p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  The Government's legislative programme for 2017 includes the Health (Transport Support) Bill.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that:</p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;</p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;</p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and</p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  The draft General Scheme and Heads of Bill were circulated to other government Departments and have been the subject of consultation between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  When the consultation with other relevant Departments has been completed, the next step will be to seek Government approval to the drafting of a Bill for the new Scheme.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.</p>  <p>  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  The amount of funding allocated to the NHSS in 2017 was  &euro;940m. This amount was increased to &euro;949.7m in  the recent budget.</p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  The programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination  against small businesses and family farms.  It is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation  and changes to the NHSS will require legislative implementation.</p>  <p>  On this basis, I have requested legal advice from the office of the Attorney General regarding potential changes to the legislation that will address this matter.  My Department has also been cognisant of this matter in the context of this years estimates process.  I have recently met with representatives from the I.F.A.  to discuss various strategies that may assist with addressing their members concerns and have apprised them of the current progress. We agreed to meet again in the near future for further discussions.  I am committed to this review of the position with regard to family farms and small businesses for the purposes of the financial assessment of the scheme.</p></reply>

These services also provide consequent support to carers in their caring role.  The HSE provides Home Care Packages (HCPs) which are enhanced supports, over and above existing mainstream Home Help service and these can include additional home help hours, nursing care and therapy services that might be needed due to illness, disability, after a stay in hospital or following rehabilitation in a nursing home.  Access to HCPs is provided on the basis of assessed care need, carried out by health care professionals. In 2014, the HSE introduced Intensive Home Care Packages to facilitate timely discharge home from acute hospitals of people who require very significant interventions to an extent not previously provided as part of the Home Care Package Scheme or current community services.   </p>  <p>  The principal focus of these services is on people aged 65 years or over. There is some flexibility in relation to applications, and if a younger person&rsquo;s assessed needs can be best met by services designed for older people, then occasionally such an application may be considered. However, access to home care packages by reference to illness type is not provided. </p>  <p>  The overall funding allocated for Home Care in 2017 is &euro;376m. The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2017 provides for a target of 10.57 million Home Help Hours, 16,750 Home Care Packages and 190 Intensive Home Care Packages. Funding for home care supports continues to increase with a further &euro;32m for home care and transitional care provided for in 2018 in the recent Budget. The detail of service delivery for 2018 is currently being developed through the National Service Planning Process. </p>  <p>  The HSE is committed to protecting the level of Personal Assistant and Home Support Services available to people with disabilities.  In their 2017 National Service Plan, the HSE expects to deliver 1.4 million Personal Assistant hours to 2,357 adults with a physical and/or sensory disability.  With regard to Home Support hours, the HSE's 2017 commitment is to provide 2.75 million hours to people with disabilities.</p></reply>

I recognise the need for an improved out of hours service for North Wicklow which can provide the appropriate level of cover for the population of the area. The development of such a service would allow GPs to participate fully in the provision of an integrated healthcare system providing medical services that are appropriate, timely and effective, easily accessible and responsive to the needs of patients. I remain committed to the development of  an improved GP out of hours services for North Wicklow and I expect progress to be made in this matter in the near future. </p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE's National Primary Care Division has also undertaken a national review of current GP out of hours services and a final report  is expected to be completed shortly.  This report will make recommendations regarding the future provision of GP out of hours services and will have particular relevance to the currents gaps in service, in areas such as North Wicklow.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-12-06a.428.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017120600078#WRK01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 188, 189, and 195 to 198, inclusive, together.</p><p>The HSE-Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) is a specialist agency for the surveillance of communicable diseases. It works in partnership with health service providers and similar organisations in Ireland and around the world, to provide the best possible information for the control and prevention of infectious diseases. The roles of the HPSCinclude providing timely information and independent advice, carrying out disease surveillance, epidemiological investigation and related research and training.</p><p>Earlier this year the HPSC undertook an investigation to determine if gulls posed a potential infectious risk and to attempt to quantify this in the most valid manner.  The main focus of investigation was an examination of the potential for transmission from gulls to man, of infectious disease. An extensive review of the relevant international literature on the evidence for transmission of infectious disease from gulls to man indicated that, although disease carriage is relatively common amongst such birds, there is very little evidence of disease transmission to humans and that wild birds play a limited role in human infectious disease.</p><p>About 5% of gulls are infected with Salmonella.  This is a lower prevalence than many other common wild birds.  For example, amongst starlings and house sparrows, a number of studies agree that the prevalence of carriage of various pathogens is about is in the range of 24% for Salmonella, 4% for Campylobacter and 24% <i>Clostridium perfringens</i>.  About 20% of starlings carry <i>E.coli</i>and the same levels are seen in crows.  Levels of these pathogens are even higher in long distance migratory birds.</p><p>With regard to antibiotic resistant pathogens, in general about 10-15% of isolates carried by wild birds, are resistant to the common (and not so common antibiotics).  Transmission of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by wildbirds is a potential health issue, but it has its greatest potential for impact when the birds acquire these AMR pathogens in countries where there are high levels of AMR.  These can be carried long distances by far-reaching migratory wild birds.  Gulls do not migrate very far, and so tend to be infected with local pathogens.</p><p>A review of 10 years Irish national infectious disease data was carried out to determine how many cases of any infectious disease (but particularly instances of gastrointestinal disease caused by Salmonella and Campylobacter) could be attributed to contact with birds. The aim was to determine the proportion of human infectious disease cases in which wild birds (including gulls) were associated. The results of this investigation showed that in that ten-year period, there were barely a handful of infectious disease cases that could be explained by bird contact.  Between 2006 and 2016, there were just three cases of salmonellosis (two of these mentioned contact with caged, pet birds) and a further two cases of campylobacteriosis (one of which mentioned proximity to gulls). These were suggestive of association but not evidence of cause.  Moreover, there were no outbreaks of human disease over the same 10 year period in which gulls (or any other wild birds) had been implicated as the cause of an outbreak of infectious disease, or even a contributory factor.</p><p>Over the last 10 years there have been in total in Ireland, about 25,500 reported cases of Campylobacter and 3,900 cases of Salmonella.  That investigation found that, of our salmonellosis cases, 0.06% and of our campylobacteriosis cases, 0.012% mentioned some form of bird contact, though not necessarily causative.  In other words, cases of these diseases that even mentioned birds as possible risk factors are extremely uncommon. </p><p>The  information that gulls are colonised with bacteria which demonstrate varying levels of antimicrobial resistance does not add to the negligible risks of transmission from gulls to humans. Just because these are AMR pathogens, this does not alter their ability to be spread from these birds to humans and AMR pathogens are just as unlikely as non-AMR pathogens to be spread in this manner. Moreover, among wild birds, gulls would seem to have a lower propensity (as evidenced by their lower rate of carriage) to carry these pathogens than other, far more numerous species, such as crows, starlings and sparrows.</p><p>In Public Health,  health threats are prioritised using a number of parameters (severity of disease, potential for transmission, numbers of cases of illness).  Diseases that have such features as severe of illness, ready transmissibility, or high numbers of cases then become priorities for Public Health interventions such as control and prevention.  Iit is evident that there are extremely low numbers of cases of diseases spread from gulls to humans in this manner and that this is an extremely uncommon way in which humans can acquire these diseases.  It this was a common or significant mode of transmission there would have been considerably greater numbers of these diseases  over the years in which gulls as a potential source of infection were mentioned and there would been evidence of outbreaks of illness that could be validly explained by gull contact.</p><p>The available evidence, while indicating that gulls and other wild birds do carry potentially harmful pathogenic bacteria, does not indicate that they transmit these microbes to any significant extent, or in any meaningful amount, to humans despite these birds having been documented as carrying and excreting these bacteria, in close proximity to humans, for many decades.</p><p>With regard to the Intradepartmental AMR Consultative Committee which was launched in November 2014. This committee advised on the development Ireland&rsquo;s National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (iNAP) which was launched October 25th 2017. An implementation plan for iNAP is currently being drafted.</p></reply>

To do this effectively, we need to spend time 'on the ground', developing positive relationships with Japanese and South Korean buyers, regulators and political counterparts. </p>  <p>  In Japan I met the Minister for Health Labour and Welfare, Minister Katsunobu Kato. This was a useful opportunity to hold high level discussions with a Senior Minister in Japan, with responsibilities in the areas of food safety, standards and certification. I took the opportunity to request that the 30-month age limit on our beef exports be raised and also undertook to begin the process of gaining market access for Irish sheepmeat to Japan. I also met with the State Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Mr Yousuke Isozaki. This was another valuable opportunity to raise awareness of Ireland as a strategic partner from a food perspective, and a similar range of issues was discussed. Indeed, Minister Isozaki, who also holds responsibility for the equine sector, was interested to hear about Ireland&rsquo;s success as a world leader in the thoroughbred horse industry. Parallel to this meeting Department officials held technical discussions with their Japanese counterparts.  </p>  <p>  The Japanese element of the mission was extremely useful in gaining a better understanding of Japan's priorities in the agrifood area, while also raising awareness of Ireland as a potential strategic partner.  Japan has one of the most highly respected food safety systems in the world, and it was important to get the opportunity to let potential Japanese customers know that our own systems are of a similarly high standard. The Ministries of Agriculture and Health both responded very positively to the issues raised, and it is clear that Japan is open to further cooperation and collaboration with Ireland. I also hosted a number of promotional events such as the Bord Bia Origin Green Dairy Seminar, which facilitated further engagement between Irish food companies and potential customers.  </p>  <p>  The Korean leg of the trade mission began with a meeting with the South Korean Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Kim Yung-Rok. During the meeting I emphasised the very high priority that Ireland accords to achieving beef market access to Korea, and the importance of further advancing the process, following on from recent inspection visits. A follow-up meeting has been arranged between Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine officials and Minister Kim's technical experts. </p>  <p>  In South Korea, I had the pleasure of opening an Origin Green Dairy seminar and also addressing &lsquo;The Flavour of Ireland&rsquo; networking reception which showcased the best of Irish food and drink to an audience of South Korean buyers and media.  </p>  <p>  I concluded the trade mission with a meeting with South Korea&rsquo;s Minister for Food and Drug Safety, Minister Ryu. During the meeting it was useful to receive a direct appraisal from the Minister on the progress of our application for market access for Irish beef. While a number of stages remain to be cleared in the multi-stage process before market access can be secured, Minister Ryu indicated that it may be possible to move to the next phase of the process before the end of the year. I also took the opportunity to communicate to the Minister our intention to initiate applications for poultry and sheepmeat access.</p>  <p>  Overall, the 5-day mission was very positive for Irish agrifood ambitions in the region. I met four Senior Ministers in two major economies, engaged with five multi-billion euro companies, and attended thirteen separate promotional events attended by over 400 Japanese and Korean buyers. More importantly, the travelling delegation from the agrifood industry considered the mission a success in terms of helping their efforts to build links in these markets. </p>  <p>  I believe that Trade missions like these play a crucial role in raising the profile of Ireland. They help to build the kind of political, official and commercial relationships that can make a real difference to Irish food and drink exporters, which is, of course, critically important against the background of the challenges presented by Brexit.</p></reply>

It works in partnership with health service providers and similar organisations in Ireland and around the world, to provide the best possible information for the control and prevention of infectious diseases. The roles of the HPSC include providing timely information and independent advice, carrying out disease surveillance, epidemiological investigation and related research and training.</p><p>Earlier this year the HPSC undertook an investigation to determine if gulls posed a potential infectious risk and to attempt to quantify this in the most valid manner.  The main focus of investigation was an examination of the potential for transmission from gulls to man, of infectious disease. An extensive review of the relevant international literature on the evidence for transmission of infectious disease from gulls to man indicated that, although disease carriage is relatively common amongst such birds, there is very little evidence of disease transmission to humans and that wild birds play a limited role in human infectious disease.</p><p>About 5% of gulls are infected with Salmonella.  This is a lower prevalence than many other common wild birds.  For example, amongst starlings and house sparrows, a number of studies agree that the prevalence of carriage of various pathogens is about is in the range of 24% for Salmonella, 4% for Campylobacter and 24% <i>Clostridium perfringens</i>.  About 20% of starlings carry <i>E.coli</i>and the same levels are seen in crows.  Levels of these pathogens are even higher in long distance migratory birds.</p><p>With regard to antibiotic resistant pathogens, in general about 10-15% of isolates carried by wild birds, are resistant to the common (and not so common antibiotics).  Transmission of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by wildbirds is a potential health issue, but it has its greatest potential for impact when the birds acquire these AMR pathogens in countries where there are high levels of AMR.  These can be carried long distances by far-reaching migratory wild birds.  Gulls do not migrate very far, and so tend to be infected with local pathogens.</p><p>A review of 10 years Irish national infectious disease data was carried out to determine how many cases of any infectious disease (but particularly instances of gastrointestinal disease caused by Salmonella and Campylobacter) could be attributed to contact with birds. The aim was to determine the proportion of human infectious disease cases in which wild birds (including gulls) were associated. The results of this investigation showed that in that ten-year period, there were barely a handful of infectious disease cases that could be explained by bird contact.  Between 2006 and 2016, there were just three cases of salmonellosis (two of these mentioned contact with caged, pet birds) and a further two cases of campylobacteriosis (one of which mentioned proximity to gulls). These were suggestive of association but not evidence of cause.  Moreover, there were no outbreaks of human disease over the same 10 year period in which gulls (or any other wild birds) had been implicated as the cause of an outbreak of infectious disease, or even a contributory factor.</p><p>Over the last 10 years there have been in total in Ireland, about 25,500 reported cases of Campylobacter and 3,900 cases of Salmonella.  That investigation found that, of our salmonellosis cases, 0.06% and of our campylobacteriosis cases, 0.012% mentioned some form of bird contact, though not necessarily causative.  In other words, cases of these diseases that even mentioned birds as possible risk factors are extremely uncommon. </p><p>The  information that gulls are colonised with bacteria which demonstrate varying levels of antimicrobial resistance does not add to the negligible risks of transmission from gulls to humans. Just because these are AMR pathogens, this does not alter their ability to be spread from these birds to humans and AMR pathogens are just as unlikely as non-AMR pathogens to be spread in this manner. Moreover, among wild birds, gulls would seem to have a lower propensity (as evidenced by their lower rate of carriage) to carry these pathogens than other, far more numerous species, such as crows, starlings and sparrows.</p><p>In Public Health,  health threats are prioritised using a number of parameters (severity of disease, potential for transmission, numbers of cases of illness).  Diseases that have such features as severe of illness, ready transmissibility, or high numbers of cases then become priorities for Public Health interventions such as control and prevention.  It is evident that there are extremely low numbers of cases of diseases spread from gulls to humans in this manner and that this is an extremely uncommon way in which humans can acquire these diseases.  It this was a common or significant mode of transmission there would have been considerably greater numbers of these diseases  over the years in which gulls as a potential source of infection were mentioned and there would been evidence of outbreaks of illness that could be validly explained by gull contact.</p><p>The available evidence, while indicating that gulls and other wild birds do carry potentially harmful pathogenic bacteria, does not indicate that they transmit these microbes to any significant extent, or in any meaningful amount, to humans despite these birds having been documented as carrying and excreting these bacteria, in close proximity to humans, for many decades.</p><p>With regard to the interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee which was launched in November 2014. This committee advised on the development Ireland&rsquo;s National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (iNAP) which was launched October 25th 2017. An implementation plan for iNAP is currently being drafted.</p></reply>

This was done because commercial operator plans in those areas had not materialised. The school referenced by the Deputies was among the number moved from BLUE to AMBER. As a result, a high speed broadband service will be delivered to the school under the NBP State Intervention.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now at an advanced stage.  &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; submitted by two bidders on 26th September are being evaluated by the NBP specialist team. The next stage in the procurement process is the receipt of final tenders followed by the appointment of a preferred bidder(s) and contract signature.  </p><p>I recognise the importance of availability of high speed connectivity for all premises in Ireland and the frustration for communities, schools and businesses that do not currently have access to this level of connectivity. Delivering connectivity to the 542,000 premises (including 437 schools)  that fall within the State led intervention under the NBP remains a Government priority and my Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract.  </p><p>In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

Removing doubt and confusion will play a huge role in improving the quality of the material that goes in the recycle bin and will also help to ensure that these items are actually recycled, as opposed to being contaminated accidentally by householders and sent to thermal recovery or landfill.</p><p>The list was developed in conjunction with the Regional Waste Management Planning Offices, Repak and the waste management sector.

The scheme is being piloted in Community Healthcare Organisation 7 and is open to people aged 55 and over or aged 12 and under who are living with chronic respiratory conditions in households that are in receipt of the Fuel Allowance or the One-Parent Family Payment.The Warmth and Well-being scheme is a joint policy initiative between my Department and the Department of Health under the Healthy Ireland framework. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the Health Service Executive are working together to deliver the scheme. The HSE have set up a dedicated team to recruit participants to the Warmth and Well-being scheme. They determine eligibility for every person who makes contact with them about the scheme before referring only the eligible applicants to the SEAI. The scheme is being piloted in CHO 7 to build the capacity of the dedicated team that the HSE has been able to establish there. The HSE Warmth and Well-being team have visited 765 homes to date. </p><p>I have allocated &euro;20m to the pilot scheme under the Government&rsquo;s Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty. An independent research project will assess the impact the scheme is having. At the conclusion of the scheme, and with independent evidence on its effectiveness, the potential for a wider roll-out will be considered. The funding to the scheme should provide for the upgrade of at least 1,500 homes. This is the minimum size needed to develop the evidence base on the impact on the health outcomes of participants of making their homes more energy efficient and warmer, and make the business case for a wider roll-out of the scheme. </p><p>To date 395 homes have received upgrades to their homes under the scheme. A further 142 homes have upgrade works on-going and another 115 homes are awaiting an SEAI survey before works can begin. There is a further waiting list with the HSE who will shortly be referred to the SEAI for surveys. The scheme is still open for applications and will continue to run in 2018.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme is available on a nationwide basis to low income households who are at risk of energy poverty.

In a digital age, Smart Meters are the next generation of electricity and gas meter, and are being rolled out across Europe and internationally, replacing older, mechanical meters. By 2020, in Ireland, almost three quarters of a million of existing meters will be more than 40 years old and in need of replacement. The initial priority is to respond to consumers who request a smart meter and also to replace older meters. Smart meters give consumers more choice and information, enabling them to be more proactive in their use of electricity and save money, for example by using appliances at off peak hours.</p>  <p>  This is a significant energy infrastructure project, involving the installation of new meters to over 2.3 million customers nationwide, on a phased basis, a significant part of which is addressing required meter replacement. CRU estimate the cost of the project at &euro;1.2 Billion over the six year roll-out period. This cost will be included in the costs of distribution networks in the same way as all other electricity infrastructure investments are paid for. This will be reflected on consumer bills through an additional cost of approximately &euro;5.50 per annum per customer. It is expected this investment will be more than offset by the potential savings customers will be able to make as a result of the greater information that will be available through the smart meter.</p></reply>

This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan (NBP). </p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p><p>- The  AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing  procurement process.  </p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p><p>- The Light BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to roll-out high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of 2018 as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April. </p><p>There are approximately 33,000 premises in Monaghan. Just over 15,600 (47%) fall within the AMBER area and will be covered under the State led Intervention. Nearly 14,000 (42%) of premises are in a BLUE area and are or will be covered by commercial providers, while approximately 3,500 (11%) are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be covered by eir's planned rural deployment. </p><p>Under this rural deployment, eir is bound to provide access to the premises included in the LIGHT BLUE areas of the Map, including the 3,500 premises in Co Monaghan.  My Department is in regular contact with eir in relation this work and will continue this engagement with the aim of ensuring the requirements of the Commitment Agreement are met. According to information submitted to the Department as of September 2017, eir has passed over 1,200 premises in Monaghan as part of their rural deployment of high speed broadband.</p><p>Concerning the letter referenced by the Deputy, decisions made by private telecommunication operators relating to the roll-out and siting of infrastructure to provide high speed broadband services throughout Ireland, including County Monaghan, are undertaken on a commercial basis by competing service providers operating in a liberalised market. I have no statutory role or function to intervene in the commercial decisions of private operators, and therefore cannot direct operators regarding infrastructure installation or delivery of services. </p><p>I recognise the importance of availability of high speed connectivity for all premises in Ireland and the frustration for communities and businesses that do not currently have access to this level of connectivity.  Delivering connectivity to the 542,000 premises that fall within the State led intervention under the NBP remains a Government priority and my Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract.</p></reply>

With specific regard to hotels, however, it is a statutory requirement that every hotel in Ireland must register its maximum rates with the National Tourism Development Authority (F&aacute;ilte Ireland) and display them in the premises.  Hotels must then operate within the maximum rates set and any customer who feels that they have been overcharged may make a complaint to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p>  <p>  While I welcome the improved viability of the tourism sector, not least because it is a large employer and a significant contributor to the economy, hotels must ensure that this is done at an appropriate rate and in a sustainable way that visitors perceive as reasonable.  If the industry does not continue to provide value for money, the growth it is now experiencing will be undermined.  These are points Minister Ross and I constantly stress in our engagements with the industry.</p>  <p>  Higher rates at times of high demand are a feature of competitive markets, including the accommodation market.  In the specific case of Dublin, a shortage of available hotel bedrooms in the city has caused hotel room rates there to increase in recent years. I am informed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland that the most recent information available to it indicates that the rate of increase in hotel room pricing is slowing.</p>  <p>  Given that the issue is fundamentally one of supply and demand, I welcome the results of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's assessments of hotel accommodation in Dublin, which indicate that there should be sufficient stock to meet projected demand after 2018, with approximately 5,500 bedrooms coming on stream by 2020.  This should moderate price increases.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Government has continued a range of supportive measures, such as the reduced VAT rate, aimed at enhancing Ireland's tourism competitiveness.  With specific regard to factors within the Department's and F&aacute;ilte Ireland's remit, changes introduced in the revised Hotel Regulations introduced in August 2016 should also make investment more attractive by allowing hotel operators provide more rooms and operate at a lower cost base, thus improving hotel capacity, competitiveness and profitability.  Consumers should also benefit from the resulting increased availability, competition and range of accommodation.</p>  <p>  Finally I would like to assure the deputy that this is a matter I keep under constant review. I personally check hotel prices on a regular basis and while I will am concerned some room prices seem excessive it can be said that excellent value can still be found throughout the country.</p></reply>

The report highlighted the lack of access to cooking and storage facilities for families living in hotels and B&amp;amp;Bs. For those who were provided with meals there were also issues around the lack of control that they had over their own, and their children&rsquo;s, food choices and not being able to eat in socially acceptable circumstances as a family.</p><p>The report made a number of recommendations regarding: </p><p>- Recognition of the severe challenges of homelessness for families in emergency accommodation;</p><p>- Standards in emergency accommodation; and</p><p>- Emergency accommodation as a temporary measure.</p><p>The report was commissioned by Focus Ireland and is available on their website at</p><p><i></i>. </p><p>This Government recognises that hotels are inappropriate for accommodating homeless families for anything other than a short period of time and this is reflected in the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, Rebuilding Ireland.

There are currently more than ten such facilities in operation providing temporary accommodation to more than 300 families.  These custom developed hub facilities offer temporary living arrangements for families that have a greater level of stability than is possible in hotel accommodation, including providing for cooking facilities and dining space.</p></reply>

In the last three Budgets (2016, 2017 and 2018) investment in Early Years sector has increased by some 87% which reflects the emphasis being placed on developing a quality service with appropriately supported staff.  This has helped to address affordability, access and quality, although it is recognised that there is more to be done.  Budget 2018 announced an extension of the universal provision of the ECCE scheme accompanied by increases in capitation rates, both standard and higher, by 7% particularly aimed at supporting the workforce. </p>  <p>  Budget 2018 also announced &euro;18 million in Programme Support Payments in 2018 will be provided to Early Years services to assist with non-contact costs.  Programme Support Payments, previously known as non-contact time payments, are now fully secured and will be available again in 2018 and thereafter.  &euro;14.5m was originally secured in Budget 2017, and this was topped up by &euro;3.5m this summer for services who signed up to the September measures. The latter was provided however on a one-off basis. The full allocation of &euro;18 million is now in the early years funding base going forward.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to carrying out an independent review of the cost of providing quality childcare. The 'Independent Review of the Cost of Delivering Quality Childcare' which will be carried out by Crowe Horwath, will examine the costs faced by childcare providers in delivering quality childcare  and will include a survey of childcare providers. Following completion the review is intended to be used to strengthen the evidence base underpinning investment in early years. As such, it will feed into future policy development, including in relation to levels of payments to services.</p>  <p>  In October 2016 Government approved policy proposals for the Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS).  ACS will provide a new basis for funding childcare with both universal and targeted subsidies available for parents of children between six months and age 15.  The scheme will streamline the existing targeted schemes to make them more accessible for both parents and providers; provide a fair and consistent system of progressive financial support towards the cost of childcare; and provide a robust and flexible platform for future investment in childcare in Ireland. </p>  <p>  In the interim, a range of measures have been introduced in September to increase investment in childcare.  The &lsquo;September measures&rsquo; relate to the introduction of the Community Childcare Subvention Universal (CCSU) payment and the increase in band rates across the different strands of the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) Scheme and the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Scheme. As part of these 'September measures', a universal subsidy is available for all children aged between 6 months and 3 years of age (or until they qualify for ECCE if later than 36 months) in registered childcare. This amounts to up to &euro;20 a week or &euro;1,040 per year for children in full time childcare.  </p>  <p>  Although my Department has been successful in securing additional funding for this sector over the past three budgets, as outlined above, it is acknowledged that much more must be done to continue to improve both the affordability and quality of childcare. To this end I will continue to engage with Government colleagues with a view to securing additional investment for the Early Years sector in future budgets. Childcare workers are part of a growing sector, which the Government is strongly supporting. My Department and I believe that by working together with all the stakeholders in the Early Years sector we can ensure that it is a viable and strong sector which makes a significant contribution to the care and personal development of our children. I am committed to ensuring childcare is affordable, accessible and of a high quality.</p>  <p>  In response to the second part of the Deputy's question, while the early childhood education and care sector is largely funded and regulated by my Department (DCYA), the Department of Education and Skills (DES) plays an important role in the development and implementation of the two national practice frameworks, S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  DES also supports and advises DCYA on qualifications and workforce development and is in the process of conducting a review of education and training programmes for early years practitioners.  DES, with its agencies, works to ensure that there is a smooth transition for children from pre-school into the primary school sector and also supports DCYA in the implementation of AIM.  On my behalf, the Department of Education and Skills has put in place early years education-focused inspections which inspect the educational provision in the ECCE programme.  However, beyond the promotion of this alignment and support for quality, there is no plan to further integrate the schools sector, statutory provision for which lies with the Minister for Education &amp;amp; Skills, with the formal ECEC sector which is my responsibility as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p></reply>

CIB has taken this operational decision following years of analysis of options and a detailed consultation period with all stakeholders on the need for a more streamlined governance model. The changes are being made at local company board level only. The valuable work carried out by employees and volunteers working in CIS services and employees of MABS services will continue as heretofore. </p>  <p>  The staff and boards throughout the CIS &amp;amp; MABS network have been assured   by CIB that there will be no changes to the terms and conditions of staff, no change to the level of service delivered to clients and no reduction in the level of investment in the services across the country.</p>  <p>  The Citizens Information Board has been allocated   &euro;57.410 million to fund its activities and that of its service delivery partners for 2018.

According to the records of my Department, the person concerned has a social insurance record of 1,719 reckonable contributions and credits.  A reduced state pension (contributory) was awarded based on an assessed yearly average of 36 contributions, covering the period from December 1968 to December 2016.  The person concerned is in receipt of the correct rate of contributory pension based on this record.  Any gaps in the person&rsquo;s insurance record will impact on the person&rsquo;s overall yearly average and, consequently, on their rate of weekly pension entitlement.  </p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for state pension (contributory) easier for a claimant who has taken time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years (since 1994) spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or for an incapacitated person(s), to be disregarded when the claimant&rsquo;s social insurance record is being assessed for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, and making it easier for them to qualify for the most beneficial rate of state pension (contributory).  As part of the pension eligibility assessment of the person concerned, a disregard of one year and an award of 24 additional credits in the person&rsquo;s yearly average calculation resulted from home-making periods from 6 April 1994 to 19 September 1995.  </p>  <p>  If the person concerned considers they have additional contributions or credits that have not been recorded, it is open to them to forward documentary evidence of the missing periods of employment to my Department and their pension entitlement will be reviewed. </p>  <p>  The changes made to rate bands in 2012 more closely reflect the social insurance contribution history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are more proportionate with their level of contribution. </p>  <p>  My Department is examining in depth whether the 2012 rate band changes have impacted disproportionately or unfairly on specific groups in relation to the contributions they have made for the pension they receive.  If that is the case, measures to alleviate that impact on people who have reduced pension entitlements following the 2012 changes, would be considered.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In isolation, credits do not give entitlement to social insurance benefits. In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits can assist employees qualifying for short-term schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Credits may also enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes such as the level of payment of State pension contributory (SPC), but only where the individual has already met the condition relating to the minimum number of paid contributions.</p>  <p>  To qualify for credits an individual must satisfy entitlement to the credits scheme.  While there are no self-employed credits, individuals who were previously employed can access the scheme in the same manner as other workers, subject to meeting the conditions of the scheme.  In general credits can only be awarded where an individual has had a recent attachment to the workforce as an employee i.e. within the last 2 years.  Therefore credits are not automatically awarded to all recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance.  </p>  <p>  Individuals who are caring on a full-time basis, including those in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance may, however, qualify for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is designed to help home-makers and carers protect their SPC entitlement, and applies to home-making periods since 6 April 1994.  It applies to the self-employed on the same basis as it does to other workers.</p>  <p>  The scheme provides that years spent working in the home while caring on a full-time basis for a child up to 12 years of age or an incapacitated person age 12 or over will be disregarded in calculating a person's yearly average number of contributions for the purposes of determining the rate of their entitlement to SPC. In this way the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme ensures that an individual&rsquo;s entitlement to SPC is protected during periods spent caring.</p></reply>

I was impressed with what I saw and since then, I have met with O'Cualann&rsquo;s representatives to discuss how the homes delivered in Ballymun can be delivered at greater scale.  My Department has also arranged meetings involving O&rsquo;Cualann, Dublin City Council and the Irish Council for Social Housing. </p>  <p>  It is precisely for the purpose of scaling up delivery of this type of affordable housing that I am providing funding of &euro;25 million, over 2018 and 2019.  The funding will be made available to unlock local authority owned lands specifically for affordable housing, using models such as this which have already proven to be successful but are now needed at greater scale.  It is estimated that over 650 such new affordable homes could be facilitated under the new scheme.</p>  <p>  I understand that, working with Dublin City Council, AIB and industry professionals, &Oacute; Cualann delivered new 2-, 3- and 4-bed, A2 rated, quality homes with sales prices ranging from &euro;140,000 to &euro;220,000.  Importantly, in terms of the model used, the Council provided serviced &ldquo;ready to go&rdquo; sites at very low cost, facilitating the affordable delivery and ultimate sales prices of the homes.  </p>  <p>  My Department is meeting with the Dublin local authorities this week to discuss how the new scheme will operate, and I expect to be in a position to issue a call for proposals on this matter in early 2018.</p></reply>

The guidance also covers a range of scenarios that may arise for victims of domestic violence in seeking social housing supports, including provisions around the use of the Housing Assistance Payment scheme, or the Rental Accommodation Scheme, where a victim has a joint interest in the family home, or ownership of alternative accommodation, but would otherwise qualify for social housing support.  </p>  <p>  I understand that this guidance has been positively received and broadly welcomed by housing authorities and the domestic violence services sector.  My Department is not aware of  any reports to suggest that the guidance is not being implemented across the local authority sector and, accordingly, at this time, I have no plans to meet the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, specifically in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

This right runs throughout people&rsquo;s lives, irrespective of where they come from, where they live, their religious beliefs or their economic or social backgrounds.  In line with these policy objectives, my Department's Creative Ireland programme continues to promote the Traveller Mentoring Program and in 2017, through Cork City Council, funded the renovation of the Traveller Culture Exhibition at Cork Public Museum in 2017, with the refurbishment designed by visual artist and Traveller Leanne McDonagh </p>  <p>  In addition, the Arts Council, in particular  arrange of supports for work in the context of the Traveller Community under the Arts Participation Scheme and the Artist in Community Scheme, managed by Create on the Arts Council&rsquo;s behalf which, actively encourages artists to work in a culturally diverse context including among the Traveller Community.  The work of artists from the Traveller Community has also been recognised this year with the election to Aosd&aacute;na of playwright Rosaleen McDonagh and the award of the Council&rsquo;s Next Generation Bursary Award for 2017 to Visual Artist, Leanne McDonagh.</p>  <p>The Cultural Institutions are also active in this space and this year, the Chester Beatty Library has partnered with the National Concert Hall as part of Dublin City Council&rsquo;s Dublin Culture Connects under which, the poet Stephen James Smith is working with the traveller women&rsquo;s group at Labre Park in Ballyfermot to look at shared stories.  The National Museum is planning a major exhibition with the Traveller Community to be hosted in the Museum of Country Life from June 2018.  The exhibition will focus on the traditions, customs and history of the Traveller community over the years.</p>  <p>  My Department is also represented on the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy Steering Group, which monitors the implementation and progress of the recently published the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021.  I look forward to working with my Department and those bodies under its aegis in developing these important initiatives.</p></reply>
