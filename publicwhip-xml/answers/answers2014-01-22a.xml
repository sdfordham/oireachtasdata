I have reiterated this commitment in the new Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016, which I published last week. One of the four key themes in the new Reform Plan is the delivery of improved outcomes for service users through the use of new models of delivery, including the use of external providers where appropriate.</p><p>  Good progress has already been made by Government in this area, as set out in the Second Progress Report on the Public Service Reform Plan, which I also published last week. In July 2012, we agreed a range of actions aimed at achieving a focused and integrated approach to the external delivery of non-core processes, with the objective of reducing costs and focusing staff resources on priority areas. </p><p>  All new services must be tested for external service delivery suitability before any approval to deliver the service internally will be granted. For example, the Revenue Commissioners have appointed a third party call service centre to deal with queries on the Local Property Tax. </p><p>  The major sectors of Health, Justice and Local Government have prepared and are now implementing detailed benefits-driven external service delivery plans. The Education sector; the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Social Protection; the Office of Public Works and the Revenue Commissioners are finalising their plans, which will be brought to Government shortly, and we have made a commitment in the new Reform Plan that all remaining Departments and Offices will prepare and submit plans by the end of the third quarter of this year.</p><p>  A cross-organisational evaluation of the Debt Management functions of a number of public bodies has been completed and the project board overseeing this process will be bringing a set of proposals for the future delivery of these services to Government shortly.</p><p>  We are building capacity and capability through training programmes, workshops and seminars. An external service delivery handbook and preliminary business case template has been developed and distributed to public servants.</p></reply>

No approvals have been issued for new appointments in excess of these pay ceilings where they apply. </p><p>  Since the application of the pay ceiling, direct pay reductions, on a progressive scale starting at 5.5% and rising to 10%, have been applied by the Government to all public servants with salaries of &euro;65,000 or more under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 from 1 July 2013. </p><p>  Based on the information available within my Department regarding post holders in Government Departments, State agencies and semi-State bodies, the Chief Executive Officer of the National Roads Authority retains an approved salary level in excess of &euro;200,000 as his appointment pre dated the imposition of the salary cap. I am also aware that there are staff in the Central Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency whose salary exceeds &euro;200,000.  </p><p>  There are also 2 Chief Executive Officers in the commercial state sector who are on salary levels above &euro;250,000.  The appointment of the CEO of the Irish Aviation Authority also predates the salary ceiling decision.   </p><p>  When introducing the general pay cap of &euro;250,000 for Chief Executive Officers of Commercial State Companies, the Government decided that the CEO of the ESB would be paid a higher amount given the importance of the role. The CEO of ESB was appointed subsequently at an annual  salary of &euro;295,00 which represented a reduction of 43% in the maximum of the scale that applied to the previous incumbent of the post.  </p><p>  With regard to other classes of senior public servants, </p><p>- 5 persons in the Universities retain salary levels above the ceiling.</p><p>- At the time of the introduction of the pay ceiling it was indicated that the Minister for Health would address consultant salaries in the context of discussions arising in relation to the consultant contract under the Public Service Agreement. Following discussions with representative associations under the Public Service Agreement, a 30 per cent reduction in consultant rates for new appointees was implemented with effect from October 1, 2012. It is estimated that some 62 academic consultants are on approved salary rates above &euro;200,000.</p><p>- Following the passage of the referendum on judicial pay in 2011 and of the subsequent legislation implementing the paycuts, certain members of the senior judiciary and the President retain pay rates greater than the salary ceiling.</p><p>  As I have already noted, the salaries of all these public servants, with the exception of the President whose salary is afforded constitutional protection, were reduced under the recent legislation.   </p><p>  None of these figures are reflective of any voluntary arrangement that the individuals concerned may have entered into, following the Government decision in June 2011 to seek voluntary waivers of salary of 15%, or by a lesser amount if the application of the full 15% reduction would bring the salary levels of such individuals to below the pay ceiling of &euro;200,000 p.a. across the public service and of &euro;250,000 within Commercial State Companies.</p></reply>

It is proposed that a sub-panel of Irish language functional bilinguals comprising up to 6% of the overall EO panel size, will be created. </p><p>  In the case of Departmental recruitment and promotion competitions, an assessment will be made of the requirement for functional bilinguals and, where necessary and appropriate, a sub-panel of functional bilinguals will be put in place. </p><p>  Where a post is identified as requiring proficiency in Irish, the intention is that it should be filled by a functional bilingual. The use of staff currently serving in such posts will be a matter for the individual Departments to decide.</p><p>  As part of the implementation of these new arrangements, my officials wrote to Departments on 17 December last, asking them to review the workforce planning frameworks previously submitted and to identify posts/areas of work requiring functional bilinguals and to include these in a revised workforce action plan. This exercise is expected to provide information on the demand from Departments for functional bilinguals and will facilitate arrangements being put in place to ensure that the requirement for Government Departments to provide services through Irish is met.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-01-22a.33.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012200069#WRC00231"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 28 together.</p><p>  The Government published the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2012 on 3rd August, 2012 as part of its legislative programme. The Bill proceeded through its second stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 11th October 2012. </p><p>  At the outset, let me say that the Bill will not change the basis of valuation for rating purposes. This will continue to be &quot;net annual value&quot; which is the hypothetical rental value of a property as assessed by reference to a specified date. This is a long standing principle of the rateable valuation system in Ireland and ensures equity and fairness in relation to the values of commercial and industrial properties across a local authority area.</p><p>  The primary purpose of the Bill is to accelerate the national programme of revaluing every commercial and industrial property in the country which is being undertaken by the Valuation Office. The Bill amends several provisions contained in the Valuation Act 2001. These amendments include a number of technical changes to Part 5 of the 2001 Act which deals with how valuations, including revaluation of entire rating authority areas, are carried out. The Bill also proposes to amend Part 6, which deals with the carrying out of revisions of the rateable valuation of individual properties within rating authority areas between revaluations. In both instances, it is envisaged that the Commissioner of Valuation will appoint officers to carry out the tasks in question and the Bill makes specific provision for the appointment of &quot;revision managers&quot;. Section 6 of the Bill proposes to amend Section 19 of the Valuation Act 2001 by enabling the Commissioner to appoint persons to carry out the revaluation of entire rating authority areas. Such persons may be an officer of the Commissioner. However, provision is also made for the Commissioner to enter into an arrangement with a person or persons (other than officers of the Commissioner) to assist in the performance of the revaluation function. The effect of this provision is to enable the Commissioner to contract out some of the revaluation work, in order to augment the in-house capacity of the Valuation Office. This is one of the express provisions intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme. I understand that, following enactment of the Bill, the Commissioner intends running a pilot revaluation project which will utilise such external resources.</p><p>  Following enactment of the Bill, it is envisaged that revaluation projects can be conducted through the normal direct assessment methodology.  However, the Bill (Section 11, inserting a new Part 5A into the 2001 Act) also provides for the Commissioner to conduct a revaluation using elements of self-assessment by ratepayers. This provision is also intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme and I understand that, following enactment of the Bill, the Commissioner intends running a pilot project which will utilise self-assessment principles. I also wish to draw the attention of the Deputies to Section 22 of the Bill which proposes to amend Section 48 of the 2001 Act by providing for the use of general market data or aggregated data (including statistical and computer-aided techniques) in determining valuations, where the Commissioner considers it appropriate to do so.</p><p>  Since the 2nd  stage debate was taken in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, officials in my Department and the Valuation Office have engaged in an extensive consultation process on various aspects of the Bill with a range of stakeholders. While the legislation is quite complex, the amendments to be proposed at Committee Stage in the Seanad are at an advanced stage of drafting. Every effort is being made to expedite the passage of the Bill and I expect to see it progressing through the Oireachtas before the Summer recess.</p></reply>

The output of this important project will be an integrated plan of specific measures to address, in a comprehensive and sustainable way, the significant flood risk factors in the Shannon basin, including the Callows area.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, operational control of water flows and levels on the Shannon is the responsibility of both the ESB and Waterways Ireland.  In order to address ongoing concerns that the existing water level control regime may be a contributory factor in early Summer flooding in the Callows, the OPW facilitated discussions between these principal operating stakeholders toward agreeing a new interim control regime on the regulation of levels.  Under this interim regime the ESB agreed to a trial lowering of the Spring/early Summer target levels in Lough Ree to reduce somewhat the risk of summer flooding, particularly in the Shannon Callows area.  This trial commenced in Summer 2013 and will remain in place until the publication of the Shannon CFRAM Plan.</p><p>  On foot of discussions between my colleague, Minister of State Hayes and the IFA, and with the cooperation of both the ESB and Waterways Ireland, a water level monitoring exercise is being carried out as part of the CFRAM process which will allow for analysis of water flows and levels at key points around the Lough Ree and Callows areas.  Data from this exercise has been collated and the results have been forwarded to the CFRAM consultants.  This data will feed into the overall Shannon CFRAM study and the interim data will be published on the website, .  The OPW will continue to review these developments on a regular basis in consultation with the ESB and Waterways Ireland.</p></reply>

Work is under way in my Department on updating this figure; this exercise will estimate the position as of December 2012, and will take into account the relevant changes in public service pay and pensions over recent years. It is expected that the updated estimate of the accrued liability will be available early this year.  The updated liability figure arising from this exercise will be an important consideration in the ongoing development of public service pension policy.  Notwithstanding that the revised total liability figure is awaited, I am satisfied that adequate planning and provision is being made for the future payment of public service pensions, though this is naturally a matter which is kept under close review.  My view is based on a series of cost containment measures put in place over recent years affecting existing pensioners, serving staff and new recruits.</p><p>  The most significant cost-saving reform has been the introduction in January 2013 of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme , also known as the Single Scheme, which is the default pension scheme  for new-hire workers across the entire public service.  This landmark reform targets very substantial long-run savings of about one third of pension outgoing, with those savings deriving mainly from career-average (not final-salary) pension accrual, inflation (not pay) linkage of benefits, and higher minimum pension age (effectively 68 years for most new joiners).</p><p>  Several other measures have also been taken over recent years which help to curb public service pension costs as follows:<blockquote>- In 2004 minimum pension age for new-joiner public service workers was raised from 60 to 65 years.<br /><br />- In 2010 public service pay cuts averaging approximately 7% were applied.  Further pay cuts affecting public servants with annual earnings above &euro;65,000 were applied in July 2013.  These various pay reductions act to reduce individual pension and lump sum awards to persons retiring from the public service.<br /><br />- In 2011 public service pensions in payment above &euro;12,000 were reduced via a multi-band progressively structured Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR), which had an average impact of 4% on pensions.<br /><br />- In July 2013, further cuts in public service pension payment rates, via adjustments to the rates and scope of the PSPR, and amounting to between 2% and 5%, were imposed on pensions in excess of &euro;32,500. This adjustment brings the full-year saving from PSPR to a projected &euro;125 million.</blockquote></p></reply>

The revaluation programme which has been completed in three County Council areas in Dublin, began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to the areas covered by Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December 2007, Fingal was completed in 2009 and D&uacute;n Laoghaire- Rathdown was completed in 2010.  After publication of the revaluation, the Act provides for an appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation and following the Commissioner's decision on this appeal, the ratepayer has the further option of making an appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal.  There is also a further appeal on a point of law to the High and Supreme Courts.</p><p>  In reply to the Deputy's question, I am setting out the number of appeals received by the Commissioner of Valuation following the publication of the revaluation results in the three local authority areas where the revaluation has been completed.

Prior to 2011, two separate reductions, each amounting to 8%, had been effected in regard to legal fees. In the period from 2011 onwards, these reductions have been augmented by a range of measures including:</p><p>1. a reduction of 10% in Criminal Legal Aid fees;</p><p>2. changes in regard to one day fees in the District Court, rates payable in respect of travel and subsistence and the rate paid for sentence fees in the Circuit and Higher Courts;</p><p>3. the introduction of a pre-approval process prior to the engagement of expert witnesses and a time limit of 24 months for submission of fee claims;</p><p>4. a further 10% reduction in brief and refresher fees paid by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in parallel with reductions in fees payable under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme; and</p><p>5. a 10% reduction in Tribunal fees.</p><p>  With the objective of further reducing legal costs, my Department has supported the introduction in both the Chief State Solicitor's Office and that of the Director of Public Prosecutions of enhanced mechanisms for rigorous examination of claims.  These enhanced mechanisms and reductions in fee levels have resulted in a dramatic decline in expenditure on legal fees - for example, expenditure incurred by the Chief State Solicitor's Office on fees to counsel has been reduced by 46% since 2008.</p><p>  It is intended to examine the level of legal fees across Government Departments and agencies in the light of the relevant expenditure allocations decided by the Government in the context of the recently-published Revised Estimates Volume 2014.  It is envisaged that my Department will engage with the relevant parties with a view to achieving the necessary adjustments to ensure adherence to such allocations.</p><p>  In addition, my Department, through the Office of Government Procurement, has a particular responsibility to assist public bodies that procure legal services with the objective of leveraging resources in order to achieve best value for money. In that regard the Office of Government Procurement will work across Government Departments and Agencies to examine legal services spend across the public service, will conduct a review of the markets for the various different services involved such as employment law, conveyancing, tax law, etc. and determine appropriate commercial strategies to address the markets.</p></reply>

It is open to the Local Authorities to apply for funding to deal with coastal protection under the Office of Public Works' (OPW) Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme.  Any application received will be assessed under the eligibility criteria, which include a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding.</p><p>  OPW wrote on 10th January, 2014 to City and County Managers in coastal areas indicating that it will accept applications under its Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme for funding to assist with repairs to built flood defences and coastal protection structures which have been damaged by the recent storms.  This is a once-off measure to reinstate built coastal defences to their pre storm condition.  The specific application form for this entitled Coastal Storm Damage Flooding Questionnaire 2014 is available on OPW's website www.opw.ie under Flood Risk Management.  Any work for which funding is sought will be carried out by the local authorities.</p><p>  It is not possible at this point to say what amount of funding will be made available to assist Local Authorities in dealing with the storm damage to coastal protection structures.  This will depend on the submissions received and the assessment of those submissions.  Applications approved for funding under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme will be funded from OPW's overall Flood Risk Management capital allocation, which for 2014 is &euro;44.2m.  It is also open to Local Authorities to carry out flood mitigation and coastal protection works using their own resources.</p><p>  Coastal erosion is a natural and ongoing process and needs to be considered in a holistic way as its impact can vary greatly in different locations and over time.  It only becomes a problem when it threatens human life, infrastructure and properties.  The Government recognises this and is taking active measures to assess and monitor the risks of coastal erosion.  The Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) is a major examination to assess and identify the most significant areas of erosion risk for the entire national coastline.  This major study is effectively complete and it will provide invaluable and essential information required to inform policy in this area going forward particularly for Local Authorities in relation to the proper planning and development of coastal areas.</p></reply>

In July 2012, the Government agreed a range of actions aimed at achieving a focused and integrated approach to external service delivery of non-core processes with the objective of reducing costs and focusing staff resources on priority areas.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that shared services is a key area of reform being led by my Department. In this regard, each appraisal for shared services carried out by my Department evaluated the existing in-house service, the external delivery option and whether the service can be retained in-house but with business process improvements. Each decision took into account a number of factors, including overall cost, quality of service, effectiveness and the public interest. A Financial Appraisal was prepared in respect of the Human Resources to become a shared service which was implemented providing services to 13 organisations and a further 40 in 2014. Forecasted savings of &euro;12.5m per annum are estimated with a reduction of 149 staff. A Business case for a Pensions Shared Services Centre is well advanced and expected to save &euro;5.6m per annum with a reduction of 56 staff. Non-financial benefits including improved efficiency, consistency and service delivery are also expected.</p><p><b></b> Within the Vote Group for which I am responsible, the Office of Public Works is involved in outsourcing much of its work.  A significant proportion of the workforce is dedicated to managing the outsourced service delivery to ensure the provision of value for money, quality services to client Departments and Agencies and to ensure all of its actions are compliant with legislation, regulations and good governance.  The Office of Public Works also provides a shared service in the area of property management and property maintenance to central Government Departments and Agencies.  It is currently responsible for the management over 2,000 properties. The OPW routinely commissions external service providers to deliver these services.  </p><p>  In addition, the OPW invites proposals on an annual basis from event organisers for high profile Heritage sites to maximise the use of these sites and to enhance the visitor experience.  This has been extended to include other commercial activities on OPW sites in 2014.  A number of proposals are being considered currently.  The OPW was one of a number of bodies requested to prepare an External Service Delivery Plan in 2013.  That Plan has identified a number of areas where further opportunities for External Service Delivery can be explored and these are being considered for implementation in 2014.  This Plan is due to be considered by Government shortly.</p><p>  The Public Appointments Service outsourced Call Centres for the Garda Trainee recruitment campaign and the Internal Promotion campaigns at HEO and AP level being run for other Departments/Offices in the civil service.  Following two separate procurement exercises the contract for these projects were awarded to the company &quot;Call Management&quot;.  This part of the process was outsourced in order to allow staff to deliver on a large number of campaigns at the same time and deal with very large potential candidate pools. It was considered more efficient to engage external call-centre support rather than recruiting temporary staff to deal with short intensive peaks in activity.  In addition, my Department will be preparing its own benefits-driven external service delivery plan during 2014.</p></reply>

The Office of Public Works (OPW) responded to the Committee by way of a written reply in September 2012, in relation to the specific matters within the OPW's area of responsibility. The main area addressed in the reply related to the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) programme and how the OPW is addressing flood risk on the River Shannon in the context of the CFRAM Programme.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that Jacobs Engineering are the consultants on the Shannon CFRAM study.  The Committee Report was forwarded to Jacobs for consideration in the context of the Shannon CFRAM Study.  In this regard, he will also recall the Shannon Levels Operations Report, produced by Jacobs in 2012 and on which the Committee received a briefing in late 2012.  The OPW, with the cooperation of both the ESB and Waterways Ireland, has facilitated the carrying out of a water level monitoring exercise, as part of the CFRAM process, which will allow for analysis of water flows and levels at key points around the Lough Ree and Callows areas. The hydrometric data collated from the water flow/level exercise has been provided to the CFRAM consultants for its consideration within the CFRAM project.  Any conclusions to be drawn from the exercise will form part of the CFRAM study.  This data will be published shortly on the CFRAM website, .</p></reply>

This is a once-off measure to reinstate built coastal defences to their pre-storm condition.  The specific application form for this, entitled Coastal Storm Damage Flooding Questionnaire 2014, is available on the OPW's website, www.opw.ie, under Flood Risk Management.

The situation has deteriorated in recent months due to an acute economic and energy crisis caused by the long standing restrictions on the movement of people and goods from Gaza, but was further exacerbated by the winter storms in December. </p><p>  In response to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza in 2013, Ireland provided additional funding of &euro;500,000 to UNRWA (the UN agency dedicated to responding to the needs of Palestinian refugees) to support the food assistance element of their Gaza Emergency Appeal.  This brings Ireland's total contribution to UNRWA's appeals for Gaza to &euro;4.64 million since 2006 and underlies our continuing commitment to meeting the emergency needs of the Palestinian people.  UNRWA's food assistance provides a lifeline for thousands of refugee families in Gaza and helps to prevent a potentially large scale crisis in a context where an estimated 57% of households are classified as food insecure.  This funding support was in addition to Ireland's broader programme of assistance to the Palestinian people and brought our total funding support in 2013 to &euro;10.7 million.  This included support to UNRWA's general fund, the Palestinian Authority, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and civil society organisations working to promote human rights and democratisation.</p><p>  In the coming year, Ireland will continue to support actively the search for a lasting and peaceful political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as well as the wider region.  The Government will continue to press, at both political and diplomatic levels, for an end to the blockade of Gaza.  The Government has also appealed to all relevant parties &ndash; especially Israel but also Palestinian leaders and Egypt &ndash; to take account of the effect their policies are having on the people of Gaza.  In the meantime, we will continue, as we have done for many years, to offer the humanitarian support which is essential in addressing the ongoing basic and emergency needs of the Palestinian people.</p></reply>

However, Palestine has not yet done so, and is not at present a party to the Statute.  At the time of the General Assembly vote in 2012 the UK was one of many states, including many who voted in favour of granting Palestine observer state status, who expressed concern that any decision to accede to the Rome Statute simply in order to open another front in an already complex and deadlocked conflict with Israel might be counterproductive to efforts to achieve a negotiated peace agreement. </p><p>  The consent or acquiescence of existing State Parties is not required for an eligible party to become a party to the Statute.  The issue of the UK or other states recognising Palestine as a member of the International Criminal Court, and of Ireland making representations to them on the subject, does not therefore arise.</p></reply>

Sovereign immunity, also known as State immunity, is an established principle of customary international law and is recognised in Irish law, although there is no domestic legislation on the topic.  This was acknowledged by the Supreme Court in the case of Canada v Employment Appeals Tribunal (1992).  The State is required as a matter of law to respect sovereign immunity. </p><p>  Sovereign immunity means that, subject to certain exceptions, states are not subject to the jurisdiction of other states.  Sovereign immunity may also apply to officials &ndash; for example officials of one state visiting the territory of another state may be immune from arrest and trial.  The fact that immunity applies, however, does not exempt states or their officials from their obligation to respect the law and nor does it prevent the investigation of any alleged criminal offence.  Sovereign immunity is procedural only and may be waived by the state enjoying it.</p><p>  As I have said on previous occasions, where allegations of extraordinary rendition through Shannon Airport have been made, including by members of the Oireachtas, these have been fully investigated by senior officers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In no case has any evidence been adduced to support claims that extraordinary rendition had occurred.  If anyone has evidence to suggest that any person subject to extraordinary rendition has transited an Irish airport, this evidence should be made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, so that an investigation can take place.</p></reply>

This is a repayment scheme to qualifying road haulage and bus operators of a part of the mineral oil tax paid on their purchases of auto-diesel for use in the course of business. </p><p>  In order to qualify for the repayment, the auto-diesel must be purchased by the qualifying road transport operator; either in bulk (a quantity over 2,000 litres) or by means of a fuel card approved by Revenue for that purpose. Purchases in bulk must be made from a licensed mineral oil trader, and delivered to a premises or place that is under the control of a qualifying road transport operator. </p><p>  These restrictions as to the means by which the auto-diesel concerned may be purchased are necessary for the management and control of the repayment scheme by Revenue, so that it is not subject to abuse. Bulk purchases from licensed mineral oil traders will be verified by reference to the monthly electronic returns that the oil traders are required to make. Revenue will only approve a fuel card where they are satisfied that the fuel card provider will supply them with the information required by Revenue about purchases of auto-diesel by means of that card.</p><p>  There are a number of fuel card providers who can supply suitable fuel cards to road transport operators who operate on a smaller scale.</p><p>  The scheme was the subject of considerable discussion with the haulage sector and I believe the scheme strikes the right balance between facilitating the legitimate haulage sector and preventing fraudulent claims. Revenue will be closely monitoring the scheme and will continue to engage with sectors involved.</p></reply>

The Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit will be of the same value, i.e. &euro;1,650, as the existing One-Parent Family Tax Credit and will also carry the same entitlement to the extended standard rate tax band of &euro;36,800 per annum. However, the new credit will be more targeted in that it will, in the first instance, only be available to the principal carer of the child.</p><p>  When this measure was introduced in Budget 2014 it was estimated by the Revenue Commissioners that up to 15,400 individuals may be affected by the restriction of the restructured credit to the principal carer. However, as a result of an amendment which I brought forward at the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill which allows a primary carer to relinquish the credit such that it can be claimed by a non-primary carer, it is estimated that this number will reduce by 2,000 to 13,400. Ultimately however, the numbers affected will depend on the caring arrangements in place for each case.</p><p>  Furthermore, at the time of the Budget it was estimated by the Revenue Commissioners that the expected yield from replacing the One-Parent Family Tax Credit with the Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit would be &euro;18 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in a full year. The amendment introduced at Committee Stage of the Finance Bill had the effect of reducing this estimated yield to &euro;16 million in 2014 and to &euro;22.5 million in a full year.</p></reply>

The Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit is of the same value, i.e. &euro;1,650, as the former One-Parent Family Tax Credit and also carries the same entitlement to the extended standard rate tax band of &euro;36,800 per annum. However, the new credit will be more targeted in that it will, in the first instance, only be available to the principal carer of the child.</p><p>  The person who receives the child benefit payment is being used as the initial indicator by the Revenue Commissioners to identify the individuals who are most likely to qualify for the new credit.  However, eligibility for the credit will in the first place be determined by who cares for the child for most of the year.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, as a result of an amendment which I brought forward at Committee stage of the Finance Bill, a primary claimant who is entitled to the credit and who does not wish to avail of it can choose to surrender it.  A secondary claimant may then make a claim for the credit, provided that the qualifying child resides with him or her for not less than 100 days in the tax year.  Neither the primary claimant, nor the secondary claimant can be married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting.</p></reply>

The Department will continue to provide a book grant as usual to all primary schools. This grant, can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's existing book rental scheme.  I want to commend all schools that have used it to help build up book rental schemes over the years. Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.  Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child. Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim.  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget. Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents. The parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support.

However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down Syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process.  In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs. </p><p>  The NCSE has established a Working Group to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report. I understand that the Working Group will report its findings before the end of Spring 2014.</p></reply>

For instance, in 2012, the Momentum initiative was announced following a two-stage application process for providers, where value for money as well as quality formed part of the evaluation process.  This initiative is providing 6,500 training places which are offered by both public and private providers.  In June 2013, following a competitive process a new round of Springboard was announced which includes 6,000 places on 200 courses in 38 Institutes of Technology, Universities and privately-run higher education colleges.</p><p>  Arising from a Government Decision in July 2012, Departments are required, when evaluating any proposed new service, to include an appraisal of the costs and benefits of delivering the service using external providers.  While, to date, no proposal for a new Department service has been considered under this provision, my Department is addressing the issue of external service delivery in the context of other initiatives underway across the Education sector, such as the use of aggregated procurement and the assessment of potential shared services projects.  The Department has also identified a number of functions for further consideration as to their suitability for external service delivery and these will be assessed in the coming months.</p></reply>

Administrative burdens will be reduced, procurement procedures simplified, and costs related to tendering lowered by making procurement systems more transparent.  The use of e-procurement will also simplify the processes and foster greater competition. It will strengthen the generation of jobs and growth, given that public authorities across the European Union spend approximately &euro;2 trillion per annum (some 19% of EU GDP) on the procurement of goods, services and works.</p><p>  Some of the measures included in the reform of the general procurement rules that will facilitate SME involvement include:</p><p>- Acceptance of self-declarations until the award stage and the promotion of e-procurement with mandatory electronic availability of procurement documents;</p><p>- Except in justified cases, turnover requirements are to be explicitly limited to two times the estimated contract value;</p><p>- Contracting Authorities will now have to comply or explain in relation to the division of contracts into lots;</p><p>- Member states will be required to provide the Commission with detail on SME participation.  Such monitoring can support consistent application across all Member States and ensure that the objective of greater SME involvement is being delivered.</p><p>  In addition, the new Directive on concessions will be ensure Union wide competition for high value concessions where the most efficient providers are given a fair chance of winning the contract. This will enable Irish business to have greater access to high value contracts within the EU.</p><p>  Given current budgetary constraints it is vital that the public procurement market works effectively to deliver value for money. Inflexible procedures, which limit the ability to negotiate, have restricted the opportunities to promote innovation in public procurement. There will be a new innovation partnership procedure in both the Classical and Utilities Directives. The shortening of times limits and greater flexibility in the choice of procedure can facilitate delivery of value for money by contracting authorities alongside the provision of innovative solutions.</p><p>  In summary, the package will promote simplified procurement, better access for SMEs, sound procedures and governance, and improved value for money. While the transposition of these new rules is a priority for Government, it is important to ensure that the transposition is carried out in a manner that maximises the aforementioned benefits. Member States have two years to transpose the three Directives. However, I am keen to ensure that Ireland can avail of the flexibility afforded by these Directives and with this in mind my officials are prioritising this area of work with the view to completion by early next year.</p><p>* Concessions are partnerships between the public sector and mostly private companies, where the latter exclusively operate, maintain and carry out the development of infrastructure (i.e. ports, water distribution, parking garages, toll roads) or provide services of general economic interest (energy, water and waste disposal).</p></reply>

The OGP's mission is to deliver sustainable procurement savings for the tax payer by optimising value for money across the public service.</p><p>  The OGP will be head-quartered in Dublin. However, as there are public service staff in different locations across the country that have the necessary skills and expertise to make a positive contribution to the work of the OGP, it is planned to have a number of OGP offices in regional locations. In order to determine the right number of offices and their locations, the OGP has asked each sector to collate data to assist the OGP in identifying geographical locations where critical mass, skills, experience and expertise currently exists. The collation of this data is currently underway.</p><p>  In terms of staffing, the OGP will need to attract experienced procurement staff from across the public sector to join it. In planning for this staff migration, cognisance is being given to both Croke Park and Haddington Road Agreements. Any expressions of interest / recruitment process will be coordinated across the Public Service by the Public Appointment Service aimed at filling as many of the posts as possible from existing public service employees.  Only when this process is exhausted, and in the event that some posts remain vacant, will an external recruitment process be initiated.</p></reply>

It is located near Drimoleague in Co. Cork.</p><p>  The OPW has been engaged in an ongoing scheme of works at this castle for several years.   This has been undertaken using the OPW's direct skilled labour force based in Cork and the issue of tendering out the construction work does not therefore arise, except in the case of certain supporting specialist requirements not available within the OPW.</p><p>  The project commenced in 2001 and has now concluded, apart from a small amount of landscaping works and the provision of an Interpretative panel giving the history of the site.</p><p>  The project cost, including archaeology, direct labour and all materials in the period 2001 to end 2013 is: &euro;1.6 million approximately. Of this &euro;36,000 plus VAT was expended on externally delivered scaffolding services.</p><p>  A certain amount of the work was undertaken during the period when the Heritage estate was under the care of the then Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.   This included a detailed and comprehensive archaeological investigation over three successive seasons which had to be done before any of the extensive conservation work could be undertaken onsite.  The procurement of this element was, I understand, managed by the DOEHLG in accordance with normal procedures.</p><p>  Although all the works carried out at Castledonovan were carried out by OPW's direct labour force based at Mallow, Co. Cork, it was also necessary to procure the services of a specialised scaffolding company for the supply for rent and erection of Tube and Fitting Scaffolding.  Five companies were invited to tender for the provision of this service in 2010 and the company that submitted the lowest tender was awarded the contract.</p><p>  This project has been technically very difficult and was hampered in the early stages particularly by the condition of the building which was fragile, structurally unstable and dangerous. Due to the nature of the work involved it was only possible to proceed on a seasonal basis, i.e, carrying out this sensitive restoration work when the weather conditions are generally favourable. Unfortunately the Castledonovan work was adversely affected by relatively poor weather over a number of summer seasons and  this was exacerbated by the need, at times, to divert skilled labour resources away to other conservation and urgent maintenance projects ongoing in the region at the time.   While the length of time taken to bring the work to completion may seem long, this needs to be viewed in the context of a project which was technically complex and, at times, made more difficult by circumstances.</p><p>  It is intended to open the Castle to the public this summer and my officials are already in touch with a local community group with a view to maximising the visitor potential to the area from this new visitor destination.</p></reply>

My colleague, Minister of State Brian Hayes worked closely with Senator Feargal Quinn to develop the Senator's private member's Construction Contracts Bill into a robust piece of legislation.  The Bill was signed into law on the 29 July 2013.</p><p>  The key objective of the Construction Contracts Act is to ensure that cash flows down the supply chain on all construction contracts. This issue is addressed in the Act by providing statutory arrangements in relation to payments under construction contracts, including providing for interim payments. This will reduce the subcontractor's exposure to non-payment. The Act also provides the means for subcontractors to enforce these rights; by suspending their labour and by introducing a new mechanism for the swift resolution of payment disputes through a process of adjudication.</p><p>  My officials have been working with stakeholders in the development of the code of practice that will apply to the adjudication process.   I expect that this process will be concluded shortly.  A Commencement Order to bring the legislation into force will be signed once a Chair and panel of adjudicators has been established.</p></reply>

Where necessary, my Department meets regularly with line Departments to review financial management.  There is regular reporting to Government on these matters, and we publish information monthly as part of the Exchequer Statement.</p><p>  Over the period since 2009, gross voted expenditure has been reduced from a peak of &euro;63.1 billion to &euro;53 billion for 2014.  The General Government Deficit has been reduced from 13.7% in 2009, and we will bring it down to 4.8% this year and below 3% by the end of 2015.  This radical improvement in the sustainability of the public finances has helped to achieve our successful exit from the EU-IMF programme of financial assistance on December 15 2013.  It has been delivered through the efforts of all Departments and their agencies to seek savings, pursue efficiencies and manage within constrained budgets often while meeting increasing demands for the public services they deliver.</p><p>  The Government is committed to making fundamental changes to the way the public service operates to safeguard the delivery of essential services in a way that is in keeping with the needs of a modern society while driving value for money for the citizen.  The Public Service Reform Plan   the second phase of which I launched last week   together with the Haddington Road Agreement which is delivering important workplace efficiencies and enhanced productivity are critical in enabling us to achieve this.</p></reply>

As I noted in that response, the final report of the Implementation Body for the Croke Park Agreement concluded that the Agreement facilitated significant cost savings, amounting to &euro;1.8 billion over its lifetime, while also acting as a key enabler for reform both at central and sectoral levels in a climate of industrial peace.  The report also concluded that the overwhelming majority of commitments around cost extraction, reform and changed work practices had been substantially delivered. In this context, I am satisfied that the Croke Park Agreement has delivered on, and indeed exceeded, its objectives.</p><p>  In relation to the Haddington Road Agreement, the Agreement is already delivering on its objectives. In terms of cost reduction, approximately &euro;300 million in savings, arising from the implementation of various measures under the Agreement, was incorporated into the various votes in the context of the Revised Estimates for 2013. The measures and reforms implemented under the Agreement helped to ensure that spending remained in line with profile and resulted in Ireland delivering on our fiscal target for 2013. </p><p>  Furthermore, savings under the Agreement were included in the budgetary arithmetic for 2014, in the expenditure ceilings for each Vote, as appropriate. Similarly, the savings to be generated from the Agreement in 2015 will be incorporated into the expenditure ceilings for each Vote as part of the estimates process.</p><p>  In addition to these monetary targets, a number of changes in work practices and reforms have been implemented since 1 July 2013. Of particular significance is the fact that public servants across all sectors of the Public Service will work an additional 15 million hours annually when all measures are fully implemented. These additional hours will help us to deliver long term and sustainable increases in productivity, while also helping to improve the provision of services to citizens. The benefits from the additional hours under the Agreement are significant, with measures around increased productivity set to deliver approximately &euro;430 million of the &euro;1 billion targeted savings.</p><p>  On 14 January, I published a new Public Service Reform Plan, covering the period 2014 to 2016.  A progress report on the previous Reform Plan was also published. The new Reform Plan includes more than 200 actions, with clear time lines attached, including start and end dates for delivery.  A senior official has also been assigned to each of these actions, to ensure clarity of responsibility for delivery of the actions and to assist in monitoring the progress made.   The Haddington Road Agreement will act as a key enabler for the delivery of this next phase of the Government's ambitious reform agenda.</p></reply>

This, in turn, will aid the restoration of confidence in the Irish economy and allow for sustainable economic growth over the medium term.  </p></reply>

A zero hour contract must be entered into freely between the employer and the employee &ndash; it cannot be forced upon an employee.  Zero hour contracts are normally found in sectors such as retail, healthcare and hospitality.  I am very conscious that in<font color="#FF0000"> </font>certain circumstances, they may be of great benefit to<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  both employers and employees.  They allow greater flexibility for both, reducing the employer&rsquo;s pay costs, while workers can decide when and if they want to work.  Such contracts may be preferred by employees who require flexibility to facilitate educational or other personal requirements and banning such contracts could do a disservice to these workers.  However this is an area I will keep under review.</p><p>  It is important to note that Section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 contains a protection for employees who are employed on zero hour contracts.  The zero hour protection applies to all employees whose contract operates to require them to be available whether they work on a casual basis or not.  This feature of the Organisation of Working Time Act covers situations where, for example, an employee is sent home if things are quiet or is requested to be available for work and is not, on the day, asked to work.  Where an employee suffers a loss by not working hours he/she was requested to work or be available to work, the zero hours provisions of the Act ensure that he/she is compensated for 25% of the time which he/she is required to be available or 15 hours whichever is the lesser.  The level of compensation may be impacted if the employee got some work.  Claims of breaches of section 18 may be referred to a rights commissioner.</p><p>  An expectation of work does not, however, entitle an employee to compensation.  The zero hours provision does not apply to lay-offs, short-time, emergency or exceptional circumstances, employee illness, employee on-call or where the employee is paid wages for making him/herself available for work.</p><p>  Sections 17 and 19 of the Organisation of Working Time Act may also be of particular interest to employees on zero hour contracts.  Section 17 sets out the requirements regarding notification to the employee of the times at which he/she will be required to work during the week. Generally, an employee is entitled to 24 hours&rsquo; notice of his/her roster for the week, although section 17(4) allows for changes as a result of unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>  Section 19 sets out an employee&rsquo;s entitlement to paid annual leave equal to 4 working weeks in a leave year in which he or she works at least 1,365 hours (unless it is a leave year in which he or she changes employment) or one-third of a working week for each month in the leave year in which he or she works at least 117 hours or 8 per cent of the hours he or she works in a leave year (but subject to a maximum of 4 working weeks).</p></reply>

These protections relate to the statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions.  A person who is working under a contract of employment on a full-time or part-time basis has the same protection under law as all other workers.</p><p>  NERA aims to achieve voluntary compliance with employment law through the provision of education and awareness, inspection of employers&rsquo; employment records and enforcement where necessary.

The total spend to date is some &euro;2.2 million.  This spending refers to this Department only and does not include spending from other Government Departments or Agencies which has been significant.  Following the June 2012 flooding, 123 payments were made to affected householders in the Cork area to the value of approximately &euro;150,000.</p><p>  The humanitarian assistance scheme, which is means tested, provides emergency financial assistance to households who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs in the period immediately following flooding. The aim of the scheme is to provide financial support to people who have suffered damage to their homes and in doing so provide hardship alleviation, as opposed to full compensation.  Repairs for structural damage caused as a result of the flooding can also be considered under the scheme.  The Government has not set a limit on the amount that can be paid to an individual household under this scheme.  Levels of payment depend on the relative severity of damage experienced and the household&rsquo;s ability to meet these costs ensuring that the funding is appropriately targeted. Humanitarian assistance does not cover risks that are covered by insurance policies or cover business or commercial losses. </p><p>  Any person continuing to experience hardship as a result of the flooding event of June 2012, or as a result of the recent severe weather conditions, should contact the Department&rsquo;s local  representative administering the supplementary welfare allowance scheme who may be able to offer assistance.</p></reply>

The claim for invalidity pension was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that, based upon the evidence provided, the person was not permanently incapable of work in accordance with the relevant legislation. The person in question was notified of this decision and the reason for it on 07 November 2012. </p><p>  Following a request from the claimant for a review of the decision to disallow invalidity pension, further medical evidence was received on 22 March 2013 and was forwarded to a different medical assessor for review.  This additional evidence, along with the original information, was evaluated by a different medical assessor in May 2013 who also was of the opinion that the person in question did not satisfy the medical criteria for invalidity pension.  The deciding officer found that there were no grounds to overturn the original decision to disallow invalidity pension. </p><p>  However due to an unfortunate oversight the person concerned was not notified of the outcome until 09 October 2013 and advised of her right to appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).  The person concerned has appealed the decision and has submitted further medical evidence with her appeal.  Prior to sending the papers to the SWAO, the Department is having the entirety of the medical evidence examined by a medical assessor.  It is expected that the medical assessor will have completed the assessment and provided an up-to-date opinion today.  In view of the particular circumstances of this case, a deciding officer will review the claim immediately upon receipt of that opinion.  If, following this review, it is decided that she still does not satisfy the medical criteria, the person in question will be notified and her file and all relevant papers will be immediately prepared and forwarded to the Social Welfare Appeals Office for determination.  On the other hand, if the deciding officer is satisfied that the claimant is eligible for invalidity pension, a revised decision will be made and the person in question will be notified of same in the next few days.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 80,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. </p><p>  Revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme have been implemented with effect from Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014.  The new rent limits were determined following an extensive review of the private rental market based on the most up-to-date data available.  The emphasis of the rent limit review is to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer is achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  It is also essential that State support for rents do not distort the market in way that could increase rent prices for others including low paid workers and students.  </p><p>  In Westmeath, the monthly shared rate for a single person is &euro;190 and the couple shared rate is &euro;210. </p><p>  Analysis shows that there are properties available in county Westmeath within the maximum rent limits for rent supplement recipients.  Latest figures show that there are approximately 1,600 rent supplement recipients in Westmeath, with approximately 100 of these in shared accommodation indicating that it is possible to secure accommodation within the rent limits. </p><p>  Officials in the Department will continue to monitor the impact of the revised rates ensuring that the accommodation needs of rent supplement recipients are met. </p></reply>

Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.  However, many services are available to people who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.  </p><p>  For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department's employment services offices regardless of their social welfare status.   </p><p>  Unemployed persons not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through ETB training for unemployed people.  Although not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course, they may receive some support for expenses on travel, meals and accommodation.</p><p>  Springboard and Skillnets courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are also open to people who are not in receipt of payment, regardless of their social welfare status.</p></reply>

In general, the contracts are used to supplement and complement, rather than replace departmental activities. For example, about half of the Department&rsquo;s public offices are operated by private sector providers. The Department also contracts with third party payment agencies, with third party providers of IT services and with third party providers of employment and illness/disability services. The Department spends some &euro;120M annually with external providers, which represents about 20% of overall administrative costs.</p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s records show that, since March 2012, external service delivery contracts have been signed to a total amount of c. &euro;150M (excluding VAT). Some of these contracts extend over a number of years. These include new and renewed contracts for the provision of Local Employment Services (LES) and Job Clubs as well as contracts for the provision of services such as file management, staff training and IT support. The names of these contractors are set out in appendix 1 hereunder. </p><p>  As the contracts are, in general, not used to replace or substitute any existing Departmental activities, the issue of savings does not tend to arise.

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative and financial system in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation.</p><p>  Accommodation for Travellers is provided across a range of options including standard local authority housing which is financed from my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Investment Programme (SHIP), Traveller-specific accommodation such as group housing and halting site bays and funded by means of 100% capital grant, private housing assisted by local authority or voluntary housing bodies, private rented accommodation and through their own resources. It is open to Travellers to opt for any form of accommodation, including Traveller-specific accommodation, and local authority programmes are intended to reflect these preferences.</p><p>  Local authorities are statutorily required to prepare and adopt multi-annual Traveller Accommodation Programmes for their areas. The most recent round of Traveller Accommodation Programmes for the period 2009 - 2013 was substantially completed in December, with some on-going works being carried into 2014. Local authorities are currently making arrangements for the next round of programmes which must be adopted by 30 April and which will run from 2014 to 2018 . Since the adoption of the third round of programmes in 2009, it is estimated that over 450 units of Traveller-specific accommodation had been provided by end 2012, supported by the provision of approximately &euro;50 million in capital funding from my Department. My Department also provides funding for accommodation related supports which operate in tandem with the capital programme. This year some &euro;6.250 million is being provided in respect of Traveller accommodation. </p><p>  Local authorities are required to produce annual progress reports which measure the provision of Traveller accommodation in a given year against the target figure contained in their Traveller Accommodation Programme. As part of this process, housing authorities are requested to provide an explanation for any variations between targets and outputs. Local authorities cite various reasons for failing to meet targets and these include Traveller families refusing offers of accommodation, families only willing to live in certain areas where housing availability may be an issue, difficulties in obtaining Traveller agreement locally, planning and legal problems, difficulties in obtaining site access and anti-social behaviour by Traveller families which can delay development of projects. This information is circulated to, and discussed by, the statutory National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee at its meetings during the year; the Committee advises me on a range of issues in relation to Traveller accommodation.</p><p>  The 2012 Annual Count identified a total of 9,929<b></b>Traveller families in the State. In spite of the huge increase of 5,139 families between 1999 and 2012, only 3.32%<b></b>of the 9,929 families were living on unauthorised sites in 2012. This reduction in the number of families living on unauthorised sites, despite a large increase in the overall number of families, is concrete evidence of the results of investment in Traveller accommodation over the last decade.</p><p>  The National Traveller Management Advisory Committee (NTMAC) which falls within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality issued a report on Traveller mental health in 2013. This report was brought to the attention of the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee and it will be a matter for this Committee to make recommendations with regard to any policy changes needed in the light of the NTMAC report.</p></reply>

In addition to the comprehensive open consultation undertaken by my Department in 2012, the Oireachtas Joint Committee facilitated a round of stakeholder engagement on the final policy analysis report from the Secretariat to the National Social and Economic Council and the outline Heads of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill which I released in February 2013. I am now considering the Joint Committee's report, as well as a range of other issues, with a view to finalising the draft Heads of the Bill as soon as possible. Subject to the approval of Government, my intention is to publish the final Heads before Easter 2014.   </p><p>  In anticipation of the planned primary legislation, a National Low-Carbon Roadmap to 2050 is now being developed. At present, Departments with responsibility for the key sectors in the national transition agenda are currently preparing the sectoral elements for incorporation into the national roadmap. The key sectors are electricity generation, the built environment, transport and agriculture.</p><p>  To ensure that the roadmapping process is inclusive, informed and transparent, the public has already been invited, by the Departments concerned, to input to the sectoral work on electricity generation, agriculture and transport. A public consultation paper on the built environment, which is being developed jointly by my Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is at an advanced stage and will be issued for consultation shortly. Feedback through these sectoral consultations will input into the key sectoral contributions to the first draft National Low-Carbon Roadmap which I intend to release, together with a draft Strategic Environment Assessment, for a substantial period of open consultation later this year. My intention is to ensure that the first draft national roadmap will be informed and technically sound, and provide a solid basis for a constructive, transparent and inclusive open debate.</p><p>  In addition to a direct involvement in the sectoral element of the roadmapping process related to the built environment, my Department&rsquo;s responsibility for overall coordination of national climate policy, both mitigation and adaptation, constitutes a major contribution to the development of national greenhouse gas emission reduction policies and actions. Having facilitated the comprehensive open consultation at the outset of the national policy development Programme, my Department will also lead and coordinate the open consultation on the draft National Low-Carbon Roadmap and Strategic Environment Assessment which will conclude the Programme later this year.</p><p>  In parallel to the mitigation agenda, the National Climate Change Adaptation Framework which I issued in December 2012 provides for the development and implementation of sectoral and local adaptation action plans which will form part of a comprehensive national response to the impacts of climate change. Under the framework, sectoral plans will be developed by the relevant Government Department or Agency and adopted by the relevant Minister. Draft sectoral plans are due to be published by mid-2014, and details of the lead Departments and Agencies are set out in section 4 of the framework. On stakeholder consultation, the framework states that &ldquo;Government Departments and bodies will adopt an open, transparent, and inclusive approach to sectoral adaptation planning, with interested organisations and stakeholders being given early and adequate opportunity to input to the process of preparing adaptation plans&rdquo;.</p><p>  Local adaptation action planning will be undertaken by local authorities. The national framework states that &quot;the spatial planning process, with full engagement of key stakeholders, provides an established means through which to implement and integrate climate change objectives, including adaptation, at local level&quot;. On stakeholder consultation, the framework adds that &quot;local authorities will continue to consult and encourage partnership with stakeholders when addressing adaptation matters at a local level, particularly through the open and participative process for making development plans, into which local adaptation planning is to be integrated&quot;.</p><p>  My Department has not commissioned any research on greenhouse gas mitigation or climate change adaptation over the past year. However, my Department sought technical support from the Economic and Social Research Institute and University College Cork on low-carbon roadmapping, and on modelling in the context of the 2030 EU framework for climate and energy policies. This work relates generally to scenario modelling for the purpose of informing and bringing technical robustness to preparation of the first National Low-Carbon Roadmap for 2050, and Irish engagement in EU climate policy development for 2030. My Department's work, with the benefit of the technical support which it is receiving from ESRI/UCC, is key to finalising an informed and technically sound draft national roadmap for consultation later this year. In the interest of a transparent and inclusive debate on the draft National Low-Carbon Roadmap, I will consider releasing the technical background work on roadmapping for the purposes of the consultation.   </p></reply>

The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which includes adopting the annual budget, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.   </p><p>  While it is a matter for individual local authorities to manage their own day-to-day finances in a prudent and sustainable manner, my Department is in regular and ongoing consultation with both Sligo and Donegal County Councils in relation to their financial positions.   </p><p> Local authorities&rsquo; cost and income bases vary significantly from one another.  General purpose grants are structured to bring about equalisation over time, that is a position of balance where the financial <b>needs</b> of local authorities are met by their <b>resources</b> and they are able to provide an appropriate level of service to their customers.  In determining these grants a number of factors are taken into account including the overall funding available for this purpose, the estimated cost to each authority of providing a reasonable level of services to their customers, the income each authority should generate from local sources and the necessity to provide each authority with a baseline allocation that supports its financial stability.   </p><p>  &euro;1m was held back from the original general purpose grant allocation to Sligo County Council.  The subsequent letter from my Department made the allocation of this &euro;1 m conditional on an agreed long-term financial plan to address the Council&rsquo;s accumulated deficit being adopted by the Council in early 2014.  The allocation of the &euro;1 m in 2014 is fully conditional on a realistic and achievable plan which charts a path to long-term financial sustainability being agreed between my Department and the Council in the first quarter of 2014.  A similar approach was not adopted in relation to Donegal County Council as it continues to implement a long-term financial plan in consultation with my Department.   </p></reply>

The role of my Department is to drive the overall water sector reform process which includes developing the policy and legislation and ensuring delivery of the implementation strategy which was published in December 2012.</p><p>  To assist with the implementation of the reform process the Water Services Transition Office (WSTO) was established by the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association. The role of the WSTO is to support the delivery of the water sector reform programme on behalf of the local government sector, by co-ordinating the input of the 34 County and City Councils. The WSTO prepared a detailed business case setting out its proposed role, functions and funding requirements. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was agreed between the Department and the WSTO. The MoU set out the common understanding between the parties in relation to the role and functions of the WSTO during 2013 and 2014 and the agreed funding mechanism. To date, within the overall spending of some &euro;15.7 million by my Department in respect of the Water Sector Reform Programme, funding of &euro;5.7m has been provided to the WSTO. This funded the secondment of a number of dedicated staff from local authorities with experience across the water services, financial and human resources issues arising in this major organisational change. It also funded the recoupment of on average 2-3 staff in individual authorities for periods of time to interface with the transition office in collating and analysing the information necessary to support the transfer of functions, assets and liabilities to Irish Water. My Department has not made any payments to County Managers in respect of the Water Services Reform Programme.</p></reply>

I have also received a number of representations on the matter from the Law Society, concerned members of its staff and from trade union representatives.   </p><p>  It is fundamental that the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, to be established under the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, be independent of the legal professions and of the Government in the performance of its functions. This will include its implementation of new and independent procedures relating to allegations of professional misconduct by either solicitors or barristers. Such complaints will be dealt with under the auspices of the new Regulatory Authority's Complaints Committee and supported, where appropriate, by the work of the new and independent Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal. Under the Bill, members of the public will no longer go to the Law Society or to the Bar Council with their complaints in the first instance, as happens at the moment, but will instead make them through the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.</p><p>  The independence of the new Regulatory Authority and of its attendant complaints and Disciplinary Tribunal procedures is, therefore, fundamental to their success and to the avoidance of any perception among members of the public that complaints about lawyers are being dealt with by lawyers themselves or by their representative bodies. In that spirit, I have previously welcomed the recognition, by the Law Society, that it would be &quot;in the best interests of the public and the profession&quot; if complaints about solicitors were no longer to be dealt with by the Society but by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority. This stance has helped to underpin public perceptions of impartiality in the proposed new professional conduct regime to the utmost degree. </p><p>  It is also desirable that the independence of the new regulatory regime be reflected in the relevant recruitment and appointment processes for staff of the new Authority and it is considered that such appointments should be better made by the Authority itself under open and public competition. Under this scenario, it should be open to existing staff of the legal professional bodies - who would obviously possess the relevant skills and experience - to apply for those positions advertised by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, which would then fill them independently.   </p><p>  At the same time, I readily acknowledge that the proposed reforms to the legal professional conduct regime will have negative implications for a number of existing and appropriately skilled staff who currently deal with public complaints made through the legal professional bodies. I have also noted the broad support given by Deputies, from across the Parties, during our discussion of this specific matter at Committee Stage on 15 March, to finding a workable solution which can reconcile the competing human resource and policy considerations involved. However, the human resource and other aspects of the establishment of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority and of the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal remain matters of ongoing consideration at my Department and will have to be negotiated to their conclusion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which has overall responsibility for policy in these areas.</p></reply>

These helplines are provided between certain set periods each week, for example, the citizenship helpline is available two mornings a week from 10am to 12.30pm. The periods for which the helplines operate strikes a balance between facilitating customers in making queries to INIS and the overall priority of ensuring that immigration and citizenship applications are processed as quickly as possible. In addition to the provision of helpline services, email facilities are also provided, allowing customers to contact INIS at their own convenience. Details of all helpline and email services are set out on the INIS website, www.inis.gov.ie. It must also be emphasised that INIS, together with the Garda National Immigration Bureau, provides public services at its offices at Burgh Quay in respect of registration of non-EEA persons residing in the State and for applicants seeking re-entry visas. Furthermore, on a daily basis the office receives a number of callers seeking information or for other business. In total the number of persons attending the office is in the region of 130,000 per annum.</p><p>  Regarding the second part of the Question concerning Immigration Officers, provision is made at section 3(1) of the Immigration Act 2004 for the Minister for Justice and Equality to appoint such and so many persons as he or she considers appropriate (referred to in the Act of 2004 as &ldquo;Immigration Officers&rdquo;) to perform the functions conferred on Immigration Officers by the Act . The majority of persons appointed as Immigration Officers are Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the remainder comprising officials of my Department working in the immigration area who have been appointed as Immigration Officers for the purposes of carrying out their duties. Figures for the number of persons appointed Immigration Officers in the period 1990 to 1998 are not available. However, I can inform the Deputy that since 2004 the total number of Garda&iacute; and officials of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service appointed as Immigration Officers under the Immigration Act 2004 is 623. It should be noted that all persons who were acting as an Immigration Officer prior to the commencement of the 2004 Immigration Act were upon commencement of the Act deemed to have been appointed as an Immigration Officer under section 3 of the Act.</p><p>  Finally, it is not clear in respect of the citizenship element of the Question as to whether the Deputy has a particular case in mind and in the absence of specific details it is difficult to evaluate eligibility for citizenship.  However, the general position is that the mere fact of having a child born in Ireland confers no additional rights to citizenship for its parents. The eligibility of parents to be considered for naturalisation will depend on the nature, duration and legality of their own residence in accordance with the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, (as amended). The child's own eligibility for citizenship at birth will, under the same Act, depend on the status of his/her parents, for instance whether one of them is an Irish national, or, in the case of a foreign national parent, whether they have, prior to the child's birth, met the residency requirements of the Act.  </p></reply>

I have been actively assessing the damage to the many small Local Authority piers and harbours right around the coast. I am aware of the critical importance of this local pier and harbour infrastructure to the 1900 odd inshore fishing vessels that provide a backbone to our inshore fishing fleet.</p><p>  The Government in considering the totality of the impact of the storms decided that the Local Authorities need to do a full assessment of the damage and the costs involved and should revert to Government in the coming weeks. That comprehensive assessment will then enable Government to decide on a fully informed response to the damage that was wreaked on our coastal communities as a result of these exceptionally bad storms.</p><p>  On the specific issue of Government support for inshore fishermen for losses of equipment or boats, it is useful to recall that there are a range of grant aid schemes already available to inshore fishermen, which are administered by BIM. </p><p>  There have been some reports in the media about the loss, by some inshore fishermen, of their pots. It is not unusual for inshore fishermen to experience some pot losses through the winter. It is too early to fully determine the scale of the losses and if these were widespread.  I will in the coming days be endeavouring to assess the scale of losses that may have occurred.</p><p>  In deciding on an appropriate response to the situation that emerges I will have to take account of the fact that EU Law limits the options. The EU requires that any financial assistance provided by Government to the seafood sector must always be considered in terms of what is permissible under EU State Aid rules.  It is clear that under State Aid rules no aid may be given for the replacement of any lost or damaged fishing boats.  </p><p>  In relation to pots, the European Fisheries Fund Regulation does allow for financial assistance for purchase of pots but only where the replacement pots provide for more selectivity in relation to by-catch and under size fish.  Any such assistance to purchase fishing gear may not increase the ability of a vessel to catch fish and would be difficult to implement without the risk of breaching State Aid rules.  </p><p>  However, while all of these constraints and considerations exist, I am still endeavouring to get a full picture of the situation and when that is to hand I will be in a better position to inform Government and determine what responses are practical and appropriate.</p></reply>

In this regard payment may only be made in respect of eligible land.</p><p>  At the start of each year, my Department issues colour maps of all land parcels declared by farmers in the previous year together with a covering letter.

They are also given the means to do so by making the ortho-photos available to them on an annual basis. These requirements are also made clear in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes, which accompanies the pre-printed application form issue to all farmers at the commencement of the application period each year.  </p><p>  Farmers who have removed ineligible features, such as scrub from their land parcels should advise my Department accordingly. They will be assisted in updating their land parcel details by reference to the colour maps and the pre-printed 2014 application forms which will be provided to them at the commencement of the 2014 application period. The claimed area on land parcels should be adjusted on the 2014 Single Payment Scheme application form, to take account of any additional areas that have been made eligible by the removal of ineligible features.</p></reply>

This will guide how best to implement the first responder capacity including the requirement to provide defibrillators across many community settings including transport facilities.

My Department identified three areas for alternative delivery models. One of these related to my Department and the other two, to agencies under my remit. These were:</p><p>  - Transfer of the Department's aviation security functions to the Irish Aviation Authority </p><p>  - External delivery of customer and production services for the new format driving licence </p><p>  - Various outsourcing initiatives on the part of F&aacute;ilte Ireland</p><p>Substantial progress has been made on all three.</p><p>  The provision of new credit card format driving licence has been outsourced freeing up roughly 200 staff in local authorities.  While there have been some teething problems, the service is now delivered at no net cost to the exchequer with fees now covering the cost of the contracts.  The Road Safety Authority (RSA) developed the structure of the new National Driver Licensing Service (NDLS) to consist of three outsourced elements, overseen by a specialist unit based in the RSA headquarters in Ballina. Following competitive procurement processes, the RSA awarded contracts in 2013 to SGS (front office provider to engage with customers); Abtran (Back Office provider to process applications) and CCS (Card producer of the plastic licences.</p><p>  Failte Ireland has outsourced the inspection and operational elements of its Statutory tourism accommodation registration and grading functions to a private contractor. It has ceased its direct training activities in its training centres and now operates on the basis of engagement with institutes of  technology and onsite training with industry partners.  It has also outsourced a significant number of its third tier/smaller tourist information offices to Local Authority/community groups/chambers of commerce on the basis of a set of defined standards. </p><p>   Responsibility for aviation security compliance monitoring was transferred from the Department to the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) on 1 January 2013.  The IAA is a state-owned enterprise and receives no exchequer funding.  The transfer of these functions was put into effect under the European Communities (Civil Aviation Security) (Amendment) Regulations 202.</p><p>  In addition to the above, the Department&rsquo;s Internal Audit Unit has contracted Capita Consulting for the delivery of internal audit services. The contract is for the performance of specific blocks of internal audit work to be assigned, as required, by the Head of Internal Audit and is not full outsourcing of the Internal Audit Function.</p><p>  The primary savings to my Department from the transfer of the aviation security function to the IAA and the outsourcing of the Internal audit service is through reduction in staffing numbers equivalent to 9 staff.</p></reply>
