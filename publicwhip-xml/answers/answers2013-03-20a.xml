    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-20a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032000048#WRA00500"><p>Immediately following my appointment, I set out to address the issues which have been causing unacceptable delays in patients being treated in our hospitals. I established the Special Delivery Unit, (SDU), as set out in the Programme for Government. The SDU is working to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  Since its establishment there has been significant improvements in the waiting times for unscheduled care against a background of reduced funding for health, reconfiguration of services and a challenging socio-economic climate.</p><p>  Hospitals across the country have experienced a surge in presentations to Emergency Departments, as would be expected in the winter months, resulting in high demand for admissions and a consequent rise in trolley waits. Recent outbreaks of influenza have created additional logistical difficulties in relation to the admission, movement and discharge of patients in some hospitals. Those hospitals have released media messages advising non-attendance and restrictions on visiting.  The SDU continues to monitor Emergency Department  activity closely, engaging with key hospitals via teleconference and on-site meetings, collaborating in putting in place a range of measures to assist with patient flow and reviewing the available data for trends in relation to the reported levels of high activity. </p><p>Despite these pressures the year on year improvements continue nationally. Numbers recorded on trolleys at the end of 2012 showed a marked improvement of 23.6% less than 2011 which equates to 20,386 less people. From 1st January to 15th   March, there has been a total of 15,220 patients on trolleys: this is a reduction of 2,258 patients or 12.9% on the equivalent period last year. Priority now is to reduce long waiters (over 9 hours) as we move to a six hour patient journey target. The SDU and the Patient Safety &amp; Quality Directorate in HSE are  in communication to agree a mechanism of capturing and responding in instances where a hospital reports one or more patients breaching the targets.</p><p>  In relation to St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, it  is the largest hospital in Dublin South East region dealing with all trauma and serious cases and providing support for such patients presenting to St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital, Dun Laoghaire and St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital. The hospital has advised that over the past few weeks the number of patients requiring admission has averaged between a low of 10 to a high of 30. The hospital is working closely with the  SDU  and the Acute Medicine Programme in order to enhance patient care pathways and patient flow. </p><p>  The hospitals discharge process has been reviewed in detail and additional emphasis has been placed on the early identification of potential discharges.  All members of the multi-disciplinary team have been engaged in this process.  All consultants and their teams are required to identify potential &ldquo;weekend discharges&rdquo; for review by the consultant on call.  Consultants and their teams are also required to prepare a list of &ldquo;next day discharges&rdquo; on a daily basis with a view to effecting discharges by 11.00am the following day. The hospital has also introduced the following initiatives in relation to dealing with Emergency Department  pressures:</p><p>  - Introduction of an Acute Medicine Unit (AMU)</p><p>  - Acute Assessment Unit (AAU)</p><p>  - Clinical Decision Unit (CDU)</p><p>  - Chest Pain Evaluation Unit (CPEU)</p><p>  - Rapid access triage (Doctor/Nurse triaging patients)</p><p>  - Specialty Specific targets for Length of Stay</p><p>  The hospital is also in daily consultation with their  community based colleagues to ensure that all necessary supports are in place to facilitate discharge from the acute setting, to facilities more appropriate to the patients needs.</p><p>  It is envisaged that these developments will lead to shorter lengths of stay in acute hospital care which will in turn improve waiting times and patient experience in the Emergency Department.</p></reply>

Now, 6 patients are waiting this length of time. This waiting list has been reduced by 86%. 168 patients were waiting over 9 months for an inpatient or day case procedure in Sligo Regional Hospital at the end of February 2011.  Now, 94 patients are waiting this length of time. This waiting list has been reduced by 44%. This improvement in waiting list numbers is mirrored throughout the country.  There are 35 hospitals with data available for both the end of February 2013 and the end of February 2011.  1,925 patients were waiting longer than a year for an inpatient or day case procedure in these hospitals at the end of February 2011.  396 patients were waiting this length of time at the end of February 2013.  This waiting list has been reduced by 79%.  4,992 patients were waiting longer than nine months for an inpatient or day case procedure in these hospitals at the end of February 2011.  2,136 patients were waiting this length of time at the end of February 2013.  This waiting list has been reduced by 57%.  10,844 patients were waiting longer than six months for an inpatient or day case procedure in these hospitals at the end of February 2011.  8,649 were waiting this length of time at the end of February 2013.  This waiting list has been reduced by 20%.  Since the end of February 2011, waiting lists longer than a year for inpatient and day case procedures have been eliminated in 15 hospitals and waiting lists longer than 9 months for these procedures have been eliminated in 9 hospitals</p><p>  I am determined that the progress made in 2012 be maintained and improved upon. For 2013, the target is that no adult should be waiting longer than 8 months for inpatient or daycase treatment. It is important to recognise that the progress made in 2012 does not mean the problem is solved, and 2013 will of course be extremely challenging. For example, winter pressures in Emergency Departments have impacted on scheduled care waiting times. However, in the coming months, as winter pressures ease, the SDU will work towards re-balancing scheduled care  to maintain the improvements seen in 2012 and to achieve the new 2013 target. </p><p>Sligo Regional Hospital achieved the national adult waiting list targets of 9 months for inpatient and daycase surgery and 13 weeks for scopes by the end of December 2012.  Whilst the seasonal challenges of winter have temporarily increased numbers, with 94 patients currently waiting over 9 months, the hospital continues to progress towards regaining compliance with the targets.    .</p></reply>

As part of the reform programme, Universal Primary Care is to be introduced on a phased basis during its term of office. Primary legislation is being prepared to give effect to this commitment.  The wording of this legislation, which will allow the Minister for Health to make regulations to extend access to GP services without fees to persons with prescribed illnesses, is currently being drafted by the Office of the Attorney General and the Department. As the legislation is still being drafted, I am not in a position to give a definite date for its publication. Details of an implementation timeframe, illnesses to be covered  etc  and application details will be announced in due course. </p></reply>

A consultation process has taken place with key stakeholders in relation to the proposed amendments, which include introducing import and export controls on benzodiazepines and z-drugs as well as an offence of possession, thereby assisting the law enforcement roles of Customs and of the Garda Sioch&aacute;na. </p><p>  Anabolic steroids are currently subject to prescription control under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003  (S.I. 540 of 2003), which means they cannot be supplied except in accordance with a prescription.  In view of their potential for abuse, it is proposed to place them under the control of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations by making it an offence to import anabolic steroids other than for medical purposes.</p><p>  Draft Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Regulations are currently being prepared and will be submitted for the Government's approval.  Following this, it will be necessary to notify the proposed legislation to the EU Commission and Member States to complete the 3 month EU notification period under the Technical Standards Directive.</p></reply>

The aim of the SDU is to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system. The SDU's Scheduled Care Team focused initially on  waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.  For 2012, a target was set that no child should wait longer than 20 weeks for inpatient or daycase treatment. By the end of December 2012, the number of children nationally having to wait more than 20 weeks was down to 89, a drop of 95% on the 1,759 children waiting longer than the target in December 2011.</p><p>  I am determined that the progress made in 2012 be maintained and improved upon and the 20-week target remains in place for 2013. It is important to recognise that the progress made in 2012 does not mean the problem is solved, and 2013 will of course be extremely challenging. For example, winter pressures have impacted on scheduled care waiting times for children. However, in the coming months, as winter pressures ease, the SDU will work towards re-balancing scheduled care  to maintain the improvements seen in 2012. </p><p>  With regard to the Children's University Hospital Temple Street,  as set out in the HSE's Performance Report for December, no child at Temple Street was waiting longer than 20 weeks at the end of last year. As set out above, winter pressures have impacted on waiting times in the early part of this year and February data show the number of children waiting longer than 20 weeks at Temple Street at 53.  As set out in the HSE's Regional Service Plan for Dublin Mid-Leinster, which has the remit for Children's University Hospital Temple Street, the hospital will continue to work with the Special Delivery Unit to achieve the 2013 target of no child waiting longer than 20 weeks for in-patient or day-case treatment. </p></reply>

The scope and range of public health nursing services are aligned to the health service demand that emerges from the population demographics and epidemiology. This demand varies depending on the complexity of health service requirements in geographic areas such as deprivation, cohort of frail older adults, extent of child health interventions, prevalence of chronic diseases etc.</p><p>  The future planning of public health nursing posts will be based on identified service need and undertaken within the context of available resources to the HSE.</p><p>  PHN training is delivered at post graduate level and numbers are determined by the HSE according to service need, including retirements and workforce planning. There are currently 40 PHNs in training, scheduled to graduate this year and work within the public health system when vacancies arise. The HSE has yet to determine the number of training places to be offered this year for graduation in 2014.</p><p>  In 2013, Primary Care funding of &euro;20m, nationally, will be invested to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line primary care team posts and enhance the capacity of the primary care sector.  The HSE's 2013 National Service Plan has identified approximately 250 Primary Care posts (including Public Health Nurses (PHNs), Registered General Nurses (RGNs), Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists and Speech and Language Therapists).  These posts will be filled using the Resource Allocation model, based on deprivation and need, which was developed by the HSE's National Primary Care Office and Health Intelligence Unit.  </p><p>  Using this model, the HSE completed a detailed analysis of the numbers and distribution of the above health care professionals.  The analysis revealed considerable variation across the 17 Integrated Service Areas in ratios of health care professionals to population, and to population numbers in areas of high deprivation.  Based on this analysis, it proposed that of the approximate 250 posts, 70 Public Health Nurses and 37 Registered General Nurses will be recruited to Primary Care Teams.  It is my firm intention, along with my colleague Minister of State Alex White, to have these posts filled as soon as possible in 2013.</p><p>  I am confident that these additional posts will have a positive impact on the ongoing development of services in the community, giving people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of health professionals.</p></reply>

In recent years, a number of changes to the pricing and reimbursement system have been successfully introduced in Ireland. These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines.</p><p>  Following intensive negotiations involving the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA),  the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including </p><p>- significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, </p><p>- a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, </p><p>- timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and</p><p>- reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.</p><p>The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years. Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.</p><p>  The Department and the HSE have successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. Under this Agreement, from 1 November 2012, the HSE will only reimburse generic products which have been priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE will require a generic price to be priced below the originator price. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate. It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.</p><p>  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nominated EU member states in which the medicine is then available.  The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.</p><p>The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which was passed at Committee Stage yesterday, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. The Bill provides that when the HSE is setting a reference price for, or reviewing a reference price set for, a relevant group of interchangeable medicinal products it shall take into account the following criteria:</p><p>- the ability of suppliers to meet patient demand for the relevant item;</p><p>- the value for money afforded by the relevant item;</p><p>- the equivalent prices of the relevant item in all other Member States where the product is marketed;</p><p>- the prices of therapeutically similar items; and </p><p>- the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>It is important to balance achieving best value for money for the taxpayer with assuring continuity of supply for critical medical products, particularly in a small market like Ireland. Consequently, the Bill aims to achieve value for money while avoiding disruption in the availability of medicines on the Irish market. This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients.</p></reply>

The aim of the SDU is to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system. The SDU's Scheduled Care Team focused initially on  waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.  For 2012, a target was set that no adult should wait longer than 9 months for inpatient or daycase treatment. By the end of December 2012, the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months for inpatient and day case surgery nationally had fallen to 86. This was down from 3,706 in December 2011, representing a 98% decrease </p><p>  I am determined that the progress made in 2012 be maintained and improved upon. For 2013, the target is that no adult should be waiting longer than 8 months for inpatient or daycase treatment. It is important to recognise that the progress made in 2012 does not mean the problem is solved, and 2013 will of course be extremely challenging. For example, winter pressures in Emergency Departments have impacted on scheduled care waiting times. However, in the coming months, as winter pressures ease, the SDU will work towards re-balancing scheduled care  to maintain the improvements seen in 2012 and to achieve the new 2013 target. </p><p>  With regard to the specific hospital referred to, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputies concerned. </p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the second National Cancer Forum, an advisory body to the Minister for Health and Children at that time.  The Strategy&#8217;s vision was that &#8220;Ireland will have a system of cancer control which will reduce our cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality rates relative to other EU countries by 2015.&#8221; To date, significant progress has been made on implementing the Strategy's recommendations but more work is needed on reducing the burden of cancer associated with lifestyle related behaviours.</p><p>  The HSE established the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) in 2007 to implement the 2006 Strategy. The role of the NCCP is to provide a comprehensive programme of cancer control in Ireland, to transform how cancer care is delivered, and ensure that cancer services meet the highest standards.</p><p>  Recently, I published Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015. This sets out the main healthcare reforms that will be introduced in the coming years, as key building blocks for the introduction of Universal Health Insurance in 2016. Future Health is about prioritising the needs of patients even as difficult decisions on health financing are made.</p><p>  Future Health will deliver a major reshaping of the health system by restructuring our service delivery, and improving our organisational, financial, governance and accountability systems across the board &#8211; in the primary, community and hospital sectors. Any changes that are deemed necessary in relation to cancer control will be considered in the context of Future Health.</p></reply>

A small number, in the region of five to six per cent, will receive a not normal result and will require an additional test. They will be referred for a colonoscopy to a Screening Colonoscopy Unit within a hospital contracted by the HSE&rsquo;s National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) for provision of this service.</p><p>  Over half of the initially selected fifteen candidate screening colonoscopy units have been accredited to date, and the remainder of units continue to work to achieve this benchmark.

The development of the Framework is one of the key actions identified in <i>Future Health,</i> the recently published Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 &#8211; 2015. It supports the message coming through from <i>Future Health</i> regarding the need to restructure service delivery, and improve organisational, financial, governance and accountability systems with the aim of providing a more effective and more accountable service.</p><p>  The vision of the Disability Services Programme as set out in the VFM Review is <i>&quot;to contribute to the realisation of a society where people with disabilities are supported, as far as possible, to participate to their full potential in economic and social life, and have access to a range of quality personal social supports and services to enhance their quality of life and well-being&quot;.  </i>  The recommendations in the Review describe how this vision is to be given tangible effect.</p><p>  The National Implementation Framework determines how the recommendations from the VFM Review are translated into concrete actions. It assigns responsibilities for those actions, and specifies timelines for their completion. It also identifies priorities and key performance indicators. The Framework describes the project management and monitoring processes which are needed to make sure that the reform of the Disability Services Programme is achieved in a planned, timely and cost effective manner.</p><p>  The implementation of the recommendations, in the manner set out in the National Implementation Framework will ultimately improve the lives of people with disabilities in the following ways: </p><p>  -People with disabilities and their families will have more choice and flexibility in the services they receive and will have more control over how they access these services.</p><p>  -Services and supports will be tailored to meet individual need and will support greater independence and social inclusion.</p><p>  -The move to individualised budgeting will be underpinned by a standardised needs assessment to ensure fairness and transparency in the way in which funding is allocated.</p><p>  -Supports and services will be delivered with greater equity, transparency and accountability and will be more cost effective.</p><p>  A set of key measures necessary to implement the 7 strategic aims which are at the core of the recommendations of the VFM Review have been identified.  Each key measure has been broken down into a set of key actions.  These key measures are clustered under the following strategic aims</p><p>1. Establish a national disability function, within the framework of the Social Care Directorate, with a central directional role in funding, shaping and driving the Disability Services Programme.</p><p>2. Achieve optimal efficiency in the delivery of the Disability Services Programme.</p><p>3. Re-shape certain services and models of service delivery through a collaborative process based on a commissioning and procurement framework.</p><p>4. Develop a national resource allocation model, based on a standardised and appropriate assessment of need process, a methodology for associating standard costs with assessed needs and transparent protocols for determining the basis for allocating finite resources.</p><p>5. Develop and implement an information infrastructure to support the effective delivery of the Disability Services Programme.</p><p>6. Develop a strategic planning framework to support the re-configuration of the Disability Services Programme.</p><p>7. Drive migration towards a person-centred model of services and supports through the Service Level Arrangement (SLA) process by initiating and evaluating demonstration projects as proof of concept.</p><p>  A full list of key measures is published in Appendix A of the Framework.</p></reply>

For the first time, budget allocations are related to projected spend rather than to historic budgets rolling forward from previous years. This is with a view to ensuring sustainable budgets into the future within the resources available. Heretofore, distribution of budgets across acute hospitals was made with limited reference to past organisational performance or realistic future cost reduction potential and the end result was a system in which some hospitals were significantly underfunded, leading to a position in which deficits become inevitable. We cannot afford to run our hospital system this way. </p><p>  The rebalancing of hospital budgets is a very necessary step on the road to financial stability in the health system as a whole in 2013 and aims to introduce a different mindset and culture into the system. Without these changes there is a real risk that the hospital sector as a whole would be in significant deficit this year.  This rebalancing of budgets is just one part of a comprehensive programme of reform in the hospital sector, as outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Future Health strategy. This strategy includes the establishment of hospital groups this year, with the end goal being the establishment of Hospital Trusts in 2015.</p><p>  The National Service Plan which was submitted to me in December sets out the quantum and type of health services to be provided in 2013 within the overall level of funding provided.

I have emphasised to the HSE the high priority the Government and I attach to this issue.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Service Plan for 2013 specifically recognises the need to address the issue as a priority, stating that there will be a particular focus in the acute hospital service on the achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive amongst the non-consultant hospital doctor workforce, in line with the Implementation Plan submitted to the Commission in 2012.</p><p>  A key priority for the HSE in 2013 will be a further reduction of average weekly hours worked and also a reduction in the duration of shifts undertaken. The Executive is bringing a strong and particular focus to the achievement of compliance with the Directive.  New and demanding targets and timescales have been issued to hospital managers and clinical directors and progress on a site-by-site basis will be assessed against these.  The HSE has recently established a national group chaired by a senior executive to bring a clear and urgent focus to: implementation of the Directive, assessment of performance and site-by-site accountability for change.</p><p>  The HSE is also engaging with the training bodies in relation to progressing compliance.  </p><p>  I am satisfied that the HSE is making every effort to improve the working hours of NCHDs which will in turn facilitate the provision of improved and safer delivery of services to patients. </p></reply>

The aim of the SDU is to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system. The SDU's Scheduled Care Team focused initially on  waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.  For 2012, a target was set that no child should wait longer than 20 weeks for inpatient or daycase treatment. By the end of December 2012, the number of children nationally having to wait more than 20 weeks was down to 89, a drop of 95% on the 1,759 children waiting longer than the target in December 2011.</p><p>  I am determined that the progress made in 2012 be maintained and improved upon and the 20-week target remains in place for 2013. It is important to recognise that the progress made in 2012 does not mean the problem is solved, and 2013 will of course be extremely challenging. For example, winter pressures have impacted on scheduled care waiting times for children. However, in the coming months, as winter pressures ease, the SDU will work towards re-balancing scheduled care  to maintain the improvements seen in 2012. </p></reply>

I established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), as set out in the Programme for Government. The SDU is working to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  Since its establishment there has been significant improvements in the waiting times for unscheduled care against a background of reduced funding for health, reconfiguration of services and a challenging socio-economic climate.</p><p>  Hospitals across the country have experienced a surge in presentations to ED, as would be expected in the winter months, resulting in high demand for admissions and a consequent rise in trolley waits. Recent outbreaks of influenza have created additional logistical difficulties in relation to the admission, movement and discharge of patients in some hospitals. Those hospitals have released media messages advising non-attendance and restrictions on visiting.  The SDU continues to monitor ED activity closely, engaging with key hospitals via teleconference and on-site meetings, collaborating in putting in place a range of measures to assist with patient flow and reviewing the available data for trends in relation to the reported levels of high activity. </p><p>  Despite these pressures the year on year improvements continue nationally. Numbers recorded on trolleys at the end of 2012 showed a marked improvement of 23.6% less than 2011 which equates to 20,386 less people. From 1st January to 15th   March, there has been a total of 15,220 patients on trolleys: this is a reduction of 2,258 patients or 12.9% on the equivalent period last year. Priority now is to reduce long waiters (over 9 hours) as we move to a six hour patient journey target. The SDU and the Patient Safety &amp; Quality Directorate in the are currently in communication to agree a mechanism of capturing and responding in instances where a Hospital reports one or more patients breaching 24 hours on a trolley on one or more occasion.</p></reply>

The National Service Plan which was submitted to Minister Reilly in December sets out the quantum and type of health services to be provided in 2013 within the overall level of funding provided. In accordance with the Act Minister Reilly approved the National Service Plan and laid a copy of the plan before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 9th   January this year.  Subsequently, the Executive prepared and published its Operational Plan and Regional Service Plans which underpin the National Service Plan. The HSE has responsibility for the delivery of services set out in these Regional Plans and to ensure that services are delivered within budget. </p><p>  The Director General Designate of the HSE, Tony O'Brien, has provided full briefing on the Regional Service Plans to the Regional Fora.</p></reply>

This report includes the measure of recorded 30 day in-hospital mortality rates following heart attack. This work demonstrates the value of using the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry (HIPE) system to derive knowledge and understanding of health care quality.  However, it has also uncovered variation in the accuracy of data as reported through the HIPE system.  Some individual hospitals have attributed this variation to inaccuracies in the medical chart and the subsequent coding of information inputted by individual hospitals to the HIPE system.  The data is collected and inputted by the hospitals themselves and, therefore, they are responsible for the quality of the inputted information. Every public hospital in the country has been written to in order that they can ensure that the information they record and report for 2011 and 2012 is accurate. Following a period of consultation and further analysis, the report entitled 'Health Care Quality Indicators in the Irish Health System: Examining the Potential of Hospital Discharge Data' is currently being finalised with a view to publication in the near future. </p></reply>

Minister Reilly and I considered the recommendations of the Ombudsman in relation to both schemes carefully and in particular, we looked at the potential cost of implementing the recommended changes.  Any additional cost incurred by expansion of the schemes would have to be met from current expenditure and result in a reduction of front-line specialist disability, older people and mental health services for people who need them.  It is clear that an extension of either scheme would create serious financial pressure on the health budget in the current climate and would be unsustainable.  </p><p>  Following detailed consideration of issues involved with Cabinet colleagues, the Government decided on 26th February that it is no longer possible to allow the two schemes to continue as they presently operate and to devise an alternative solution for meeting people's needs.  A special review group, which is independently chaired, has been established to seek an alternative method to provide for the needs of people in a manner that does not run counter to the Equal Status Acts.  The initial phase of the group's work, which is led by the Department of Health, will concentrate on issues around Mobility Allowance and the Motorised Transport Grant.  Thereafter, the group will continue, under the leadership of a different Government Department, to look at opportunities for the enhancement of the transport options provided to the relevant persons in need.  As part of the initial phase of the review, the Health Service Executive will examine the circumstances of all those currently benefiting from the schemes to ensure the identified solutions will encompass their priority mobility needs.  In addition, the Minister for Health has instructed the HSE to contact each individual in receipt of the payments to notify them of this decision.</p><p>  It is important to note that, although the Government's decision ends both schemes to new applicants with immediate effect, the payment of mobility allowance to those currently in receipt of it, will continue for a period of four months following the decision.  It is also important to note that the decision is in no way intended to save costs and the funding involved in the two schemes (&euro;10.6 million) remains committed to meeting the priority transport needs of people with a disability.</p><p>  In advance of the establishment of the Project Group,  Department of Health officials met with representatives of the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association at my request.  In addition, membership of the Project Group, which is independently chaired, is drawn from both the statutory and non-statutory sectors.  The work of the Project Group is being supported by the National Disability Authority and includes representatives from the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Disability Federation of Ireland, an independent service user and advocate for people with disabilities and a retired County Council Manager with relevant experience.  Both Minister Reilly and myself have instructed the Project Group to seek solutions across the whole of Government, so that alongside representatives from the Department of Health and the HSE, membership also includes representatives from Pobal and from the Departments of Transport, Tourism &amp; Sport, Environment, Community and Local Government, Social Protection and Finance.   </p><p>  The Project Group has already met twice and their next meeting is scheduled for 25th March.  The Government decision includes a requirement that the results of the review will be presented to the Government before any final decisions are made on future arrangements.</p></reply>

Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self harm is a priority for this Government.  Reach Out our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention makes a number of recommendations in relation to fast track referrals to community-based mental health services, effective response to deliberate self harm, training, stigma reduction, etc.   Since the launch of Reach Out and the establishment of the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP), there has been a significant amount of cross-sectoral working which has resulted in considerable advances in suicide prevention.  The NOSP has implemented many of the action areas engaging a strategic approach in four key areas - delivering a general population approach to mental health promotion and suicide prevention; using targeted programmes for people at high risk of suicide; delivering services to individuals who have engaged in deliberate self harm and providing support to families and communities bereaved by suicide; and commissioning research into suicidal behaviour. </p><p>Earlier this year, the NOSP established an Expert Group to review the current activities in the area of suicide prevention and to determine the priorities within this area to ensure that we maximise available resources.  The Group will also review current national and international evidence on effective approaches in suicide prevention and will consider how the emerging evidence base can be used to inform the remaining period of the <i>Reach Out</i>   strategy and influence new policy on suicide prevention  beyond 2014.</p><p>  Priority suicide prevention initiatives identified for this year include:</p><p>- The further development of existing National Mental Health Awareness campaigns to promote help seeking</p><p>- Increased training for GPs and practice staff.</p><p>- Building the capacity of communities to respond to suicide.</p><p>- Implementation of the clinical care programme for self-harm.  This will include the funding of nursing posts within Hospital Emergency Departments, training of acute hospital staff on suicide and self-harm intervention and the development of the SCAN (Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse) model which allows for crisis interventions at primary care.</p><p>- Investment in voluntary agencies providing frontline services. </p><p>  The annual budget for suicide prevention increased this year to over &#8364;13m, with &#8364;8.1m available to the NOSP to fund voluntary and statutory agencies delivering services in the area of prevention, intervention, postvention and research and the remaining &#8364;5m available regionally to fund Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives.</p></reply>

The HSE National Ambulance Service is developing non-emergency transport, through a national intermediate care service (ICS) , which is key to resolving bed and clinical management pressures.   ICS will allow for safe, planned and timely clinical transfers of inpatients to the most appropriate facility, depending on their acuity and clinical needs.  This will allow for beds to be made available for higher acuity admissions through emergency departments.  ICS will also release emergency resources for emergency functions, for improved response times and performances in pre-hospital care.  To date, ICS has been implemented in Cavan, Castleblayney, South County Dublin, Letterkenny, Sligo, Galway, Limerick, Roscommon, Mallow and Bantry.

Desired outcomes range from a return to full independence in social and work situations to a person requiring long-term support and care but with a higher level of independence than in the absence of neuro-rehabilitation.  Current services available include acute hospital services; the National Rehabilitation Hospital; multidisciplinary community services; long-term assisted living supports; and rehabilitative training services.  These services are provided directly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and several non-statutory organisations.</p><p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have developed and published the &quot;National Policy and Strategy for the provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011 - 2015&quot;. In addition the HSE is developing its Rehabilitation Medicine Programme within the Clinical Strategy and Programmes Directorate.  The Report is the overarching policy on neuro-rehabilitation services and  includes proposals for a framework for the future of neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland and proposals on implementing the report including key elements such as guiding principles; implementation structure; methodology for implementation; and information and communication.</p><p>  The Report recognises that given the current economic climate, the focus in the short to medium term has to be on re-configuration of services, structures and resources and the enhancement of the skills and competencies required to meet the changing context.</p><p>  The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has been working in collaboration with the National Disability Unit as part of an expert Working Group planning for the implementation of the Report.  The key priority areas, as identified in the HSE's National Operational Plan for 2013 are to map and develop Integrated Service Area level rehabilitation networks; and implement the model of care for rehabilitation services within the networks with a focus on community rehabilitation.</p><p>  The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has incorporated key elements of the Report into its own Model of Care and adopted the Strategy's recommendation of &quot;hub and spoke&quot; model for specialist rehabilitation services and is keen to progress with a comprehensive model for the continuation of such service into the community.</p><p>  With regard to funding agencies, this Government currently provides over &euro;1.5 billion to the Disability Services Programme through the HSE's National Service Plan for 2013. We are committed to protecting frontline services for people with disabilities, including neuro-rehabilitation services, to the greatest possible extent.  The Minister for Health is working to ensure that protection is afforded to the disability sector and the Social Care area as a whole.  While the allocation for disability services in 2013 will be reduced by 1.2%, its share of the estimate reduction, the HSE is seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources and to maintaining a consistent level to that provided in 2012.</p></reply>

In line with normal practice, the HSE will aim to facilitate applicants with offers of appointment to posts in the part of the country for which they have expressed a preference.</p><p>  The HSE has decided that applications<b></b>for Phase 1, covering registered general nurses for the Acute Hospital setting and the Community, will be accepted on a rolling basis for 2012 graduates, and also those who graduated in 2010 and 2011.  Phase 2, which covers General, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability and Midwifery Mental Health, Intellectual Disability, Midwifery launched in mid-February.</p><p>  Recruitment will continue during 2013. Paediatrics will launch at a later stage and there will also be opportunities for those who graduate in 2013 to participate.  The scheme was introduced on the assumption that intake would be spread over a period, especially since the scheme was being introduced some months after most 2012 graduates completed their training.</p><p>  The initiative will give nursing and midwifery graduates an employment opportunity and facilitate their professional development.  They will be able to avail of a suite of educational programmes including intravenous canulation and training in anaphylaxis treatment. It has also been agreed that participants will be facilitated in obtaining a certificate in advanced healthcare skills to cover areas such as health assessment and pharmacology.</p><p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform approved this employment initiative on the basis that participants would not be counted in health service staff numbers and that it would contribute to savings on unsustainable levels of agency and overtime expenditure. The HSE's National Service Plan for 2013 provides for a saving of &#8364;10m in the current year, arising from the introduction of this scheme.  This level of saving will need to be achieved regardless of uptake.  Given the requirement on the HSE to reduce numbers employed and to maximise savings, there is only very limited scope to offer permanent nursing posts at present.</p><p>  The graduate nurse/midwife scheme represents an opportunity for a substantial number of recently-qualified nurses and midwives to work in Ireland for a two-year period and to gain valuable experience and additional skills at a time when job opportunities in the public service are, regrettably, very limited.</p></reply>

Under the Bill, Irish Medicines Board has statutory responsibility for establishing and publishing a List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products.</p><p>  In deciding whether to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the Board must be satisfied that each medicinal product which falls within the group:</p><p>(a) has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in each of its active substances as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group;</p><p>(b) is in the same pharmaceutical form as, or in a pharmaceutical form that is appropriate for substitution for, each of the other products in the group; and</p><p>(c) has the same route of administration as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group.</p><p>  In addition, the Bill provides that the Board is not permitted to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products where:</p><p>- there is a difference in bioavailability between the medicinal products and the interchangeable medicinal products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable medicinal products which may lead to a clinically significant difference in efficacy between them, and</p><p>- any of the medicinal  products cannot be safely substituted for any one or more of the other medicinal products in the group.</p><p>  I would like to emphasise that in making a decision to add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable medicinal products or a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products the Board is obliged to have regard to the criteria as set out in the Bill and that these criteria fully reflect the recommendations set out in the Joint Department of Health/HSE report 'Proposed Model of Reference Pricing and Generic Substitution' (the Moran Report, 2010) regarding criteria for interchangeability.</p><p>  To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, Section 13 of the Bill allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.  I am satisfied that these provisions address the concerns raised by the Deputy. I met with the Irish Epilepsy association in January and explained this position.</p><p>  It is also important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine. All of the generic medicines on the Irish market are required to be properly licensed and meet the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-20a.231.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032000051#WRC02300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 114 together.</p><p>  The issue of the provision of home care packages for children with life-limiting conditions is complex. This group includes children who may require short to medium term care, children who have a disability and require long-term care and also sick children for whom there is no reasonable hope of a cure and who are expected to die.</p><p>  The national policy document <b>Palliative Care for Children with Life-limiting Conditions in Ireland &#8211; a National Policy </b>(2010) provides the foundation and sets out clear direction for the development of an integrated palliative care service for children and their families, across all care settings. Following the publication of the policy document the National Development Committee for Children&#8217;s Palliative Care (NDC) was established by the Health Service Executive. The committee is co-chaired by the HSE and the Irish Hospice Foundation. The Committee has overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the national policy recommendations. The committee&#8217;s emphasis on partnership is reflected in its membership comprising statutory, voluntary, professional, and parent involvement. Lauralynn and The Jack &amp; Jill Foundation are members.</p><p>  In October 2012 the HSE regions were asked to indicate the total previous 12 month spend on home nursing care for children with life-limiting conditions. This amounted to &#8364;8.58m. However, it is widely acknowledged that due to financial coding issues within the system the total spend is actually significantly higher than this amount. It is also acknowledged that children with life-limiting conditions, and particularly children with palliative care needs, are prioritised within the regions and every effort is made to provide home care packages to these children and their families. </p><p>The HSE is aware that a more systematic/coherent approach is needed around the provision of funding for home care packages for children.</p><p>  It is also concerned that proper governance arrangements are in place to ensure that the care being provided is clinically sound and that those providing the care to this cohort of children are adequately trained. To this end a working group has been established in HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster. The group has identified the total spend on home care packages for children and has implemented a standardised financial coding system. It is intended that this approach will be replicated across all four regions.</p><p>  In addition to this the National Development Committee has commenced is work on the development of standards for the provision of home and out-of-home respite care. This will be done in partnership with current voluntary providers such as the Jack and Jill Foundation and Lauralynn&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Hospice.</p><p>  One of the national policy recommendations was the employment of eight children&#8217;s Outreach Nurses. One of the responsibilities of these Nurses is to facilitate a co-ordinated support structure for children with life-limiting conditions and their families. The Nurse will identify the needs of each child and ensure that families are appropriately linked in to local services. Three nurses are in place (Drogheda, Limerick and Waterford); the fourth will take up her post at the end of March (Temple Street); and the remaining four nurses should be in place within 6-8 weeks (Crumlin, Mullingar, Cork and Galway).</p><p>  The first Consultant Paediatrician with a Special Interest in Paediatric Palliative Medicine has also been appointed to Crumlin Hospital.  The support structure for these children and their families includes health care staff across a range of disciplines. Some of these staff require additional training on working with children with life-limiting conditions. In order to address this, a national programme of continuing professional education on caring for children with life-limiting conditions has been established in Crumlin Children&#8217;s Hospital.</p></reply>

The aim of the SDU is to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system. The SDU's Scheduled Care Team focused initially on  waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.  For 2012, a target was set that no adult should wait longer than 9 months for inpatient or daycase treatment. By the end of December 2012, the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months for inpatient and day case surgery nationally had fallen to 86. This was down from 3,706 in December 2011, representing a 98% decrease.</p><p>  I am determined that the progress made in 2012 be maintained and improved upon. For 2013, the target is that no adult should be waiting longer than 8 months for inpatient or daycase treatment. It is important to recognise that the progress made in 2012 does not mean the problem is solved, and 2013 will of course be extremely challenging. For example, winter pressures in Emergency Departments have impacted on scheduled care waiting times. However, in the coming months, as winter pressures ease, the SDU will work towards re-balancing scheduled care  to maintain the improvements seen in 2012 and to achieve the new 2013 target.  Since its establishment of the SDU there has been significant improvements in the waiting times for unscheduled care against a background of reduced funding for health, reconfiguration of services and a challenging socio-economic climate. Hospitals across the country have experienced a surge in presentations to ED, as would be expected in the winter months, resulting in high demand for admissions and a consequent rise in trolley waits. Recent outbreaks of influenza have created additional logistical difficulties in relation to the admission, movement and discharge of patients in some hospitals. Those hospitals have released media messages advising non-attendance and restrictions on visiting.  The SDU continues to monitor ED activity closely, engaging with key hospitals via teleconference and on-site meetings, collaborating in putting in place a range of measures to assist with patient flow and reviewing the available data for trends in relation to the reported levels of high activity.</p><p>  Despite these pressures the year on year improvements continue nationally. Numbers recorded on trolleys at the end of 2012 showed a marked improvement of 23.6% less than 2011 which equates to 20,386 less people. From 1st January to 15th March, there has been a total of 15,220 patients on trolleys: this is a reduction of 2,258 patients or 12.9% on the equivalent period last year. Priority now is to reduce long waiters (over 9 hours) as we move to a six hour patient journey target. The SDU and the Patient Safety &amp; Quality Directorate in the are currently in communication to agree a mechanism of capturing and responding in instances where a Hospital reports one or more patients breaching 24 hours on a trolley on one or more occasion.</p><p>  With regard to the specific hospitals referred to, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputies  concerned.</p></reply>

The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction.  The primary aim is to cut the cost of services and not the services themselves.  However, in 2013, Primary Care funding of &euro;20 million nationally will be invested to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line primary care team posts and enhance the capacity of the primary care sector.  The HSE's 2013 National Service Plan has identified approximately 250 Primary Care posts, including Public Health Nurses, Registered General Nurses, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists and Speech and Language Therapists, that will be filled using the Resource Allocation model, which is based on deprivation and need and was developed by the HSE's National Primary Care Office and Health Intelligence Unit.  Using this model, the HSE has completed a detailed analysis of the numbers and distribution of the above health care professionals.  The analysis revealed considerable variation across the 17 Integrated Service Areas in ratios of health care professionals to population, and to population numbers in areas of high deprivation.  Based on this analysis, it proposed that of the approximately 250 posts, 70 Public Health Nurses and 37 Registered General Nurses will be recruited to Primary Care Teams.  It is my firm intention, along with my colleague the Minister for Health, to have these posts filled as soon as possible in 2013.  I am confident that these additional posts will have a positive impact on the ongoing development of services in the community, giving people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of health professionals.</p></reply>

However, the provision of modern, high-quality and safe care requires increasing levels of co-operation and overarching systems of governance and communication.  We know the traditional practice of providing as many services as possible in every hospital is neither sustainable nor safe.  Experience in Ireland and abroad teaches us that a co-ordinated system of care is clearly better for patients than a sporadic approach from hospital to hospital.  The formation of Irish acute hospitals into a small number of groups, each with its own governance and management, will provide an optimum opportunity for hospital services to be configured to deliver high-quality safe patient care in a cost-effective manner.  It was with this in mind that I appointed Professor John Higgins in June of last year to chair a strategic board on the establishment of hospital groups.  I have received Professor Higgins's report, which is based on a comprehensive consultation process and contains almost 60 recommendations on the formation, management and governance of hospital groups, all of which are strongly endorsed by the strategic board.  I will submit this report to the Government shortly to consider it and to decide on the final formation of each hospital group.  I appreciate that this report and the related Government decision are anxiously awaited.  This is the most radical and most fundamental modernisation of our health system infrastructure since the foundation of the State.  I take very seriously my obligation to consider the report closely and assure myself and my Cabinet colleagues that it provides a robust basis to enable timely access to a high-quality and sustainable hospital service for those who need it.  The Government will decide on the initial make-up of hospital groups which will be established on an administrative basis pending the legislation required to set up hospital trusts by 2015.  Before those trusts are established, the composition and functioning of the groups will be reviewed.  If changes prove necessary, then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed.  As such, it would be inappropriate and merely speculative to comment on the prospective impact of the formation of hospital groups on individual hospitals in advance of the consideration of the Higgins report by the Government.</p></reply>

For the first time, budget allocations are related to projected spend rather than to historic budgets rolling forward from previous years. This is with a view to ensuring sustainable budgets into the future within the resources available. Heretofore, distribution of budgets across acute hospitals was made with limited reference to past organisational performance or realistic future cost reduction potential and the end result was a system in which some hospitals were significantly underfunded, leading to a position in which deficits become inevitable. We cannot afford to run our hospital system this way. </p><p>  The rebalancing of hospital budgets is a very necessary step on the road to financial stability in the health system as a whole in 2013 and aims to introduce a different mindset and culture into the system. Without these changes there is a real risk that the hospital sector as a whole would be in significant deficit this year.  This rebalancing of budgets is just one part of a comprehensive programme of reform in the hospital sector, as outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Future Health strategy. This strategy includes the establishment of hospital groups this year, with the end goal being the establishment of Hospital Trusts in 2015.</p><p>  The National Service Plan which was submitted to me in December sets out the quantum and type of health services to be provided in 2013 within the overall level of funding provided. In accordance with the Health Act 2004  I approved the National Service Plan and laid a copy of the plan before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 9 January this year.  Subsequently, the Executive prepared and published its the Operational Plan and Regional Service Plans which underpin the National Service Plan at the end of February. These plans set out the detail of the level of services to be provided, including acute services in the hospital referred to by the Deputy.  The HSE has responsibility for the delivery of services set out in these Regional Plans and to ensure that services are delivered within budget.  </p><p>  The Director General Designate of the HSE, Tony O'Brien, has provided full briefing on the Regional Service Plans to the Regional Forums.  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy regarding the hospital's budgets, I have referred this to the HSE for direct reply. </p></reply>

These proposals cover all of the areas mentioned in the report such as:</p><p>- Legislation on minimum unit pricing which is about setting a statutory floor price per gram of alcohol;</p><p>- Access and availability of alcohol &ndash; including of structural separation in retail units where alcohol is sold;</p><p>- Advertising and sponsorship; and</p><p>- Treatment and prevention services within the HSE.</p><p>  As part of the process of developing these proposals, my Department is continuing discussions with various Departments. </p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has also considered the matter and I intend to bring forward specific proposals for consideration by Government as soon as possible.  In the meantime, work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation on minimum unit pricing and the advertising of alcohol is continuing.  For example, in conjunction with Northern Ireland, a health impact assessment is being commissioned as part of the process of developing a legislative basis for minimum pricing.  The health impact assessment will study the impact of different minimum prices on a range of areas such as health, crime and likely economic impact.</p></reply>

As outlined in that document, many of the key building blocks for UHI have been progressed including:</p><p>  - the drafting of legislation to extend access to GP services without fees to persons with prescribed illnesses; </p><p>  - the work of the Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups, and the significant progress made by the Special Delivery Unit to reduce waiting times for scheduled and unscheduled care;</p><p>  - the development of a 'Money Follows the Patient' policy which was published on the 15th February, and which heralds a fairer, more transparent means of funding healthcare;</p><p>  - the approval of national healthcare standards and ongoing work in relation to supporting licensing legislation, and</p><p>  - the enactment of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012 providing for a new scheme of risk equalisation for the private health insurance market from 1st January 2013.</p><p>The Department is currently undertaking detailed work in relation to the preparation of a <i>White Paper on Universal Health Insurance.</i>  The White Paper will provide further detail on the UHI model for Ireland in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with its introduction.  The work involved is both complex and technical and  demands a wide-range of specialised legal and financial expertise.  My Department has recently engaged specialised legal expertise to support deliberations in relation to the design of the UHI model and work in this area is underway.  In addition, my officials are currently establishing a UHI Design Team which will oversee progress on the preparation of the White Paper. </p><p>The reform programme is a major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing over a number of years and full implementation of UHI will take some time to achieve.  I anticipate that by 2016 the necessary groundwork will be in place to enable us to phase in  implementation of UHI, as promised in the Programme for Government.  I should add that it is my intention to consult widely as part of the reform implementation process.    </p></reply>

These discussions concluded on Monday February 25th, with proposals being put forward by the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) on a draft Agreement.  A key requirement for the health service during the process was to protect front-line care while at the same time significantly reducing costs.</p><p>  Subject to the ratification of the proposals, significant savings will be made on the health pay bill.  Savings will be achieved through the reduction in the overtime rates payable, the elimination of twilight payments and a reduction in Sunday Premium pay.  Savings will also be achieved through the progressive reduction in salaries over &euro;65,000 per annum, measures to delay or freeze increments, and balancing measures for those already at the maximum of their scales.  In addition, the draft agreement provides for an increase in working hours for most staff and this will deliver a long-term, sustainable and unprecedented increase in productivity.  The increased working hours will, it is anticipated, enable the reliance of the health service on overtime and agency working to be substantially reduced, and at the same time, facilitate the achievement of the further staffing reductions required for 2013 and 2014.  </p><p>  The HSE's National Service Plan 2013 includes unallocated pay savings of &euro;150m.  As the Plan contains no specific allocations in relation to this &euro;150m, these are not, as yet, reflected in either the programme or regional budgets.  These budgets will however be adjusted downwards, later in 2013, when the breakdown of the pay savings under the proposed Agreement has been definitively quantified. </p><p>  The Revised Estimates Volume for 2013, which will be published shortly by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, will set out the revised allocations for Votes arising from the proposals made by the LRC.  </p></reply>

The implementation of this Strategy is a priority for the Government and in this regard a special allocation of &#8364;35m was provided in 2012 primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both adult and children's mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention, to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems and to facilitate the re-location of mental health service users from institutional care to more independent living arrangements in their communities, in line with <i>A Vision for Change.  </i>414 posts were approved to implement the &#8364;35m package of special measures.  </p><p>  A further additional &#8364;35m was allocated to mental health in Budget 2013 and the HSE National Service Plan, which was approved by the Minister for Health, commits to the further development of suicide prevention initiatives, forensics and community mental health teams for adults, children, older persons and mental health intellectual disability and to the recruitment of over 470 additional staff to implement these measures.   </p><p>  In order to ensure that the additional resources will be used to best effect, discussions are ongoing within the HSE, and in consultation with the Department of Health, to finalise the allocation of these resources.  Each HSE Region is being asked to submit a business case against each of the identified objectives detailing how the funding is to be spent and the type and number of WTE to be recruited.  It is expected that this process will be concluded in the very near future.  I have been assured by the HSE that the recruitment process for the new posts being funded in 2013 and any outstanding posts from the 414 approved in 2012 is being given priority within the HSE.</p><p>  In relation to the specific question on the HSE Regional Service Plans, as this is a service matter, the question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

The patient was 13 days overdue.  Serious concerns arose following a clinical review at the clinic.  The patient was advised that an immediate admission to the hospital for a caesarean section was needed.  It was deemed that there was a substantial risk to the health and wellbeing of both the baby and the mother.  I am advised that, at this point, the mother refused to be admitted to hospital. </p><p>As the risks were deemed unacceptably high, an application was made by the HSE to the High Court seeking an order &#8211; <i>Notice of Motion</i>  - to allow the hospital (or its doctors or staff) to administer all appropriate medical treatment for the mother to safeguard her health and that of her unborn child.  The court order included a request that the patient be compelled to undergo a caesarean section if necessary.  As per the patient's entitlement legal representation was organised for the patient by the hospital. The patient's legal representation costs will be covered by the hospital. </p><p>An initial <i>Notice of Motion </i>was issued<i></i>on Friday night<i></i>requesting the patient to return to the hospital for further review.  The mother consented to stay in the hospital.  A second consultant obstetrician spoke to the mother and outlined the serious concerns and the risks for both the baby and the mother.  The mother again refused to undergo a caesarean section </p><p>  On Saturday 9 March the patient consented to a caesarean section which was carried out immediately.  Therefore a further Court ruling was no longer required.  I wish the patient a speedy recovery.</p><p>  I am unable to advise the Deputy of the nationality of the woman involved on the grounds that this could potentially lead to the identification of the patient. </p></reply>

The aim of the SDU is to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  The SDU's Scheduled Care Team focused initially on  waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.  For 2012, a target was set that no adult should wait longer than 9 months for inpatient or daycase treatment.  By the end of December 2012, the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months for inpatient and day case surgery nationally had fallen to 86.  This was down from 3,706 in December 2011, representing a 98% decrease </p><p>  I am determined that the progress made in 2012 be maintained and improved upon.  For 2013, the target is that no adult should be waiting longer than 8 months for inpatient or daycase treatment.  It is important to recognise that the progress made in 2012 does not mean the problem is solved, and 2013 will of course be extremely challenging.  For example, winter pressures in Emergency Departments have impacted on scheduled care waiting times.  However, in the coming months, as winter pressures ease, the SDU will work towards re-balancing scheduled care  to maintain the improvements seen in 2012 and to achieve the new 2013 target. </p><p>  I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in regard to the specific hospital referred to. </p></reply>

The Deputies should be aware that it would not be correct for the Department to become involved in governance and funding procedures proper to the HSE. </p><p>  In the area of patient advocacy the HSE is establishing its Patient Safety Champions Network and this is what it wishes to support and target financially.  It will also continue to fund another patient advocacy group engaged in direct advocacy work.</p><p>  The HSE has been in discussions with the Association since 2006/2007, in relation to it becoming self-financing; there does not appear to have been progress in this direction. (The Department was also in similar discussions with the Association in 2003/2004). The Association receives some private funding from the pharmaceutical sector.</p><p>  The CEO of the Irish Patients Association met with the Secretary General of my Department in January and was appraised of the HSE's position on funding for the Association.  A further meeting between the Association and the HSE was suggested and this took place last Thursday, 14th March.  The outcome of this meeting is that the decision by the HSE to cease funding the Irish Patients Association will not be reversed.  </p></reply>

However, I have consistently urged the VHI and all the private health insurers to do everything possible to keep down the cost of private health insurance and I am determined to address costs in this sector in the interest of consumers.  </p><p>  Given the VHI's very significant share of overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs and to address the base cost of procedures, including professional fees.  Specifically, I have asked the VHI to focus on increasing the extent of procedure based payments, in addition to benchmarking to determine the underlying basis for the cost of specific procedures.</p><p>  VHI note that the key factors influencing price increases generally include the increasing volume and cost of claims, an ageing membership, and ongoing medical innovations, which while welcome, have an impact on the cost of care.  According to the VHI, approximately 70% of VHI Healthcare's claims are performed in private facilities, and the negotiated price for procedures in private hospitals is a &quot;package&quot; price, which includes the cost of surgery, drugs, pathology, and accommodation.</p><p>  In  terms of increased premiums which may arise from cost of procedures or hospital accommodation, it is a matter for each insurer to contain its own costs and to compete actively on the basis of price.  </p></reply>

While the Framework focusses in particular on the role of nine smaller hospitals - the names of which follow - which have been the subject of particular attention from the HIQA, the principles behind it will apply to all smaller hospitals, regardless of whether or not they are specifically referenced.  The hospitals in question are: Dublin North East - Our Lady&#8217;s Hospital Navan and Louth County Hospital Dundalk; Dublin Mid-Leinster - St. Colmcille&#8217;s Loughlinstown; South - Mallow and Bantry; and West, - Ennis, Nenagh, St. John&#8217;s Limerick and Roscommon County Hospital.</p><p>  In developing the framework to address the development of smaller hospitals, this Government is clear that:</p><p>- there is an important future role for smaller hospitals, in which they will provide services for more patients, not fewer</p><p>- no acute hospital will close, and</p><p>- safety issues in all acute hospitals, large or small, must be fully addressed, by providing the right type of service, for the right patient in the right setting.</p><p>This Framework will demonstrate clearly that the future of smaller hospitals is secure. It will set out what services can and should be delivered safely by these hospitals in the interest of better outcomes for patients.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-20a.375.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032000057#WRJ01100"><p>The Framework for Smaller Hospitals defines the role of the smaller hospitals.  It outlines the need for smaller hospitals, such as Navan, and larger hospitals to operate together.  The Framework outlines the wide range of services that can be provided within the smaller hospital.  It defines the need for the smaller hospital to be supported within a group of hospitals in terms of education and training, continuous professional development, the sustainable recruitment of high quality clinical staff and the safe management of patients who present with varying levels of complexity.  It also sets out to address the categories of services that should transfer from the larger to the smaller hospitals and <i>vice versa</i> within a Hospital Group so that services are delivered in the most appropriate hospital.  I am determined to ensure that as many services as possible can be provided safely and appropriately in smaller, local hospitals.  On this basis, the organisation of hospital services nationally, regionally and locally will be informed by the ongoing development of the HSE Clinical Programmes.  With this in mind the Framework will set out what services can and should be delivered safely by these hospitals in the interest of better outcomes for patients.</p><p>  In relation to the specific hospital named by the Deputy, I have been informed by the HSE that it is planned that the OLHN as part of the Louth Meath Hospital Group (LMHG), will deliver at minimum similar activity volume and range as undertaken during 2012.  In additional OLHN will continue to meet the National targets for waiting times for inpatient elective procedures, day case procedures and all endoscopy procedures.  I have been further informed that there are currently no planned changes to any service in OLHN other than planned seasonal closures which are scheduled every year to coincide with holiday periods, such as Easter, Summer Term break and Christmas.  In terms of service improvements / gains, a second Consultant Rheumatologist has now been appointed to OLHN to further extend the Regional Rheumatology service and provide early and rapid access for patients requiring this service.  In addition two permanent Consultant appointments have been made in Endocrinology/Diabetology and Gastroenterology.  Both of these appointments have shared sessions with Our Lady of Lourdes, Hospital, Drogheda (OLOL).</p><p>  With regard to finances, the recent budget allocation for LMHG reflected an uplift of 13.9% on the allocated budget for 2012.  Whilst this does not reflect additional monies for Our Lady's Hospital Navan it does mean that the allocation is based on the outturn for 2012.  This will ensure that the principles outlined in the service plan of maintaining services and capacity can be confidently managed.  The Director General Designate of the HSE has informed me that he put alternative governance arrangements in place for LMHG on 1 December 2012.  The LMHG management team no longer report via the Integrated Service Area or Regional Director of Operations but through an Executive Chair.  The Executive Chair has a direct reporting relationship with the Deputy Director General/Chief Operating Officer.  With regard to staffing for 2013, the HSE informs me that at this point in time there are very few anticipated retirements as many staff availed of the early retirement opportunities in 2012. </p></reply>

On the one hand, these research areas enable the generation of evidence to inform policy, improve clinical practice and create opportunities for improved health care delivery and better health outcomes.  At the same time, research in these areas can benefit the wider economic agenda which aims to further develop the health care industry in Ireland for the domestic and potentially international markets.  It can do so by strengthening the infrastructure, capability and capacity that will enable, inter alia, the identification, development, validation and potentially the adoption of enterprise outputs within the health system.</p></reply>

A resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish immigrants will continue to be pursued by the Government in our ongoing contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  During our visit to Washington this week, the Taoiseach and I discussed the latest prospects for progress with President Obama, Senators McCain, Leahy and Schumer.  The matter also featured prominently during my meeting with Secretary of State Kerry and with Senator Isakson.</p><p>  The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which a resolution for our undocumented can be achieved.  The prospects for such reform would appear to have advanced in the wake of President Obama&rsquo;s re-election.  The emphasis he placed on immigration reform in his inauguration address as well as his subsequent speech on the issue on 29 January and his State of the Union address on 12 February sent a very positive signal in this regard.  The indications of emerging bipartisan support for reform in Congress is also encouraging.</p><p>  Through our Embassy in Washington and in close liaison with Irish-American community representatives, our contacts with the US Administration and Congress continue with a view to ensuring that the interests and concerns of undocumented Irish immigrants are captured in any future legislative deal in this area that emerges.  In addition to the meetings in the US this week,  I raised the issue with then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during our bilateral meeting on 6 December last and recalled our strong support for comprehensive immigration legislation and the passage of E3 visas for Irish citizens.   I spoke with Senator John McCain on 8 February last to express the Government&rsquo;s appreciation for the efforts he and others are making in developing bipartisan Senate proposals and to underline our ongoing interest in the issue.  I also spoke with Senator Patrick Leahy on 25 February and met with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand during her recent visit to Dublin on 8 March.</p><p>  Much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system as to what any future legislative deal might comprise.  It is therefore not possible at this stage to identify an exact timescale in which these may become clear but the area will continue to receive the Government&rsquo;s close attention over the period ahead.</p></reply>

While Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic relations with Burma/Myanmar are maintained on a secondary accreditation basis via our Embassy in Vietnam, and through the Embassy of Burma/Myanmar in London, we continue also to work through the mechanisms of the EU and UN to ensure that human rights are respected in Burma/Myanmar, including those of the Rohingya people.</p><p>  On 28 January 2013, the Irish Ambassador in Hanoi presented his credentials to become the first Ambassador of Ireland accredited to Burma/Myanmar.  Following accreditation, the Ambassador met with both the President and Foreign Minister of Burma/Myanmar and discussed a range of issues, including the human rights situation in Rakhine State.  As an elected member of the Human Rights Council, Ireland is working closely with partners at the Council to ensure the continuation of international scrutiny of the human rights situation in Burma/Myanmar.  At the 67th   session of the United Nations General Assembly Ireland along with our international partners urged the Government of Burma/Myanmar to accelerate its efforts to address human rights concerns and called upon the Government there to grant safe, timely, full and unhindered access across Rakhine State.</p><p>  President Thein Sein visited Brussels on 5 March.  He met with High Representative Catherine Ashton as well as with President of the Commission Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso and President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy.  Following this latter meeting, a Joint Statement was released in which both sides agreed to work in partnership to promote human rights and the rule of law for all people living in Burma/Myanmar, including the Rohingya.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s recent experience in development cooperation in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia as well as in Timor Leste is relevant to Burma/Myanmar, and we stand ready to share this experience to assist in its development and democratisation.   To date, Irish Aid has provided over &euro;7m to Burma / Myanmar through NGOs and Irish missionaries for long term development and emergency and recovery responses.  Ireland will continue to urge the Government of Burma/Myanmar, both bilaterally and through the relevant multilateral channels, to address the human rights situation of the Rohingya.</p></reply>

Mr Brahimi briefed the Council on the situation on the ground as well as on the prospects for a political solution to the two-year old conflict.  Drawing our attention to the increasingly destructive war of attrition between the Syrian army and the opposition forces, he reaffirmed his view that only a political solution can bring about an end to the harrowing violence in Syria.  He also appealed to the EU to continue using its leverage with other countries of influence to advance the prospects for a political settlement.  Observing that the continuous flow of arms into Syria is part of the problem, Mr Brahimi endorsed the view of UN Secretary General Ban that supplying arms and ammunition will only exacerbate an already destructive conflict, leading to more casualties and greater destabilisation of the wider region.</p><p>  When High Representative Ashton received the Chief of Staff of the Syrian Supreme Military Council, General Idriss, earlier this month in Brussels, she made clear to him that EU support for the people of Syria, other than the already substantial contribution being made to UN-led humanitarian efforts, could not go beyond the provision of non-lethal equipment and technical assistance intended for the protection of civilians.  Along with most EU member States, Ireland is of the view that lifting the current EU embargo on the supply of arms and military equipment would contribute to further militarisation of the conflict and to greater proliferation of arms in Syria and in neighbouring countries.  We also believe that it could undermine the efforts currently underway to promote a peaceful political solution to the crisis.</p></reply>

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA) estimates that almost 70,000 people have been killed as a result of the conflict and over 3 million have been displaced from their homes.  Over 1.1 million Syrian refugees have fled to neighbouring countries.</p><p>  We are very aware of the challenges involved in reaching those most in need in Syria, and I have consistently raised our concerns about humanitarian access at the EU Foreign Affairs Council.  The constraints are many. Excessive controls on aid agencies working in the country, the fragmentation of the armed opposition and the intensity of military confrontations have made the operating environment extremely volatile and insecure, particularly in opposition-controlled areas.  Restrictions imposed by the Assad regime, combined with logistical constraints and increasing insecurity, make it very difficult to access populations in need of humanitarian assistance.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied that our key partners on the ground are succeeding in reaching vulnerable populations.  Since last October, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) has been delivering assistance to 1.5 million people each month.  Almost half of this aid has been delivered in disputed or opposition-controlled areas.  Other partners such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), working with the Syria Arab Red Crescent (SARC), have been reaching areas inaccessible to the UN.  We believe it is essential, however, that the international community increase the scale and scope of humanitarian assistance in order to meet the increasing level of needs across the country.</p><p>  In January, negotiations between the UN and the Government of Syria resulted in agreement to allow for the delivery of humanitarian assistance across conflict lines.  The UN also negotiated authorisation from the Government of Syria to establish an international field presence.  The UN base in Homs has had an immediate impact in increasing the delivery of aid.  Additional implementing partners, approved by the Government of Syria and vetted by the UN, have been contracted to expand the reach of humanitarian assistance across the country.  The ICRC and SARC have succeeded through negotiation in delivering much-needed food and essential household items to a number of opposition-held areas, most recently Al-Houleh in Homs province.</p><p>  The meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council which I attended in Brussels on 18 February, explicitly reaffirmed the leading role of the UN in providing assistance to Syria and to neighbouring countries which are hosting the large number of refugees from the conflict.  The Council also committed the EU to taking steps towards providing humanitarian assistance to all areas in the country, including those currently not reached by humanitarian aid.  At the most recent meeting of the Council, on 11 March, we held further discussions on the deteriorating humanitarian situation with the Special Envoy of the UN and the Arab League, Lakhdar Brahimi.</p><p>  The UN and other humanitarian partners aim to reach 2.5 million people across all areas of Syria over coming months.  Such an increase in humanitarian assistance will depend on the support of the Government of Syria and the Opposition to facilitate safe access to vulnerable populations.  The availability of funds is also critical. It is estimated that over &euro;1.1 billion will be needed for the response in Syria until the end of June.  Ireland has responded swiftly and generously to the humanitarian crisis in Syria and to date has provided over &euro;7 million in humanitarian assistance through long-standing and reputable partners such as WFP, UNICEF, UNHCR, ICRC, and international Non-Governmental Organisations.  We work through partners which have a demonstrated track record of effective humanitarian response in Syria, with strong targeting, delivery and accountability mechanisms to provide live-saving assistance to the people most in need.  We are continuing to monitor the situation to review the effectiveness of our contribution and asses how we can respond further to humanitarian needs in Syria and the region.</p></reply>

Ireland has long term, strategic development partnership programmes with eight Programme Countries.  These are Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia in sub-Saharan Africa, and Vietnam in Asia.  In these countries we aim to build government and institutional capacities to deliver the essential services that their populations need, mainly in the areas of health, education and food security. </p><p>  In 2012, Ireland provided &#8364;12.5 million for the bilateral aid programme in Malawi.  The overarching goal of the Malawi programme is to ensure that households are better nourished and less vulnerable to poverty.  It focuses on activities in agriculture, climate change, nutrition, social protection and good governance.</p><p>  The Irish Aid programme is delivered through targeted programmes implemented by a variety of partners including Government institutions, NGOs and international organisations.  This ensures a high degree of accountability and clear results for the poorest and most vulnerable people.</p><p>Comprehensive details of how Ireland&#8217;s total Overseas Development Assistance (ODA), including funding allocated directly to Programme Countries, was spent in 2012 are currently being compiled and will be published in the Irish Aid Annual Report which will be available on the Irish Aid website <i>.</i>  Details of all countries that benefited from Ireland&#8217;s aid programme in 2011 are set out in the 2011 Irish Aid Annual Report, which is available on the Irish Aid website.</p></reply>

Section 15A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided by a local authority.  The person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.  The reduction in value is limited to the lesser of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  The relief ends on the sale or transfer of a property that has been adapted, unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property.</p><p>  A person who adapted a home before 2001 is not excluded from this relief.  The relief is dependent on local authority grant aid being paid under S.I. No. 607 of 2001 or S.I. No. 670 of 2007.  The 2001 regulations cover adaptation work carried out on or after 1 March 1993 and on foot of applications received by a local authority up to 1 November 2007, at which stage S.I. 670 of 2007 came into effect.</p></reply>

A lender&rsquo;s Arrears Support Unit must base its assessment of the borrower&rsquo;s situation on the full circumstances of the borrower including: </p><p>- the personal circumstances of the borrower; </p><p>- the overall indebtedness of the borrower; </p><p>- the information provided in the standard financial statement; </p><p>- the borrower&rsquo;s current repayment capacity; and </p><p>- the borrower&rsquo;s previous payment history. </p><p>  The Central Bank is proposing to update the CCMA so that it continues to provide protection to customers who cooperate with their bank while facilitating and promoting the resolution of arrears cases.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, last week the Central Bank also announced new measures to address mortgage arrears, which included the publication of performance targets for the main mortgage banks.  This new approach is aimed at ensuring that banks offer and conclude sustainable solutions for their customers in arrears by setting performance targets and proposing revisions to provision standards.  While the Central Bank is not mandating any particular model of restructuring and while sustainable solutions can only be arrived on a case by case basis, the Central Bank had indicated that the affordability assessment of the borrower needs to be based on, as indicated above, the borrower&rsquo;s current repayment capacity and prospective repayment capacity.</p><p>  Banks will be required to make regular returns to the Central Bank on their performance against the published targets.  The Central Bank will consider each bank&rsquo;s performance against the targets, including assessing whether sustainable solutions have been offered to customers.  Assessments will be carried out towards the end of 2013 and 2014 and the outcome of these assessments will determine whether targets have been met. If banks are deemed not to have met the targets they may be subject to regulatory and supervisory actions by the Central Bank.</p></reply>

There are quarterly reviews of programme implementation, and we have met all our target for these review to date.  Our programme is therefore well performing and we are now well on our way to exit it. </p><p>  We have used these quarterly reviews to renegotiate various aspects of the programme.  By way of example, we reversed the reduction in the minimum wage, and also agreed a more progressive use of the proceeds from the sale of state assets. </p><p>  A series of measures have already been put in place since early 2011 which serve to significantly reduce the cost and negative impact of Ireland&rsquo;s EU/IMF programme.  As I noted in my reply to your Parliamentary Question No. 94 of 15 November 2012, the interest rates on EU funding mechanisms (the EFSF and EFSM) were reduced significantly in 2011 and are now provided at rates close to the cost of funding.  These rates apply equally to all countries availing of these mechanisms.  The maturities of these loans were extended at the same time. </p><p>  Lengthening of maturities provides benefits in terms of phasing of loans and ensuring that the profile of redemptions is more orderly &ndash; avoiding as far as possible exceptionally large amounts in particular years.  By contrast, money borrowed at longer maturities is generally more expensive.  However, on balance, savings arising from maturity extension are significant though complex to calculate.</p><p>  The interest rate reductions for the EFSF and the EFSM have also been reflected in the rates charged on Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral loans from the UK, Sweden and Denmark.  It is estimated that the interest rate reductions on the EU funding mechanisms and the bilateral loans are worth of the order of &euro;9 billion over the initially envisaged 7 &frac12; year term of these loans. </p><p>  The positive impact of these changes has been significant as demonstrated by the fact that the average interest rate charged on our programme borrowing at the outset of the programme in 2010 was 5.82 per cent, whereas by end-December 2012, the NTMA has estimated that the all-in fixed euro equivalent cost of loans received under the EU/IMF programme was 3.36 per cent.</p><p>  As noted above, our EU programme funding is being provided at, or close to, the cost of funds for the lenders.  The scope for further changes to our programme interest payments is therefore very limited.  </p><p>  On 29th June 2012 the Euro Area Heads of State or Government (HoSG) agreed that &ldquo;... it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns&rdquo;.  The same statement also made explicit reference Ireland, noting the need to further improve &ldquo;the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme&rdquo;.  This commitment was reaffirmed by the European Council in December, which also mandated the completion of the operational framework for the ESM direct banking recapitalisation facility in the first semester of 2013.  Work is continuing at technical, senior official and Ministerial levels to complete work on the European Stability Mechanism&rsquo;s direct banking recapitalisation facility by June of this year in accordance with the mandate of the European Council.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position is that it is essential that the measures introduced for direct banking recapitalisation achieve the object of breaking the link between the sovereign and the banks &ndash; as agreed by the HoSG on 29th June last year and confirmed last December.</p><p>  In February this year the Government announced a solution to the Promissory Notes in IBRC (formerly Anglo Irish Bank &amp; Irish Nationwide).  The Promissory Notes were replaced with a series of long term, low interest Government bonds (average length of 34 years) and the liquidation of IBRC.  This generated real and tangible economic and financial benefits to the State, and will improve the long term viability of the Irish financial system and assist our return to the international financial markets.</p><p>  As a result of this solution, &euro;3.1 billion will not be paid this month and the arrangement also covers the repayment of &euro;3.1 billion that was due to Bank of Ireland following last year&rsquo;s arrangement.  It will deliver a cash-flow benefit of &euro;20 billion over the next 10 years, as well as reducing the deficit by &euro;1 billion per annum over the coming years.  It also generates significant efficiency benefits from moving assets to NAMA.</p><p>  In addition, the Government announced the ending of the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme for new liabilities after the 28th of March 2013.  This marks an additional significant step in the normalization of our banking system and reduces substantially the associated contingent liability of the State.</p><p>  EU Finance Ministers at Eurogroup and ECOFIN on 4/5 March 2012 discussed an adjustment of the maturities on the EFSF and EFSM loans to Ireland and Portugal in order to smooth the debt redemption profiles of both countries.  They agreed to ask the troika to come forward with a proposal for their best possible option for both Ireland and Portugal for EFSF and EFSM loans.  In addition, on Saturday last, 13 March, Eurogroup Finance Ministers agreed to an adjustment of the maturities of Ireland&rsquo;s (and Portugal&rsquo;s) EFSF loans. </p><p>  Work is continuing at official level on the adjustment of the maturities for Ireland and Portugal.  In the case of the EFSM loans, this will require discussion and agreement of the EU 27 Finance Ministers, and I expect this matter will be discussed at the April meeting of EU Finance Ministers in Dublin. </p><p>  The success of our overall approach to date is illustrated by the NTMA&rsquo;s highly successful sale of &euro;5 billion in ten year bonds last week.  We are now in the final year of our programme of support, and the Government will continue to seek improvements in our programme conditions appropriate to ensure we exit durably and successfully.</p></reply>

One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme.</p><p>  The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.  Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &#8364;3 billion in 2011, &#8364;3.5 billion in 2012 and &#8364;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  As the Deputy will be aware from my reply to his questions on 28 February, the Credit Reviewer said in his most recent quarterly report that &#8220;Both banks have achieved their &#8364;3.5bn SME loan sanction targets.  Over &#8364;8bn was sanctioned in 2012; of which approx. &#8364;2.5bn (27%) is new lending drawn down.&#8221;  According to the Credit Review Office, the balance of the sanctioned lending represented restructured or refinanced credit to SMEs.  The Credit Review Office in the past has noted that this is important in terms of sustaining the businesses and the associated jobs.</p><p>  In addition to the lending targets imposed on the banks,<b></b>the pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets.  The banks have submitted their lending plans for 2013 to my Department. My Department, in conjunction with the CRO, has analysed the plans and has met with the banks to discuss them.  The banks also meet with the Department of Finance and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress.  The monthly management meetings with the pillar banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by the Department.  My officials and I will engage robustly with the banks to ensure that they meet their 2013 targets.  The pillar banks report to my Department and to the Credit Review Office on credit on a sectoral basis but this is commercially sensitive information and I am not in a position to release it.</p><p>My Department&#8217;s review of 2012 is available at <i><i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></i><i>.  </i>It contains details of some of the actions taken in 2012 including demand surveys, ongoing consultation with the SME sector, initiatives with the banks, the Credit Review Office review and increase of its resources and NPRF funds for the SME sector. </p><p>  Access to Finance for SMEs is a key aspect of the Action Plan for Jobs 2013. It is the Government&#8217;s vision that all viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs, in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy. </p><p>  The SME State Bodies Group was established in 2012 to both develop key policy initiatives to support SME access to credit and other forms of finance, and to ensure their implementation.  It will continue in 2013 to engage intensively in proactively addressing issues associated with SME funding and financing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders through the SME Funding Consultation Committee.  My officials also meet frequently with additional stakeholders who wish to contribute to policy development in relation to access to finance. </p><p>  I have previously acknowledged that having only three main banks lending to the SME sector is not an ideal situation.  The Government has taken a number of actions, particularly where SMEs have been refused credit, to improve the situation in relation to credit availability to SMEs.  Ultimately, it is the many actions which this Government is taking to normalise the Irish banking sector such as the cessation of the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme together with the recovery of the economy which will attract new participants to lend in the SME sector.</p></reply>

With GDP up 0.8% (y-o-y) in the first three quarters of 2012, a second successive year of growth is expected to be confirmed tomorrow when the CSO releases its first full-year estimate for GDP in 2012.  The recovery is forecast to gain ground in 2013.  Over the medium term, a return to robust and more sustainable growth is foreseen.  While exports are expected to continue supporting economic activity, a gradual pick-up in domestic demand is also projected as the recovery broadens further and spills over to the labour market.  We have also seen that 2012 marked the largest increase in net job creation by IDA client companies in a decade.  All of this points to the fact that many of the underlying strengths of our economy remain, including a well-educated workforce, favourable demographics, an open and flexible economy and a pro-enterprise environment.  Of course there are many challenges which we still face and it will take time to work through the legacies of the crisis.  Not least of these is the high level of Government debt which we have accumulated.  However the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to peak this year and begin to fall from next year onwards. </p><p>  In order to reduce the deficit, consolidation measures amounting to around &#8364;28 billion or over 17 per cent of estimated 2013 GDP have been implemented since the crisis began.  This represents about 85 per cent of the total consolidation required.  This is an ambitious programme of fiscal consolidation, accompanied by structural reforms, to improve the fiscal position of the State.  We will continue to pursue this policy of fiscal consolidation, while making the adjustments as growth-friendly and equitable as possible, to ensure that the deficit is reduced below the 3 per cent of GDP target by 2015.</p><p>  The Government recognises that SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy and will play a vital role in the recovery of employment growth in our country.  One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme.  The Economic Management Council meets the banks on a regular basis and discusses the key issues pertaining to this priority.  My officials also meet regularly with key stakeholders at the forum of the SME Funding Consultation Committee. </p><p>  The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.  Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &#8364;3 billion in 2011, &#8364;3.5 billion in 2012 and &#8364;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks have reported that they achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets. </p><p>  In addition to the lending targets imposed on the banks,<b></b>the pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets.  The banks also meet with the Department of Finance and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress.  The monthly management meetings with the pillar banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by the Department.</p><p>  It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery.  However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.</p></reply>

Real GDP increased 0.8 per cent over the first three quarters of 2012 when compared with the same period in 2011.  Provisional figures for the year as a whole will be published tomorrow.  As is typical in small open economies, the traded sector is leading the recovery in Ireland with the services sector playing an increasingly significant role in export growth, owing much to the significant price and cost adjustments that have taken place in recent years. </p><p>  There has been a significant improvement in economy-wide cost competitiveness.  The European Commission is forecasting that Ireland&#8217;s nominal unit labour costs will have improved by 23 per cent relative to those in the euro area over the period 2008 &#8211; 2014. </p><p>  We are still, however, facing many challenges.  Domestic demand remains weak and is expected to contract again in 2013, albeit at a much slower pace than in the recent past.  Households, firms and the government sector are still working through the imbalances built up during the boom.  However, there have been some positive developments in recent months as core retail sales have stabilised and have now been in positive territory in year-on-year terms in each of the last six months.</p><p>  The unemployment rate at 14.1 per cent in February is showing signs of stabilisation, albeit at an unacceptably high level, with long-term unemployment now a prominent feature of the labour market.  This high unemployment rate is the unfortunate legacy of the crisis in Ireland, and underlines the importance of the <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2013</i> launched last month by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  </p><p>  My Department&#8217;s latest economic forecasts were set out in December 2012 as part of the Budget.  For this year, real GDP growth of 1.5 per cent is projected.  While exports are expected to remain the key driver of the recovery, a gradual pick-up in domestic demand is projected over the medium term, as the recovery broadens out and spills over to the labour market in a more sustained way from the second half of 2013 onwards.  Growth is expected to accelerate to 2&frac12; per cent in 2014 and close to 3 per cent in 2015.  My Department will issue revised forecasts in the Stability Programme Update, which will be published next month.</p></reply>

HP will also provide hosting facilities at a backup data centre for the purposes of business continuity. Both of these data centres are located in Dublin.</p><p>  The Central Bank will remain in control and manage all sensitive systems and data. This new data centre will negate the requirement for the bank to build two new Data Centre environments to replace existing facilities which are at &lsquo;end of life&rsquo;. It will also enable supplier consolidation for a range of services currently being provided by a diverse group of up to 17 external suppliers. There will be no &lsquo;outsourcing&rsquo; of Central Bank staff arising from the contract with HP. </p><p>  As the existing facilities are unsustainable, a direct comparison of costs does not provide a valid like for like comparison.  A robust business case, in which a number of alternatives were investigated thoroughly and compared across a number of criteria including cost, was produced and was approved by the Central Bank Commission. The main cost savings relate to the very significant capital costs avoided in relation to the alternative need to build two new data centres. The costs agreed with the provider are commercially sensitive and are not available for release. However the approach taken by the Bank was considerably advantageous on cost when compared to the alternatives examined.</p><p>  The Bank selected HP as a result of an open tendering process in compliance with the strict guidelines laid down by the EU public procurement process.  The cost of the tendering process for this service is estimated at &euro;150,000 including the costs of legal advice and assistance with the complex contract.</p><p>  The commercial agreement between the parties contains adequately robust provisions regarding the security and confidentiality of Central Bank information. These provisions are designed to safeguard commercially sensitive information and comply with the Banks internal standards and those laid down by the European Central Bank.</p><p>  The service provider is Hewlett Packard Ireland Limited. This entity is not regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. The commercial terms agreed between the parties impose strict restrictions on access to data.</p><p>  I am not in a position to outline the details of any specific outsourcing arrangements that may exist in other Central Banks as they are confidential to those institutions. We are aware that some other Central Banks and Regulators have engaged external specialist private companies to provide elements of the services which will be provided under this contract.  It is to be expected that other Central Banks will evaluate external Data Centre options when they come to an &lsquo;end of life&rsquo; scenario with their existing facilities.</p></reply>

As part of this series, it commenced the publication of data on mortgage restructures in respect of primary homes in 2010 and subsequently in respect of buy to let mortgages in 2012.  The outstanding number of restructured mortgage accounts for these types of mortgages at year ends, as well as the number of such mortgages currently in arrears, are set out below:</p><p><table><tr><th></th><th>end-2010</th><th>end-2011</th><th>end-2012</th></tr><tr><td>Stock of restructured PDH mortgages</td><td>          59,229 </td><td>        74,381 </td><td>         79,852 </td></tr><tr><td>of which in arrears</td><td>          24,024 </td><td>        37,584 </td><td>         37,821 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Stock of restructured BTL mortgages</td><td></td><td></td><td>         21,800 </td></tr><tr><td>of which in arrears</td><td></td><td></td><td>           8,331 </td></tr></table></p><p>It should be noted, however, that the number of restructured accounts possessing arrears at the end of each year does not indicate the level of mortgages that have slipped into arrears after initial restructuring. Restructured accounts that are in arrears is comprised of loans that had arrears both prior to restructuring (but are now performing according to the new arrangement) and loans that have slipped into arrears post restructuring. Furthermore, the annual increase in the total stock of restructures is not due exclusively to new<i> </i>  restructures that took place in that year, as some restructuring arrangements that were in place at the end of the previous year will have expired by the end of the following year. Therefore, those accounts whose restructuring arrangements have expired at some point during a period are not included in the overall stock of restructures at the end of that period.</p><p>The data currently published by the Central Bank relates to restructures and they type of restructure.  At the end of 2012, the Central Bank advised that around 23,430 PDH mortgage accounts had a permanent restructure type of arrangement but data is not yet available on the durability of the restructured arrangement.   However, as the Deputy is aware, last week the Central Bank announced new and significant targets for the main banks to offer and put in place durable and sustainable solutions for their customers in mortgage difficulty.  Initially the targets are for the offer of solutions but over time targets will also be set for the conclusion of sustainable solutions and for the durability of such solutions.  Arrangements will be put in place to audit and monitor progress made against these targets.</p></reply>

As I have previously stated, the Revenue Commissioners will not be involved in valuing individual properties.  LPT is a self-assessed tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the chargeable value of the property.  As values for properties under &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands for the purposes of LPT, property owners will not be required to provide a precise value for their property.  </p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners have prepared valuation guidance which, taken together with the owner&rsquo;s own knowledge of the property, will assist him or her in assessing its value.  The guidance, which is now available on the Revenue website, includes an on-line guide that provides indicative property valuation bands depending on the property type, age and location.  If a property has certain unique features, is smaller or larger than the average for the area, is in a significantly poor state of repair or has exceptional features, property owners will have to factor this into their assessment of the valuation of their property.  Where property owners consider that the on-line valuation guide is not indicating a reasonable valuation for their property, they should make their own assessment of its value.  As I have previously advised the House, where the Revenue guidance is used in an honest manner, the valuation made by a property owner will not be challenged by the Commissioners in accordance with its normal Customer Service Charter.  </p><p>  I am further advised that additional sources that a property owner would find useful to help them with their property value assessment include the property prices register, the property section of local newspapers, information from local estate agents and property websites.  </p><p>  It is a matter for the property owner to decide whether they should have their property professionally valued.  However, it is expected that, for the vast majority of properties, the guidance provided by Revenue will give the owner sufficient information which, when combined with their own knowledge of their property, will allow them determine the valuation band for their property.  Consequently I do not believe that a tax credit to have a residential property professionally valued is necessary. </p><p>  Finally, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a copy of the information sources used by the property owner to inform their self-assessment of the value of their property should be retained as proof of compliance with their LPT obligations.  This might include a paper record of the property section of their local newspaper, information downloaded from the property price register regarding the sales price of a similar house sold in the area, information downloaded from property websites or details taken from Revenue&rsquo;s valuation guidance. 	</p></reply>

In other words, the relief provided for in Section 825A is confined only to employees holding certain employments outside the State, and does not extend to the self-employed.   As the Deputy will be aware, where a statutory provision applies, as in this case, to one category of individual, it is not necessary to list in the provision all the categories of individuals to which the relevant provision does not apply nor is it necessary to distinguish as between various categories of individual.  This is why Section 825A makes no specific distinction as between employed and self-employed persons resident here but working exclusively outside the State.</p></reply>

As part of their ongoing prudential work, banks and the Central Bank monitor the level of capital and if a deficiency is identified, or if one could reasonably arise, the regulated bank will have to take action to address such a potential or actual shortfall.  As part of its overall support for the Irish banking system, the State has provided a very significant amount of capital support to the covered banks with the most recent capital injection arising from the March 2011 Central Bank PCAR assessment of the covered banks.  That capital assessment was based on certain macro economic and loan loss assumptions on all parts of the loan books of the covered banks, including mortgages.   The capital provided to the covered banks allowed them to meet their regulatory capital requirements having regard to aggregate actual and protected loan losses and other costs and also, in respect of the continuing banks, to enable them to continue to operate as banks.  The Central Bank has clearly stated that banks now have a substantial capital buffer with which to absorb losses on their mortgage portfolios and, as evidenced by the Central Bank statement last week on performance targets, the State authorities now require determined action by banks to systemically work through their mortgage book and to offer appropriate durable solutions to mortgage holders in arrears.  </p><p>  However, under the Relationship Frameworks put in place with the covered banks, the Boards of these institution, in the exercise of their fiduciary responsibilities, are responsible for the day to day operations of the banks including decisions on the commercial management and resolution, where appropriate, of individual loans and they are required to report, in line with prudential and accounting requirements, on the provisioning position of all individual loans in their interim and annual accounts.  As Minister, I have no directive role or involvement in such decisions.</p></reply>

Following the publication of the Review of Remuneration Practice and Frameworks at the Covered Institutions, I have directed the covered institutions including AIB to come up with plans to meet the State&rsquo;s objectives.

The National Debt, that is the net debt incurred by the Exchequer after taking account of cash balances and other related assets, stood at &euro;163.354 billion at end-February 2013. Current estimates for Nominal GDP for both 2012 and 2013, at &euro;163.2 billion and &euro;167.7 billion respectively, were published as part of <i>Budget 2013</i>.   As regards payments for banking recapitalisation which affected the National debt during the period of 2007 to 2012, the following was recorded:</p><p>- In 2009, the Exchequer injected &euro;4 billion into Anglo Irish Bank.</p><p>- In 2010, the Exchequer provided, by way of Special Investment Shares (SIS), &euro;625 million to EBS and a further &euro;100 million to INBS.</p><p>- In 2011, the Exchequer funded the first of the Promissory Notes payments to IBRC (formerly Anglo Irish Bank and INBS) and EBS. These amounted to &euro;3,060 million and &euro;25 million respectively. The Exchequer also provided a gross &euro;7.6 billion towards the recapitalisation of Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life and Permanent (ILP) in July 2011.</p><p>- In 2012, the Exchequer funded the second instalment of the EBS Promissory Note of &euro;25 million. It also funded the &euro;1.3 billion acquisition of Irish Life Limited from ILP.</p><p>Finally the bond issued to settle the 2012 IBRC Promissory Note also added to National debt in 2012. With regard to the purchase of Irish Life in 2012, the Deputy may be aware that the State recently sold Irish Life. This was a welcome development, representing the first time during the crisis that a company in which we have invested has been returned fully to private ownership.</p><p><bu>Table 1.

Revenue has appointed a number of payment service agents, An Post, Payzone and Omnivend Systems Ltd, to provide cash payment facilities for LPT.  The payment service agents will not apply any minimum threshold for cash payments but will charge a transaction service fee, which will be borne by the customer.  The three payment service agents have extensive networks and are easily accessible across the country.

As a new service that will have exceptional temporary pressures at particular stages of its initial implementation it proved difficult to predict the level of contact that would arise during its introduction and, consequently, the resource required to meet customer service demands.    Revenue considered a number of options for the provision of a phone call service and estimated the cost of providing the service needed to meet the anticipated demands taking account of a number of resource options.  These included the use of existing Revenue resources only; the recruitment of Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) for their 1890 service; the outsourcing of the entire service and a mix of existing staff, TCOs and external resources.  Revenue chose the final option outlined, a mix of external and internal resources. </p><p>  The service was initiated on 7 March, the contact number is 1890 200 255 and it operates on the basis that calls are handled by the service provider in the first instance.  Complex matters that cannot be handled by the service provider are escalated to a team of Revenue staff.  The call management and reporting systems are monitored by Revenue and also the actual delivery of the service.  The number of staff allocated to the call centre service, both in Revenue and externally will vary in response to the levels of demand, but for the Deputy&#8217;s information, current indicative numbers are 40 external staff with up to 27 Revenue staff available as required.</p><p>  The outsourcing of peak call handling in respect of the LPT will ensure that skilled Revenue staff can continue to provide the necessary customer service to meet their long term, on-going demands and commitments in relation to the strategic priority of maintaining and improving levels of tax and duty compliance.  It meets the specific and unusual need which has arisen in the context of the roll out of the new tax.  It might also be noted that, following a full hearing, the Civil Service Arbitration Board determined that the proposal to outsource this service is entirely consistent with provisions of the national agreements on the provision of outsourced services, including specific provisions in <i>Towards 2016</i>   and the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014.</p><p>  The &#8364;4.9 million figure quoted by the Deputy does not represent the estimate of the cost of the outsourced call centre service.  This figure was Revenue&#8217;s estimate of the total cost of providing a service using internal and external resources.  The nature of the contract is that the cost will depend on the volume of calls handled, but I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is expected to be very much lower than the figure quoted by the Deputy.  I am further informed that in accordance with the relevant Government  decision,  the Revenue Commissioners publish quarterly lists of payments over &#8364;20,000 and payments made under this contract will be included in future lists.</p><p>  The proposal to address the simpler LPT queries through the outsourcing of limited call services offers a flexible, scalable response to an unpredictable demand.  It will also provide assurance that the introduction of LPT will not damage Revenue&#8217;s overall capacity to deliver for the Exchequer and for the Irish people, an important consideration at any time and vital in the current economic circumstances.</p></reply>

This is essential if they are to return to profitability, be in a position to support the economy and repay the State&rsquo;s investment through a return to private ownership.  On behalf of the Government, I have now directed the banks to come up with plans as to how they intend to address this issue in a manner that can help meet the State&rsquo;s objectives.  I expect the value of those plans to mean a saving of 6% - 10% of total remuneration costs, through reductions in payroll and pension benefits, new working arrangements and structures that deliver efficiency gains. </p><p>  I acknowledge that the sacrifices and changes made by bank employees to date at all levels and recognise that this has been achieved without major industrial unrest in what is a critically important sector.  However, it can never be forgotten by management and employees of these banks &ndash; both past and present &ndash; that without enormous cost to Irish taxpayers these institutions would not have survived and that this needs to be borne in mind during future discussions.</p></reply>

Therefore, in assessing the market value of a residential property it would be inappropriate that account be taken of whether the property was purchased by its current owner at a discount to market value, whether from a local authority or any other previous owner.  The Local Property Tax (LPT) is a self-assessed tax, therefore it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the chargeable value of the property.     Certain Government backed schemes have been and continue to be available, aimed at helping lower-income households buy their own homes by allowing properties to be purchased at prices significantly less than their market value.  I am advised by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that under the Affordable Housing Scheme, launched in March 1999, local authorities provide additional housing on land, which they own, to low-income purchasers at cost price.  A mortgage subsidy is payable to qualifying households based on income bands.   The Shared Ownership Scheme facilitates access to home ownership in two or more stages for those who cannot afford home ownership immediately.  In the case of qualifying households a subsidy towards the rent payments for that portion of the equity not yet purchased, based on income bands, is payable by the local authority, and recouped by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  There are transitional arrangements for subsidy payments to avoid disincentives in the scheme as income rises.</p><p>  To the extent that those who purchased a property under such schemes are on a low income, they may be in a position to qualify for either a full or a partial deferral of payment of Local Property Tax.  The income thresholds for a full deferral are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple.  The thresholds for a partial deferral are &euro;25,000 for a single person and &euro;35,000 for a couple.  These thresholds may be increased by up to 80% of mortgage interest payable &ndash; this increased threshold is available until 2017. </p></reply>

The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that a liability for LPT will arise where a person owns a residential property on the liability date which will be 1 May 2013 for the year 2013 and for subsequent years 1 November in the preceding year.  </p><p>  The Act provides that local authorities will be liable to pay LPT on their properties in the same way as any other residential property owner, unless the properties are used to accommodate people who have special housing needs.  Special housing needs refers to the provision of housing and support for people who have a particular need in addition to a general housing need to enable them to live in the community.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are currently drawing up guidelines that will facilitate social housing providers, including local authorities, in identifying which of their properties are used to provide special needs housing and are, therefore, exempted from the charge to LPT.  In keeping with the Department of Finance&#8217;s mission to play a central role in the achievement of the Government&#8217;s economic and social goals, as set out in my Department&#8217;s <i>Annual Review of 2012</i>  , officials of my department, along with the Revenue Commissioners, are actively engaging with social housing providers, including, for example, Focus Ireland, in this regard.  </p><p>  It is not possible to give a definitive view on whether local authority emergency or transitional housing will be exempt from LPT without further information on the nature of the housing and any supports provided. </p><p>  As already stated, one of the criteria for liability to LPT is that a building is suitable for use as a dwelling.  The fact that a building is unoccupied will not of itself mean the building is exempt from LPT.  It will be a question of fact in each case whether a particular building awaiting demolition or regeneration is suitable for use as a dwelling.  It is not possible to provide a general reply that will address each case; for example, a perfectly habitable property may be awaiting demolition simply because a local authority intends to re-develop an area. </p><p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that where local authority owned properties are not exempt from LPT, the market value of any such property will be deemed to fall into the lowest valuation band of &#8364;0 to &#8364;100,000 up to and including 2016.  This will result in an LPT charge of &#8364;45 per property for 2013 and &#8364;90 per year for 2014 to 2016.  In addition, section 119 of the Act also gives local authorities until 1 January 2014 to pay the 2013 tax. </p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are liaising with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to establish how local authorities will provide the Revenue Commissioners with information in relation to their LPT liability and the timing and manner of the payment of this liability.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-20a.545.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032000060#WRM03500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 231 to 235, inclusive, together.</p><p>  Section 30 of the Finance Bill 2013 introduces a scheme of tax incentives, focussing on the regeneration of the historic centres of some of our main cities. The scheme, which will be introduced by Ministerial order, is entitled the Living City Initiative and will apply, in the first instance, on a pilot basis, to specified regeneration areas in Waterford and Limerick.  My Department have prepared an information note on this Initiative which was published on the Department&rsquo;s website on 13 February last. </p><p>  The historic centres of some of our cities have suffered for a long time from gradual depopulation and the relocation of family homes and businesses out to the suburbs, particularly during the period of the &ldquo;Celtic Tiger&rdquo;. These centres have also suffered greatly from the general economic downturn of the past few years and while I am not suggesting that this scheme is capable, on its own, of reversing that trend, I am convinced it has a part to play especially with regard to helping to rebuild confidence in those areas. The particular focus of the scheme is as follows:</p><p>- to encourage people back to the centres of Irish cities to live in historic buildings, in particular Georgian houses, and</p><p>- to encourage the regeneration of the retail heartland of central city business districts.</p><p>  I indicated in my Budget speech in December last year that I would examine proposals for a targeted incentive for already identified regeneration areas. The tax relief which will apply under this scheme will operate for 5 years from the date of commencement. However, it is my intention that before it begins, the scheme will be the subject to an ex-ante cost benefit analysis. Subject to a positive outcome from that analysis, I will seek EU approval under State Aid rules for this initiative to be commenced for Limerick and Waterford cities. I have not yet decided on the exact boundaries of the regeneration areas in these cities but I will be consulting with my Government colleagues and the relevant local authorities before I make any final decision.</p><p>  There are 2 strands to the scheme.  The first involves a tax relief for the refurbishment or conversion of Georgian houses for residential purposes. The relief will only apply to owner/occupiers and not for rented residential accommodation. The relief will be spread over 10 years at the rate of 10% of the expenditure per annum, provided the property is occupied as the principal private residence of the individual during that time. No relief can be transferred to any subsequent purchaser. It will be necessary for the individual to have received confirmation from the relevant local authority that the property conforms to planning permission (if required), appropriate building regulations and floor area limits and that the cost of the works seem reasonable, before the relief can be claimed. </p><p>  The second strand is a scheme of accelerated industrial buildings allowances for the conversion and refurbishment of retail premises, although other business services will also be allowed where the premises is a Georgian building. In such cases, the commercial element will be confined to the ground floor or basement with the residential element upstairs. The allowance is at the rate of 15% per annum for 6 years with 10% in year 7 and is subject to the normal balancing charges or allowances if disposed of within that time period.  The standard restrictions on the sideways setting of unused capital allowances against other income will apply and there will be no exemption from the current treatment of the termination of the carry-forward of certain unused capital allowances for passive investors. Furthermore, the high earners restriction, which applies across the full range of reliefs such as this, also applies to this relief. </p><p>  I am hopeful that these reliefs will help restore some of these inner city areas to their former glory. The prevalence of Georgian houses is a peculiar characteristic of the built-environment of many Irish cities and while some of these Georgian buildings have fallen into a state of disrepair and dereliction, my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and myself have been exploring ways in which to promote and support the regeneration of these city centres. If EU State Aid approval is received, I will then consider extending the scope of the Initiative to other clearly defined areas within cities, but I do not believe that it would be prudent to go beyond the areas which are already identified at this stage.</p><p>  The reliefs which I am introducing are an attempt to encourage people back into these cities, to rear their families and if possible, to operate their business from there. It will not be possible to revitalise these inner city areas without this happening. Pobal, the state agency that supports local communities has developed a sophisticated index which measures deprivation in different local areas across Ireland. Taking into account the deprivation statistics from the 2011 Census, both Limerick and Waterford score as the most disadvantaged of our major cities. Furthermore, unemployment rates in these cities are also the highest, significantly worse than the national average.  Both have their own unique problems regarding unemployment and social problems and for these reasons I have selected these for the pilot phase of this initiative.</p></reply>

The final staffing position for all schools will not be known until later in the year when the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeal Board will have been considered.</p><p>  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools is being gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.  During this period the pupil threshold for a 2-classroom school is being increased to 20 pupils. In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.  The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.  If amalgamations do take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department.</p><p>  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities and my Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the small schools that are affected by the budget measure.  In this regard small schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting sustainable increased enrolments in September 2013 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.</p><p>  The detailed arrangements in relation to the appeals process are set in the Department's Staffing Circular 0013/2013.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p></reply>

This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the rights of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.</p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that in 2011, I launched a discussion paper on school enrolment.  The &quot;Discussion Paper on a Regulatory Framework for School Enrolment&quot; contains suggestions on how to make the process of enrolling in schools more open, equitable and consistent and is available on my Department's website.</p><p>  I also invited education partners and interested parties to submit their views to my Department.  The feedback from this consultation has helped inform the nature and scope of a new regulatory framework for school enrolment.</p><p>  I intend to bring legislative proposals to Government this year, the primary aim of which will be to ensure that every child is treated fairly and that every child has a place at school</p></reply>

Work-life balance arrangements in the public service will continue to be among the best available options provided by Irish employers, particularly when considered in tandem with annual leave and other provisions.  These arrangements underpin important social policy goals, in particular supporting the ongoing participation of parents and carers in the workplace.  The Irish public service has a proud record of promoting these arrangements and the employee profile across the service reflects the strong efforts made over the last few decades to ensure that public servants&#8217; employment terms allow them to balance their work and home commitments.  A range of flexible working arrangements will continue to be available across the public service where they currently exist, including, flexitime, work sharing arrangements, the shorter working year scheme, career breaks, as well as all of the statutory entitlements such as parental leave and carer&#8217;s leave.  The LRC is proposing that two of these arrangements, namely flexi-time and work sharing, be amended as sustainable reform measures that will underpin the delivery of a more integrated, efficient and effective public service.</p><p><b>  Flexi-time: </b>Public service organisations that currently have flexitime in place will continue to have flexi-time.  It will be available for existing staff and new entrants up to the grade of Higher Executive Officer and equivalent.  Everyone on flexi-time will continue, within certain limits, to be able to vary their arrival times, departure times and lunch breaks.  A change is proposed in the amount of flexi-leave that can be taken in a flexi period (4 weeks) - this will now be one day.  This still allows somebody on flexitime to avail of an additional 13 days flexi-leave per year in addition to their annual leave entitlement and any other flexible working arrangement that they may have.  Management grades at Assistant Principal and equivalent, who currently have access to flexi-time will continue to have access to these arrangements but will not have access to flexi-leave.</p><p><b>  Work Sharing: </b>It is important to clarify that a worksharer is an employee who was recruited to a full time position and has opted to reduce their hours to an agreed work sharing pattern.  Work sharing will still be available within the public service.  The proposals include a provision that will require everyone, with notable exceptions, to work a pattern of at least 50% of the full time hours.  It is important to note that only in the region of 2% of those currently work sharing in the Civil Service have a pattern of less than 50%.  In recognition of the valuable contribution made by carers to society, those in receipt of Carer&#8217;s Allowance will not be required to increase their hours above the 15 hour a week limit for payment of their allowance.  In support of our commitment to achieving the public service target of a 3% employment rate for people with disabilities, those with disabilities who have reached a reasonable accommodation with their employer to work less than 50% of full time hours will continue to be able to avail of these arrangements for as long as they are required.  It is necessary to revise flexi-time and work sharing arrangements to better reflect the current needs of public service organisations, in the context of falling numbers and changing demands for public services.  The operation of these arrangements must support the business of the organisation and the provision of services to the public.  The proposed changes are an attempt to balance the requirements of the business while enabling staff to balance work and personal life requirements.</p></reply>

The proposals contain many multifaceted measures and it takes time to fully disaggregate the impact on Departmental pay and pension allocations.  In the interim, the Deputy will be aware that all Government Departments have legal authority under the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act 1965 to spend funds up to the value of four-fifths of the previous year&rsquo;s allocation until the revised estimates have been approved.  The Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2013 will provide additional details and information in relation to the allocations contained in the 2013 Estimates as published on 5 December 2012 in the "Expenditure Report 2013".

In July 2012, the Government agreed a range of actions aimed at achieving a focused and integrated approach to external service delivery of non-core processes with the objective of reducing costs and focusing staff resources on priority areas.  A Commercial Delivery Manager was also appointed to drive this issue.  As part of this approach, the Government has decided that all proposed new services across the Public Service will be tested for external service delivery before any approval to provide the service internally will be granted.  External service delivery leads have been appointed in every Department and Sector and the Health, Justice and Local Government sectors are preparing external service delivery plans.  My Department is also examining a number of potential cross-Departmental projects for external service delivery.</p><p>  While my Department is overseeing the development and implementation of external service delivery policy for the Public Service, the testing and ultimate decision with regard to the external delivery of any particular service is a matter for the individual public bodies concerned in each case.  It is envisaged that this will involve cost-benefit analysis, on a case-by-case basis.  To this end, my Department has produced and distributed a Preliminary Business Case Template to all Departments and Sectors.  All contracts offered for external service delivery will be subject to the normal rules governing public procurement, which require all services to be offered by competitive tender.  In addition, the proposals from the Labour Relations Commission in respect of the Draft Public Service Agreement 2013-16 reaffirm the principles and procedures in the Croke Park Agreement regarding outsourcing, which include a commitment to evaluate the existing in-house service, the outsourcing option and to compare both.</p></reply>

The appeal was heard on 18 December 2012 when judgment was reserved.  In addition, there are a number of pending High Court challenges to the current Electrical and Construction REAs, all of which challenge the constitutionality of provisions in the 1946 and 1990 Industrial Relations Acts underpinning the REA system.  Unless and until such time as the Courts rule otherwise, the terms and conditions of employment contained in all Registered Employment Agreements remain in place and continue to be legally binding.</p><p>  I am very aware that current economic circumstances are having a particular effect on areas such as electrical contracting and construction, and other sectors that are covered by the statutory wage setting systems (REAs and EROs).  With this in mind, I have been determined to reform these systems to help businesses in struggling sectors to survive, and to protect existing jobs and help business to create new ones.  To this end, a new legal framework for REAs and EROs has been put in place with effect from 1 August 2012, following the enactment of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012.  The measures contained in the Act make significant provisions for all future registrations, variations and cancellations of REAs and will transform the REA and JLC systems and make them fit for purpose.</p></reply>

Ireland fully subscribes to its international obligations in this regard. </p><p>  From an export control perspective, my Department monitors trade flows to embargoed and sanctioned countries in close co-operation with Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service.</p><p>  This co-operation with Customs is an essential aspect of the effective implementation of our export control regime and especially in connection with exports of controlled technology to sanctioned or embargoed countries. </p><p>  In addition, prior to issuing any export licence for goods intended for a country where there is civil or military unrest, my Department consults with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It is important that the export of sensitive technology is properly controlled and the licensing procedures operated by my Department take into account Irish foreign policy considerations, the EU Common Position on Military Exports, international sanctions policies, as well as obligations stemming from Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the international export control regimes.</p><p>  As part of the licensing process my Department requires extensive information from companies including detailed information in respect of the end-use and the end-user of the product to ensure the ultimate use of a licensed export conforms with national and international law. </p><p>  Furthermore, as part of wider outreach activities, my Department recently met with the industrial development agencies so that their officials who advise client companies on export opportunities can inform these companies of their responsibilities in relation to export controls and embargoes. </p><p>  In relation to the specific instance raised by the Deputy, I am satisfied that the product involved was not an item covered by the EU&rsquo;s military list.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that the security, regional stability and human rights concerns which underpin export controls are of paramount importance to my Department. My Department takes its responsibilities in this regard very seriously.</p></reply>

Arrears can be withheld without the agreement of the person concerned, but in all cases, a notification of the intention to withhold arrears is issued and the person concerned is offered the opportunity to give their views on the proposal, within 21 days. </p><p>  The person concerned applied for domiciliary care allowance in April 2012.

This would leave an outstanding balance of &euro;31,254.80 for repayment by on-going weekly deduction.</p><p>  The person concerned was notified by letter on 13 March 2013 of the proposal to retain the arrears as outlined, and subsequently contacted the Department by phone to discuss this.

Recent developments have focused on CE schemes involved in supporting community child-care services and on CE participants who wish to pursue a career in child-care while on CE. These developments reflect the findings of a number of recent reviews - the &#8220;CE Financial Review of Schemes&#8221; (2012) and the &#8220;Review of Department of Social Protection Employment Support Schemes&#8221; (2012). In response, the Department is planning a number of improvements which will provide a clear career progression path and a structure for CE participants in Early Years Services.</p><p>  These improvements will provide a more tailored and valuable support to the provision of community child-care and achieve greater coherence between CE participation and the job market.  The Department has engaged with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DYCA)<font color="#004080"> </font>regarding the qualification requirements and progression path for CE participants<font color="#004080">.</font></p><p>  In addition to engagement with the DCYA, there has been consultation with the representatives of the Child-care Sector including County Childcare Committees, and schemes currently involved in child-care provision.</p><p>  As the programme is in the early stages of design, it is too early to provide a definitive budget statement. However, the current arrangements for allocation of the CE budget will apply to this initiative.</p></reply>

In addition, an estimated &euro;284 million will be spent on the household benefits scheme, providing some 410,000 customers with a package worth almost &euro;700 per year.  This scheme incorporates the electricity and gas allowances, the telephone allowance and the free television licence.</p><p>  The aim of the fuel allowance scheme is to provide additional support for those on long-term welfare payments during the winter season.  The duration of the fuel allowance is for 26 weeks or  half of the year and covers the coldest months from October to April. The allowance is not paid beyond 26 weeks in any circumstances. The household benefits package is paid all year round.</p><p>  While there is no provision to extend the fuel allowance beyond the qualifying period, under my Department&rsquo;s supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people who have special heating needs.  A person may qualify for a heating supplement, if they can show that they have extra heating needs because of their age, medical condition or disability, are living alone or only with a dependent adult or dependent children  and satisfy a means test.  Approximately 3,200 people are currently in receipt of this supplement.</p><p>  In addition, exceptional needs payments (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his or her own resources. There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is decided on the particular circumstances of the case.  The provision for exceptional needs payments in 2013 is &euro;47.6 million, with an additional &euro;11.4 million for supplements.</p></reply>

The Report of the Group, which recommends a scheme for the legal recognition of transgender persons, was approved by the Government on 12 July 2011, and was subsequently published on 14 July 2011.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Report, the Department has been working on developing draft Heads of a Gender Recognition Bill.  In this context, it has engaged in discussions with the relevant medical health professionals and with representatives from interested NGOs.</p><p>  Given the legal complexities involved in relation to some of the GRAG recommendations relating to the marital and civil partnership status of individuals, in March 2012 my Department sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General, which in turn sought the legal opinion of external counsel on these issues.</p><p>  The formal opinion of the Attorney General was received in the Department in December 2012 and is currently under consideration by officials in my Department with a view to progressing the draft Heads of the Bill. </p><p>  In addition, discussions are taking place with the Department of Justice and Equality in relation to potential changes to legislation under its remit which may be contained in the draft Heads of the Bill. </p><p>  Given the sensitive and complex nature of the issues involved, it is my intention to ask the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education to discuss the provisional draft Heads of Bill once they are completed.

This figure includes approximately 400 Social Welfare and Special Investigation Unit Inspectors and the remainder of the staff are based in the Local Offices and Scheme Headquarters or other control units.</p><p>One of the major changes that has occurred over the period referred to by the Deputy arises from the transfer of some 1,700 Community Welfare Service (CWS) and F&Aacute;S staff to the Department.  A more integrated approach to fraud control can, therefore, now be realised as a single customer view for control purposes is possible.  The staff numbers above do not include the CWS or F&Aacute;S staff whose work would also include a control dimension.</p><p>Each major headquarter scheme section has a dedicated control unit which initiates, undertakes and co-ordinates all control activities within their respective areas.  While some 'desk review' work is carried out at these units, the detailed investigations are sent to Inspectors, including the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) to carry out.</p><p>The SIU carry out a wide range of control activities and projects which include reviewing means-tested claims and entitlements, investigating fraud and abuse and carrying out employer inspections.  The Unit also works jointly with Revenue staff in Joint Investigation Units and other inter-agency work is undertaken with NERA, Customs and the Garda&iacute;.  <b>  </b></p><p>In addition, it is worth noting that:</p><p>- Activation and Control Teams operate at local level.  They provide a focal point for the management and co-ordination of all the activities and resources in relation to the control of schemes at local level.  They augment general control activity with particular approaches based on local knowledge and circumstances; and</p><p>- Medical Assessors carry out medical review examinations and desk reviews/assessments of medical reports in order to provide a second medical opinion for the guidance of Deciding and Appeals Officers on all medical aspects of the illness schemes.</p><p>The table below illustrates the level of control activity and control related reviews that were recorded by the Department from 2010 to 2012:</p><p><table><tr><th></th><th><div>Control Reviews</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>929,383</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>982,580</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>1,196,180</div></td></tr></table></p><p>Control reviews are proactive reviews on claims in payment.  It is important to stress that not all of these will have been carried out by Inspectors.  As outlined above, control activity is carried out in a number of ways by different staff and teams.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that Social Welfare Inspectors are appointed under the Social Welfare Acts to investigate and report on claims and to carry out inspections at employer premises to ensure that there is compliance with the PRSI scheme.  An Inspector&rsquo;s report is then used to inform the Deciding Officer, who is also appointed under the Social Welfare Acts to make decisions on claims based on all the facts and evidence available.  Therefore, the breakdown of the number of fraudulent claims that have been identified per inspector during each of these years is not available.<b> </b></p></reply>

They also complete medical reports for customers for the various illness and disability related schemes, as required.  In the case of Illness Benefit, the Department initially accepts the GP&rsquo;s opinion regarding medical eligibility for the scheme.  However, as part of the review process the Medical Assessors carry out desk assessments of medical evidence/reports supplied by the medical professional and where required, conduct in person assessments in order to provide a second medical opinion to that of the certifying doctor for the guidance of Deciding and Appeals Officers.  The Medical Assessors employ evidence based medical protocols in completing their medical assessments of clients. These protocols provide comprehensive guidelines on a wide range of medical conditions/disorders.  When conducting an assessment, the Medical Assessor does not dispute the existence of the certified cause of incapacity but rather s/he assesses the degree to which the loss of function in work-related activities resulting from the disease or injury affects the person&rsquo;s ability to perform either their own job or alternative types of work.  Therefore when a Medical Assessor presents a medical opinion that a customer is not eligible for a scheme, this does not necessarily mean that he is contradicting the medical report completed by the GP for the customer or that there is any suggestion of falsification of information by the GP. </p><p>  Any instances of irregular certification that come to light pertaining to the issue of Social Welfare Medical Certificates or completion of medical reports are investigated by this Department. Following investigation, irregular certification action may have consequences which include the imposition of monetary penalties, termination of the Certifier&rsquo;s agreement, or referral to the Medical Council or relevant body.</p></reply>

The population share of those aged 65 and over is expected to more than double between now and 2051, from 11% to approximately 23% in 2050.  In contrast, the working age to pensioner ratio is projected to decline gradually from 5.3 /1 to 2.1/1.  </p><p>  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  The fundamental principle involved here is that people need to participate in the workforce for longer and they need to contribute more towards their pensions if they are to achieve the income they expect or would like to have in retirement.  </p><p>  The interdepartmental group, which was established in August 2012 is chaired by the Department of Social Protection, includes representatives from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Pensions Board.  Further engagement has also been undertaken with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health and Children. </p><p>  The group has met on 4 occasions which included a &lsquo;Forum on Working and Retirement&rsquo; held in Croke Park on 12th Dec last.  The purpose of this forum was to obtain views from representative bodies and stakeholders and identify the wide ranging issues linked to working and retirement prior to the development of any possible policy proposals.  Attendees included employer and employee representative groups, older people&rsquo;s representative groups, representatives from the pensions industry, academic commenters and representatives from the legal profession.</p><p>  The agenda for the group&rsquo;s meetings has included consideration of the broad range of issues impacting on the labour market participation of older workers; enterprise issues, employment and equality law issues; and proposals regarding deferral of the state pension and consideration of occupational pension issues. </p><p>  It is expected that the Group will prepare preliminary proposals detailing measures which may encourage participation and retention in the labour market of older workers and present proposals to Government in the near future.   </p></reply>

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect architectural heritage, including thatched buildings, by including them on the Record of Protected Structures. Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future. </p><p>My Department does not maintain a record of the number and distribution of habitable thatched units. However, it is the practice of my Department, when undertaking county surveys for the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH), to accord a '<i>regional'</i> rating to thatched structures where the roof is intact. Structures rated '<i>regional'</i> or higher are subsequently recommended by me, as Minister, to a planning authority, under section 53 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, for inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures. Information on such thatch buildings recorded by the NIAH is available on my Department's website at .</p><p>  In addition, as part of an Architectural Advice Series, my Department plans to publish an advice book on thatching in 2013, which will include practical advice and guidance on aspects of conserving and restoring thatched structures. The nine previously published booklets in the Series cover areas such as roof and energy efficiency for traditionally built buildings. The full series is available on my Department&#8217;s website.</p><p>  The nature of thatch is such that it requires regular maintenance and more frequent renewal in comparison with other types of roofing. However, some of the costs involved in maintaining thatched properties can be attributed to the use of an incorrect material, issues with the style of thatching and material used, and severe weather conditions. There are some funding streams which, subject to the availability of resources, may assist owners of thatched houses in repairing or maintaining their thatched roofs, including </p><p>- my Department&#8217;s <i>Structures at Risk</i>   Fund, </p><p>- the Traditional Farm Buildings Grant Scheme, which is managed by the Heritage Council Heritage for REPS 4 participants, and </p><p>- a grant scheme for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs administered by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

While I know that the Deputy appreciates the funding difficulties facing all Departments at this time, I can assure him that I remain committed to securing the best possible level of funding for these sectors.

The group from Clara Bog commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June last, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have now been accommodated.</p><p>  Progress has been made with a view to the relocation of turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation in County Kildare to Timahoe North, County Kildare, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na. Officials from my Department as well as staff from Bord na M&oacute;na recently meet with a number of qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog. A number of issues raised at the meeting are being followed up and my Department envisages that turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the forthcoming turf cutting season.</p><p>  I am advised that of the remaining 49 raised bog special areas of conservation, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 31 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites. It would be inappropriate to name the locations of these sites at this early stage. Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation due, for example, to the small number that had been cutting turf on these sites during the relevant five year period and would qualify for the relocation option available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.</p><p>  Lattins Bog in County Kildare has been identified as a potential relocation site for turf cutters from Mouds Bog special area of conservation in County Kildare. Bord na M&oacute;na has produced a preliminary suitability assessment report for the relocation site, which my Department has provided to the Secretary of the Committee of the Kildare Turf Cutters Association. My Department has asked Bord na M&oacute;na to undertake a stratigraphy survey at this site, which will provide an indication of the quality of peat there.</p><p>  Since February last, my Department has been in contact with the Kildare Turf Cutters Association in order to arrange a meeting with representatives from the Association to discuss issues pertaining to Mouds Bog. However, to date, the Kildare Turf Cutters Association has not taken up this invitation.</p><p>  A payment of &euro;1,500 or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum is available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to applicants while awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs. </p></reply>

In this regard, the Falcarragh to M&iacute;n an Chladaigh area, which had been identified as an Important Bird Area in a report published in 2000, was specifically mentioned in the Court&rsquo;s ruling. A failure to abide by the Court&rsquo;s findings would result in the probable imposition of fines against the State. In the circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to suspend the designation process for the Falcarragh to Meenlaragh SPA.</p><p>The proposal to designate a number of Corncrake sites in Co Donegal, including the Falcarragh to Meenlaragh SPA, was advertised in the Donegal News, the Irish Times and in the Foinse supplement to the Irish Independent in the week commencing 4 July 2011. In addition, the proposed designations were announced four times daily on Highland Radio on 6, 7 and 8 July 2011.</p><p>Some 909 landowners and licence holders who could be identified in respect of the Falcarragh to Meenlaragh SPA were written to and provided with detailed information packs, including maps outlining the proposed boundaries, the reasons behind the proposed designation and the processes for objecting.</p><p>Maps and details of the proposed designations were also made available for inspection in</p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">- the Garda Stations in Bunbeg, Carrick, Carndonagh, Carrigart, Creeslough, Culdaff, Dunfanaghy and Malin;</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">- the libraries in Carndonagh and Letterkenny;</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">- offices of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and of Teagasc in Letterkenny;</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">- the Donegal County Council offices in Lifford; and</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">- the Department of Social Protection offices in Letterkenny.</div></p><p>Under the provisions of the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, the requisite consultation process commences after the notification of the intention to designate a site.</p><p>The Falcarragh to Meenlaragh SPA was chosen as a site for Corncrake on foot of evidence from survey work over a period of years indicating that the area is of continued importance to this species. Using the best available spatial data on Corncrake distribution and numbers, a suitable boundary for the SPA was produced by my Department. The annual survey data was gathered using international best practice methodology as part of ongoing Corncrake conservation work. This species spends a large proportion of its time concealed in vegetation and sightings are rare. The primary method of estimating its abundance and distribution relies on analysis of the audible records of this vocal species. It is only the male that regularly calls or sings and there is usually no direct recording of the female or young in an area. Scientific studies have shown that the nest of a female Corncrake and her brood rearing area is usually within 250 meters of the singing place of the male with which she paired. Individual male Corncrake can call from several locations over the course of a breeding season and may pair with more than one female.</p><p>Over 35 individual Irish grid reference records estimating the singing locations of male Corncrake are outlined below. These estimates are of calling male Corncrakes that were recorded in or, due to their proximity, were considered to be associated with, the Falcarragh to Meenlaragh SPA over the course of the last six breeding seasons.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>X</div></th><th><div>Y</div></th><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div>Individual bird ID</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>193926</div></td><td><div>433781</div></td><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>B93.1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>193926</div></td><td><div>433781</div></td><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>B93.1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>193927</div></td><td><div>433780</div></td><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>B93.1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>193945</div></td><td><div>433815</div></td><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>B93.1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>194449</div></td><td><div>434485</div></td><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>B93.3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>194480</div></td><td><div>434411</div></td><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>B93.3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>194480</div></td><td><div>434411</div></td><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>B93.3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>194480</div></td><td><div>434411</div></td><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>B93.3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>194452</div></td><td><div>434438</div></td><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>B93.3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>194458</div></td><td><div>434486</div></td><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>B93.3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>194027</div></td><td><div>434229</div></td><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>B93.4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>194270</div></td><td><div>434390</div></td><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>B93.4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>194098</div></td><td><div>434341</div></td><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>B93.4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>194089</div></td><td><div>434341</div></td><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>B93.4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>193117</div></td><td><div>433562</div></td><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>B93.1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>193120</div></td><td><div>433560</div></td><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>B93.1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>189447</div></td><td><div>432725</div></td><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>B83.8</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>19172</div></td><td><div>43175</div></td><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>B93.1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>19165</div></td><td><div>43181</div></td><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>B93.1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>19164</div></td><td><div>43182</div></td><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>B93.1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>1895</div></td><td><div>4324</div></td><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>B83.2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>1895</div></td><td><div>4323</div></td><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>B83.2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>18959</div></td><td><div>43242</div></td><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>B83.2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>18958</div></td><td><div>43240</div></td><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>B83.2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>1895</div></td><td><div>4327</div></td><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>B83.3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>18941</div></td><td><div>43271</div></td><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>B83.3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>18945</div></td><td><div>43272</div></td><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>B83.3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>1895</div></td><td><div>4327</div></td><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>B83.2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>1895</div></td><td><div>4323</div></td><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>B83.2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>1895</div></td><td><div>4326</div></td><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>B83.2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>1894</div></td><td><div>4327</div></td><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>B83.3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>1894</div></td><td><div>4324</div></td><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>B83.3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>189469</div></td><td><div>432316</div></td><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>B83.4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>1916</div></td><td><div>4319</div></td><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>B93.1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>1919</div></td><td><div>4319</div></td><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>B93.1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>1917</div></td><td><div>4322</div></td><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>B93.2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>1916</div></td><td><div>4317</div></td><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>B93.2</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

I have no statutory function in the matter of disconnections of electricity or gas customers regardless of the supply company involved.</p><p>  The CER provides quarterly and annual updates on the electricity and gas retail markets, including on disconnections, and further information may be found at:</p><p><i></i></p><p>  Nevertheless, the number of disconnections is a matter of concern to me as it is for the Government, the CER, voluntary organisations and suppliers.  The rise in numbers in recent years has coincided with the economic recession which has caused customer arrears and debt levels to rise. </p><p>  In line with the CER&#8217;s Code of Practice on disconnection, electricity and gas suppliers must facilitate payment options/plans for domestic customers experiencing genuine hardship and, where appropriate, engage with a money advisor acting on behalf of the customer or a recognised charity.  This must include offering the customer a prepayment meter.  According to CER&#8217;s published report on its website on Electricity and Gas Retail Markets, concerning the period to the end of September 2012, over 11,000 Pay as You Go electricity meters have been installed.  That report also states that there are approximately 19,500 token meters in operation.  In addition, disconnections may not be initiated where a customer has entered into a payment plan with the supplier and is honouring that arrangement. </p><p>  I welcome the fact that CER is working with energy suppliers to ensure that they take all reasonable steps to assist customers through this difficult period and that disconnections resulting from genuine inability to pay are minimised, and only occur as a very last resort.</p><p>  Implementation of the measures set out in the Government&#8217;s Affordable Energy Strategy, published last November, is pivotal to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers and improving energy affordability.</p><p>  In addition, the Government will continue to support the delivery of energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households in 2013.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme has been allocated Exchequer funding of &#8364;18 million for 2013, which is expected to result in upgrades in over 10,000 homes.  </p></reply>

The previous scheme was known as AER.  There were numerous generators involved in AER, but ESB, in its role as Public Electricity Supplier, was the contracting party for all of the AER contracts.  With market liberalisation, REFIT was opened to all licensed suppliers.  There are over 16 different licensed electricity suppliers and numerous generators involved in the REFIT schemes operated by my Department.</p><p>  Under Directive 2009/28/EC Ireland has been assigned a legally binding target that 16% of all energy consumption must be from renewable sources by 2020.  This includes a minimum of 10% in the transport sector.  Overall, the target comprises 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heating by 2020, which combined amount to 16% of all energy consumption. </p><p>  The Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012-2020 and the First Progress Report on the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) set out how it is anticipated that renewable generating capacity will be developed in Ireland in the period to 2020. These documents are available on my Department&#8217;s website at:<i></i><i>  .</i>  The First Progress Report on the NREAP sets out that it is envisaged that around 4000MW of installed renewable capacity will be required by 2020 in order to achieve 40% renewable electricity.  There is approximately 1900MW installed at present.</p></reply>

The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) is responsible for issuing licences to mobile phone operators and for monitoring compliance with the conditions attached to the licences.  ComReg concluded a spectrum allocation process in late 2012, which will enable the successful applicants to operate 4G mobile services across the country. 4G is the fourth generation and most modern of mobile phone technologies currently available.  It is a matter for the individual mobile telephone operators to decide those parts of the country they will prioritise and those areas they will ultimately serve in accordance with the license conditions.</p><p>  The provision of broadband services   is also undertaken within a fully liberalised market. National and international statistics on broadband availability measure the highest broadband speeds marketed by retail services at the national level. These comparisons do not measure whether the speeds quoted are available in all areas of any country.   The high speeds offered in parts of County Kildare by at least one cable operator, in the areas it serves and has upgraded, compare favourably with high broadband speeds marketed internationally.  Unfortunately there are no statistics available which would allow a national or international comparison of the different speeds available throughout any one county.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  Specifically, it commits to 70Mbps to 100Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; at least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population, and  a minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.</p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.</p><p>  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.</p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention. </p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including County Kildare, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.   </p></reply>

The National Housing Development Survey 2012 revealed that 1,203 developments which had previously been included in the 2011 Survey could be removed as they were either substantially complete or development had never commenced, and many substantially complete developments could progress to being taken in charge by local authorities. Since 2010, the number of such developments has fallen by 37%, to 1,770. I anticipate that this progress will continue in 2013 as more problem estates are resolved under the work of the National Coordination Committee and its stakeholders, which include NAMA, local authorities, the Irish Banking Federation and the representatives from the construction sector. Work on the 2013 survey will commence during Q2 with a view to publication of the results in the autumn. </p><p>  The list of unfinished housing estates to be prescribed for purposes of a waiver from the local property tax has been compiled by local authorities utilising the categorisation in place in respect of the household charge, updated by reference to the National Housing Survey 2012. My Department has collated the data from local authorities and Minister Hogan yesterday signed the Regulations to prescribe the list of qualifying estates for purposes of exemption from the local property tax.   </p></reply>

In allocating the available funding across all 34 city and county councils I did so in as transparent and as fair a way as possible. In framing the 2013 allocations, my Department wrote to each local authority requesting details of the numbers and value of grant s where work had been approved to commence. Between them, local authorities reported contractual commitments in respect of approved grants totally &euro;18 million. This year I allocated local authorities the full amount of their contractual commitments which, in the case of Kerry County Council, amounted to &euro;838,493. The balance of the available funding was allocated on the basis of each authority&rsquo;s share of the new applications on hand in January 2013. This brought Kerry County Council&rsquo;s overall allocation to &euro;1,445,971.</p><p>  In order to deal with any acute or particular difficulty which might arise in the operation of the schemes over the course of the year I have set aside a small capital reserve . My Department will consider applications from local authorities for a supplementary allocation in such cases . A submission in this regard was received from Kerry County Council on 15 March, and it will need to be examined in the context of the available funding and the requests already received from other authorities; I do not propose , therefore, to make any decisions in relation to supplementary allocations at this time. In the circumstances, meetings with public representatives would not therefore for the present serve any useful purpose.</p></reply>

The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, including the most appropriate method of valuation.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</p><p>  It is important to acknowledge that commercial rates, as a local tax, and the rating system generally are deeply embedded in the local government system. A large body of case law is well established and local authorities and ratepayers are, in the main, very familiar with, and generally accepting of, the operation and practice of the rating system. Rates also provide a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.</p><p>  I am acutely aware of the pressures on small and medium sized businesses at the present time. Local authorities have been asked by my Department to exercise restraint or, where possible, to reduce commercial rates and local charges for 2013. Local authorities have responded well to such requests in recent years and in 2013, 87 out of the 88 rating authorities have either reduced their ARV or kept it the same as in 2012.</p><p>  I have no immediate plans to amend the legislation governing commercial rates. I am however, keeping the approach to rates by local authorities under active review, and am determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain costs in the local government sector.</p></reply>

This is the largest reduction in the annual expenditure ever recorded and represents a fall of approximately &euro;10 million, or 16%, over the peak recorded in 2009.  This follows a number of measures introduced since I came into office including significant cuts to practitioners' fees during 2011.</p><p>  Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal aid him/herself.  The Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.   An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that an accused person who faces serious charges is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence and if he/she cannot afford to pay for legal representation there is a right to legal aid.  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend him/herself in person or through legal assistance of his/her own choosing or, if he/she has insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  My overriding concern must be to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.</p><p>  A new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is being drafted to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  Provision to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions will have regard to a person's rights to the presumption of innocence, to a fair trial and to be given legal aid, where appropriate.  I hope it will be possible to publish the Bill during the course of this year.</p></reply>

Students who satisfy these criteria may apply for the special probationary extension.</p><p>  Following an examination of this case INIS has determined that the student referred to first registered his residence as a student in Ireland in January 2005 and from enquiries made with his college that he commenced his course of studies in January 2005. Having regard to this, the student is therefore not eligible for the 2004 Student Probationary Extension.</p><p>  It is also important that the 2004 Probationary Extension be considered in the context of the overall transitional arrangements implemented in respect of non-EEA students resident in Ireland on 1 January 2011. Special provisions were made to facilitate non-EEA students who became &ldquo;timed out&rdquo; as a result of the rules introduced on 1 January 2011.  These provisions were extended on several occasions since the introduction of the student immigration rules to allow &quot;timed-out&quot; students to complete their studies, avail of post-study pathways or to secure alternative immigration permission, for example by way of an employment permit. I understand that the student in this case has availed of the special &lsquo;timed out&rsquo; permission since 30 September 2011.</p><p>  The fact that the student is not eligible to avail of the 2004 Student Probationary Extension will not prejudice any other applications that the student wishes to make to INIS regarding their immigration permission.</p></reply>

In the case of an exchange of land, the registration fee is charged on a scale that is based on the amount of money paid in equality of exchange. In both sales and exchanges of land, the scaled registration fee commences at &euro;400. The registration fee for a voluntary transfer is the fixed fee of &euro;130. In the case of a boundary rectification, which is perfected by consent of the affected owners, the registration fee would be &euro;40.</p><p>  Section 21(2) of the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006 provides that registration fees shall not be fixed at a level which is less than that sufficient to discharge the operational cost and expenses under that Act and the Registration of Title Act 1964. The current Fees Order, the Land Registration Fees Order 2012 (S.I. No. 380 of 2012) came into effect on 1 December 2012 and sets the fees at the level required to meet this statutory obligation. All Land Registry fees are paid into and disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in accordance with the directions of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  The Fees Order sets out the fees payable on the making of an application for registration in the Land Registry. It is the Fees Order, operative on the day of lodgement of the application for registration in the Land Registry, that governs the fees payable. I have already made the Land Registration (Fees) (Amendment) Order 2013 (S.I. No. 21 of 2013) which put in place transitional arrangements in respect of cases which were first lodged prior to 1 December 2012 and subsequently rejected by the Land Registry. The Amendment Order specifically provides that any applications, which were lodged prior to 1 December 2012 and subsequently rejected, may be relodged prior to 31 December 2013 and will be charged according to the fees that were payable immediately prior to the coming into force of the 2012 Fees Order. There is also provision made in the Amendment Order for a limited number of cases, which would have been lodged prior to 1 December 2012, were it not for unavoidable delays in retrieving stamp certificates from the Revenue Commissioners. While I have no plans at this time to make any further amendments to the 2012 Fees Order, I will continue to keep this matter under review.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no power to intervene in any decision made by these statutorily independent bodies. The regulatory and complaints handling procedures are framed in the Solicitors Acts 1954-2008 and in regulations made under those Acts. The legislature has, in its wisdom, to date provided no direct ministerial role in the regulation of the legal profession.</p><p>  Apart from the regulatory framework, the courts are, of course, a key avenue of redress for aggrieved clients of solicitors. The courts may indeed in many cases be the most appropriate arbitrator in alleged cases of serious negligence and misconduct, but in the instant case that is for the person the subject of the Deputy's question to decide.</p><p>  As the Deputy will know, I believe improvements can be made to the regulatory regime for legal professionals in this country and that less self-regulation and more independent regulation will go a long way towards this. To this end, I have published the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, which I expect to move to Committee Stage later this year.</p><p>  The Bill was drafted in line with the Programme for Government which undertakes to &ldquo;...establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints.&rdquo;</p><p>  The Bill has three main pillars of reform:</p><p>- a new, independent, Legal Services Regulatory Authority with responsibility for oversight of both solicitors and barristers;</p><p>- an independent complaints system to deal with complaints about professional misconduct. This will provide a first point-of-call for the public, independent of the professional bodies;</p><p>- an Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator that will assume the role of the existing Office of the Taxing-Master, with enhanced transparency in its functions.</p><p>  While I, as Minister, am not empowered to intervene directly on anybody's behalf in the matters the Deputy has raised, it is hoped the above information will be of some assistance in understanding the current regulatory framework. In the meantime, I will continue to drive the Legal Services Regulation Bill towards enactment in order to make the improvements set out above.</p></reply>

Moreover, that is a statutory obligation for all applicants. This requirement is established by various checks with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies as appropriate and as the circumstances of each application warrant it.  </p><p>  All applications for naturalisation are submitted to me for decision. I make my decision in my absolute discretion based on the entirety of the case presented and taking into account important considerations such as the integrity of the immigration system, the economic and security interests of the State and its international relations. Clearly it is important to ensure to the greatest extent possible that only those persons who respect our laws and have not been involved in criminal activity or other activities unbecoming of an Irish citizen are granted citizenship.</p><p>  It should be noted that while the Supreme Court in the judgement referred to by the Deputy quashed the Minister's decision to refuse the naturalisation application in that particular case, it went on to say that it is not for the Court to prescribe whether the Minister will give notice of his concerns to the applicant or to disclose information on which they may be based or whether the Minister will continue to refuse to disclose reasons for the refusal but to provide justification for so doing. </p><p>  The implications of the judgement of the Court have been considered in their entirety in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and revised procedures are being put in place to provide increased clarity for the very few applicants to whom the judgement applies.</p><p>  To put this into context, since coming into office I have made decisions on 46,000 applications of which 43,000 were approved and 2,800 were deemed ineligible or were rejected because they did not comply with the statutory criteria. Only a very small number of applications that were refused fall within the consideration of the judgement in question.     <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p><p>  Finally, it is open to any individual who is not satisfied with a decision to deem their application ineligible or a decision to refuse citizenship to lodge a new application for citizenship at any time in accordance with the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended.  </p></reply>

I am currently engaged with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in addressing the staffing issues relevant to the coming into force of the 2012 Act  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-20a.986.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032000060#WRW00300"><p>The Resilient Threat Management Conference on 6th March, 2013, was organised by the European Defence Agency and in conjunction with the Irish Presidency of the European Council.  Ireland has been a member of the European Defence Agency since 2004.   The most pertinent issue facing our troops serving on Peace Support and crisis management operations overseas is Force Protection, and one of the main factors considered when undertaking any operation is protection from threats such as snipers, booby traps and improvised explosive devices.</p><p>  We all know the toll caused by Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and homemade explosives; we know how easy it can be for terrorists to wreak death, havoc and destruction in our countries and communities.  We also know there is a need for cooperation and collaboration to counter that threat.  </p><p>  Recent operations have shown that those engaged in hostile terrorist actions are likely to use (IEDs) because the materials to assemble them are easy to come by, they are relatively simple to construct, they are difficult to combat and, as we have found to our cost, they are devastatingly effective.  Indeed, criminals engaged in organised crime are also using IEDs and Pipe Bombs  in dealing with their adversaries. This is a very worrying development for civil society, which brings the threat of IEDs and their carnage ever more on to our streets and into our communities. </p><p>  The aim of the Resilient Threat Management Conference was to create a common understanding and appreciation of the challenges posed by IEDs past and present; to establish a vision for how the IED threat will be managed in the future; to generate the will to address these challenges comprehensively by bringing together international actors from the civil and military domain; to spread awareness on future capability requirements and technological opportunities and to increase networking within the community.  Therefore, the participation of Irish Defence Forces personnel at the Resilient Threat Management Conference, as experts in this area, is to be welcomed.  </p><p>  With expertise gained over several decades in C-IED operations at home and abroad, the Irish Defence Forces are acutely aware of the importance of continuing to find ways to reduce the effects of IEDs on operations.  C-IED is not just about stopping or neutralising an IED once it is already in place, but also about identifying and disrupting the networks that create and initiate IEDs. Understanding the various threat networks at the tactical to strategic levels is vital to success in current and future operations where battle lines are no longer linear.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Circular was to initiate an assessment of the capabilities of Civil Defence at local and regional level to support a co-ordinated response to such incidents with a particular emphasis on the provision of emergency welfare for mass strandings of motorists.

Prices for cattle have been increasing recently, with a base payment of &euro;4.35 per kg being quoted last week by factories and Bord Bia quality assured cattle also finding a ready market at present. </p><p>  On the export front, there is strong demand from customers in our main markets (UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain etc.) which is underpinning the current high beef prices to Irish farmers. In 2012, beef exports amounted to &euro;1.9 billion, an increase of 2% over the previous year.</p><p>  The long term sustainability of the Suckler herd will depend on market prices for beef. The current strong prices for both store cattle and finished animals will help increase profitability in 2013 for Suckler cow farmers. In Europe beef supplies remain tight, with beef production down 2.7% in 2012 and due to contract by a further 0.5% in 2013. I am confident that, with these high prices, the viability of the National suckler herd is secure.</p><p>  With regard to the viability at farm gate level for suckler farmers Teagasc undertakes income analysis at farm level and publishes the results under their National Farm Survey (NSF) series.  In 2011 the average direct cost of production per hectare for Single Suckling enterprises ranged from &euro;350 per hectare on those farms with the lowest average gross margin to &euro;463 per hectare on the most profitable farms. </p><p>  There was considerably more variability in the average gross output between the least profitable and most profitable farms. The most profitable third of Single Suckling farms earned an average gross output of &euro;1,013 per hectare compared with an average gross output of &euro;451 per hectare on the least profitable one third of Single Suckling enterprises. This variability in average gross output is in large part due to the higher average stocking on the more profitable farms. These farms had an average stocking rate of 1.57 livestock units (LU) per hectare compared with only 1.03 LU per hectare for those farms with the lowest profitability.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the ongoing consolidation of the public finances my Department and the agencies under its remit have continued to provide an array of financial and infrastructural supports to underpin production in this sector. These include initiatives such as the Beef Technology Adoption Programme (BTAP), which is designed to equip beef farmers with the knowledge to improve efficiency at farm level. Some &euro;4.5 million was paid in 2012 to 4,800 farmers under the programme. </p><p>  Other supports include the establishment of the Beef Data Programme for which &euro;10 million has been allocated in 2013. The new programme will assist farmers in improving the genetic quality of Irish cattle and will maintain the data flow into ICBF in order to build further knowledge and more rapid progress in breeding and ultimately in profitability for farmers. In addition my Department continues to support the work of ICBF in improving genetic quality in the beef herd. On the advisory side Teagasc provides a best practice model for suckler farmers with the expanded BETTER Beef Farm Programme.</p><p>  My Department and its agencies will continue to make every effort to assist farmers, including suckler farmers, to improve their farming and income situation in 2013.</p></reply>

This would, in the case of several Member States (including Ireland), result in significant transfers between farmers.  I believe there is a need for redistribution but I am concerned that moving to a flat rate as proposed would be harmful for the Irish agricultural sector and the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  Other Member States, such as the newer Member States are seeking alternative solutions, while others still are happy with the flat rate system.  The February Council of EU Agriculture Ministers meeting broadly endorsed a package of measures that I tabled aimed at achieving a compromise on this very difficult issue. The package included the option to take a more flexible approach to distribution, the so-called &lsquo;approximation&rsquo; model favoured by Ireland. This would result in a less radical level of redistribution between farmers, moving gradually towards but not all the way to, a flat rate. </p><p>  As part of a set of proposals giving flexibility to Member States, I have proposed that Member States should be allowed to introduce a minimum payment per hectare if they wish, but some others have suggested that this should be mandatory.  Under the Commission proposal, &euro;280m would be transferred between farmers. Under the Irish proposal, a minimum of &euro;74m would be transferred, with flexibility to transfer more if we wished to do so. There will be those who gain and those who lose with either approach but I am working to ensure that those on historically lower payments are adequately supported and those on the very highest payments contribute the most towards redistribution. The key will be to reach a fair compromise, which levels the playing field without putting productive farmers out of business.  As is the case with any negotiation, the final position will be somewhere in between my approach and that of the Commission. I am fighting to ensure that the best possible outcome for all farmers is reached, in a balanced and fair way.</p></reply>

The Terms and Conditions of the Scheme require that applicants undertake to carry out and notify to my Department the requisite measures for the full 5 year duration of this Scheme. In August 2011, applicants were informed of the requirement to notify the details of such measures within one year from the date of birth of the animal.  In this particular instance, all 11 animals were born between March and April 2011 and data in relation to the weaning of these animals has not been received to date. Therefore, the applicant is no longer considered to be participating in the Scheme and a letter issued to this effect.  If the applicant wishes the decision to be reviewed an application should be submitted in writing to the Review Officer, Suckler Welfare Scheme, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Government Offices, Portlaoise, Co. Laois, setting out the circumstances of his case and provide any supporting information and evidence.</p></reply>

However, in the light of a recent review of Regional Office operations, I am strongly of the view that significant efficiencies and cost savings can be made by centralising in one or possibly two locations the administrative support available to the veterinary, technical and professional staff in those Offices.  I am also strongly of the view that these efficiencies can be achieved without any diminution in the level of services normally available to farmers.</p><p>  This process has commenced with the transfer of administrative functions for the Clonakilty office to Cork city and the transfer of administrative functions for the Limerick DVO office to Naas.  Arrangements are also in train to transfer the administrative functions out of the Tipperary regional office.  In each case, the veterinary, professional and technical services available to farmers from these offices have remained in situ.  The centralisation of administrative functions in other regional offices including Roscommon will be considered in light of the availability of opportunities to redeploy the staff concerned to support other critical public services.</p></reply>

Best Practice Guidelines have been produced for both miscanthus and willow, and were first published by Teagasc in 2007. Subsequently, Teagasc and its counterpart in Northern Ireland - the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) &#8211; jointly published best practice guidelines in 2010 (updated in 2011).  These guidelines are reviewed and updated as appropriate in the light of new research as it emerges.  The guidelines include a section on the economics and market returns associated with the crops, including a table of payback calculations over 20 years.  In calculating the payback in respect of miscanthus, consideration is given to factors such as yield, price per tonne, bank interest, inflation, the crop establishment cost and the benefit of the grant-aid available under my Department&#8217;s Bioenergy Scheme.  </p><p>A copy of the Best Practice Guidelines is made available as part of the information offered to potential applicants under the Bioenergy Scheme and may also be found on my Department&#8217;s website at (<i></i>).  </p><p>  The Bioenergy Scheme Terms and Conditions advises potential applicants to obtain independent technical advice as to the suitability of their land for planting willow and miscanthus crops and as to the necessary husbandry, particularly weed control, and management requirements for optimum establishment.</p><p>  The returns that can be achieved from energy crops may be significantly influenced by the location of the crop relative to the market.  As the energy crops industry is still relatively young, the supply/demand situation is constantly evolving, and this can influence the economics of growing biomass crops for early adopters. </p><p>  An Excel calculator for energy crops, which provides details of the economic returns over the lifetime of the crop, is available at Teagasc offices throughout the country.  This is a useful tool to help inform potential applicants in the decision making process when considering whether to plant energy crops.</p></reply>

Section 58 of the Act  provides for exemptions for certain categories of childminders from the provisions of Section 51 and the services exempted under this section are not required to give notice to the HSE of their service. </p><p>  Childminders who are not subject to the requirement to notify are, however, encouraged to voluntarily notify their service to their local City or County Childcare Committee which provides a range of supports to enable them to improve the standards of their childcare service. These supports include the Childminders Tax Exemption scheme which provides for a tax exemption for those childminders who have satisfactorily participated in the Voluntary Notification process and whose annual income from childminding does not exceed &euro;15,000.  Despite these supports the number of childminders who opted to voluntarily notified their services only reached approximately 1,250 in 2011.   While my Department continues to actively promote the notification of childminding services and the participation of childminders in quality and training programmes, it is not in a position to prevent parents entering into informal arrangements with childminders who are outside the scope of the Regulations. </p><p>  While I am aware that nearly all of the pre-school services in the country are participating in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and are subject to the Regulations, there are no means available to my Department to calculate the number of childminders, providing childcare from their own homes, who are not subject to the Regulations and who have chosen not to participate in the voluntary notification process. </p><p>  My Department has commenced work on Ireland's first Early Years Strategy.

The legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, provides a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child.  Any adoption from a Hague country must comply with the Adoption Act, 2010 and the Hague Convention.</p><p>  The Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) is an independent statutory body charged with implementing the Adoption Act, 2010.

Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>  Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department has tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding.

Responding to the ICDRG recommendations forms an integral part of the &lsquo;change management programme&rsquo; being developed by the senior management team of the new Child &amp; Family Support Agency, led by Project Director Gordon Jeyes. This programme involves over 100 individual reform projects; and through these initiatives the responses to many of the ICDRG recommendations will be mainstreamed into the work programme of the new Agency.</p><p>  The HSE has committed to reviewing a number of the cases covered by the Child Death Review Report.

Under the Bill, Irish Medicines Board has statutory responsibility for establishing and publishing a List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products.  </p><p>  In deciding whether to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the Board must be satisfied that each medicinal product which falls within the group:</p><p>(a) has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in each of its active substances as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group; </p><p>(b) is in the same pharmaceutical form as, or in a pharmaceutical form that is appropriate for substitution for, each of the other products in the group; and</p><p>(c) has the same route of administration as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group. </p><p>  In addition, the Bill provides that the Board is not permitted to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products where:</p><p>- there is a difference in bioavailability between the medicinal products and the interchangeable medicinal products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable medicinal products which may lead to a clinically significant difference in efficacy between them, and</p><p>- any of the medicinal  products cannot be safely substituted for any one or more of the other medicinal products in the group. </p><p>  I would like to emphasise that in making a decision to add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable medicinal products or a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products the Board is obliged to have regard to the criteria as set out in the Bill and that these criteria fully reflect the recommendations set out in the Joint Department of Health/HSE report 'Proposed Model of Reference Pricing and Generic Substitution' (the Moran Report, 2010) regarding criteria for interchangeability.     </p><p>  To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, Section 13 of the Bill allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.</p><p>  I am satisfied that these provisions address the concerns raised by the Deputy. I met with the Irish Epilepsy Association in January and explained this position.</p><p>  It is also important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine. All of the generic medicines on the Irish market are required to be properly licensed and meet the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board.</p></reply>

I am advised that, in 2012, ninety cochlear implants were carried out with 42 children receiving implants and 48 adults.  In addition to providing the surgical services, the programme provides a comprehensive assessment service to potential candidates and a rehabilitative service to those actually implanted.</p><p>  In 2009 a National Review of Audiology Services was carried out by the HSE, to examine the services provided to children and adults nationwide, and to formulate a national plan for the services. The report of the National Audiology Review Group, published by the HSE in 2011, provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services, from new-born screening to assessment and management of adults and children with hearing problems, including cochlear implantation.  Two of the main recommendations in the report include the national rollout of a universal new-born hearing screening programme and the establishment of a bone anchored hearing aid programme. The report also included a recommendation that continued ring-fenced financial support be provided for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children. A key development has been the creation of the post of National Clinical Lead for Audiology. This post has recently been filled by a clinician who has worked extensively on cochlear implant programmes, including the Irish cochlear implant programme in Beaumont. The newly appointed lead is very familiar with the complexities of this area and will be taking a key role with the development of the potential introduction of a bilateral simultaneous/sequential cochlear implant programme.</p><p>  While no dedicated programme for simultaneous or sequential implantation is being carried out in Ireland at this time, some bilateral implantation has already occurred for patients, mainly very young children with certain medical conditions such as a history of meningitis or blindness.  It is estimated that there are approximately 200 children in Ireland today who may be suitable for a second implant.</p><p>  The HSE is working closely with Beaumont Hospital to progress plans for both simultaneous and sequential bilateral implantation.  I understand that Beaumont Hospital, HSE Management and the HSE&rsquo;s Audiology Clinical Care Programme have met recently to discuss a joint process to identify the options for developing and resourcing a programme of simultaneous and sequential cochlear implantation.  An important element of this will be the development of clear clinical criteria to prioritise clients for assessment and follow on implantation. Each child requires to be assessed to determine if they are suitable for a bilateral implant, and the provision of information about the advantages and potential disadvantages of bilateral implantation is required in order to facilitate an informed decision as to whether to proceed. Not all suitable patients proceed with the second implant when apprised of all the issues involved. I understand that the HSE will be arranging an information day for all parents/caregivers and children who have had, or about to have a single cochlear implant. This will provide a balance of information regarding the potential benefits that bilateral cochlear implantation may afford some children and the assessment programme that will be required to assess each child individually.</p><p>  The development of the service will require additional resources for Beaumont and these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 Estimates process.</p></reply>

I am assure by the hospital that there is no predicted impact on patient safety. All urgent, critical and prioritised reports, as well as referrals from Emergency Department and Paediatrics are  reported and typed within 24 hours.There are clinical governance processes in place at the hospital for radiologists, the doctors who examine x-rays, to ensure that any significant or urgent cases are responded to immediately.  Any critical or urgent findings are immediately brought to the attention of the referring doctor and to the clerical staff who then transcribe and send the report immediately.</p><p>  There are currently 6000 images reported but untyped &ndash; this represents 3.5% of the total number of reports typed annually.  Standard turnaround time for routine reports is  2 to 3 weeks, these tapes are currently 5 weeks old - this means that there is a 2-3 week delay in typing these images.  The Radiology Department, with the Diagnostic Directorate and Executive Team at the hospital are taking a number of steps to address this issue, including additional clerical support in Radiology to assist with typing of tapes.  It is intended that the backlog will be cleared in approximately 5 weeks.</p><p>  In relation to the specific query from the Deputy regarding the number x-rays outstanding to GPs for particular areas in Dublin I have asked the HSE to contact the Deputy directly in this matter.</p></reply>

Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data.  For the first time, data is available on www.ntpf.ie.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals.  In the first instance, this will allow resources to be targeted towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment.</p><p>  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time.  In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service issues they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the exemption in the case of psychiatric hospitals was intended to cover cases that might arise with persons with serious mental health issues who require constant observation and where staff/client safety would be an issue if the client had to go outside to smoke.  In the case of the majority of clients there should be no need to avail of this exemption and nothing in the legislation obliges employers in exempted premises to permit smoking.  In any event, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 provides that 'every employer shall ensure so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare at work of all employees'.  Therefore, while psychiatric hospitals are exempt from the smoking ban, employers continue to have a duty of care to their employees and a statutory responsibility to provide a reasonably safe working environment.</p><p>  The 'HSE Best Practice Guidelines for Tobacco Management in the Mental Health Setting' were drafted to assist employers in the management of tobacco use in the mental health setting, taking into account the exemption from legislation and the continuing duty of care to health care workers to ensure minimum exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.  The Guidelines state that: Smoking is prohibited in all work areas, common areas and facilities used by staff, clients and visitors in the organisation, including transport; if smoking areas are designated, they should be completely separate from non-smoking areas and all efforts should be made to reduce time spent there by smokers; the designation of indoor smoking facilities may only be provided, if appropriate, in extreme circumstances and the decision to do so has been recorded and reviewed by a senior manager; management is responsible for ensuring that every effort is made to provide staff with a smoke free working environment; mental health services staff may only smoke at official break times, in external designated smoking areas or facilities, away from entrances.</p></reply>

This measures the average level of prices paid for consumer goods and services by all private households in a country.  The index can be subdivided depending on types of consumption.  The health category includes prices of medical products, appliances and equipment, hospital and outpatient costs, and services supplied by doctors, dentists, opticians etc. and other health care practitioners including alternative medicine.</p><p>  Over the period from the year 2005 to January 2013, Ireland records the third highest rate of inflation in the EU 15 and the twelfth highest rate in the EU 27 in the health category of the HICP.  By comparison, the Netherlands had the highest rate of inflation of the EU 15 countries over the period, and ranked seventh highest in the EU 27.</p><p>  The most recent year of available data for Ireland shows a marked change in these rankings.  For the period February 2012 to January 2013, Ireland recorded the sixth lowest inflation rate in the EU 15 and the ninth lowest in the EU 27.  For the same period, the Netherlands, by comparison, showed the second highest rate of inflation for both the EU 15 and the EU 27 countries.  It should be noted that the health category of the HICP refers specifically to prices paid by consumers of health care products and services.  It does not measure the cost to the Health Service Executive (HSE) in providing treatment and as such does not reflect changes in the cost of inter alia human resources, medications and professional fees.</p></reply>

The aim of the SDU is to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system. The SDU's Scheduled Care Team focused initially on  waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.  For 2012, a target was set that no adult should wait longer than 9 months for inpatient or daycase treatment. By the end of December 2012, the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months for inpatient and day case surgery nationally had fallen to 86. This was down from 3,706 in December 2011, representing a 98% decrease. </p><p>  I am determined that the progress made in 2012 be maintained and improved upon. For 2013, the target is that no adult should be waiting longer than 8 months for inpatient or daycase treatment. It is important to recognise that the progress made in 2012 does not mean the problem is solved, and 2013 will of course be extremely challenging. For example, winter pressures in Emergency Departments have impacted on scheduled care waiting times. However, in the coming months, as winter pressures ease, the SDU will work towards re-balancing scheduled care  to maintain the improvements seen in 2012 and to achieve the new 2013 target.</p><p>  In relation to waiting list management in general, the National Waiting List Management Policy, <i>A standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, January 2013,</i>   has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has recently been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.   In relation to this particular query raised by the Deputy regarding waiting lists for gastric bypass surgery, I have asked the Health Service Executive to investigate the situation and respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.</p></reply>

The basis of the complaint, which was upheld by the Data Protection Commissioner, was that NSCs should not be retained indefinitely without consent as this breached the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003. There followed a series of meetings between the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner, representatives from my Department, the Health Services Executive (HSE) and the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, which resulted in the decision to destroy existing cards that are older than ten years. This is to rectify a situation which had developed and which, in the words of the Data Protection Commissioner, &quot;...was unlawful and could not be allowed to continue&quot;. </p><p>  I received representations from a number of people and organisations, who pointed out their potential value for research. Consequently, I requested the HSE to conduct a review of the decision to destroy these cards. This review examined both the legal and ethical basis for retention of NSCs and the potential use of the existing cards for research purposes. The report and recommendations of the review group were submitted to me in January 2012. The review group supported the decision to destroy cards more than ten years old.  </p><p>  However, the review group also explored how the cards could be made available to the research community in a way which is compatible with ethical and legal obligations. It must be remembered that there is no written consent from parents for the retention or use of these newborn screening cards taken before 2002 for research, or other, purposes.  As Deputies are aware, Part 4 of the Disability Act 2005 deals with genetic testing. Section 42.1 (b) which states that genetic testing shall not be carried out on a person unless &quot;the consent of the person to the processing of any genetic data to be derived from the testing has been obtained in accordance with the Acts&quot;. Sections 41.3 and 41.4 also point out what information should be provided to people before processing of genetic information and make clear it is an offence to process genetic information without the consent of the person concerned. </p><p>   line with its recommendations, the HSE  began an information campaign offering people the opportunity to have their screening card returned to them. This campaign will run until 31 March 2013, after which the retrieval procedure will begin. I have been assured that no material will be disposed of before all requests received before 31 March 2013 have been processed. </p></reply>

Ireland, the report of National Steering Committee on Narcolepsy (2012) concludes that an observed 13-fold increase in the incidence of narcolepsy in children/adolescents in Ireland since 2009 is associated with Pandemrix.  The Irish Medicines Board has reported 42 such cases to my Department.  My priority is to ensure that those affected by narcolepsy with symptom onset post pandemic vaccination are provided with services and supports to meet their health needs.</p><p>  The HSE and the Department of Education and Skills together provide a comprehensive range of services and supports to those affected.   These supports and services include access to rapid diagnosis, clear treatment pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred. This includes expenses for counselling services for individuals and also for families of children affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination,  in cases where such services are not already available through the HSE.  Multi-disciplinary assessments which allow for the appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place are ongoing. The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected.      </p><p>Myself, officials from my Department and representatives from the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills have met representatives of the support group SOUND on a number of occasions to address their concerns and to outline the services available. The Health Service Executive advocacy unit is in regular contact with the support group SOUND.  Through regional co-ordinators the HSE also has frequent contact with individual members of SOUND.     My Department is considering all possible supports which may need to be put in place for those affected by Narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination.  A further meeting with representatives from the support group will be arranged when the matter has been concluded.</p></reply>

It has been delayed by a number of factors including the changed economic context, constraints in public spending and the moratorium on recruitment.  It is expected that the appointment of a Director for Mental Health, which was advertised recently by the HSE, will greatly accelerate the pace of implementation.  </p><p>  Nonetheless, a great deal of progress has been made with the accelerated closure of old psychiatric hospitals and their replacement with bespoke new facilities, better suited to modern mental health care.  Progress also includes shorter episodes of in-patient care and the involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health policy, service planning and delivery. </p><p>A modern mental health service is best delivered in the community and in 2012 a special allocation of &#8364;35m was provided primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both adult and children&#8217;s mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention, to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems and to facilitate the re-location of mental health service users from institutional care to more independent living arrangements in their communities, in line with AVFC<i>.</i> 414 posts were approved to implement the &#8364;35m package of special measures.  <i></i></p><p>  Budget 2013 provided a further &#8364;35m for the continued development of our mental health services including forensics and community mental health teams for adults, children, older persons and mental health intellectual disability  Over 470 additional staff will be recruited to implement these measures.  </p><p>  In order to ensure that the additional resources will be used to best effect, discussions are on-going within the HSE, and in consultation with the Department of Health, to finalise the allocation of these resources.  Each HSE Region is being asked to submit a business case against each of the identified objectives detailing how the funding is to be spent and the type and number of WTE to be recruited.  It is expected that this process will be concluded in the very near future.   </p><p>  The Minister for Health has been assured by the HSE that the recruitment process for the new posts being funded in 2013 and any outstanding posts from the 414 approved in 2012 is being given priority within the HSE.</p></reply>

Co-location, and ultimately tri-location with a maternity hospital, on the St James's campus will support the provision of excellence in clinical care that our children deserve.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital is a key commitment in the Programme for Government and the largest project within the current Capital Plan.  This Government regards the building of the hospital as a priority and no effort will be spared in expediting its completion.  </p><p>  Following the announcement of the Government's decision, the first priority has been to determine the project management structures and governance arrangements required to enable delivery of the project as quickly as possible and to the highest quality.  In this regard I intend to restructure the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board so that it focuses on the core function of planning, designing, building and equipping the new hospital. The membership of the restructured Board will align with this core function and include the necessary capital development expertise. The required legislation will, inevitably, take some time and as the terms of office of the majority of Board members expired on 5 December, I have appointed senior representatives from my Department and the HSE as an interim measure aimed at ensuring effective governance and decision-making for the project during this transitional phase. </p><p>  At this important initial stage it is crucial that the project continues without delay. Work has been progressing in relation to the site and site preparation, while a review of urgent care centre(s) configuration is underway and a time-limited review of Dublin maternity services configuration is due to commence shortly. The Dolphin report concluded that the existing plan for the Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre in Tallaght would need to be revisited in light of any decision about the location of the new children&rsquo;s hospital. The necessary review is well underway and is expected to be complete within the coming weeks; its outcome will be a key factor in finalising the scale of the facilities required on the St James&rsquo;s campus. </p><p>  With regard to the architectural work, much of the work that has been done for the project in its previous location on the Mater site is transferable to the new site. However, a new design for the new site is required and in this regard the transitional National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is progressing the procurement of a new design team. </p><p>  This Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that the project proceeds securely to completion as quickly as possible and with optimal results. I am confident that the project management and governance structures now being put in place will enable the fastest possible delivery of this key infrastructure for children&rsquo;s hospital services. </p></reply>

The numbers are not clear for presentation and can cause confusion.  There are a number of reasons for this, e.g. there is an element of churn involved in any time period as clients can lose eligibility for a period of time due to non response etc., which is subsequently approved on review following appropriate engagement with the HSE by the client. In addition Medical cards are issued on an ongoing basis in respect of new applicants and in respect of applicants on review. It is not possible to clearly identify what is a &#8216;new&#8217; card, as a client may have held and lost eligibility in the past, at any time, even a number of months ago, and on a number of occasions over a prolonged period as their circumstances change.</p><p>  To date the Central Office has processed 820,873 applications for Medical Cards with 95.38% of completed applications been processed within 15 working days. The remaining 4.62% are being processed.  These applications predominantly relate to applicants whose assessable income is in excess of the financial guidelines, and who are claiming undue medical hardship. The HSE has arrangements in place for Medical Officers to review such cases. The appointment of additional Medical Officers has reduced the number of applications currently waiting for Medical Officer assessment. The target turnaround time for discretionary medical cards is 20 working days. These figures are updated on a weekly basis and can be viewed on </p></reply>

I am deeply aware of the need to facilitate the recruitment of NCHDs and to ensure that posts are sufficiently attractive in terms of future career development, working conditions and remuneration. Most NCHDs are recruited by the postgraduate training bodies for placement in training posts.  Approximately 15% of NCHDs are recruited to non-training posts.  I have recently emphasised to the HSE the need to focus on reducing NCHDs working hours and, as part of this process, to ensure that they undertake duties appropriate to the grade.</p><p>  Government public sector pay policy is driven by the requirement to achieve savings and attain sustainability. In order to restore the public finances it has been necessary to implement reductions in remuneration that apply across the Public Service. These reductions have been applied to NCHDs in the same manner as other staff with comparable levels of remuneration.</p><p>  While deficits in the NCHD workforce have arisen in recent years, the HSE response has ensured that there has been little, if any, service reduction arising from problems filling posts and that most posts are now filled.</p></reply>

Information pertaining to diagnosis is specifically excluded from the National Intellectual Disability Database as the database is not designed as a medical epidemiological tool.  Accordingly the database does not record the incidence of Autism or any other disability. </p><p>  The 2011 National Council for Special Education (NCSE) study on prevalence of special educational needs in Ireland (A Study on the Prevalence of Special Educational Needs, Joanne Banks and Selina McCoy, Economic and Social Research Institute) includes autism and estimates that prevalence for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is 1 in 100.  </p><p>  In 2004, the Department of Health provided funding for research into autism through the HRB as part of the Autism Genome Project - a collaboration of autism researchers internationally aimed at understanding susceptibility to ASD, to pave the way towards the development of better diagnostics and treatments. The research groups for this work were based in Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin. The second phase of the program (2007-2011) was recently completed. This research investigated the genetic risk factors in ASD by pooling DNA obtained from a large international sample of individuals and their families, including many Irish families. Genetic screening was then employed to identify (i) genetic variants that might increase the risk of autism and (ii) structural changes in the DNA of people with autism. In parallel, complete clinical information was gathered on participants and the clinical and genetic information was combined in the analysis. </p><p>  The main outcome showed that although ASDs have a substantial genetic basis, most of the known genetic risk has been traced to rare structural gene variants. These gene variants were both de novo (arising for the first time in individuals) or inherited, implicating many novel ASD genes and genes involved in neurodevelopment.  The results of this research revealed many new genetic and functional targets in ASD, that has increased the understanding of the causes of ASD and will inform future therapeutic approaches.  The key research findings were published in the prestigious international science journal Nature.</p></reply>

This includes vital statistics on causes of death, notification of infectious diseases, disease registers, data on hospital discharges, and population-based health survey data.  The reasons for higher or lower prevalence and/or mortality by region and across countries can vary according to the condition and can be due to a range of factors.
