They can go through fallow periods while, for example, they are building up their work and trying to establish themselves. A pilot initiative targeted at self-employed visual artists and writers was launched in June 2017.  These professions can qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment when they are unemployed in the normal way.    The pilot is intended to assist those who apply to the Department for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  A key feature of the initiative is that it acknowledges their status as self-employed artists or writers and gives them a 12 month window to focus on building up their work before they become subject to activation. </p>  <p>  This initiative was a collaboration between my Department and what is now the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, with the support and advice of the Arts Council.  We also consulted with the artists and writers professional bodies.  Naturally there are safeguards in place to ensure that claimants are professional visual artists and writers.  Applicants must satisfy all of the usual qualifying conditions for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</p>  <p>  At the beginning of February 2018, there were 32 people in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance availing of the pilot initiative.  The total numbers who have applied to date are not available.  There are a number of reasons why any applicant might not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, such as not satisfying the means test.  </p>  <p>  This also does not mean that there are only 32 professional visual artists or writers in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  It simply means that there are 32 recipients of the payment who are availing of the pilot arrangements and therefore not party to the activation process for 12 months.  The general population of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients is not classified as to their occupation or profession so it is not possible to say how many writers or visual artists are in receipt of the payment.   </p>  <p>  The arrangements will be reviewed after 12 months and this review will take place later this year.</p></reply>

There are robust arrangements in place for dealing with complaints of bogus self-employment.  Social welfare inspectors inspect a wide range of businesses, as part of their on-going compliance operations.  Inspections are also undertaken jointly with other agencies including the Revenue Commissioners and Workplace Relations Commission.  Where evidence of non-compliance is detected, this will be pursued. </p>  <p>  Officials also investigate specific cases referred to my Department&rsquo;s Scope section.  This section determines employment status and the correct class of pay-related social insurance (PRSI).  Where misclassification of workers as self-employed is detected, the correct status and class is determined and social insurance arrears are collected as required. Under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, there are specific offences in relation to employment contributions.  On conviction, fines and or imprisonment can ultimately be imposed.</p>  <p>  Any worker who has concerns about their employment and PRSI status should contact my Department and the matter will be investigated.  This can only happen with the cooperation of the worker.</p>  <p>  The classification of a worker for PRSI purposes can be complicated by the use of intermediary employment structures referred to by the Deputy.  Revenue estimates that there are some 15,000 people employed using such structures.  </p>  <p>  My Department has concerns that such mechanisms may be used to reduce the amount of PRSI and tax being paid, with a subsequent loss to the exchequer and the Social Insurance Fund.  A report on the issue prepared by officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners and informed by a public consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, was published at the end of January.</p>  <p>  The report finds that the available data does not indicate that self-employment is accounting for any significant increased share of the labour force, and accordingly the perception of the level of disguised employment may be overstated. While the report indicates that intermediary arrangements can be abused to the detriment of workers and can distort the transparent and efficient operation of the labour market, it also notes that contract for service arrangements can provide flexibility, in many instances, for both businesses and workers, where they are freely chosen by both parties.</p>  <p>  The report also contains an analysis of issues raised in the public consultation specifically pertaining to the construction sector.  It looks at the administration of tax and social insurance in the sector, including 'relevant contracts tax' (RCT) and compliance activities. The report finds no evidence that the system facilitates the mis-characterisation of workers as self-employed as there are safeguards for workers who may have been incorrectly classified.  For example, Revenue informs the sub-contractor after receiving the relevant contract from the principal contractor and will investigate if the sub-contractor is of the view that they are incorrectly classified. They can also engage with the Scope insurability section in my Department.</p>  <p>  The recommendations of the Report are being examined in the context of the overall development and sustainability of social insurance and the supports available for both the self-employed and vulnerable workers.   This Report and the recent Actuarial Review of Social Insurance provide a timely and evidence-led opportunity to undertake a full review of our social insurance system and to consult with stakeholders.</p></reply>

In the first case, the person concerned was made permanent and formally admitted to the superannuation scheme by her employer on 1 September 2006.  In 2013, following a request by the employer for an insurability decision, Scope Section determined that the correct class of contribution effective from 1 September 2006 was PRSI Class D.  Prior to that, the employee was correctly insured at PSRI Class A.   In the second case, the person concerned became permanent and pensionable from 1 July 2006, the date from which the employer should have applied PRSI Class D.  The employer in this case sought a decision on 26 June 2012.</p>  <p>  As the incorrect class of contribution was paid in both cases, there is no entitlement to any social welfare schemes covered by PSRI Class A contributions.  The social welfare payments that both individuals had been in receipt of based on the PRSI Class A contributions incorrectly returned ceased to be paid following the Scope decisions.</p>  <p>  In the first case, illness benefit and partial capacity benefit of approximately &euro;15,000 were paid during the period February 2010 and October 2013.  Due to the overpayment of PRSI, arrears of &euro;8,000 were due to the employer.  These arrears were held against benefits paid.  The Department did not pursue any overpayment for the balance of &euro;7,000.</p>  <p>  The second person had been in receipt of invalidity pension based on her PRSI Class A contributions.  The pension was terminated with effect from 27 February 2013.  The Department confirmed with the HSE in relation to the person&rsquo;s occupational pension that the HSE occupational pension had increased before termination of the invalidity pension. </p>  <p>  The Department did not pursue any overpayment of illness benefit and invalidity pension paid from April 2009 to February 2013.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the Department&rsquo;s role in dealing with these cases.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-20a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022000058#WRA01800"><p>The research report referred to is &ldquo;Poverty Dynamics of Social Risk Groups in the EU&rdquo; produced by the ESRI, funded by my Department and published last month.  It analysed the significance of different systems of welfare regimes and their effectiveness in protecting vulnerable groups in eleven EU countries, including Ireland, over a 10 year period.  That ten year period was from 2004 to 2014, and so it covered the end of the boom period, the recession and the start of the recovery.  The report showed that, across the eleven countries, lone parents and their families and working-age adults with a disability and their families are more at risk of material deprivation and income poverty than other groups.  Given the sustained economic recovery since 2014, and with unemployment down from 11.3% in 2014 to 6.2% at present, I expect that the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions data for 2017 will continue the recent trend of reductions in poverty for all sectors of society.  But it remains the case that lone parent households and those of working people with a disability continue to experience deprivation and consistent poverty rates which are higher than those of the general population and we cannot contemplate any reduction in our commitment to support those most in need.</p>  <p>  My Department, as well as providing income supports to people with disabilities, offers a range of employment support programmes, including the wage subsidy scheme and the EmployAbility service as well as the partial capacity benefit scheme. The Intreo service is also available to provide employment support services for people with disabilities who wish to engage with the service on a voluntary basis.  This year expenditure on these programmes will amount to some &euro;50 million.  Last September, the Ability programme, supported by the European Social Fund was launched. This is a new pre-activation programme which recognises the critical importance of engaging with young people with disabilities at a time when their disability threatens to keep them out of the workforce.</p>  <p>  It is accepted that for lone parents, the best way to tackle poverty is through employment. The recently published Indecon report echoed this view and found that the changes to the one-parent family payment scheme made over the last number of years increased employment and reduced welfare dependency.  It also found that the changes increased the probability of employment and higher employment income for lone parents.  The report concluded that assisting lone parents to enhance skills also needs to be seen as a key objective as low paid employment will not, on its own, ensure a reduction in the risk of poverty.</p>  <p>  The Budget 2018 measures - increases in the income disregard, the primary rate and the increase for qualified child rate &ndash; come into effect next month. The effect of these measures will see a lone parent on the one-parent family payment or jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, who is working 15 hours a week on the National Minimum Wage, being better off by nearly &euro;1,000 per year.</p>  <p>  I should mention finally that my Department is currently developing the new National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  Like its predecessor, it will have a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach that will aim to improve outcomes for the vulnerable and marginalised in our society.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-20a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022000058#WRA02100"><p>The JobsPlus scheme, since its introduction in 2013, has provided a direct monthly financial incentive to employers who recruit employees who are long term on the live register and those transitioning into employment.  My Department pays the incentive to employers monthly in arrears over a two-year period.  It provides employers with two levels of payment, &euro;7,500 and &euro;10,000, depending on the length of time the recruited employee has been unemployed.  The Scheme has proved to be effective in meeting its initial objectives.  I was keen, however, to ensure that the JobsPlus scheme would have a particular focus on addressing the position of older unemployed people and the very long-term unemployed.  In this regard, I was struck by the findings of a recent review of JobsPlus, conducted by my Department, which showed that workers over 50 years of age were under-represented on the scheme. Consequently, as part of budget 2018, I announced key new measures which came into effect on the 1st January 2018 and which provide a new focus for the scheme.    Firstly, jobseekers aged over 50 years will qualify for the higher &euro;10,000 incentive rate after 12 months on the live register, down from 24 months.</p>  <p>  Secondly, for jobseekers aged less than 50 years, the qualifying period for receipt of the higher incentive rate of &euro;10,000 has been increased from 24 months on the live register to 36 months.  For this cohort, the qualifying period for the &euro;7,500 incentive rate remains at 12 months. </p>  <p>  As I say, I have introduced these measures to encourage employers to focus their recruitment efforts on older workers and on those who are long-term unemployed. </p>  <p>  For those under the age of 25, the qualifying period for the &euro;7,500 incentive rate remains at 4 months.</p>  <p>  The incentive will continue to be paid in monthly instalments over a two year period provided the employment is maintained. </p></reply>

Scheme areas are monitored and reviewed to ensure customers are responded to and claims are processed as expeditiously as possible.  As part of its programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented by my Department in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.  Staffing levels are also kept under review to ensure the best use of available resources. Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme my Department may make a single exceptional needs payment &ndash; an ENP - to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  </p>  <p>  Provision of a prompt service is a major objective for the Department&rsquo;s staff, especially for the SWA scheme which is the safety net within the social welfare system.  The ENP scheme is demand led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  Reviews of ENP cases are carried out by review officers within the community welfare service.  ENP applications and requests for reviews are examined promptly by the Department given the nature and sometimes urgency of the need presented, for example travel required for urgent medical or family circumstances may be examined immediately. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy has concerns in respect of a particular case he should bring it to the attention of the Department. </p></reply>

In addition to its own statutory responsibilities in relation to information and advocacy service provision, it has statutory responsibility for the countrywide networks of Citizens Information Services (CIS) and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS).   The decision to restructure the governance arrangements of the CIS and MABS companies was taken by the statutory Board of the Citizens Information Board.  In November 2014, the CIB Board decided to restructure the local CIS and MABS networks.  In October 2016, the Board decided that the new structure should be regionally based.  On 15 February 2017, the Board adopted a recommendation that the current structure of ninety three individual local companies would be changed to a sixteen regional company model, comprising eight CIS and eight MABS companies.   The CIB Executive is currently implementing the decision taken by the Board, as it is required to do.  An Implementation Group, with cross sectoral representation, has been set up to assist with the transition to the new governance model.  CIB has, and will continue to, provide the necessary information and support to each of the local companies and their Chairpersons and Boards, throughout the transitional period.</p>  <p>  Information sessions have already been held for chairpersons of the 38 companies transitioning to the regional companies in Phase 1.  This month, consultation sessions were held with CIS Development Managers and MABS Money Advice Co-ordinators regarding the preparations needed to transfer to the new companies and to address any queries they had.  </p>  <p>  Further information sessions will be held for the companies transitioning in the remaining phases.  It is expected that the full transition to the 16 new companies will take up to two years to complete.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, generally speaking, trustees of pension schemes have duties and responsibilities under the Pensions Act, under trust law, and under other relevant legislation.  They must administer the trust in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed and rules.    The provisions of the Pensions Act are enforced by the Pensions Authority so any issues or complaints in relation to a particular scheme should be notified to the Authority for action.  The Pensions Authority will assess if there has been a breach of any legal obligations and take any necessary action if such a breach is found.</p>  <p>  I intend to introduce a number of amendments to the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill at Committee Stage which will ensure that a sponsoring employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the company pension scheme.  The amendments will provide for a 12 month notification period where an employer is seeking to cease making contributions to a scheme.  They will also provide that, where a scheme is in deficit and a funding proposal is not been put in place in a timely manner, the Pensions Authority may direct steps to be taken to ensure that the scheme meets the funding standard .  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In order to ensure services are provided to the right person and to support efficient service delivery, a growing number of public service providers, including my Department, are requiring that proof of identity is underpinned by the SAFE 2 identity verification standard.  This standard verifies identity to a substantial level of assurance and is the most robust identity verification in Ireland today.</p><p>The requirement for this level of identity verification is provided for at Section 247C of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended) in respect of customers of my Department. </p><p>My Department needs to verify the identity of customers to a substantial level of assurance to ensure that they are who they claim to be, to ensure that they are not being impersonated, to ensure that they are not claiming services or payment in another identity, to minimise the need for them to prove their identity over and over again, and to provide them with access to an increasing range of online public services.</p><p>For the most part, the SAFE2 registration process is very easy and straightforward and simply verifies the identity information the public service already has for a person.  A Public Services Card may then be issued as a physical token of proof of having successfully completed that SAFE2 identity verification. </p><p>While the roll out of the SAFE identity verification requirement to other public services is a matter for the relevant Departments and public bodies providing those services, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published the eGovernment Strategy 2017 &ndash; 2020 last year which lists a number of public services for which SAFE 2 identity verification will be required and highlights how others are likely to be listed in the future.  The list is available at .</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s schemes and services are audited and adjudicated on by a number of regulatory and judicial bodies at various times.  Normal business is continued while these audits are carried out.  Accordingly, I do not believe that it would be appropriate to suspend the SAFE identity verification programme due to the ongoing audit by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputies.</p></reply>

The service was launched in 2015 on a &lsquo;rolling basis&rsquo; with referral numbers gradually increasing over time.  There are two phases to the service.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, a personal advisor (PA) provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months.    My Department has published an (updated) cohort based report on the performance of the service, in January 2018.  This report detailed employment outcomes on a quarterly cohort basis, i.e. customers referred in Quarter 3 and 4 in 2015 and those referred in Quarter 1 and 2 in 2016.</p>  <p>  Of the 39,603 jobseekers referred to the service during this period, 58% were over three years unemployed and a further 17% were over two years unemployed.  These groups face significant barriers when seeking to enter or return to employment in the open labour market.</p>  <p>  The total employment outcome across all four cohorts at the time of publishing was 25%: 18% of Jobseekers who engaged with the service during this period obtained full-time employment, in addition a further 4% of clients entered part-time employment and a further 3% became self-employed.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note, that the latter two cohorts (Q1 and Q2 2016), represent 80% of the 39,603 jobseekers referred between July 2015 and June 2016, and the employment outcomes are expected to improve over time as more  jobseekers from these cohorts complete their full engagement period with the service.</p>  <p>  Given the extended time a customer may engage with the programme and the increase in referral numbers over the reported timeframe the results are very positive.  These initial reports are subject to review and are based on a relatively small sample size.  With this in mind, the department is undertaking an econometric review of this strand of its activation services.  Completion of the review is provisionally scheduled for the end of Q3 2018, following which more detailed and robust statistics will be available.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It provides part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping-stone back to employment.  However, it is important to note that these placements are not full-time sustainable jobs and are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market or getting a job for the first time.  The Deputy will appreciate that the welcome reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes.  Long-term unemployment is expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecasted fall in overall unemployment. Currently, participants can remain on T&uacute;s for one year and I have no plans to change this.  However, changes were introduced recently to the selection criteria for T&uacute;s which should broaden the availability of T&uacute;s to a greater number of people on the live register.  This includes an increase in the percentage of assisted referrals from 20% to 30%, as well as permitting someone who has had a break of up to 30 days on the Live Register in the past 12 months to be considered eligible for T&uacute;s selection. </p>  <p>  The Department keeps all aspects of its activation programmes under review to ensure the best outcomes for participants and communities.  The Government is very mindful of the large number of work programme places involved in service delivery and other valuable services around the country. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) is the lead Department for one of the 2016 Dormant Accounts Action Plan measures which provided &euro;0.5m for training and supports for family carers at the end of their full-time caring role. The 2016 DAF Action Plan for carers has now been fully implemented.  Pobal administered the measure on behalf of the DEASP, in accordance with their service agreement with the Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD).For the 2016 Action Plan, Pobal made a competitive call in early 2017 for proposals from national organisations that provide services to carers.

This is a review required by legislation. It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure. In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071. As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.</p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.</p>  <p>  These costs assume that the cost of extending invalidity pension to the self-employed builds up steeply for the first 10 years after introduction after which time the scheme is almost at maturity or a steady state.  </p>  <p>  For the shorter term schemes, illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefits, it is estimated that they will reach maturity after 2 years.  Projected expenditure on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit assumes the same incidence rate as prevail in the employed (PRSI Class A) population. </p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.</p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular state pension contributory.  </p>  <p>  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.</p>  <p>  The findings of the Review will play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the SIF in the years ahead including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.  The Actuarial Review provides government with a timely and evidence-led opportunity to undertake a full review of our social insurance system and to consult with stakeholders.  </p></reply>

Crucially, unlike the proposed Homemaking Credits which was proposed in 2010 as part of the National Pensions Framework, the HomeCaring Credit will apply to periods both before and after 1994, as for most people reaching pension age between 2012 and 2019, such periods, where they had them, occurred before 1994, and provisions restricted to periods after then are of little or no benefit to them.</p>  <p>  This approach will make it easier for many post-2012 pensioners affected by the 2012 rate band changes who are currently assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  A person who reached pension age after 1st September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Up to 10 years of other credits, for example, awarded when on Jobseekers or Illness Benefit, may also be used, subject to the total credits not exceeding 20 years.  </p>  <p>  So, for example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseeker credits, and 15 years HomeCaring Credits (before or after 1994), over a 50 year period and qualify for a maximum rate pension, despite additional gaps of up to 10 years.  Those with fewer contributions will have a pro-rata entitlement.  For example, someone with 18 years PRSI contributions and 18 years homecaring may qualify for a 90% contributory pension.</p>  <p>  Legislation has to be drafted and enacted to enable implementation of these arrangements and IT solutions in line with this legislation must be developed.  Accordingly, it is planned that the reviews will commence at the start of Q4 of this year, with the first payments being made in Q1 2019.</p>  <p>  Under the arrangements, post 2012 pensioners will not see their pension reduced by this change.  If their rate is improved by the TCA calculation option they will benefit, but if their TCA calculation entitlement is lower, they will remain on their existing rate.  Everyone on reduced rates will also continue to have access to the State pension (non-contributory), which provides a pension of up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate and includes generous income disregards.</p>  <p>  As was understood by the then Government in 2010 when adopting the National Pensions Framework,  there are those who are less likely to benefit from the TCA model, notably people with lower numbers of paid social insurance contributions, who have no significant homemaking/caring periods.  </p>  <p>  The final model of TCA for those reaching pension age from 2020 will be decided upon following a public consultation later this year, and I do not wish to pre-empt that process, nor the Government decision and legislation which will follow it.  However, I can state my determination that adequate provision for home-carers will be an important factor in the final design.  I can also say that I will ensure that there will continue to be a strong State pension (non-contributory), which ensures those with very limited PRSI contributions and/or home-caring periods can be guaranteed a decent standard of living in old age, regardless of their contributions to the Social Insurance Fund. </p>  <p>  If everyone received the same rate under both systems, there would be no point in such a reform, and if the result of introducing TCA was to make the State pension system more expensive, it would undermine the long-term sustainability of the pension system, which would endanger the future pensions of the existing workers who fund the system now.  This will be the system in place for the decades to come, and it will not be possible to simply provide everyone with a maximum rate pension, regardless of the contributions they have made inside and outside the home, and regardless of their means.  Choices will have to be made, and the planned consultation will give an opportunity for people to express their views for consideration in making the final policy decisions.  The final TCA model will seek to provide the most equitable outcomes, and ensure the current success of the State pension system in providing older people with a decent standard of living continues.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputies.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-20a.70.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022000058#WRA05200"><p>Ireland has a unified system of social security whereby all contributions paid by workers (and their employers, where applicable) are paid into a single fund, the Social Insurance Fund (SIF),which is applied to pay benefits to which those workers have established entitlement.  The Irish social welfares system recognises different categories or &ldquo;Classes&rdquo; of workers.  The rate of contribution paid by these categories differs.  They can therefore access different levels of social insurance benefits.  For example, Class A employees, generally private sector employees and post 6 April 1995 public servants, pay a combined employer and employee PRSI rate of up to 14.85% and qualify for all social insurance benefits.  In contrast, Class B public sector employees pay a much lower combined PRSI rate of up to 2.91%.  Consequently, they qualify for a restricted range of social insurance benefits.  They do not qualify for the State pension (contributory), relying instead on their occupational pensions. This government is committed to improving the PRSI scheme for employees and the self-employed.  Entitlement to treatment benefit was extended to the self-employed in March 2017 and the treatment benefit scheme was improved for all qualified contributors in October 2017 with the optical scheme now covering the provision of glasses, either free or subsidised if an upgraded design is chosen, or provide a contribution towards contact lenses.</p>  <p>  Repairs to glasses are also covered under the scheme.  The dental scheme now includes a contribution to cleanings, either an annual scale and polish or more extensive periodontal treatment if clinically required.  Even more significantly, self-employed contributors are now eligible for the invalidity pension from December 2017.  For the first time, this gives the self-employed access to the safety-net of State income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability without having to go through a means test.  This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed.</p>  <p>  On 23 January, the Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated by a new &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) which will include up to 20 years of a new Home Caring credit. Unlike the current Homemakers scheme, this credit will apply to periods both before and after 1994. This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role. It will make it easier for such pensioners to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory). The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines a final pension outcome, and it also acknowledges, for the first time, the contribution made by home-carers in the period before 1994.</p>  <p>  An inter-departmental working group has been established to examine and report on options for the amalgamation of USC and PRSI.  It will have regard to the structures and rates of personal tax and social insurance in other countries and the macroeconomic and demographic contexts in Ireland and its work should be completed by the end of June 2018. </p></reply>

The interdepartmental group considered a range of approaches across relevant Departments to deliver on this commitment and made 24 recommendations under the broad headings of: reconfiguring the system of supports to ensure that work pays; promoting early intervention; communicating effectively that work pays and future proofing.  </p>  <p>  The report contains a number of recommendations covering a range of Government departments.  A number of the report&rsquo;s recommendations related to my Department&rsquo;s responsibilities have already been implemented namely:</p>  <p>  - People with a long-term disability payment who move off the payment to get a job will retain their Free Travel Pass for a period of five years (the report recommended retention for 3 years). </p>  <p>  - A fast&ndash;track return to Disability Allowance for people where employment does not work out.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a number of other actions are the subject of ongoing work:</p>  <p>  - Development work is being undertaken on a new &ldquo;Ready Reckoner&rdquo;, to calculate the net benefits and financial implications of working for people on a disability type payment.</p>  <p>  - Persons with disabilities may, on a voluntary basis, make an appointment with a case officer to explore their options and develop a personal progression plan.  Strengthening the capacity of the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service to support people with disabilities to get and maintain employment is an ongoing activity.  </p>  <p>  - Amending legislation dispensing with the requirement for disability allowance, blind pension and rent supplement under supplementary welfare allowance, that work must be of a rehabilitative nature has been included in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registrations Bill 2017. </p>  <p>  On the publication of the MWP report, the Government gave a clear commitment to consult widely in relation to a number of recommendations.  This has led to initial consultation with the Department&rsquo;s Disability Stakeholders Group followed by the procurement of an independent facilitator and the holding of a number of facilitated focus groups.  Following this, the DEASP will now engage in an extensive consultation process in the first quarter of 2018 with people with disabilities, parents of children with disabilities, and sectoral representatives, in relation to early engagement with people with disabilities on the recommendations 9 and 10 of the MWP report.</p>  <p>  While the Government has decided to implement some of the recommendations, others require further consultation with disability service providers and other stakeholders.  These include developing and extending interdepartmental and interagency protocols, including protocols with the range of State funded disability service providers; developing a proactive communications/information strategy; and future proofing to ensure that the recommendations are reviewed on a regular basis.</p></reply>

Only one allowance is paid per household.

Through the operation of the income support system managed by my Department and the health service managed by the Health Service Executive (HSE), the Government recognises the need for flexible and effective support for persons who encounter mental health difficulties.  Both an effective income support system and health services are key to addressing these difficulties but the research has also demonstrated that work can be an important factor in recovery, in particular for people with mental health issues. The Make Work Pay report for People with Disabilities, published last year, identified the need for flexibility in both the income support and the health (medical card) systems.  This is particularly the case where a person with a disability takes up a job but that job does not work out.  Anxiety in such circumstances can be particularly pronounced amongst those with mental health issues, given the episodic nature of such conditions.</p><p>One of the recommendations of the Make Work Pay report was to put in place and promote a system for fast-track reinstatement of income support payments to people with disabilities who have returned to work, and have subsequently had to leave their job within one year.  </p><p>As a first step in implementing this recommendation a fast-track return to disability allowance protocol has now been put in place.  In addition to this initiative, people who are participating on the partial capacity benefit scheme may return to illness benefit or invalidity pension if they find that they cannot continue to work.</p><p>My Department also provides a wide range of work related supports for people with disabilities, including people with mental health difficulties, which they or their employers, where appropriate, can access while in receipt of income support payments.  These include the Wage Subsidy Scheme, the EmployAbility service and employment support grants for people with disabilities. </p><p>Most recently, the Department participated as a partner organisation in the Integrating Employment and Mental Health Service project, which ran between 2015 and 2017.  The aim of this project was to demonstrate how existing employment services (specifically the EmployAbility service) could practice the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model of supported employment for clients with severe and enduring mental health issues.  An evaluation report, <i>Steps into Work,</i>was published on the 8<sup>th</sup>February last and found that through improved integration between mental health services and employment support services, improvements can be achieved in the employment outcomes of people with mental health difficulties. </p><p>My Department is now collaborating with the Department of Health and the HSE to extend the availability of IPS to all Mental Health Services in each Community Healthcare Organisation.  This will see funding from the HSE Service Reform Fund (SRF) and funding from the HSE&rsquo;s Clinical Programmes for 27.5 IPS employment specialists for a three year period.</p><p>I look forward to seeing better health and employment outcomes delivered as a result of this good example of interagency collaboration.</p></reply>

Section 263 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005 (as amended) provides that:   </p>  <p>  (a) the following information is inscribed on the Public Services Card (PSC): forename, surname, Personal Public Service (PPS) Number, photograph, signature, card issue number and expiry date; and </p>  <p> (b)	the following information is encoded on the chip of the PSC: forename, surname, date of birth, place of birth, sex, nationality, former surnames (if any), mother&rsquo;s former surnames (if any), photograph, signature, issue number of the PSC, and expiry date of the PSC. </p>  <p>  The above data (apart from the issue number and expiry date of the PSC) are part of the Public Service Identity (PSI) dataset as set out in section 262 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005 (as amended). </p>  <p>  Section 262 also sets out how the sharing and use of the PSI data is restricted to public service bodies specified in law or their agents.  Designation as a specified body requires primary legislation and as such can only be done by an Act of the Oireachtas.  </p>  <p>  Section 262 also provides that PSI data can only be used by a specified body for authenticating the identity of an individual with whom it has a transaction and in performing its public functions insofar as those functions relate to the person concerned.  In addition, where a specified body collects any element of PSI data from a person, that information shall also be collected for the purpose of maintaining the person&rsquo;s public service identity.  The Data Protection Acts as amended, Subsection 1 c iii of Section 2A, also provide for personal data to be processed on condition that &ldquo;the processing is necessary for the performance of a function of the Government or a Minister of the Government&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The Department provides extensive information on SAFE2, the PSC and PSI on its website, including on the range of bodies using the PSI and details on this usage.  As part of this, the Department has also published a Comprehensive Guide to SAFE Registration and the PSC on its website.</p>  <p>  The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into effect on the 25th May 2018.  This is the one of most significant developments in European data protection law in over 30 years.  The GDPR strengthens the rights of data subjects and will have many implications for my Department.  Given its wide range of schemes, services and payments, the Department collects and holds large volumes of personal data on customers and is very aware of the need to have adequate data protection policies, procedures and structures in place in line with the GDPR.  Accordingly, the Department has established a dedicated GDPR implementation team which is undertaking a major programme of work to ensure compliance with the GDPR.  Additionally, specific GDPR training and awareness is being provided by the GDPR implementation team and a specialist external training company to staff and senior managers across the Department.  All of this work is being overseen by a senior level Data Management Programme Board.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I indicated that I would consider these matters in the context of possible Committee Stage amendments.However, I would like to make a number of points.  There will be an administrative burden on employers in implementing the banded hours provision so therefore it is desirable that an &lsquo;easy&rsquo; divisor is used.  I am open to  discussing a reference period of 13 months or less and in this respect I note that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in their report on the Banded Hour Contracts Bill 2016 recommended a reference period of 12 months. In relation to the width of the bands, I am open to discussing the option of narrower bands at Committee Stage once the bands allow a reasonable degree of flexibility.  This can benefit both employers and employees.  A greater number of bands but with more narrow ranges of hours will be more difficult to operate.  </p><p>We know that banded hours arrangements are operating successfully in the retail sector but we must acknowledge that what is appropriate to individual employments in the retail sector might not work as well in other sectors.  This legislation will apply to all employers in all sectors of the economy and not just the retail sector.  Therefore, we must be careful to introduce banded hours provisions that work more generally across the economy, rather than imposing on all, a particular banded hours model that is adapted to the retail sector. </p><p>Regarding a definition of casual work, the <i>Organisation of Working Time Act</i>was enacted in 1997.  Section 18 of that Act refers to &lsquo;work of a casual nature&rsquo; but does not define it.  This has not led to a regulatory problem of employers incorrectly categorising employees as &lsquo;casual&rsquo; in the 20 years since enactment.  It is not good practice to put definitions in legislation when the plain, ordinary meaning of a word is capable of being understood by the bodies adjudicating on it. </p><p>The WRC and the Labour Court are capable of examining all of the circumstances of a particular case and then making an appropriate judgement as to whether or not a particular arrangement is genuinely casual.  The Bill introduces a new requirement on employers to provide in writing shortly after the commencement of employment what the employer reasonably expects the normal length of the working day and the normal length of the working week will be.  Furthermore, deliberately misrepresenting this will become an offence under the Government&rsquo;s proposals and I am sure that employers will not want to fall foul of this provision in the Bill.</p></reply>

In advance of this, on the 23rd January, the Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated by a new &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) which will include up to 20 years of a new HomeCaring credit.  This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome.  Under this new arrangement, a person who reached pension age after 1st September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Up to 10 years of other credits, for example when unemployed or ill, may also be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years.  So, for example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseeker credits, and 15 years HomeCaring Credits, over a 50 year period.</p>  <p>  As with the Yearly Average approach and the pre-existing homemakers disregard scheme, these measures only determine the rate of payment for those with an entitlement to a State pension (contributory).  They do not remove the requirement to be entitled to such a pension in the first place.  Entitlement to a State pension is based on a number of criteria, including that a minimum of 520 qualifying contributions are paid.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to remove the requirement to have 520 contributions paid to qualify for the State Pension (contributory).  It is reasonable to require people who seek a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years paid contributions into the Social Insurance Fund which finances it, over 50 years of working age life.  While it was lower in the past when PRSI coverage was less widespread, legislation was introduced in 1997 to increase this threshold to 520 weeks, or 10 years of contributions.  A fifteen year period was allowed pass between that legislation being enacted and the threshold being raised to this level, which would have been sufficient for most people to achieve the required contributions.</p>  <p>  For those who do not qualify for the State Pension (contributory) (SPC), there are other state pension payments available.  Notably, they may qualify for the State Pension (non-contributory) which is a means-tested payment (based on their share of household means) with a maximum payment of 95% of the SPC.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult (based on their own means), amounting up to 90% of a full rate SPC pension.  Consequently, if a person doesn&rsquo;t receive a State pension after pension age, they have both significant means and have made little or no contribution to the Social Insurance Fund.  Introducing a new pension entitlement for such people would reduce the resources available for other pensioners, most of whom have less means than they do, and have contributed significantly more to the Social Insurance Fund.</p>  <p>  The final model of TCA which will be in place for all new pensioners from 2020 will be decided upon following a public consultation later this year, and I do not wish to pre-empt this process, nor the Government decision and legislation which will follow it.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Irish youth unemployment has thus fallen from well above the EU average in 2012 (23%) to well below the current figure EU figure of 19.1%.  The long-term unemployment rate for young people has fallen from over 15% at peak to below 4% in the third quarter of 2017.  Youth unemployment figures can be expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecast fall in overall unemployment.  Additionally, Ireland is on course to bring youth unemployment below 12% and long-term unemployment below 2.5% in accordance with <i>Pathways to Work</i>targets for 2020.</p><p>Under the Youth Guarantee process case officers engage with unemployed young people, on a monthly basis, to prepare and implement personal progression plans for employment. Where young people do not find work quickly, additional supports are offered through places on employment and training schemes. </p><p>As part of this range of opportunities, later this year I will be introducing a new work experience programme targeted exclusively at young jobseekers who are long-term unemployed and face a significant barrier to gaining employment. </p><p>The Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) will provide young jobseekers with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement.Young people, like other groups, vary in terms of skills, aptitude and background so will be offered a wide variety of work experience options to meet their particular needs while enhancing their employment prospects.  A Learning and Development Plan will be at the core of each placement, and progress will be supported and monitored by a case worker on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The scheme will complement and sit alongside other opportunities developed by the Department of Education and Skills, such as the new Career Traineeships and Apprenticeships, and will broaden the options available to young people.  It will be open to employers across the private, community and voluntary sectors who meet the eligibility criteria. Public sector organisations will not be included.  Host Organisations will complete an assessment for the participant at the end of the placement.  Employers will be encouraged to hire participants who have performed well, and will qualify for a financial subsidy under<i>JobsPlus Youth.</i></p><p>The qualifying payments are Jobseekers&rsquo; Payments, One Parent Family Payment, Jobseeker Transition Payment, Disability Allowance, Blind Person&rsquo;s Pension or Supplementary Welfare Allowance.  In some cases, candidates who have been in receipt of a payment for less than 12 months, but who are considered by a case worker to face significant barriers to work will be granted access to the scheme. </p><p>Operational details are currently being finalised and I hope to launch the Scheme in Q.2, 2018.  I am confident that these planned measures, together with the continuing strong performance of the economy, will support further reductions in long term and youth unemployment.</p></reply>

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded and just 1% are appealed.   Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.  Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.</p>  <p>  The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeal officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the higher courts and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  </p>  <p>  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.</p>  <p>  In addition, a number of new appeals officers have joined the appeals office over the past year, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise.  This changeover in staff led to a slightly longer time to conclude appeals in 2017.  However, the Chief Appeals Officer has advised that she is hopeful that processing times will improve in 2018.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that an appellant can claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal and that any favourable decisions are backdated to the original date of the claim. </p></reply>

All decisions regarding a person&rsquo;s welfare entitlements are taken only by Department Officials. </p></reply>

My Department has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events.  My Department immediately activated the humanitarian assistance scheme, administered by the local Community Welfare Service (CWS), to assist householders affected by flooding following storm Eleanor.  I am satisfied that the local CWS is best placed to work with householders in response to emergency events.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of the humanitarian assistance scheme is to prevent hardship by providing income tested financial support to people whose homes are damaged from flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and structural repair.  The Government has not set a limit on the amount that can be paid under this scheme.  </p>  <p>  In dealing with emergency events, my Department adopts the following approach: </p>  <p>  - Stage 1 is to provide emergency income support payments (including food, clothing and personal items) in the immediate aftermath of the event.  </p>  <p>  - Stage 2 involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential items. </p>  <p>  - Stage 3 is to identify what longer term financial support or works are required, including plastering, painting and relaying of floors.</p>  <p>  The scheme is demand led and in the aftermath of storm Eleanor, officials have provided financial support to a small number of affected households (15 in total) primarily in the Galway area, who have engaged with the Department.  Latest figures show that over &euro;23,000 has been paid to these households.  A further four households have recently sought financial assistance and these applications are being considered.  This particular storm impacted mainly business rather than residential properties.  Humanitarian support is provided to those businesses affected by the Department of Defence.</p>  <p>  Householders seeking assistance under the humanitarian assistance scheme should contact my Department.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Long term unemployed jobseekers who are not engaged with any other activation scheme or service are referred by my Department to the JobPath service to receive intensive individual support, including relevant training and educational programmes which will assist them in finding full-time sustainable employment. </p>  <p>  Jobseekers can only participate with one activation scheme or service at a time, this is necessary to enable the scheme and service providers&rsquo; have sufficient time to work with them in order to develop their skills and competencies so they are in a better position pursue suitable work opportunities which may result in sustainable full time job.  </p>  <p>  However, if on the date of their referral to JobPath, a person has a written offer with a start date within four weeks for CE, they will be facilitated to take up the placement. </p>  <p>  While schemes such as CE provide long-term unemployed people with part-time experience as a stepping stone back to employment, they are not full-time sustainable jobs.  Referral to JobPath is generally for a 52 week period, participation on an employment scheme remains an option for each person if they continue to be fully unemployed at the end of their engagement with the JobPath service.   </p>  <p>  The rural social scheme (RSS) provides opportunities for low income farmers and fishermen who are currently in receipt of specified social welfare payments to work to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.</p>  <p>  The current selection process for JobPath excludes those jobseekers categorised as self-employed including those actively farming or fishing.  However a person who is currently engaged with the JobPath service is eligible to apply for a placement with RSS once the relevant qualifying conditions are satisfied and a suitable opportunity is available to the client. </p>  <p>  With regard to people engaged in Seasonal or Part-time employment, An Taoiseach, in his previous role as Minister for Social Protection, gave a commitment at D&aacute;il report stage of the Social Welfare Bill 2016 that he would ask officials to examine the issue of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the treatment of part-time and seasonal workers, including those categorised as having subsidiary employment.  My officials have recently completed this report on these issues which I will consider in detail. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

It currently benefits over 58,000 families with almost 129,000 children, with an estimated spend in 2018 of approximately &euro;431 million.  I agreed during the debate on the Social Welfare Act 2017, enacted in December, to bring forward a report to the Committee on Social Protection reviewing the operation of the Working Family Payment, including the requirement to work 19 hours per week, or 38 hours per fortnight to qualify for the payment, within 6 months of the Bill being enacted.     My officials are currently working on the review and I anticipate that this will be completed within the time agreed.  </p>  <p>Budget 2018 increased the income thresholds by &euro;10 for families with up to three children.

It replaced the former smallholders&rsquo; unemployment assistance payment.  In line with the then existing arrangements for unemployment assistance (including smallholders) and pre-retirement allowance, the income of farm assist recipients was exempt from class S PRSI for self-employed workers.</p>  <p>  Recipients of farm assist who had previously paid Class S social insurance had the option of paying voluntary contributions to maintain their social insurance record, provided they satisfied the qualifying conditions.  Since 1st January 2007, the exemption from class S PRSI has been removed and those receiving jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and farm assist are subject to Class S PRSI as self-employed contributors on their self-employed income, provided their annual income is &euro;5,000 or more.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to amend legislation regarding the State pension (contributory), to award a maximum rate payment to pensioners who had such a period during 1999-2006 when they were exempt from PRSI.</p>  <p>  However, a person aged over 66 with limited PRSI contributions over the course of their life may claim a State pension (non-contributory) if they have an income need, and this entitlement is not based on payment of social insurance contributions.  The maximum weekly rate is &euro;227, i.e. over 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.  While it is means-tested, there are very significant disregards which are to the benefit of claimants, and a significant majority of such pensioners are paid at the full rate.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Both schemes already provide significant support to individuals so that they can work up to 3 days a week and still retain access to a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  The 2018 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;2.17 billion.   It is accepted that periods of unemployment are a normal feature of the acting and artistic professions and people in these professions can qualify for a jobseeker payment when they are unemployed.  For instance, actors including self-employed actors, who satisfy the scheme&rsquo;s conditionality and the means test can qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment.  Actors who are working part-time and are categorised as casual jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients or those who are self-employed and in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance are not currently activated by my Department. </p>  <p>  My Department also operates a fast-tracking process for customers who sign-off on their jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claim to take up work for a period of up to 12 weeks.

When the person signs on again after the period of work or training, the claim can be reactivated without delay and payment restored.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s Intreo service now provides a more focussed service to those in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, including actors. </p></reply>

This reform plan will detail measures to reform both our State and supplementary pension systems. Perhaps the two most fundamental reform measures contained within this plan will relate to the introduction of the &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; for the State pension contributory from 2020 and the development of a new automatic enrolment retirement savings system for employees without supplementary pensions coverage.    It is proposed that the &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; (TCA) will replace the current &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system from 2020.  This will make the level of pension more directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life, with significant pension credits granted to people who have taken time out of the workplace to perform caring duties.  </p>  <p>  The TCA will eliminate the anomalies inherent in the current averaging system whereby a person can qualify for a full pension based on a small number of years payments (currently as little as 10 years contributions) provided they have no gaps in their record, whereas a person with more than 10 years contributions but with a significant gap in their record might be paid a reduced rate.</p>  <p>  Automatic enrolment would see a transition from the current and purely voluntary supplementary pension system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  It is planned that this reform, where the saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out, will include employer and State financial incentives to encourage long term saving and asset accumulation amongst those who may otherwise suffer a reduction in living standards at retirement.  It will increase the wellbeing, financial security, and independence of future retirees. </p>  <p>  It is intended that following publication of the reform plan, two separate public consultation processes will be launched on the &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; and automatic enrolment.  The purpose of both of these consultations will be to inform the design of both systems.  The details and timeframe of them will be confirmed subsequent to the publication of the reform plan, although I can say it is my intention to begin them by Q2 of this year. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The 1997 Act transposed the EU Working Time Directive &ndash; Directive 2003/88/EC.  The purpose of the Directive is to establish minimum health and safety requirements for the organisation of working time for employees. </p>  <p>  While the Directive sets down limits on the time that workers can work without rests, it does allow some flexibility in relation to the application of some of its provisions.  In this regard, it provides for derogations and exemptions under certain circumstances from some of its provisions.  These derogations, which are provided for under the 1997 Act, are conditional on workers being granted &lsquo;equivalent compensatory rest&rsquo;.  So, while employers may operate a more flexible system of working, employees must not lose out on rest periods.  In all of this, I am very conscious that the purpose of the Working Time Directive is to protect the health and safety of employees.  I understand that the Labour Court, in its determination of this particular case, found that the derogations available in the legislation did not apply to the employees in question.  The Court is independent in the performance of its statutory functions in this regard.  As Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, I have no role in relation to the adjudicatory functions of the Labour Court. </p>  <p>  Representations have been made to me from the horse racing and breeding industry and from my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine about the concerns that exist in the industry arising from the Labour Court ruling.  In light of the representations made to me, I have written to the Attorney General seeking his advice on this matter.</p>  <p>  I understand that the employer involved has appealed the Labour Court determination to the Circuit Court and the case is returnable for a date in April 2018.  In the circumstances it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the matter. </p></reply>

The most recent data shows that unemployment has fallen from a peak of 15% in 2012 to 6.7% by Q.3 2017.  Within the South East region, which includes Wexford, unemployment has fallen from a peak of 19.0% in Quarter 2, 2012 to 8.1% in Quarter 2, 2017 with numbers in employment increasing by 29,000 to 214,900 over the same period. While data from the Labour Force Survey is not available at the county level, trends in the Live Register can give an indication of underlying trends in local unemployment.</p><p>Overall, the Live Register in Wexford has fallen by almost 42% in the 5 years to December 2017, close to the reduction of 44% nationally.  In the year to December 2017, the Live Register in Wexford has fallen by 1,707 people, or almost 14%, again closely in line with national trends.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment since 2012 is twofold:</p><p>-  Firstly, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs.  This policy now includes a specific regional Action Plan for the South East Region that has seen over 8,000 jobs created in the region in the last two years.</p><p>-  Secondly, through Pathways to Work, my Department ensures that as many new jobs and vacancies as possible are filled by people taken from the Live Register.  Under this policy, employment services and activation supports are heavily concentrated on the areas of highest unemployment, including those in Wexford.</p><p>Currently, there are 11 Activation Case Officers in the Intreo service in Wexford.  This is an increase of one in comparison to January 2017, when there were 10. Prior to the roll-out of Intreo, there were 8 Activation Case Officers in Wexford, including former FAS personnel and DSP Jobs Facilitators. </p><p>The Case Officer capacity is supplemented by referrals to Turas Nua under the Job Path programme and to Wexford Local Development which operates the Local Employment Service (LES) on behalf of the Department.  Wexford Local Development is contracted to provide intensive supports to 960 customers and employs 8 mediators to support LES operations. </p><p>A total of 9,114 customer engagements were scheduled by Activation Case Officers in 2017 in addition to their work with employers.  Local records indicate that approximately 5,300 referrals to Turas Nua took place over the course of the year.</p><p>Later this year I will be introducing a new work experience programme targeted specifically at young jobseekers who are long-term unemployed or who face significant barriers to gaining employment &ndash; people who even during the Celtic Tiger years would have found it difficult to get a foothold on the career ladder.  The new Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) will provide young jobseekers with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement.  Host organisations will be encouraged to hire participants who performed well, and will qualify for a financial subsidy under <i>JobsPlus Youth.</i>YESS will complement other opportunities developed by the Department of Education and Skills, such as the new Career Traineeships and Apprenticeships, and will broaden the choice available to young people.  Operational details are currently being finalised and I hope to launch the scheme in Quarter 2, 2018.</p><p>To date, the policies being pursued under the Action Plan for Jobs and under Pathways to Work have been effective in reducing unemployment, both nationally and in Wexford and I am confident that they will continue to do so. </p></reply>

The 2018 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;2.17 billion.  An Taoiseach, in his previous role as Minister for Social Protection, gave a commitment at D&aacute;il report stage of the Social Welfare Bill 2016 that he would ask officials to examine the issue of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the treatment of part-time and seasonal workers, including those categorised as having a subsidiary employment.  My Department has recently completed a report on the issues of this group which I am currently examining. I want to ensure that any approach taken is fair and sustainable in the long term. </p>  <p>  On 7th December 2017, I published the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 which passed through the second stage of the D&aacute;il last week. The Bill delivers on the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to tackle the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and strengthen the regulation of precarious work.</p>  <p>  This very important piece of legislation will improve the security and predictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours in all sectors of employment.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently collating data on jobseekers benefit recipients in subsidiary employment. We will have 12 months of data gathered by May 2018 at which point I will be in a better position to make an informed decision on this issue. </p></reply>

It must be remembered that citizen centric CIS and MABS services are 100% funded by the Exchequer.  It is essential that each company operates to modern and evolving standards of corporate governance, including compliance with necessary financial and audit requirements.     Under the current unwieldy arrangements, each of the 93 services operates as independent entities and considerable administrative effort is required in the maintenance of each individual company.  Many common services are delivered to citizens across the country, so opportunities exist to improve service standards and consistency nationwide.  </p>  <p>  Reducing the administrative burden on local service managers and re-direction of valuable resources to front line services will improve services for those who rely on them.  </p>  <p>  In parallel, improved monitoring of service delivery will assist CIB in identifying weaknesses and assist regional services in getting appropriate and suitable supports in place.  </p>  <p>  A reduction in the number of individual, yet similar, CIS and MABS companies from 93 to 16 will better facilitate adherence to required governance standards, assist CIB in meeting its legislative responsibilities as direct funder and bring CIS and MABS organisations more into line with modern public service governance guidelines and requirements.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A PSC is issued once a person successfully completes a SAFE2 identity verification, i.e., has their identity verified to a substantial level of assurance.</p>  <p>  Section 263 of the Social Welfare Consolidation, Act (as amended) provides that:</p>  <p>  (a)  the following information is inscribed on the Public Services Card (PSC): forename, surname, Personal Public Service (PPS) Number, photograph, signature, card issue number and expiry date; and </p>  <p>  (b)  the following information is encoded on the chip of the PSC: forename, surname, date of birth, place of birth, sex, nationality, former surnames (if any), mother&rsquo;s former surnames (if any), photograph, signature, issue number of the PSC, and expiry date of the PSC. </p>  <p>  The above data (apart from the issue number and expiry date of the PSC) is part of the Public Service Identity (PSI) dataset as set out in section 262 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended).  Section 262 also sets out how the sharing and use of the PSI data is restricted to public service bodies specified in law or their agents.  Designation as a specified body requires primary legislation and as such can only be done by an Act of the Oireachtas.  I am not aware of any plans to specify any additional bodies. </p>  <p>  Section 262 also provides that PSI data can only be used by a specified body for authenticating the identity of an individual with whom it has a transaction and in performing its public functions insofar as those functions relate to the person concerned.  In addition, where a specified body collects any element of PSI data from a person, that information shall also be collected for the purpose of maintaining the person&rsquo;s public service identity.  Additional cover is provided by the Data Protection Acts as amended, Subsection 1 c iii of Section 2A, where personal data may be processed providing &ldquo;the processing is necessary for the performance of a function of the Government or a Minister of the Government&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The PSI data set is stored in enterprise class databases maintained in the Department&rsquo;s secure data centres.  The Department is committed to ensuring that customers&rsquo; personal data is securely held and used only for business purposes.  Access to the dataset is restricted to those members of staff who have a business need to reference the data and all accesses to the data are logged.  All members of staff must, on an annual basis, sign undertakings that they have read, and will act in accordance with, data protection policies and guidelines.  Failure to comply with these simple rules could leave them exposed to potentially serious allegations.  Where such allegations are substantiated, staff could face disciplinary action (including possible dismissal) and potential legal action including possible claim for compensation for distress/damage caused to the customer.  The Department ensures oversight in relation to data protection by keeping records of data accesses which are then subject to audit.  Twenty eight security audits have been undertaken within the last five years, twenty two of these are completed, and six are in progress.  Three Penetration tests, two Privacy Impact Assessments, and a Risk Assessment of the IS environment were also carried out during this timeframe.   The PSI data set is also stored by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the Single Customer View.  This system brings identity data together from a number of public bodies.  The Single Customer View database is stored in a secure government data centre.  Access to the data is tightly controlled and restricted to the government network.  All data access is logged and regularly audited.  The Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Aras Mhic Diarmada, Store Street, Dublin 1 is the Data Controller for the PSI dataset held by the Department including the Single Customer View.  As required under Section 16 of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 these details are listed on the Register maintained by the Data Protection Commissioner.</p>  <p>  Separately each specified body that collects or holds PSI data elements is the data controller in respect of their holding of the data on their own systems or databases.</p>  <p>  The PSC is produced in Ireland by an Irish-registered company called BCS.  It was a condition of the award of contract that all data and related services provision and operation be provided on-site in Ireland and subject to the jurisdiction of the Irish courts.  Once PSCs are personalised (i.e., the data is put on the card), the data used to personalise them is not retained by BCS but is destroyed as an automatic part of the personalisation process in accordance with advice provided by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  In addition the systems used in the card production have been subjected to audit by external experts.</p>  <p>  The PSC itself has multiple protection mechanisms, all of the highest current international standards, to prevent and detect tampering with the physical card and its contents.

An eligible employee is entitled to two weeks statutory redundancy payment for every year of service, plus a bonus week.  Compensation is based on the worker&rsquo;s length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week. In the event that an employer is unable to pay these entitlements due to financial difficulties, the Department can step in to make a payment from the Social Insurance Fund, as part of the redundancy and insolvency payments schemes.    The ceiling limit has been reviewed and changed on a number of occasions and the limit was last increased in January 2005 from &euro;507.90 to &euro;600 per week following agreement between the social partners in the &lsquo;Sustaining Progress&rsquo; talks during 2004. </p>  <p>  An increase in the ceiling limit would result in an additional cost to employers and also to the Social Insurance Fund.

In recognition of the crucial work undertaken in rural communities under the scheme, and as part of the social welfare budget package for 2018, I announced an increase in the weekly rate of payment for participants from March together with an additional 250 places to be rolled out this year. Taking into account the 500 additional places already allocated as part of the social welfare Budget 2017, this brings the total number of RSS places to 3,350, nearly 30% of an increase in the last two years.    The distribution of the 250 additional places to be allocated to the Implementing Bodies (IBs), who deliver the scheme at a local level on behalf of the Department, will be known within the next 2 weeks.  The places will be allocated taking a number of factors into consideration including the number of places already allocated, the demand for places in particular areas, work opportunities available within communities and the numbers of farmers and fishermen in receipt of income support.  </p>  <p>  While the IBs have responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the scheme, including recruitment, my Department will work closely with them to ensure that all places are filled along with the additional 250 places to be allocated. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, the scheme has played an important role in sustaining rural communities.  Participants have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing valuable work in their local communities.  In tandem, communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen and community groups have benefitted from the many projects undertaken through the scheme with minimal cost to the Exchequer.   </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The highest proportion of applications are submitted through the Passport Express postal channel.</p>  <p>  From 1 January &ndash; 16 February, the Passport Service received over 129,000 applications, an increase of 16% on the same period last year.  In order to respond to seasonal demands and anticipated application increases, the Passport Service has received sanction for 210 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) this year to be appointed to the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork. Training for the first intake of TCOs has already commenced, with a sizeable proportion already in place. All TCOs are expected to be fully trained and in place by the end of March at latest.</p>  <p>  The current average turnaround time for applications submitted through Passport Express is 16 working days.

The vast majority of online applications are being processed within 7 working days, well ahead of the target. The online service is fast, secure, convenient and available to adult citizens renewing their Irish passports from anywhere in the world. As take-up of the Online Passport Application service increases, it will enhance overall passport processing capacity and contribute to reducing turnaround times for all channels.</p>  <p>  The average turnaround time for postal applications submitted through the Passport Office in London is currently 4 weeks for renewals with a minimum of 7 weeks for first-time applications due to additional security checks.  Applicants resident in Great Britain also have the option of submitting Passport Express applications through two selected post offices in Liverpool and Glasgow with applications submitted through this channel taking an average 17 working days to process. </p>  <p>  Applications submitted through Irish Embassies and Consulates are currently taking a minimum 6 weeks to process from the date the application is registered at the Passport Office. Delivery times will vary depending on the location of the applicant. I would urge applicants wishing to renew their passports who reside overseas, including Great Britain, to avail of the online passport renewal service where possible.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service operates a counter service in both the Dublin (Mount Street) and Cork offices where applicants who need their passport application processed in timeframes shorter than those offered by the Passport Express and online facility can be accommodated in certain circumstances. </p>  <p>  In all cases, applicants should not book travel until in possession of a valid passport and should allow plenty of time for a passport to issue in case any problems with the application arise in the course of processing.

It is therefore critical to the performance and reputation of the organisation that its staff operate to the highest standards. Sexual exploitation and abuse by UN staff, whose fundamental objective is to protect and care for innocent civilians, is absolutely unacceptable.</p>  <p>  When attending the opening of the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly last September, I participated in the high-level meeting on the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse convened by the UN Secretary General, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres. I welcome Secretary General Guterres&rsquo; appointment of Jane Connors as the UN&rsquo;s first Victims&rsquo; Rights Advocate for victims of sexual exploitation and abuse. Ireland fully supports the placing of the rights and dignity of victims of sexual exploitation and abuse at the forefront of the UN&rsquo;s prevention and response efforts in this area.</p>  <p>  Secretary General Guterres has also revised UN policies on investigations and disciplinary processes, and strengthened protections for those who report harassment. The UN Secretary General has also launched a gender parity strategy which will address gender and power imbalances that lie at the root of harassment.</p>  <p>  Mr. Guterres has also made clear that sexual exploitation and abuse is a problem of the entire United Nations and is not restricted to peacekeeping.  He has acknowledged that the majority of the cases of sexual exploitation and abuse are committed by the civilian organisations of the United Nations, and not in peacekeeping operations.</p>  <p>  In this respect Mr. Guterres has requested the UN&rsquo;s Agencies, Funds and Programmes, which carry out vital work in the field, to adopt new measures and strengthen existing ones to better prevent, detect, report and take action against personnel, who commit what he rightly describes as inexcusable and abhorrent acts. I recall that the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations provides that privileges and immunities are granted to officials and experts in the interests of the United Nations and not for the personal benefit of the individuals themselves. These privileges and immunities are rightly accorded to allow UN staff members to carry out their work in often difficult circumstances. The Secretary-General has &ldquo;the right and the duty to waive the immunity of any official [or expert] in any case where, in his opinion, the immunity would impede the course of justice and can be waived without prejudice to the interests of the United Nations. In the case of the Secretary-General, the Security Council shall have the right to waive immunity.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Any case of exploitation or abuse, any case where the trust placed in the UN by all of us is broken, is one case too many. The UN can only meet its responsibilities as a force of good for our shared world if its staff and actions are beyond reproach. The UN must therefore have the systems and policies in place which provide transparency and accountability, and Ireland will continue to support the Secretary General as he implements such policies.  </p></reply>

Its focus is on the immediate regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome. It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern. This work is therefore providing baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations, including in regard to transition arrangements and the future relationship.  It also takes account of the planning being undertaken at EU level by the new Commission Preparedness Unit, which is issuing information notes aimed at different business sectors.</p><p>Distinct but closely related work on the economic and sectoral impacts of various Brexit scenarios continues to be taken forward by individual Departments and agencies, as well as by stakeholder organisations, academics and others.  The most recent major publication in this regard is the report released last week on <i>Strategic Implications for Ireland arising from changing EU-UK Trading Relations</i>, an independent expert study commissioned by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p><p>This report provides analysis of the likely impact of various Brexit scenarios on the Irish economy as a whole and on key sectors. It will help in the further preparation of our priorities for the negotiations and the consideration of possible additional mitigation actions over and above the many which are already in train. A number of further important studies are underway with a view to publication in the coming weeks and months. </p><p>The outcome of the European Council (Article 50) on 23 March should provide a better picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations. This will provide a basis on which the Government will publish a new paper in the coming months on our approach to the negotiations, our latest assessment of the economic and sectoral challenges posed by Brexit, as well as those of a regulatory and operational character, and our responses to them. </p></reply>

Crucially, there is a guarantee that a hard border, including any physical infrastructure and associated checks and controls, will be avoided, and there are commitments as to how this will be achieved.  Avoiding a hard border is described as an &ldquo;overarching requirement.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  In the event that it is not possible to resolve the border issue as part of a wider EU-UK future relationship agreement, which has always been and remains the Government&rsquo;s preference, or through specific solutions proposed by the British Government, there will be a firm back stop in the UK&rsquo;s commitment that it will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Customs Union and Single Market which support North South cooperation, the all-island economy and protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts. Moreover, such an arrangement must be compatible with the UK&rsquo;s guarantee of avoiding a hard border.</p>  <p>  These very strong political commitments and guarantees must now be reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement, which will be legally binding and must be agreed before the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU on 29 March 2019.  Detailed and intensive engagement between Irish officials and the Taskforce is now under way as the Taskforce prepares a first draft of the Withdrawal Agreement, which on approval by the Council (Article 50) will be the basis of negotiations with the UK.  </p>  <p>  This engagement includes work on elaborating the mechanisms to ensure implementation and oversight of the arrangements, as referred to in paragraph 51 of the Joint Progress Report.  Such mechanisms will need to be effective and workable.</p>  <p>  Moreover, the additional negotiating Guidelines adopted by the European Council (Article 50) on 15 December make clear that negotiations in phase two can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken in the first phase of the negotiations are respected in full and translated into legal terms as quickly as possible through the elaboration of the formal Withdrawal Agreement, including with regard to the Irish-specific issues.</p>  <p>  I and my officials continue to set forward Ireland&rsquo;s position on these issues at EU level through the General Affairs Council (Art. 50) and the relevant preparatory bodies as well as through bilateral contacts with Michel Barnier and the EU Taskforce and EU27 counterparts. My ongoing programme of bilateral engagement has, most recently, included my meetings with Foreign Minister Linas Linkevi&egrave;ius of Lithuania and Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano of Italy, which took place on 13 and 14 February respectively. </p></reply>

Credit Servicing Firms are typically firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities. </p><p>Under the 2015 Act, if the firm who bought loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm, then the loans must be serviced by a &lsquo;<b>credit servicing firm&rsquo;</b>. Loans can be sold by regulated entities to entities that are not regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (the Central Bank).  </p><p>Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;. This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various Statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank.  <s></s></p><p>The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) is a key part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection framework.  It is a statutory Code first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013.  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms with each borrower by reference to that borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner by reference to that&rsquo;s borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances.</p><p>Regulated entities, including credit servicing firms servicing loans on behalf of unregulated loan owners, are all required to comply with the CCMA.  The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears, and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  It sets out the MARP, a four-step process that regulated entities must follow:  </p><p>Step 1: Communicate with borrower;</p><p>Step 2: Gather financial information;</p><p>Step 3: Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and</p><p>Step 4: Propose a resolution</p><p>Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the solutions they provide, which may differ from firm to firm.  The CCMA includes requirements that arrangements be sustainable and based on a full assessment of the individual circumstances of the borrower and that repossession be used only as a last resort.  The CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered.  A regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where the firm has made every reasonable effort under the CCMA to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower or his/her nominated representative, and the specific timeframes set out in the CCMA have been adhered to or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.  </p></reply>

However, if the supply includes the installation of the system then the reduced rate of 13.5% may apply, subject to the two thirds rule, which requires that to benefit from the 13.5% rate the value of the goods cannot exceed two thirds of the total amount of the supply. </p><p>The directive does not permit a rebate or refund of VAT charged to a private person on the sale of a security system and there is no scope under the directive to introduce or amend a Refund Order to include it.</p><p>However, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that relief may be available in respect of the installation of a security system in the home of a senior citizen under the Home Renovation Initiative, HRI.  This provides income tax relief in the amount of 13.5% of the cost of certain repairs, renovations and improvements, carried out on a person's main residence.  The relief is granted by way of a credit against income tax over the two years following the year in which the works are paid for with the credit split evenly between the two years.  </p><p>The key features of the scheme are that:-</p><p>- The works must be carried our by a tax compliant contractor;</p><p>- The works must be liable to VAT at 13.5%; </p><p>- The works must be carried prior to 31 December 2018;</p><p>- Local Property Tax payments must be up to date in respect of the property;</p><p>- The cost of the works must be greater than &euro;4,405 and not more than &euro;30,000 (both figures exclusive of Value Added Tax).

The European requirements may supersede the Irish requirements in certain circumstances, such as for significant institutions as outlined in 1.1 below.</p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland operates a risk-based framework for the supervision of regulated firms.  Institutions are categorised based on the greatest impact on financial stability and the consumer as follows: high impact<b>, </b>medium-high impact, medium-low impact and low impact. </p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland has issued sector specific corporate governance requirements, which vary dependent on the impact of the institution.</p><p><b>1. Directorship Limits</b></p><p>All Central Bank of Ireland corporate governance requirements require firms to ensure that each member of the board has sufficient time to devote to the role of director and associated responsibilities. The board shall indicate a time commitment expected from directors in letters of appointment. </p><p>1.1  Credit Institutions </p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate governance requirements for credit institutions limits the number of directorships held by directors of credit institutions as follows:</p><p>For high impact designated credit institutions and insurance undertakings, a director can hold the following directorships:</p><p>- up to three financial directorships (i.e. directorships in companies or groups of companies which are credit institutions or insurance undertakings); and </p><p>- up to five non-financial directorships (i.e. any other type of company, which is not a credit institution or an insurance undertaking).</p><p>For non-high Impact designated credit institutions, a director can hold the following directorships:</p><p>- up to five financial directorships; and</p><p>- up to eight non-financial directorships.</p><p>Significant Credit Institutions</p><p>In a European context, credit institutions designated as &lsquo;significant&rsquo; for the purposes of the Capital Requirements Directive(&lsquo;CRD IV&rsquo;) [S.I. 158/2014] must ensure that members of the management body shall not hold more than one of the following combinations of directorships at the same time:</p><p>- one executive directorship with two non-executive directorships;</p><p>- four non-executive directorships.</p><p>The following shall count as a single directorship:</p><p>- executive or non-executive directorships held within the same group;</p><p>- executive or non-executive directorships held within - </p><p>-  institutions which are members of the same institutional protection scheme provided that the conditions set out in Article 113(7) of the Capital Requirements Regulation are fulfilled, or </p><p>- undertakings, including non-financial entities, in which the institution holds a qualifying holding.</p><p>In considering and/or proposing director appointments, the board shall assess and document its consideration of possible conflicts of interest among its members, including, but not limited to personal relationships, business relationships and common directorships among its members or proposed members. </p><p>Appointments shall not proceed where possible conflicts of interest may emerge which are significant to the overall work of the board.  Directors shall not participate in any decision making/discussion where a reasonably perceived potential conflict of interest exists. </p><p>Directorships in organisations which do not pursue predominantly commercial objectives shall not count.</p><p>Article 91(6) of CRD IV [Regulation 79(10) and 79(11) of S.I. 158/2014] permits the Central Bank to authorise directors of significant institutions to hold one additional non-executive directorship.</p><p>1.2  Insurance Undertakings</p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate governance requirements for insurance undertakings impose the same directorship limits as those outlined for credit institutions at 1.1 above.</p><p>1.3  Captive insurance and captive reinsurance undertakings</p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate Governance requirements for captive insurance and captive reinsurance undertaking limits the number of directorships held by directors as follows: </p><p>(a) Limited by the amount of time required to properly carry out the role and functions of a director in that particular captive; and </p><p>(b) Subject to an overall limit of 25 directorships, regardless of whether the directorship is held in a captive company or a company which is not a captive. </p><p>1.4  Fund Management Companies</p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland fund management companies guidance addresses director time commitments and sets a risk indicator in terms of a joint test of (a) having more than 20 directorships and (b) having an aggregate professional time commitment in excess of 2000 hours.</p><p><b>2. Conflicts of Interest </b></p><p>2.1  Credit Institutions </p><p>Chapter 7 of the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate governance requirements for credit institutions, requires the following:</p><p>It also requires the board to establish a documented &lsquo;conflict of interest&rsquo; policy for its members and where conflict of interests arise the board shall ensure that they are noted in the minutes. In addition, if on-going conflicts of interest arise, consideration shall be given to changing the membership of the board.</p><p>2.2  Insurance Undertakings</p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate governance requirements for insurance undertakings impose the same conflicts of interest requirements as those outlined for credit institutions at 2.1 above.</p><p>2.3  Captive Insurance and Captive Reinsurance Undertakings</p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate governance requirements for captive insurance and captive reinsurance undertakings impose the same conflicts of interest requirements as those outlined for credit institutions at 2.1 above.</p><p>2.4  Fund Management Companies</p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland fund management companies guidance states that individuals with multiple directorships should consider the conflicts which may arise when sitting on a number of boards and the corporate interconnectivity that is created.  Conflicts which may occur between individuals with full-time positions in a service provider to the board should also be considered and the most appropriate action taken.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to give additional consideration to company law requirements with regard to directorships of financial institutions, which are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that the Irish Funds Industry Association issued a corporate governance code for collective investment schemes and management companies in 2012: <i>.</i></p><p>In calculating the number of directorships held, the Central Bank excludes directorships held in the public interest on a voluntary and <i>pro bono</i>basis provided that such directorships shall not interfere with the director&rsquo;s ability to fulfil properly his or her role and functions as a director of an insurance undertaking.  At the time of appointment, any such directorships shall be notified to the Central Bank.

In May 2017, consultation paper 109, CP109, was published which consulted on a number of potential changes to the investment framework.  CP109 outlined the Central Bank&rsquo;s view that any changes to the investment framework for credit unions should reflect the fact that it is the savings of credit union members, which can be withdrawn on demand, that will be invested by credit unions and that the risk profile of credit union investment portfolios should reflect this.  </p><p>Taking account of the resolution framework introduced under the Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive, BRRD, CP109 outlined an intended change to the definition of bank bonds to clarify that bonds that are subordinated to any unsecured creditor including senior bank bonds issued by a credit institution do not fall within the definition of &ldquo;bank bonds&rdquo; set out in the regulations.  It also outlined that credit unions will need to ensure that they confirm that instruments are not subordinated debt instruments prior to making an investment to ensure that they remain in compliance with investment regulations.</p><p>On 1 February 2018, the Central Bank published the feedback statement on CP109 and amending investment and liquidity regulations for credit unions.  These amending regulations will commence on 1 March 2018.  These regulations reflect a change to the definition of bank bonds which precludes investment by a credit union in bonds that are subordinated to any other liability of a credit institution, including senior bank bonds, in recognition of their risk profile and complexity.  This preclusion for credit unions reflects the potential implications for credit unions should such instruments be written down or converted to equity upon the failure of a credit institution. </p><p>Credit unions will continue to be permitted to invest in senior bank bonds and the Central Bank understand that a number of European credit institutions are likely to continue to issue senior bonds.  Additionally, as minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities, MREL, &lsquo;buffers&rsquo; are established it is expected that domestic credit institutions will resume issuance of senior bank bonds in the future given the lower associated funding cost relative to subordinated bank bonds. </p><p>The Central Bank has informed me that, notwithstanding the credit rating of bank bonds generally, it is not deemed appropriate for credit unions to be holders of instruments such as subordinated bank bonds specifically designed to absorb losses in a resolution scenario as it would directly expose them to burden sharing in line with EU Commission policy, and has consequences for the resolvability of issuing credit institutions raising the risk of taxpayer bail outs. </p><p>Communication from the Commission on the application, from 1 August 2013, of State aid rules to support measures in favour of banks in the context of the financial crisis, &lsquo;Banking Communication&rsquo; (2013/C 216/01).</p></reply>

CP109 proposed the reduction in the counterparty limit from 25% to 20% of total investments to assist the objective of increased levels of diversification in investment portfolios. </p>  <p>  Feedback received to the consultation indicated that credit unions did not view it as an appropriate time to reduce the counterparty limit, citing the current low interest rate environment and the exit of certain counterparties from the market as challenges to meeting a reduced counterparty limit.  </p>  <p>  Taking account of the feedback received through submissions to CP109, the Central Bank undertook further analysis on credit union sector investment counterparties to understand further the likely impact which a reduction in the counterparty limit would have.  This analysis indicated that for the majority of credit unions a reduction in the counterparty limit will not pose a significant challenge.  </p>  <p>  On 1 February 2018, the Central Bank published the feedback statement on CP109 and amending investment and liquidity regulations for credit unions.  These amending regulations will commence on 1 March 2018.  These regulations include a reduced counterparty limit of 20% of total investments for credit unions.  Transitional arrangements have been extended which will provide a period of two years from commencement of the regulations for credit unions to become compliant with the reduced counterparty limit.  In addition, credit unions will be permitted to hold to maturity any fixed term investments which they hold at commencement of the regulations which result in them being non-compliant with the reduced counterparty limit. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank have informed me that it is its view that the reduction in the counterparty limit is appropriate to assist in driving diversification in investment portfolios and, taking account of the additional counterparties which will be available to credit unions as a result of changes to the permitted classes of investments being introduced.  Additionally, the changes being introduced to the liquidity framework for credit unions and the increases to concentration limits for certain permitted classes of investments will assist credit unions in meeting this requirement.  Further detail on these changes is included within the feedback statement on CP109 published on the Central Bank website.</p></reply>

It states that a credit union shall manage its investments to ensure that those investments do not, taking account of the nature, scale, complexity and risk profile of the credit union, involve undue risk to members' savings and for that purpose, before making an investment a credit union shall assess the potential impact on the credit union, including the impact on the liquidity and financial position of the credit union.  Section 43(3) provides the Central Bank with the power to make regulations in relation to investments.</p>  <p>  The current investment regulations for credit unions are contained in the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016.  In 2017, the Central Bank undertook a review of the investment framework for credit unions.  In May 2017, Consultation Paper 109, CP109, was published which consulted on a number of potential changes to the investment framework. Following completion of a public and statutory consultation process, the Central Bank published a feedback statement on CP109 and amending investment and liquidity regulations for credit unions.  On 1 March 2018, new investment regulations will be introduced for credit unions through the commencement of the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations 2018.  These new investment regulations introduce three additional investment classes for credit unions, supranational bonds, corporate bonds and investments, in tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies, AHBs, along with associated limits and requirements.  Investment in tier 3 AHBs has a differentiated concentration limit dependent on the asset size of the credit union. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that it views that these new regulations are effective and proportionate for credit unions and that there is a need for credit unions to fully understand the risks associated with all investments, ensure that they are in line with the risk appetite of the credit union and comply with all legislative and regulatory requirements. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated that it will undertake and publish analysis of credit union sector investments, two years post commencement of the amending regulations to assess and analyse the actual impact which the changes to the investment framework have had.</p></reply>

This relief applies a reduced rate of stamp duty of 1% to transfers of farmland between certain blood relatives provided certain conditions are met.  Since the enactment of the Finance Act 2017 on 25 December 2017, there is no age limit for consanguinity relief.  For transfers executed prior to that date, it was a requirement that the person transferring the land be under 67 years of age. No age limit applied in relation to the person receiving the land and this continues to be the case. </p>  <p>In addition to being a relative of the transferor, the person to whom the land is transferred must either farm the land or lease it to someone who farms it for a period of not less than 6 years.  The person farming the land must do so on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits.  A further condition is that the person farming the land must devote at least 50% of his or her normal working time to farming or be the holder of one of the agricultural qualifications set out in Schedule 2, 2A or 2B to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act (SDCA) 1999.   </p>  <p>  Another stamp duty relief known as &lsquo;young trained farmer&rsquo; relief allows for full relief from stamp duty but imposes an age condition on the transferee.  There is no relationship requirement for this relief.  To qualify for this relief the transferee must, on the date of execution of the instrument of transfer, be under 35 years of age and hold one of the agricultural qualifications set out in Schedule 2, 2A or 2B to the SDCA 1999.   As the transferee in this case is aged 37, a transfer of the farm would not qualify for &lsquo;young trained farmer&rsquo; relief.</p></reply>

The individual is therefore entitled to an increase in respect of the qualified adult dependent.</p>  <p>  Pursuant to section 19 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the State Pension (Contributory), including an increase for the qualifying adult dependent, is chargeable to income tax.  Disagreement arose between the individual referred to by the Deputy and Revenue on the issue of who, for the purpose of the Taxes Acts, is chargeable to tax on the amount of the increase in respect of the qualifying adult dependent.  The individual in this case contended that the qualified adult dependent should be taxed separately on the &ldquo;increase&rdquo; whereas Revenue contends that there is only one social welfare pension, given that the Social Welfare Act provides for an increase in the individuals pension and does not therefore provide for a separate pension for the adult dependent.   As a consequence the Revenue position is that the individual is chargeable on the full amount of the pension including any increase.</p>  <p>  The individual in question appealed the matter and an Appeal Commissioner found in his favour.  Once an appeal has been determined by an Appeal Commissioner, either the taxpayer or Revenue may express &ldquo;dissatisfaction&rdquo; with the decision as being in error on a point of law and require the Appeal Commissioner to state and sign a case for the opinion of the High Court on the determination of the appeal.  I understand that Revenue has expressed dissatisfaction in this case and that a Case Stated has been submitted to the High Court.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that in accordance with its customer service charter it administers the law fairly, reasonably and consistently and seeks to collect no more than the amount of tax due.  Furthermore it is committed to the principle of treating all taxpayers equally.  In this regard, Revenue also advises that any decision to pursue an appeal case to the courts following a determination by an Appeal Commissioner is only taken after a comprehensive analysis of the issues involved and consideration of the precedential nature of the point of law in question.  It is Revenue&rsquo;s duty to seek to bring certainty to important points of tax law and this necessitates bringing cases to the High Court where it is of the view that a decision of an Appeal Commissioner is in error.</p></reply>

As part of the examination framework, where customer detriment has been identified, the Central Bank has clearly articulated its expectations of lenders to provide appropriate redress and compensation to impacted customers in line with the Central Bank prescribed "Principles for Redress".</p>  <p>  Together with redress and compensation, the "Principles for Redress" also requires lenders to provide impacted customers with an additional upfront payment  which they can use, if they so wish, to pay for independent advice regarding the adequacy of their lender&rsquo;s offer.  This additional payment is to be commensurate with the complexity of the advice required by the impacted customer depending on the individual circumstances of the impacted customer's case.  Importantly customers can also accept the redress and compensation offered and still make an appeal to the appeals panels required to be established by lenders under the "Principles for Redress".  Customers&rsquo; rights to make appeals to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman and through the courts are also preserved.</p></reply>

These redress principles, along with various supplemental guidance, clearly set out the Central Banks expectations of lenders to provide appropriate redress and compensation to affected customers where tracker mortgage related issues are identified.  An important part of the Examination Framework is the establishment of Independent Appeals Panels so that customers have further recourse options if they are dissatisfied with any aspect of the redress and compensation offers made by lenders.</p><p>The Central Bank has set out guidance for the governance, process and operation of the Appeals Panels. The guidance (please see relevant links: </p><p><b>Redress principles</b><b>link </b></p><p><i></i>. </p><p><b>Appeals guidance link </b></p><p><i>).</i></p><p>provides, inter alia, that where a lender decides to impose limits on the powers of Appeals Panels:</p><p>- that lenders will inform customers of such limits;</p><p>- that limits on the powers of Appeals panels must be reasonable and must not seek to undermine the independence of the Appeal Panel to make awards of additional redress and;</p><p>- where the Appeals Panel determines an award is greater than the limit specified is warranted given the specific circumstances of the case, the Appeals process must provide for a mechanism where such awards can be made. (e.g. refer to lender for sign-off by the lender's Tracker Steering Committee/Board).</p><p>Nevertheless, in respect of the lenders in which I have a shareholding interest the following information has been provided to me by those lenders:</p><p><b>PTSB</b>- &quot;The governing rules for both the Customer Appeals Panel (CAP) and the Independent Review Panel (IRP) include the limits applicable to each panel and the process to apply in awarding amounts in excess of these limits:</p><p>- The CAP can direct the Bank to pay an amount of additional compensation to a customer up to &euro;35,000. In the event that the CAP feels that a customer has suffered a serious or severe detriment as a result of the Bank&rsquo;s failures which justifies an award over &euro;35,000, then the CAP can instead of making an award, refer the appeal to the IRP for a determination as the IRP has a higher awarding limit (detailed below);</p><p>- The IRP can direct the Bank to make payment of compensation up to a sum of &euro;50,000 (excluding the compensation amount offered in the Redress and Compensation Offer) for non-loss of ownership customers (i.e. legal customers and those referred by the CAP above);</p><p>- For Loss of Ownership customers, the IRP can direct the Bank to pay an amount of additional compensation to a customer up to &euro;250,000. If the IRP determine that a loss of ownership customer is entitled to an award in excess of &euro;250,000 then they issue an IRP Recommendation that the Bank should pay an additional amount exceeding &euro;250,000. The IRP Recommendation of any amount in excess of &euro;250,000 must be approved by the PTSB Board before this excess payment is made to the customer.  To date no such cases have arisen.&quot;</p><p><b>Bank of Ireland </b>- &quot;The appeals panel commenced its work in January. There is no upper limit on the amount of compensation that may be awarded. There is a Governance structure in place which does involve thresholds within which the Appeals Panels can operate without reference to the Tracker Steering committee. To date, there have been no instances to date where the Panels have recommended compensation in excess of the thresholds.&quot;</p><p><b>AIB -</b>&quot;The Independent Appeals Panel established by AIB, can award additional compensation(inclusive of the original Redress and Compensation payment) of up to &euro;300,000 (if the mortgaged property is a home) or up to &euro;150,000 (if the mortgaged property is a buy-to-let investment property). AIB will review any awards in excess of the limit on a case by case basis.&quot;</p></reply>

This is a national scheme of humanitarian assistance, targeting aid at those worst affected properties, for which there are no alternative feasible measures. </p><p>The Government decision confirmed that a homeowner had to meet a number of conditions to be eligible for assistance under this scheme, including:</p><p>- That floodwater entered and damaged the building during the relevant dates such as to render it uninhabitable.</p><p>- That the property was the homeowner&rsquo;s primary residence at the time of the floods.</p><p>- That the affected property must have a significant probability of the recurrence of the flood depth, duration or frequency on a scale that could cause further serious and similar damage to the home.</p><p>- That the property is not due to or may not benefit from a planned or possible future major, minor or individual flood defence scheme.</p><p>- That the property may not be protected adequately from being flooded in the future, at an economically feasible cost, through other flood mitigation works including minor works, individual property protection or other possible measures that can be considered at this time.</p><p>- That the homeowner is unable to obtain flood risk insurance.</p><p>The OPW is working with each of the Local Authorities, using their extensive and detailed local knowledge, to consider if homes that have been flooded during the event may benefit from a known or possible engineering solution.  A total of 75 homes are currently under consideration in this category.  </p><p>Where it has been established that there is no viable engineering solution at this stage, the Local Authorities have contacted homeowners known to have flooded during the period in question, asking them to make contact with the OPW for information on the Scheme and they are given an opportunity to formally create an Expression of Interest. </p><p>In addition, homeowners had the opportunity to express an interest in the Scheme directly with the Office of Public Works, before 28th July 2017. To date, a total of 77 expressions of interest have been received by the OPW. </p><p>All Expressions of Interest are assessed at Stage 1 to determine whether or not the home meets all of the criteria for eligibility to the Scheme.  Those homes that meet the criteria are invited to a meeting following which they may be requested to make an application form to progress for consideration at Stage 2 of the process.  Where they do not meet the criteria, homeowners are notified that their home will receive no further consideration for the Scheme.  </p><p>The numbers of homes within the process are changing regularly as homeowners make contact with the OPW and as assessments completed.  The most up-to-date position is as follows:</p><p>- The OPW met with 8 homeowners in December 2017.</p><p>- A further 17 homeowners have confirmed attendance at meetings with the OPW, commencing during the week beginning 19th February, 2018.</p><p>Given that the overall number of homes currently under consideration for the Scheme is relatively low, there is a possibility that individual homeowners could be identified by providing data on a County level.  In the event that numbers drop as the process evolves, there will be an even greater risk of identifying individual homeowners associated with this process.  For that reason, it is not possible to provide figures at County level as requested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans. </p>  <p>  The CFRAM Programme focussed on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding.  The proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified for AFAs are outlined in the Flood Risk Management Plans.  </p>  <p>  The Draft Flood Risk Management Plans were published for public consultation in 2016 and a significant volume of submissions were received for consideration.  In Summer 2017, the OPW finalised all Plans and each Plan was submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (D/PER) for an independent review of the environmental assessments.  Having now received the outcomes of the independent review of the environmental assessments for the Flood Risk Management Plans, the Commissioners of Public Works will in the coming weeks submit the Flood Risk Management Plans to the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for approval. </p>  <p>  Following approval by the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, the Commissioners will send a copy of the Plans to the local authorities for their consideration, in accordance with the statutory requirements.</p>  <p>  The Carysfort-Maretimo area has been studied as part of the East CFRAM Programme.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-20a.378.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022000064#WRG02200"><p>The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start.  I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers.  The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.</p>  <p>  As a result of the changes I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511, at a cost of over &euro;200 million across the public service.</p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010.  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. </p>  <p>  A commitment is included in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 to consider the issue of newly qualified pay within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.  That process has now commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.  The three teacher unions attended that first meeting.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that within 3 months of the passing of the Act, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service. </p></reply>

SUSI implements a flexible repayment policy with minimum instalment amounts and timeframes that are designed to be as student-friendly as possible.  SUSI actively manages all overpayments as debts due to the State on this basis and continues to engage with students to seek their recovery.  The repayments policy is published to the SUSI website at www.susi.ie.</p>  <p>  Grant applications are subject to extensive quality controls and system checks within the SUSI assessment process.  Grant renewal applications are also reviewed on a continuous basis.  As part of this process, it can come to attention of SUSI that an incorrect rate of grant was awarded in a prior year, or that the circumstances that determine a student&rsquo;s eligibility have changed.  In all of these cases, the original grant application is reviewed and a revised decision is issued.  </p>  <p>  I have been advised that the student to which the Deputy refers, submitted grant applications for the 2012-13 and 2013-14 academic years.  Following a review of the student&rsquo;s grant applications, the original grant awarded for both application years was revised based on a review of reckonable income in line with the income threshold provisions of the Student Grant Schemes.</p></reply>

However, the nature of the assessment process undertaken by SUSI means that there is a risk that some students may be awarded maintenance grants and/or fee grants for which they are not eligible.</p>  <p>  Where overpayments do occur, SUSI treats the overpayment as a debt to the Exchequer and seeks to ensure that all such payments are recovered from the student.  This approach is consistent with the general policy and principle regarding the recovery of debt, as set out in the Student Support Act 2011. </p>  <p>  When an overpayment is identified, SUSI will write to the student to inform him/her of the decision to vary the grant amount and to advise that recovery (repayment) of the overpayment will be necessary.  A further letter will then issue to formally advise of the overpayment amount and to request repayment.  This letter includes a Grant Repayment Option Form which requests details of the preferred repayment option. </p>  <p>  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI.  Applicants may also appeal against decisions made by SUSI in relation to overpayments. </p>  <p>  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by an appeals officer in SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal may be submitted to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe.  Such appeals can be made by the appellant on line via www.studentgrantappeals.ie.</p>  <p>  Some difficulties were encountered by SUSI in its first year of operations when processes and procedures were being rolled out for the first time.  In light of the circumstances in which these overpayments incurred, the approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was obtained for write-off of these specific overpayments as an exceptional measure in March 2016.</p>  <p>  Since 2013, SUSI has made significant improvements to its internal control systems and procedures to enhance control and reduce the potential of future overpayments occurring.  These include comprehensive training for new staff as well as updates for existing staff on new scheme rules, and improved quality control procedures including random sample checking of ongoing grant applications by SUSI&rsquo;s Quality Assurance Team.  SUSI has also strengthened data sharing processes with other relevant agencies such as the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and the Revenue Commissioners, as a means of ensuring significantly improved accuracy when assessing grant eligibility.</p></reply>

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools. </p><p>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy.  </p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Educational Training Board or to the Secretary General of this Department.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is a separate independent statutory body whose functions include planning and co-ordinating the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs in conjunction with schools and the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports as required.  The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need.</p><p>The NCSE&rsquo;s SENO responsibility includes planning and co-ordinating the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, including supporting children and parents in identifying school placement options and resource needs.  Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs.</p><p>In dealing with parents of children with special educational needs, SENOs support children and their parents in identifying school placement options and resource needs; keeping parents informed of what resourcing decisions are being made on their child&rsquo;s behalf.  The SENO will also discuss any concerns that parents have about the present or future educational needs of their child.  Contact details for SENOs is available at <i></i>.</p><p>The NCSE has advised that the local SENO is working with the school, HSE representatives and the parent to secure a school placement for the child referred to by the Deputy. </p></reply>

These areas were all stable in terms of population growth, so no new school places were required.  However sufficient demand for more choice emerged in 28 areas, including in Tramore, New Ross, Trim, Tuam and Castlebar. </p>  <p>  In the majority of the 28 areas surveyed where sufficient demand emerged, the level of parental demand for a wider choice indicated a size of a four classroom school being required to accommodate such a level of demand.</p>  <p>  Under the patronage divesting process, a school could be opened where a school building became, or was due to become available as a result of an amalgamation/closure of an existing school.  In some areas, in responding to demand for diversity where existing patrons were unable make school properties available, the Department also included an examination of properties held in public ownership.</p>  <p>  In order to facilitate the opening of these schools, their initial establishment, as with most new schools, has been in temporary start-up accommodation, pending a permanent school building being made available.  All schools, irrespective of their location, have to operate within their available accommodation and manage annual pupil intake accordingly.</p>  <p>  The initial establishment of these schools as four-classroom schools and the need to be cognisant of managing the available accommodation has been reflected in my Department&rsquo;s engagement with the patron body of the schools, Educate Together.  Indeed, a case has been submitted by Educate Together to my Department to further expand Tramore ETNS, New Ross ETNS, Trim ETNS, Tuam ETNS and Castlebar ETNS and this is currently under consideration.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently carrying out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to identify areas of demographic growth and determine where additional school accommodation is needed in order to plan for school provision nationwide and this work is almost complete.  In this context, the outcome of the nationwide demographic exercises will input into consideration of the case submitted by Educate Together. </p>  <p>  I have announced a new Patronage Reconfiguration process, which will accelerate the delivery of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools, to reach 400 live schools by 2030.

I have attached particular importance to engagement at political and institutional level on our Brexit agenda.  Last year I met my former UK counterpart, Justine Greening MP and I look forward to an occasion in the near future to meet her successor, the recently appointed Secretary of State for Education, Damian Hinds MP to continue our bilateral engagement on issues of common concern, including Brexit.</p>  <p>  I have also had meetings with the former Minister of State for Exiting the EU, David Jones MP, the UK&rsquo;s Opposition Spokesperson on Brexit, Keir Starmer MP, as well as members of the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain. </p>  <p>  I attended the Education Council in Brussels last week and participated in policy debates, one of which will address the European Council conclusion from December on the proposed European Education Area.  At this event I met with the head of the UK government delegation Nick Gibb MP, Minister of State for School Standards, and took the opportunity to raise Brexit issues with him and to contribute positively to the debate on how Europe can remain at the forefront of excellence in education and research.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department continue to work closely with their counterparts in the Department for Education, London on a range of issues including establishing a shared understanding between Ireland and the United Kingdom of the rights to access education in each other&rsquo;s jurisdictions which are facilitated and supported by the Common Travel Area (CTA) and associated rights arrangements.</p></reply>

The identification model is applied in a uniform way across the entire school system. 79 schools were included in DEIS for the first time and 30 schools were identified as needing extra supports which were allocated with effect from September 2017.  These schools were those identified as having the highest levels of disadvantage in the pupil cohort of the school.

My Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.  The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.  </p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>-  Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools</p><p>-  Extending the capacity of a school or schools</p><p>-  Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>For school planning purposes, the Saggart and Citywest areas reside within the Tallaght and Newcastle-Rathcoole School Planning Areas.</p><p>The new 1,000 pupil post-primary school referred to by the Deputy in the Kingswood area of Tallaght opened in September 2016 to serve the needs of the students in the school planning area, which includes the Citywest area and a building project for this school is commenced construction in August 2017.  </p><p>In addition, a new post-primary school is due to open in 2018 in the Firhouse/Oldbawn school planning area, which is adjacent to the Tallaght area.  When fully developed, this school will provide 1,000 pupil places.</p><p>Nationwide demographic exercises involving all school planning areas, including Tallaght and Newcastle-Rathcoole, which will determine where additional school accommodation will be needed in the future, is currently ongoing and this work is almost complete.</p></reply>

This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement.  Separately, a new preparedness unit in the Commission is considering EU-level responses. </p>  <p>  All this work provides a baseline scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations.  In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.  Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force.  The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  These guidelines &ndash; as well as further clarity on the UK position, which has been sought by the European Council &ndash; will provide a clearer picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s contingency planning framework is firmly grounded in the extensive work and outreach that has already been undertaken by individual Departments and agencies, as well as by stakeholder organisations, academics and others.  My own Department contributed fully to the preparation of the education components of that framework. </p>  <p>  Our work has been facilitated by the International Unit of my Department which, under the leadership of an Assistant Secretary General, has been given overall responsibility for co-ordinating our response to Brexit.  In discharging its Brexit-related functions, the International Unit participates in the Inter-Departmental Senior Officials Group which oversees the coordination of the Government&rsquo;s response to the outcome of the UK referendum, and supports the Cabinet Committee on the European Union including Brexit.  This is further underpinned by the Unit's active engagement with other Departments in Brexit Workgroups on Brexit Coordination; the Economy and Sectoral Issues; the Common Travel Area; and the Island of Ireland Working Group. </p>  <p>  The International Unit also chairs the Education and Research Subgroup under the Economy and Sectoral Issues strand of co-ordination.  The Subgroup includes relevant areas within the Department and relevant Agencies of the Department and other Departments/Agencies.  Meetings of the Education and Research Subgroup of the Economy and Trade Group took place on 28th October 2016, 15th February; 24th May and 9th October 2017 and most recently focused on stakeholder consultations input and research collaboration.  A further meeting is planned for early 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department has been working closely with a number of organisations, and in particular with the Higher Education Authority, in Brexit planning for the higher education sector.  The HEA has published a Brexit issues paper and has held meetings with the HEIs to discuss ongoing planning and issues with them as the process develops.  We will continue to engage in this important aspect of planning and research work, and during 2018 will maintain our extensive engagement with stakeholders across the sector, which has been fundamental to my Department&rsquo;s preparations for Brexit since late 2016.</p>  <p>  While Brexit presents numerous challenges, it is likely to bring opportunities too. Funding of &euro;1.5m was provided in Budget 2017 to attract researchers to Ireland, as part of our strategic response to Brexit.  This &euro;1.5m is again available in 2018. </p>  <p>  Under the Action Plan for Education 2018 we will enhance our strategy to attract world-leading researchers to Ireland in the context of Brexit.  In partnership with enterprise/employers, and in line with Innovation 2020 targets, we will increase the enrolment of postgraduate researchers and grow the number of programmes to support postdoctoral researchers.  In this way, we will grow a vibrant research community and address economic demands. </p>  <p>  The above themes will be explored in a paper currently being drafted between officials in my Department and the Higher Education Authority who are leading on the paper.  The purpose of the paper is to outline the importance of Brexit for the Irish higher education research system.  It will identify significant issues arising and will propose strategic actions with regard to talent, research and relationships to maximise competitive advantage for Ireland in this area post-Brexit. </p>  <p>  A further joint stakeholder dialogue on research and innovation with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is being planned for the end of April 2018 in Dublin.</p>  <p>  This follows on from the recent publication by the Royal Irish Academy of reports on All-Island aspects of Research that make recommendations to take forward initiatives to support all-island research collaborations and networking.</p>  <p>  We will continue to seek opportunities in existing and high potential markets to increase the numbers of international students and partnerships for our higher education sector as we implement the International Education Strategy.  We will also seek to maximise the opportunities from North-South cooperation and our continuing key relationship with the UK.</p></reply>

I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers.  The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.</p>  <p>  As a result of the changes I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511, at a cost of over &euro;200 million across the public service.</p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010. It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. </p>  <p>  A commitment is included in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 to consider the issue of newly qualified pay within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.  That process has now commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.  The three teacher unions attended that first meeting.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that within 3 months of the passing of the Act, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service. </p></reply>

Consequently, the number of apprentices being registered is determined by employers within each sector.  My Department is committed to supporting the increased registration of apprentices across all sectors.  New apprenticeship registrations have risen from 2,698 in 2014 to 4,843 in 2017, which represents an increase of almost 80%.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government is currently expanding the range of apprenticeships on offer to meet the identified skill needs of industry. Arising from our first call for apprenticeship proposals in 2015 eleven new apprenticeships have been developed in a wide range of sectors, including financial services, engineering, ICT and accounting.  Further new apprenticeships are to be submitted for validation to Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) shortly and, subject to successful validation, are expected to get underway in 2018.</p>  <p>  In addition, arising from last year&rsquo;s second call for proposals, I recently announced 26 new programmes for further development into national apprenticeships across a wide variety of sectors including construction, engineering, horticulture and agriculture.  These new programmes, once developed, will add to and complement the range of apprenticeships currently on offer in developing the skill needs of our economy.</p></reply>

The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions Order) 2016 (S.I. No. 12 of 2016) commenced the bulk of the Act with effect from 18 January 2016.  That Commencement Order brought provisions of Parts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 13 of the Act into operation.  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 355 of 2017) commenced part of section 47(c) of the Act with effect from 31 July 2017 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement) (No. 2) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 474 of 2017) commenced provisions of the Act relating to adoption by civil partners and cohabiting couples with effect from 2 November 2017. </p>  <p>  Part 10 of the Act, which amended the Passports Act 2008, was commenced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on 1 July 2015.</p>  <p>  Part 11 of the Act, which related to adoption, was not commenced and was repealed by section 2(2) of the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, which came into operation on 19 October 2017, as provided for by the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017 (Commencement) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 443 of 2017).  The provisions in Part 11 have been incorporated into the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, for which the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is responsible.</p>  <p>  Section 177 of the Act, which amended section 2 of the Adoptive Leave Act 1995, has not yet been commenced due to technical issues, which have now been resolved.  The Department is currently reviewing the section to ensure that there are no further outstanding issues.  It is expected that the section will be commenced in due course.</p>  <p>  Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provide for parentage through donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR).  I understand that the "barriers" the Deputy is referring to are centred around the issue of the recognition of parentage for same-sex couples and their children which is dealt with under Part 2 of the Act.  The Minister for Health has responsibility for commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act.</p>  <p>  Where a couple have a child through assisted human reproduction treatment which took place prior to the commencement of these provisions and other than in accordance with them, the social parent will not be recorded on the child's birth certificate from the outset, as parentage continues to be assigned under current law.  However, when Parts 2 and 3 of the Act are brought into force by the Minister for Health, and depending on the particular circumstances, it may be possible for couples to seek a declaration under section 21 of the Act that the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the birth mother is the other parent of the child (with all of the parental responsibilities that entails), and ultimately to have a new birth certificate issued reflecting that legal parentage.</p>  <p>  Other provisions of the Act which relate to DAHR have not yet been commenced as they are linked to Parts 2 and 3.  The commencement of the provisions of the Act which are related to Parts 2 and 3 will be co-ordinated with the commencement of those Parts by the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  Part 9 of the Act provides for a number of amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004.  No provision of Part 9 has yet been commenced.  Some sections cannot be commenced until Parts 2 and 3 are brought into operation by the Minister for Health.  Other sections are dependent on provisions of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 being commenced and my Department is liaising with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in relation to scheduling the commencement of these sections.</p></reply>

The Garda authorities also have powers of seizure, detention, storage and disposal of vehicles under road traffic legislation.  I am further informed that the use of quad bikes and scramblers in public parks and open spaces is strictly prohibited by the local authorities under the Parks and Open Spaces Bye-Laws 2011. </p>  <p>  Despite the existing road traffic and other relevant legislation available in this area, the Garda authorities have indicated that there are issues of safety involved in enforcement of these laws which are best addressed through a multi-agency approach as referred to above.

When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom 137 have been assigned to the DMR West Division.  19,18,14 and 9 of this cohort have been assigned to Clondalkin, Ronanstown, Ballyfermot and Lucan Garda Stations respectively.  I am informed that Rathcoole Garda Station is not a training station therefore new probationer Garda&iacute; are not allocated to it.  However, it is important to note that the allocation of probationer Garda&iacute; to a Divisional training station facilitates the reassignment of Garda&iacute; to other stations within the Division, if required, by the Divisional Officer.</p><p>I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College.  Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the DMR West Division.</p><p>In relation to the number of &quot;Community Garda&iacute; &quot; it is important to recognise that community policing is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  The official categorisation as a &quot;Community Garda&iacute;&quot; simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities including through the giving of talks to schools, community groups and others.  It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.</p><p>I am assured by the Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Overall the Model advocates a partnership based, pro-active, community-orientated style of policing.  It is focused on crime prevention, problem-solving and law enforcement, with a view to building trust and enhancing the quality of life of the entire community. Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies. </p><p>As part of the Community Policing Model An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work in partnership with local communities, to prevent and deter crime through initiatives such as Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert, Text Alert and the Garda Schools Programme as well as through more formal structures such as Joint Policing Committees.</p><p>The Community Policing Model also places a strong emphasis on Crime Prevention and within each Garda Division, where there are specialist Crime Prevention Officers (CPOs), who are trained to encourage, promote and advise on crime prevention within communities.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Engagement Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network. </p><p>I have previously stated that I welcome the strong emphasis that the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District.  In terms of progress on this important initiative, I am informed that a draft Community Policing Framework which outlines the manner in which Community Policing Teams will be established has been completed and is subject to internal review before being approved by the Garda Executive for implementation.</p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information I have set out in tabular form the total number of Garda&iacute; and the number of Garda&iacute; categorised as Community Garda&iacute; attached to Ballyfermot, Clondalkin, Lucan, Rathcoole and Ronanstown Garda stations as of 31 December in each of the years 2014 -2017 the latest date for which figures are readily available.<table><tr><th>Ballyfermot Garda Station</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Community Garda&iacute;</td><td>Garda&iacute;</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>9</td><td>76</td><td>85</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>7</td><td>79</td><td>86</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>4</td><td>81</td><td>85</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>7</td><td>76</td><td>83</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>Clondalkin  Garda Station </th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Community Garda&iacute;</td><td>Garda&iacute;</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>7</td><td>82</td><td>89</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>8</td><td>79</td><td>87</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>7</td><td>87</td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>7</td><td>90</td><td>97</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>Lucan  Garda Station </th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Community Garda&iacute;</td><td>Garda&iacute;</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>6</td><td>68</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>6</td><td>67</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>6</td><td>68</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>6</td><td>64</td><td>70</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>Rathcoole Garda Station</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Community Garda&iacute;</td><td>Garda&iacute;</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>1</td><td>22</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>1</td><td>20</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>2</td><td>17</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>1</td><td>13</td><td>14</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>Ronanstown  Garda Station</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Community Garda&iacute;</td><td>Garda&iacute;</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>6</td><td>85</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>10</td><td>84</td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>7</td><td>84</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>9</td><td>78</td><td>87</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.  As you will appreciate, in order to deliver an effective policing service, it is essential that Garda management have the flexibility to deploy Garda resources to meet operational policing needs and address critical issues as they arise. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that the overall strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) as of the 31 December 2017 was 3,485. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; in the DMR is supported by a number of Garda national units, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  In addition, at the request of the Commissioner in 2016, the Government moved decisively to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gang-related crime in the Dublin area.  Funding was approved for the establishment of a dedicated Armed Support Unit (ASU) for the DMR in order to enhance armed support capability in Dublin and to free up the resources of the Emergency Response Unit.  Following a selection and training process, the ASU for the DMR became fully operational in December 2016 and is providing armed cover in the DMR on a 24 hour basis.  Members of the ASU are highly trained and equipped with a variety of non-lethal and lethal weapons and perform high visibility armed checkpoints and patrols throughout the DMR.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.

I am assured by the Commissioner that following completion of these competitions the needs of all Garda Divisions including the DMR Divisions will be fully considered when determining the allocation of successful candidates.  As the Deputy will be aware the Policing Authority has responsibility for making appointments to the senior ranks of Superintendent, Chief Superintendent and Assistant Commissioner, having undertaken selection competitions. </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am advised that local Garda management  are making every effort to deal with problems arising in the Ballymun area and that a number of measures have been put in place, including additional high-visibility patrols, support from the public order unit and operations by the local drug unit and these will continue into the future.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of Ballymun Garda Station on 31 December 2017, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 113 of which 8 are designated as Community Garda. There are also 7 Garda Reserves and 8 Garda civilian staff attached to the Ballymun Garda Station. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  </p><p>In addition, at the request of the Commissioner in 2016, the Government moved decisively to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gang-related crime in the Dublin area.  Funding was approved for the establishment of a dedicated Armed Support Unit (ASU) for the DMR in order to enhance armed support capability in Dublin and to free up the resources of the Emergency Response Unit.  Following a selection and training process, the ASU for the DMR became fully operational in December 2016 and is providing armed cover in the DMR on a 24 hour basis. Members of the ASU are highly trained and equipped with a variety of non-lethal and lethal weapons and perform high visibility armed checkpoints and patrols throughout the DMR Divisions including the DMR North. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 29 have been assigned to Ballymun Garda Station. I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division. </p><p>In relation to the number of &quot;Community Garda&iacute; &quot; it is important to recognise that community policing is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official categorisation as a &ldquo;Community Garda&quot; simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities including through the giving of talks to schools, community groups and others. It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.</p><p>I am assured by the Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs. Overall the Model advocates a partnership based, pro-active, community-orientated style of policing. It is focused on crime prevention, problem-solving and law enforcement, with a view to building trust and enhancing the quality of life of the entire community. Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies. </p><p>As part of the Community Policing Model An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work in partnership with local communities, to prevent and deter crime through initiatives such as Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert, Text Alert and the Garda Schools Programme as well as through more formal structures such as Joint Policing Committees.</p><p>The Community Policing Model also places a strong emphasis on Crime Prevention and within each Garda Division, where there are specialist Crime Prevention Officers (CPOs), who are trained to encourage, promote and advise on crime prevention within communities. </p><p>In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Engagement Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network. </p><p>I have previously stated that I welcome the strong emphasis that the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District.  In terms of progress on this important initiative, I am informed that a draft Community Policing Framework which outlines the manner in which Community Policing Teams will be established has been completed and is subject to internal review before being approved by the Garda Executive for implementation.</p><p>For the Deputy's information, I have provided in tabular form, in the following document, the total strength and Community Garda&iacute; strength of Ballymun Garda Station as of 31 December 2008 to 31 December 2017 the latest date for which figures are readily available, as provided by the Commissioner.<table><tr><th>Ballymun Garda Station</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Community Garda&iacute;</td><td>Garda&iacute;</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>10</td><td>102</td><td>112</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>10</td><td>120</td><td>130</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>15</td><td>113</td><td>128</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>15</td><td>98</td><td>113</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>12</td><td>106</td><td>118</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>10</td><td>108</td><td>118</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>8</td><td>106</td><td>114</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>6</td><td>118</td><td>124</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>6</td><td>111</td><td>117</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>8</td><td>105</td><td>113</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This decision was communicated directly to the lawyers for victims involved at the time.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the criminal investigations have resulted in the Director of Public Prosecutions bringing 99 further charges against Bill Kenneally. The DPP, of course, operates independently of Government. </p>  <p>  I am anxious to establish the Commission and in this regard I have had discussions with the Attorney General while my officials are working intensively with their counterparts in the AG&rsquo;s office to find a clear, workable solution which will allow for the formal establishment of a Commission of Investigation in a way which does not impact upon any current or future criminal prosecutions. </p>  <p>  This is a high priority for me and I am acutely aware of the pain and suffering that has been endured by the victims.

The plan which is underway through the vehicle of the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 includes a commitment to achieving a medium term target of 20% civilians by 2021, in effect a doubling of civilian staff to 4,000 over the term of the programme. This is to be achieved through twin policies of "civilian by default" and redeployment. "Civilian by default" refers to the filling of new posts other than operational policing posts and non-operational policing posts that become vacant by civilian staff unless policing expertise is required.</p>  <p>  In relation to the redeployment policy this is informed by Garda Inspectorate's "Changing Policing in Ireland" report which estimated that approximately 1,500 Garda&iacute; may be suitable for re-deployment. The Government&rsquo;s plan aims to return as many of these Garda&iacute; as possible to front-line duties over the next five years. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently working on the development of a redeployment plan in respect of the 1,500 target and has identified a target of approximately 160 for redeployment in the first part of 2018. However, in relation to redeploying Garda&iacute;, I would emphasise that this is not something that can be done overnight. It is important that this is done fairly and that it takes account of individual circumstances including the length of time that a Garda has been away from the front-line and the reasons behind it. Some Garda&iacute; may, for example, be on light duties following an injury in the course of their work while others may have been assigned to administrative duties early in their policing careers and may need refresher training to support their transition to front-line duties. Garda management is working to develop a model that will take account of these issues. </p>  <p>  It is important that these issues are bottomed out at this stage as this will, I believe, facilitate more Garda&iacute; being deployed to frontline policing duties in the medium to longer term. It will be a major change for the organisation and it is important that it is well-managed so that members and civilian staff embrace it rather than resist it. This will assist in ensuring the development of a culture of sworn members and civilians working together seamlessly each making a valuable contribution to the delivery of effective policing services. </p>  <p>  I will be meeting the Garda Commissioner in the coming days with regard to progress on the reform plan and I will be stressing the importance of, and the need to accelerate, civilianisation including redeployment during 2018. </p>  <p>  Civilianisation including redeployment will not happen overnight but as I have made clear, the implementation of the ambitious reform programme, including civilianisation, must continue and, indeed, must move at a greater pace, to ensure the best possible policing services to the people of Ireland.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business are  matters for the Presidents of the Courts and the presiding judges who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.</p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has advised that it would not be appropriate to comment in relation to an individual case before the Courts. The Courts Service has informed me that the Presidents of the Courts monitor waiting times and workload across all court lists and seek to ensure the optimum use of court time and judicial resources. Wherever possible, the Presidents target additional judicial resources at the areas of greatest need. </p>  <p>  In terms of timeframes generally, domestic violence applications are prioritised in all District Courts throughout the country. Applications such as Protection Orders are prioritised in the District Court and are usually granted where the Court so decides on the date the application is made to the Court. Typically interim barring orders, which are also an emergency application, are also made ex parte and granted on the date of application. There are, therefore, no delays in dealing with such applications. Applications for Barring Orders are prioritised within court lists and a decision is generally made on such applications on the first listing date. Where adjournments occur they are generally granted at the request of one or both parties.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that delays in the hearing of cases can arise from a number of factors, some of which can be outside the control of the courts and the Courts Service, for example, the unavailability of a witness or vital evidence, delays in the furnishing of reports or because the parties and/or legal practitioners are not ready to proceed on allocated dates. This gives rise to adjournments which can have an impact on the time taken to complete the hearing of a case and on the number of cases which can be disposed of in a court sitting. Most adjournments are sought by parties to a case.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to significant reform of the courts, including the establishment of a family law court structure that is streamlined, more efficient, and less costly. My Department is currently working on the General Scheme of a Family Court Bill which will aim to streamline family law court processes, clarify jurisdictional issues and provide for a set of guiding principles to help ensure that the Family Court will operate in a user-friendly and efficient manner. The intention is to establish a dedicated Family Court within the existing court structures. The Family Court Bill will support the provisions in the Mediation Act 2017 by encouraging greater use of alternative dispute resolution to assist in more timely resolution of family law cases.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that Section 24(3) of the 2004 Act also stipulates, in any event, that a court may apply a discount rate other than the rate prescribed under subsection (1) if it considers that the application of the rate prescribed would result in injustice being done.</p>  <p>  The discount rate represents the average &lsquo;real rate of return&rsquo; that a &lsquo;prudential investor&rsquo; could achieve on an award.  The size of the award is &lsquo;discounted&rsquo; by the percentage return that the plaintiff can expect to make by investing the award.</p>  <p>  In the case of Gill Russell v HSE, the Court of Appeal upheld the determination of the High Court that the discount rate of 3% then being applied by the courts to personal injury lump sum awards was too high for cases involving significant long-term care needs and instead set the rate at 1% for future care costs (to take account of the likelihood that care costs would be higher than inflation) and at 1.5% for other future pecuniary losses (to include future loss of earnings).  </p>  <p>  My Department has already commenced examination of this issue in consultation with the Department of Finance and the State Claims Agency, taking into account the judgments in the case of Gill Russell v HSE, and the recent discount rate changes in England and Wales. </p>  <p>  Officials have engaged with counterparts from HM Treasury to discuss their experiences of reviewing and setting the discount rate in the UK. The State Claims Agency has also carried out some analysis on this subject.  A key outcome of this process will be whether regulations should be brought forward to set the discount rate and if so at what rate should they be set.</p>  <p>  I do not, on the basis of the decision in the Gill Russell case, propose to introduce regulations to set the discount rate at this stage.  However, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the State Claims Agency, I shall be reviewing legislative developments in the UK on this issue and will give consideration to their applicability or otherwise in an Irish context.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-20a.588.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022000069#WRM00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 247 and 248 together.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that Sundrive Road and Terenure Garda Stations are located in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) South Division. I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the DMR South Division on 31 December 2017 was 532. There are also 20 Garda Reserves and 36 Garda civilian staff attached to the DMR South Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the Armed Support Units, National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 118 have been assigned to the DMR South Division with 16 and 14 assigned to Sundrive Road and Terenure Garda Stations respectively. I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.</p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.</p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the DMR South Division.</p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information I have set out in tabular form the strength by rank of Terenure and Sundrive Road Garda stations as provided by the Commissioner, in each of the years 2007-2017.<table><tr><th>TERENURE GARDA STATION STRENGTH 2007-2017</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>SUPT</td><td>INSP</td><td>SGT</td><td>GDA</td><td>TOTAL</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>68</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>13</td><td>62</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>12</td><td>70</td><td>86</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>-</td><td>3</td><td>14</td><td>74</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>14</td><td>78</td><td>96</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>15</td><td>79</td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>15</td><td>78</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>16</td><td>82</td><td>105</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>14</td><td>86</td><td>106</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>16</td><td>85</td><td>108</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>18</td><td>76</td><td>101</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>SUNDRIVE ROAD STRENGTH 2007-2017</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>SGT</td><td>GDA</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>5</td><td>54</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>8</td><td>54</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>7</td><td>57</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>8</td><td>54</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>9</td><td>57</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>10</td><td>57</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>11</td><td>60</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>11</td><td>66</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>9</td><td>70</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>11</td><td>70</td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>11</td><td>67</td><td>78</td></tr></table></p></reply>

It could have responded narrowly to this judgment by setting a temporal limit. Instead it decided to opt-in to the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive bringing Ireland into line with our EU partners and place the entire system on a legislative basis, which will be subject to EU oversight. This is a significant and important reform, not only in addressing the issue of labour market access but also extending to children&rsquo;s rights, rights for unaccompanied minors, vulnerable people, new appeals processes, healthcare and education provision.</p>  <p>  During the course of the debate in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice &amp;amp; Equality, and in both the Seanad and the D&aacute;il, I outlined the proposal and rationale for opting into the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive under the terms of Protocol 21, annexed to the EU Treaties.  I also outlined the compliance process involved with the EU Commission which they require, and which will take four months to complete.</p>  <p>  Because of this timeframe, it was necessary to address the situation that will exist from the 9th February until the opt-in process is completed.  During this interim period, those seeking international protection will have access to the labour market through the existing employment permit regime in the same manner as other Third County nationals. In addition to accessing the employment permits regime, the Government decided to offer early certainty to those seeking self-employment from February 9th and prior to any confirmation of our opt-in. In this regard, I used my executive power to provide an additional access for qualified applicants to engage in self-employment on terms that can be mirrored in a permanent scheme once the process of compliance with the Directive is completed with the EU Commission.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the interim arrangements, which removed the temporal limit of access to the workplace, is in keeping with the decision of the Supreme Court. My colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has responsibility for the employment permits regime including the criteria, terms and applicable fees. I understand that generally, any fees accompanying such access are usually paid by the employer.</p>  <p>  I would stress that the interim scheme is designed to be of very short duration until the opt-in process is completed. Once this happens, access to the labour market will be underpinned by EU law. I expect that this permanent scheme will provide for a broader access to the labour market for qualified applicants &ndash; the details of which will be worked out and announced in the coming months taking all factors into account.</p>  <p>  I am confident that this progressive approach by Government, which for the first time will see many elements of our protection process subject to EU law and verification by the EU Commission, will be a further major effective and reforming step as we seek to improve the standards of our reception conditions for those seeking international protection in Ireland.</p></reply>

Of these: </p><p>-  29% related to work records,</p><p>-  25% related to a failure to grant Sunday, Public Holiday or Annual Leave entitlements, </p><p>-  16% related to terms of employment, </p><p>-  contraventions of working hours, rest provisions and payslip provisions each accounted for 8%,</p><p>-  7% of contraventions involved a failure to pay National Minimum Wage rates or contracted amounts. </p><p>Some contraventions were also detected under Employment Permits and Protection of Young Persons legislation.</p><p>Just under half of the 74 cases opened under Phase I were completed before the end of 2017 and the associated 102 contraventions addressed. The remainder are in process. </p><p>Contraventions are initially drawn to the attention of employers by means of a Contravention Notice. Where the employer does not demonstrate compliance within the time limits imposed by the Inspector, and, depending on the legislation involved, the matter may be escalated in terms of the issue of Compliance or Fixed Payment Notices and/or the initiation of prosecution proceedings.</p><p>The WRC's activities in the equine sector also include an awareness and educational programme and engagement with stakeholders with the overall objective of achieving employment rights compliance. A Working Group, comprising the WRC, Horse Racing Ireland, Horse Sport Ireland and the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association, was established in October, 2017 on the recommendation of the WRC. This is with a view to collaborating and engaging with employers in the industry on measures to enhance compliance, including the production of a guide for equine employers on employment rights and obligations. The Group expects to launch this Guide before the end of March 2018.</p><p>The WRC is currently examining the outcomes from Phase I of its campaign. This examination will inform the scope and content of operations under Phase II which is expected to commence shortly.</p></reply>

Also in 2017, the WRC issued 122 compliance notices requiring rectification of breaches detected under certain employment rights.  This included, where appropriate, the payment of any unpaid or underpaid annual leave/public holiday entitlements. In that context, I am satisfied that the current enforcement regime of employment rights legislation being pursued by the WRC is working well.</p>  <p>  As the deputy will be aware, the WRC was established on 1 October 2015 under the Workplace Relations Act 2015. Inspectors of the WRC carry out inspections of employer records with a view to determining compliance with employment rights legislation. These inspections arise: </p>  <p>  -  in response to complaints received of alleged non-compliance with relevant employment rights legislation; </p>  <p>  -  as part of compliance campaigns which focus on compliance in specific sectors or specific pieces of legislation, or </p>  <p>  -  as routine inspections, which act as a control measure.</p>  <p>  In the first instance the WRC makes every effort, through the conduct of information and awareness campaigns, to secure voluntary compliance with employment law. Where this constructive and proactive approach does not work and employers either refuse or fail to rectify the breaches identified and/or pay money due to their employees, the WRC will progress these cases through the prosecution route.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issues raised, the deputy will be aware that the WRC is an independent, statutory body. Therefore, it conducts its functions independently, having regard to applicable law, as to how best to achieve effective compliance with employment rights legislation. This includes such remedial activities as the restitution of unpaid wages by non-compliant employers. Where an employer does not make good the wages owed the WRC initiates criminal proceedings in the District Court.</p>  <p>  As regards workers&rsquo; annual leave and public holiday entitlements, under Section 28 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015, WRC inspectors are empowered to issue a Compliance Notice to employers found in breach of annual leave/public holiday entitlements. The notice requests rectification of the breach or breaches detected including, where appropriate, the payment of any unpaid or underpaid annual leave/public holiday entitlements. I note that in 2017, of the 122 compliance notices issued by the WRC requiring rectification of breaches detected under certain employment rights, 105 related to matters pertaining to employee&rsquo;s entitlements under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.</p>  <p>  On the issue of appropriate penalties under employment law, this is a matter for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection which now has responsibility for employment rights legislation and policy, including the Minimum Wage Act. </p>  <p>  Provisions in legislation governing employment permits serve to protect the employment rights of migrant workers as statutory employment rights and protections apply to migrant workers in exactly  the same manner as they do to native Irish workers. On application by either employer or employee, the employment permit is granted to the employee; and the permit contains a statement of the entitlements of the migrant worker including their remuneration, and a summary of the principle employment rights of employees. </p>  <p>  The WRC Inspectors&rsquo; powers under the Employment Permits Acts are not considered to interfere with the effective discharge of their duties or prejudice in any way the authority and impartiality which are necessary for inspectors in their relations with employers and workers as set out in Article 3(2) of the Inspection Convention of the ILO.</p></reply>

Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and EEA, an employment permit may be sought by an employer to hire a non-EEA national. As the State approaches full employment, labour as well as skills needs are beginning to manifest and as a consequence, consideration of the State's approach to the accessibility of the employment permit regime for lower skilled workers in certain sectors and occupations is appropriate. </p>  <p>  Economic migration alone is not a sustainable long-term solution to skills and labour shortages and indeed can, in some circumstances, help to perpetuate those shortages in the economy.  The development of particular skills in the resident labour force can depend upon a judicious deployment of economic migration as a supplementary rather than a primary source of those skills, and adjustments must be made with this in mind.</p>  <p>  While there is some anecdotal evidence of a tightening labour market in some sectors, the fact remains that there are 238,000 on the live register, and with a potential pool of 18 million unemployed in the EU 28. Thus my Department needs to be prudent in considering whether to open up the labour market to unskilled non-EEA workers on wage levels at or just above the national minimum wage. </p>  <p>  In this context, I have asked my officials to undertake a review of the economic migration policies which underpin the current employment permits system, to ensure it is fully supportive of Ireland&rsquo;s emerging labour market needs, be they skills or labour shortages in certain sectors.</p>  <p>  An Inter-Departmental Group has been established to inform the review and it is made up of relevant State Departments, including Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform; Justice and Equality; Housing Planning and Local Government; Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Health; Transport, Tourism and Sport; Education and Skills; Employment Affairs and Social Protection. . </p>  <p>  The review process will also include a public consultation, with feedback sought from relevant stakeholders and interest groups.  The group met for the first time on 9 February last and I have asked that a report be submitted to me before the end of June.     </p></reply>

That will remain one of our main priorities for the foreseeable future.</p>  <p>  Given the emphasis that has been placed on Brexit-related work, there are currently no plans to commission any independent report into the economic benefits of a united Ireland economy. However, we will continue to support cross-border commerce and the strengthening of commercial ties between our two jurisdictions.</p></reply>

Funding is secured for the final work programme for Horizon 2020 which will run until the end of 2020.  Brexit is therefore not expected to have a significant impact upon funding for Horizon 2020.</p><p>In terms of European research and innovation activities, the UK is one of a number of important collaborators for Ireland in Horizon 2020.  In addition to the UK, Ireland has a diversified range of collaborative links with Member States, particularly Germany, Spain and France. An analysis of Ireland's collaborations under Horizon 2020 indicates that collaborations occur in multi partner projects and that Ireland is not overly-dependent on the UK for scientific collaboration in successful EU programmes. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s agencies, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, undertook analyses on the potential impact of Brexit following the UK vote in late 2016. In addition to ongoing review by officials from my Department, these analyses have been updated for presentation to inter-department groups on <i>Innovation 2020</i>and Horizon 2020.  The recent report published by my Department <i>Building Stronger Business: Responding to Brexit by competing, innovating and trading</i>identifies some of the potential opportunities (including research) for Ireland arising from Brexit as well as the actions which are being taken. </p><p>The successor to Horizon 2020, Framework Programme 9 (FP9), will be proposed by the European Commission later in 2018. Funding for this new European research and innovation programme will be allocated as part of the Multiannual Financial Framework.  As discussions on this financial framework are ongoing, funding for FP9 is yet to be determined.</p></reply>

Creating an internationally competitive research and innovation system which drives a sustainable economy is a key strand of our Brexit response. The cross-Government Innovation 2020 Implementation Group is critical in driving delivery of the strategy&rsquo;s commitments in order to achieve national innovation objectives. </p>  <p>  A key commitment in Innovation 2020 is to enable firms to innovate which has been demonstrated to build resilience in enterprise to manage, exploit and survive global challenges such as Brexit.  &lsquo;Building Stronger Business&rsquo;, launched in November 2017 also sets out my Department&rsquo;s approach to managing Brexit impacts on the national research and innovation system. </p>  <p>  Together with Science Foundation Ireland (SFI), Enterprise Ireland (EI) and IDA Ireland, my Department is driving and supporting greater engagement in research, development and innovation by both Irish and foreign owned enterprises and by both SMEs and large scale enterprises. We are responding to the changing needs of the enterprise sector and are tailoring our supports to meet these needs.</p>  <p>  SFI, EI and IDA Ireland are targeting R&amp;D funding to support innovation in new products and processes which firms need to compete and grow and to invest in the pipeline of the next generation of innovators through a new postgraduate researcher programme.</p>  <p>  Budget 2018 saw a &euro;4.25 million increase in SFI&rsquo;s budget for a new Research Centre bringing to 17 the number of large scale Research Centres.   SFI is working to identify potential opportunities for Ireland in the context of EU-funded researchers wishing to relocate post-Brexit and is strengthening the research collaborations with the UK and Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  EI is helping clients to access external sources of innovation, enhancing internal innovation capabilities through training and supporting an increase in client research, development and innovation investment. </p>  <p>  As innovation is a key cornerstone of enterprise policy, a review of &lsquo;Enterprise 2025&rsquo; will be published shortly which will ensure that the enterprise policy framework remains robust in the context of Brexit. The Action Plan for Jobs 2018 will also be published in Q1 this year with a specific focus on Brexit mitigation policies and will outline actions which can commence in 2018 to support firms to overcome the challenges and to take advantage of the opportunities presented by Brexit.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I intend to have a mid-term evaluation of Innovation 2020 undertaken this year to determine the extent to which the specific actions outlined in the strategy remain robust and so that any relevant adjustments may be made in a timely manner to ensure successful delivery on the vision and objectives.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner. The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively. This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN.</p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017. This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster. No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer automatically receive this item under the community drugs schemes. In August 2017, the HSE advised GPs and pharmacies of the changes and of treatment alternatives. </p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes. The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision. </p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,500 applications from GPs, of which some 10% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.</p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  The HSE advises that over 50% have been accepted on clinical grounds.</p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at <i>.</i></p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

As Deputies would be aware, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on individual cases or matters that are the subject of ongoing litigation.  However, I can provide background information on this litigation and clarify matters that are already in the public domain.</p>  <p>  In October 2013, the Government approved (S180/46/01/0005B) the delegation to the State Claims Agency (SCA) of the management of claims in relation to individuals alleging the development of narcolepsy resulting from the administration of the pandemic vaccine.  The management of the cases transferred to the SCA when the National Treasury Management Agency (Delegation of Claims Management Functions) (Amendment) Order 2013 (S.I. no. 405 of 2013) was signed by the Taoiseach on 15 October 2013.  This reflects the greater experience and expertise that the State Claims Agency has in the area of medical litigation.</p>  <p>  An Order requiring the defendants to make Discovery was made in the High Court on 28 November 2016 in the most advanced case. Discovery is a legal process which must be carried out in accordance with Orders made by the Courts.  There have been a number of High Court Motion hearings concerning this matter since then and the Department of Health and the HSE continue to comply with all Orders made by the Courts.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is working assiduously to complete its Discovery and has kept the Court fully appraised as to its progress in that regard.  However, the sheer size and complexity of the Discovery which requires to be made means that this is not a trivial or quick process.  The Department undertook a full access review of the entire email, database and shared network drive which serves the whole Department of Health with a dedicated team undertaking the appropriate searches against vast sources of data supported by both internal and external IT experts.  The Department has identified over 680,000 records, all which must be examined and scheduled by the State&rsquo;s legal team.  To that end, the Department put in place a dedicated team of 8 discovery personnel to carry out this work with support from solicitors, to ensure that the terms of any Orders are fully complied with.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. </p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer automatically receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  In August 2017, the HSE advised GPs and pharmacies of the changes and of treatment alternatives. </p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes.  The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision. </p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,500 applications from GPs, of which some 10% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example, for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.</p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  Of appeals to date, the HSE advises that over 50% have been accepted on clinical grounds.</p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at <i>.</i></p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

BCG vaccine stock in all areas expired at the end of April 2015 and as of today this continues to be a problem for Ireland and other countries in Europe that use this licensed BCG vaccine.  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office (NIO) has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG vaccine to ascertain when the vaccine might be available.  There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland and this vaccine manufacturer has informed the NIO that the BCG vaccine will not be delivered into Ireland until late 2018 at the earliest.  The NIO and the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) have sought an alternative supply of BCG vaccine that meets safety, quality and effectiveness standards and that could be used in Ireland.  To date no appropriate alternative manufacturer has been found.

However, the Department is in a position to provide some information ahead of this direct reply, as follows.</p><p>Actions taken</p><p>The Department of Health was made aware of the matter relating to the monitoring of fetal heart rates in late January 2018 and immediately asked the HSE to examine the issue as a matter of urgency.</p><p>In 2009 a Field Safety Notice (FSN) was issued with new advice and guidance in relation to using these monitors and the known risks in relation to reading the fetal heartrate.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority advise that it was confirmed to the manufactor that all relevant hospitals had received this notice in 2009, and that in 2011 a software upgrade had been applied to the machines.</p><p>In addition, there was a software revision applied to all these devices in Ireland and Philips Healthcare confirmed to the HPRA in November 2011 that the software revision had been completed in all Irish centres.  The HPRA monitored the completion and effectiveness of these communications and the software revision.</p><p>The HPRA confirmed that all hospitals acknowledged receipt of the FSN, and that by 2011 all Avalon fetal monitors in Irish hospital had the software updates installed.  The National Women and Infant&rsquo;s Health Programme has requested updates from the hospitals that were affected by the FSN 2009.</p><p>Avalon Fetal monitors are CE marked medical devices on the market in Europe. [A medical device that has been approved will bear a CE mark.  This indicates it meets the basic requirements for safety and effectiveness under European law].</p><p>These medical devices were not recalled in Europe or USA as a result of this issue.  The use of the word &rsquo;recall&rsquo; is US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] terminology used in communications for either a device correction or a removal, depending on the action being taken in the United States.</p><p>The HPRA has monitored the incident and complaint rates nationally, on a European level and internationally and at no time identified the need for additional regulatory action.</p><p>Hospitals Impacted</p><p>The HSE advises that hospitals where the monitors were located are as follows, Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, Portlaoise Hospital, Regional Hospital Mullingar, University Hospital Limerick, National Maternity Hospital, Sligo University Hospital, Rotunda Hospital, South Tipperary General Hospital, St Luke's General Hospital Kilkenny, Cork University Maternity Hospital and Wexford General Hospital.</p><p>Risk Assessment Team</p><p>Due to the nature and complexity of this issue and the level of assurance currently available in relation to actions taken to date, a Risk Assessment Team has been established will be responsible for assessing the nature of any potential risk to patient safety and to determine the appropriateness of actions taken by the manufacturer and the health service to date.  If deficits are identified, the Risk Assessment Team will advise on any actions required to safeguard the safety of patients.  These actions will include but may not be limited to;</p><p>1.Understanding the nature of any patient safety risks identified in the FSN.</p><p>2.Undertaking an assessment of the actions taken following the issue of the FSN in 2009 and since then.  This will include consideration of the technological and human factors issues that may have impacted on CTG interpretation.</p><p>3.Determining whether the actions taken were appropriate in order to address potential risk.</p><p>4.Determining if there are any current safety risks and the status of risk in the period from November 2009 to the present and if there are, to advise on further actions required in order to ensure patient safety.</p><p>The membership of the Risk Assessment Team, which is Chaired by the Director of the National Women and Infants Health Programme, includes both the Clinical Director and the Director of Midwifery for the Programme, a representative of the Health Products Regulatory Authority [HPRA], the HSE&rsquo;s National Medical Device Equipment Advisor and the National Director for Quality Assurance and Verification.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017.</p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles.</p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN.</p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer automatically receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  In August 2017 the HSE advised GPs of the changes and of treatment alternatives.</p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes.  The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision.</p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,700 applications from GPs, of which some 14% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.</p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  The HSE advises that over 60% have been accepted on clinical grounds.</p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at .</p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner. The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively. This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. </p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017. This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. </p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster. No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer automatically receive this item under the community drugs schemes. In August 2017 the HSE advised GPs of the changes and of treatment alternatives. </p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes. The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision. </p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,500 applications from GPs, of which some 10% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.</p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  Of some 250 appeals to date, the HSE advises that over 60% have been accepted on clinical grounds.</p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at .</p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

I am informed by the HPRA that the enzyme thiaminase is not added during the manufacture of Gardasil HPV vaccine and is not used as an ingredient in the final medicine.  Like all other medicines manufactured using cell technologies, trace amounts of residual proteins from these cells, which would include any residual thiaminase, may be present in the final Gardasil product.  Gardasil meets EU regulatory requirements by limiting these proteins to microgram amounts at which level they have no discernible effect.  Prior to each batch being placed on the market, testing is carried out to confirm that the level of residual proteins is less than the specified limit.</p>  <p>  Other medicinal products manufactured using such cells, including some insulin products, are used daily and over a long duration (often years), compared to Gardasil which is administered once or a maximum of three times.</p>  <p>  Gardasil is approved centrally by the European Commission, acting on the recommendation of the European Medicines Agency, for all EU Member States.</p>  <p>  Most instances of thiamine deficiency appear to be as a result of lack of dietary intake and/or in instances of intake of foods rich in thiaminase.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-20a.874.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022000075#WRR01800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 347, 364, 366, 408 and 415 together.</p>  <p>  Transgender-specific guidelines have been developed by WPATH (World Professional Association for Transgender Health) and the Endocrine Society (who updated their guidelines in 2017). These guidelines were devised by experts in transgender healthcare, along with members of the International Transgender, Transsexual and LGBT community. </p>  <p>  A proposed model of care for transgender children, adolescents and adults was submitted by the HSE Quality Improvement Division to the HSE Divisions of Primary Care, Mental Health and Acute Hospital programme. The model was developed in consultation with key treating clinicians, planners, policy makers, advocates and service users. </p>  <p>  The guidelines recommend a comprehensive multidisciplinary psychosocial assessment prior to commencement of hormone therapy by endocrinology services. The assessment focuses on more than just assessment for the possible diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria. The guidelines highlight several criteria which must be met prior to referral for hormonal intervention. It is important that co-morbid conditions are identified and addressed, and that people access the supports that they need to manage co-morbid difficulties, which can impact on response to medical transition (including hormone treatment). </p>  <p>  International best practice involves an assessment by a multi-disciplinary team and shared decision making in the best interests of the individual. Both WPATH and the Endocrine Society Guidelines 2017 specify the assessment must be carried out by a mental health professional (s) with experience in transgender healthcare and possess specific skills. Endocrinologists and General Practitioners (GPs) do not possess these skills, and require access to the multidisciplinary team as described. GPs would only see a small number of gender variant individuals during their lifetime in clinical practice, and would not be in a position to build up the requisite skillset outlined in WPATH and Endocrine Society Guidelines or have the time resource to conduct a comprehensive evaluation. </p>  <p>  Informed consent is essential, whereby benefits and risks of hormone treatment and surgery are discussed with individuals seeking these interventions. Although regret rates are low, it can happen and can also lead to high levels of psychological distress. Healthcare providers work with people to try to prevent negative outcomes. The emerging evidence on good outcomes following medical and/or surgical transitioning is based on use of multi-disciplinary psychosocial assessment, fulfilment of criteria for hormones and on-going psychological support throughout the process. It is important that psychological support is available to individuals before, during and after transitioning. </p>  <p>  Prescription of hormone blockers and cross-sex hormones for transgender people is relatively new. Significant side effects can occur with cross sex hormones including irreversible physical changes and infertility. There is a lack of long-term research on outcomes. For these reasons the decision to prescribe should only be made by specialists (i.e. Endocrinologists) in consultation with other professionals involved in the assessment process. Shared decision-making is in accordance with best practice internationally.  Prescriptions can then be supported by local GPs with specialist guidance. </p>  <p>  The Best Practice approach as outlined above is endorsed in the Service Development Model as developed by the Quality Improvement Division of the HSE in 2017, in collaboration with TENI. This model is providing the framework for the development of National Gender Clinics and MDTs for children and adults, funded by the Acute Hospitals and Mental Health Divisions of the HSE. Recruitment will commence to develop these national teams in 2018. This investment in new posts in 2018 which includes one consultant endocrinologist (adult services), one consultant endocrinologist (paediatric services), one social worker (adult services), one speech and language therapist (adult services), one senior psychologist (adult services), one senior psychologist (paediatric services), one clinical nurse specialist (Paediatric services), two administrative support officers (adult and paediatric services) is a concerted measure by the HSE to address the waiting times and immediate service needs of children, adolescents and adults in transition. It is envisaged that these National Teams will be in place in 2018, pending successful recruitment campaigns. </p>  <p>  The HSE, across a number of programmes including mental health, acute hospitals, primary care and social inclusion, is committed to building services for this community in accordance with International Best Practice.</p></reply>

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  All relevant and appropriate information is taken into account when deciding to make changes to the State's immunisation programmes.  </p>  <p>  NIAC has made a recommendation that the HPV vaccine should be given to boys.  My Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to carry out a health technology assessment (HTA).  Work has commenced on the HTA and is expected to be completed in 2018.  Any decision to extend the current programme which offers HPV vaccination to all girls in their first year of second-level education to a programme that also offers vaccination to boys will be informed by the evidence contained in the HTA.  </p></reply>

To support this, we plan to establish a new statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home care services.  The Department is currently engaged in a detailed process to progress this.  </p><p>In the meantime, the Department and HSE are continuing efforts to incrementally improve the existing services.  As detailed in its <i>National Service Plan,</i>the HSE is streamlining home care services by moving towards a single funded service. This combines the funding for home help and standard home care packages which will operate as a single home support service from 2018 onwards.  </p><p>Home support services are a particular area of focus in Budget 2018, with an additional &euro;18.25m allocated.  The additional resources bring the budget for the direct provision of home support services to &euro;408m delivering over 17m home support hours to about 50,500 people.  This compares with the estimated 16.34m hours delivered to 50,000 people last year.  In addition 235 intensive home care packages will provide 360,000 home support hours for people with complex needs.  </p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement - was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017.  </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.  </p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles.  </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN.  </p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. </p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.  </p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer automatically receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  In August 2017, the HSE advised GPs and pharmacies of the changes and of treatment alternatives.  </p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes.  The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision.  </p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,700 applications from GPs, of which some 14% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.  </p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  The HSE advises that over 60% have been accepted on clinical grounds.  </p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at <i></i>.  </p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.  </p></reply>

The OPAP recommended that a code of practice for food and beverages promotion, marketing and sponsorship be developed, implemented and evaluated in conjunction with the food indsutry, HSE, Dept of Children and Youth Affairs, safefood, Food Safety Authority of Ireland and advertiser organisations. The OPAP premised this recommendation by providing that 'already there are many examples of the food industry making positive contirubtions to the prevention of obesity and it is essential to capitalise and expand on such initiatives'.</p><p>The group that developed the Codes involved representatives from the food industry, advertising sector, statutory agencies, and various Government Departments. It was chaired by the former CEO of the statutory Food Safety Authoirty of Ireland.</p><p>The Codes of Practice are one of the suite of actions set out in the OPAP in the knowledge that no single sector or agency, or no single action, is able to solve this issue on their own. Everyone and every sector has a role to play in those solutions.</p><p>Section 10 of the Codes of Practice provides for a governance framework for these codes. It stipulates that monitoring for compliance and effectiveness encompasses:</p><p>1. Compliance of the food industry with the rules in the Codes governing the various media and</p><p>2. the efficacy of the Codes of Practice with respect to achieving their objectives of ensuring that:</p><p>- So-called High Fat Sugar and Salt (HFSS) foods are marketed in a responsible way</p><p>- children are not exposed to inappropriate marketing, advertising or sponsorship associated with these kinds of food and drink products</p><p>- healthier food choices are actively promoted.</p><p>Section 10 of the Codes on governance also provides that:</p><p>'The monitoring body will be free to decide on its operational methods. However the body will have access to and review relevant data from all companies and partner organisations.'</p><p>It elaborates further on what monitoring for compliance and effectiveness shall involve. It provides that monitoring will include:</p><p>a. 'Independent research/monitoring across all of the areas governed by these Codes to assess adherence, and</p><p>b. Investigating and dealing with complaints.'</p><p>Furthermore, the Codes provide that:</p><p>'The monitoring body shall commission research that will inform it of the effectiveness of these Codes in achieving their stated aims and objectives.'</p><p>The food industry and relevant sectors have agreed to the implementation of these Codes. The Codes were only launched last week and so it is too early to be specific about the other queries raised by the Deputy pending the establishment of the monitoring body and the development of guidelines for the implementation of the Codes during 2018.</p></reply>

Over 29,000 patients came off the Inpatient/Daycase waiting list by the end of October . </p>  <p>  At present 56% of patients on the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List wait less than 6 months, and 83% wait less than 12 months for their procedure.  This is despite the additional demands on our Acute Hospitals, which, since 2000 are carrying out four times more procedures for patients ages 65 and over and twice as many in the under 65 age group. </p>  <p>  October's Budget announced a total 2018 allocation of &euro;55m for the NTPF for 2018.  This significant increase in funding more than doubles the 2017 total allocation of &euro;20m.  The NTPF and HSE are in the process of finalising Waiting List Action Plans and Initiatives for 2018.  This will include ambitious targets for both the HSE and NTPF to reduce the overall number of patients waiting for treatment including those patients awaiting Orthopaedic procedures. </p>  <p>  I hope to publish the 2018 Inpatient Day Case Waiting List Action Plan at the end of February.</p></reply>

The report also concluded  that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. Therefore, medical card provision is solely based on financial assessment. Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card. </p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p></reply>

In 2017 Ireland imported approximately 3.47 million tonnes of animal feed materials. In addition, approximately 2.1 million tonnes of home-grown cereals is used in the production of animal feed , bringing the total usage of feed materials to about 5.6 million tonnes annually. With our grass based livestock production system, with limited tillage area, Ireland is especially dependent on feed imports relative to other EU Member States. </p>  <p>  Almost 1.7 million tonnes of soya and maize genetically modified (GM) products were imported into Ireland for inclusion in animal feeds in 2017, constituting approximately 50% of total feed imports. The main commodities imported are maize and maize by-products, soyabean meal and soya hulls and rapeseed meal. Up to 90% of the soyabean and maize products are imported from Argentina, Brazil and the USA. Significant quantities of non-GM maize and oilseed rape meal are  imported from continental Europe, including the Ukraine. </p>  <p>  Due to our high proportion of livestock production compared to tillage area, Ireland is especially dependent on feed imports relative to other EU Member States. Approximately two thirds of the feed materials marketed here are imported, compared to 37% in the UK, 27% in France, and 26% in Germany. The pig, poultry and dairy sectors are particularly dependent on imports of GM soybean and GM maize by-products as they are essential ingredients in the formulation of these feed rations.  </p>  <p>  The EU is only 35% self-sufficient in high-protein supplement supplies for animal feed. Soybean is the most favoured vegetable protein because of its nutritional efficacy and competitive cost. A significant quantity of soybean and maize from North and South America is essential therefore to satisfy the protein requirements in animal nutrition within the EU.  </p>  <p>  Ireland supports increased domestic production of protein crops. The national coupled protein support payment is evidence of that.  Production of these crops in Ireland has been traditionally low. However, since the introduction of the coupled protein payment in 2015, the area of protein crops, mainly beans, has increased from an average of 4,000 ha to over 13,000 ha. The production of pulse crops such as peas and beans also contribute several environmental benefits by fixing nitrogen and adding to diversity in crop rotations.</p>  <p>  Supporting the tillage sector through encouraging the production of protein crops is an important strategic objective of this Department. It is also important however, given our dependence on imported protein for animal nutrition, that access to imports of competitively priced protein from existing sources is maintained.</p></reply>

The scheme conditions also specified that when the person named inherited the lands, he was required to prove that he qualified to retain the farmer rate of payment in his own right. Unfortunately, as that person was not farming, he was unable to do so and consequently, could only continue in the scheme at the non-farmer rate of premium. That rate was lower than the farmer rate and the term of the scheme itself was also shorter, at 15 rather than 20 years.</p>  <p>  The situation was confirmed in writing to the person named in 2007, when the transfer of the forestry contract into his name was completed.

My Department has already contacted those farmers who applied in paper form in 2017 advising them of the new requirement to submit online in 2018, to provide them with guidance material in relation to starting their online application, and to advise them that further supports will be rolled out by my Department in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department will implement a range of supports to farmers over the coming weeks, including a series of BPS clinics in locations throughout the country.  These clinics have proved very successful in recent years, and will be available on a much wider scale this year.  The format will enable farmers to sit with an official from my Department who will guide them through the process of submitting their application online there and then.  The location details in relation to these clinics are currently being finalised.  In the meantime, officials from my Department have been present at the ongoing series of CAP consultation meetings around the country to assist any farmers with queries in relation to online applications.</p>  <p>  Other supports such as telephone help lines and &lsquo;How to&rsquo; guides will also be in place.  As we move towards the application deadline, my Department will be in contact with farmers again to provide further details on available supports.  I am committed to ensuring that the supports being put in place will ensure that all farmers are able to access these important payments.</p></reply>

The measure provides a contribution towards the cost of transporting fodder from areas of surplus to those areas in need, primarily in the West and North West, based on assessment by Teagasc. This measure applies from January 29th 2018 until April 20th 2018.  </p>  <p>  While the areas identified by Teagasc as being the most affected are predominantly located in parts of the West and North West, the measure is not county specific within the region. Teagasc is also monitoring the fodder situation in adjoining areas and will carry further assessments if necessary. As with all measures, certain criteria apply. Farmers, in a locality within the region, identified by Teagasc as having a significant fodder shortage, having completed a fodder budgeting exercise with their FAS agricultural advisor, will be eligible to receive a financial contribution towards the costs of transport of fodder, sourced through the Co-operative system. Only the shortfall in fodder will be eligible to receive support under the measure.  </p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that this is a very targeted and locally focused measure, centring on areas of fodder scarcity where normal local trading in fodder cannot service. At present County Limerick is not identified as an area that currently is experiencing a significant fodder shortage and reports indicate that there is adequate fodder available currently in the county. My Department will continue to monitor the situation.</p></reply>

Special areas of conservation have been designated, in keeping with Ireland's obligations in the Habitats Directive, around many parts of Ireland's coastline. </p><p>The Marine Institute has prepared risk assessment reports under article 6 of the Habitats Directive in respect of all sea-fisheries in or adjacent to all marine SAC sites. Where mitigation responses are required to ensure the protection of designated habitats and species, it is necessary for all stakeholders, particularly the sea-fishing industry and its representatives, to contribute to the development of effective mitigation responses.  As the majority of the marine SACs are based around the coast, my Department, together with the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, continues to work closely with the multi-stakeholder Inshore Fisheries Forums and affected stakeholders to develop mitigation responses.  The relevant reports and mitigation responses are available online at <i>www.fishingnet.ie</i>. </p><p>The Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill 2017 proposes to create a system of licences for individual island fishermen to engage in small scale coastal fishing (defined in EU Regulation as fishing by vessels of less than 12m overall length with non-towed gear).  Small scale coastal fishing is a feature of fishing around the coast with landings into the local ports and harbours, and is important from a socio-economic perspective to many coastal communities and not just the offshore islands.  Small scale coastal fishing is a commercial activity for all these fishermen and supports their livelihood.  </p><p>Under EU Regulation, every commercial sea-fishing boat needs to have a licence, held by the owner of the boat, and in accordance with the Common Fisheries Policy, every Member State must manage the size and scale (capacity) of its fishing fleet. The system of licences proposed in the Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill 2017 cannot alter these requirements. </p><p>Fishing capacity in Ireland, in the form of gross tonnage and engine power, is a privately owned, tradable asset that, with certain exceptions, may be sold, traded or realised as a financial asset on the tonnage market. To licence a sea-fishing boat, capacity must be provided by the applicant as part of the licensing process. </p><p>It is important to be aware that quotas for fish stocks are available to small scale coastal fishermen who are licensed to fish for quota stocks including whitefish and pelagic stocks.  All smaller vessels  receive half of the catch limit allocation of the large vessels and the important pelagic stocks of mackerel and herring already have set-a-side allocations for inshore  vessels (including small scale coastal fishing vessels).</p></reply>

EU Regulations governing the administration of these schemes require that full and comprehensive administrative checks, including in some cases on farm inspections, be completed before any payments issue.</p>  <p>  The application of the person named was selected for a ground eligibility inspection.  This inspection identified an over-declaration in areas exceeding 10% of the area claimed.  This resulted in the area determined being reduced by 1.5 times the difference between the area claimed and area determined. </p>  <p>  A letter detailing the initial inspection findings issued on 11 October 2017 and afforded the  person named the opportunity to submit comments on the findings within 14 days. While comments were received from the person named these were received after the 14 day period and the inspection outcome was finalised and payments due processed. A letter detailing the final outcome of the inspection issued on 27 October 2017.</p>  <p>  However, a review of the case was subsequently undertaken based on the comments received and the outcome of this process did not alter the original inspection findings. A further letter issued to the person named on 19 February detailing the final inspection findings and advising of their option to seek a review of the decision within 28 days of the date of this letter. </p>  <p>  In the event that the person named is dissatisfied with the outcome of any such review, the decision can be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office, within 3 months.</p>  <p>  Payments due under the Basic Payment and Areas of Natural Constraints Schemes, on the basis outlined above, issued to the nominated bank account of the person named on 4 December 2017 and 2 November 2017, respectively. In the event that there is any change to the inspection outcome following any further review, any monies due under these schemes will be processed promptly.</p>  <p>  In relation to GLAS payments, the person named was approved into GLAS 1 with a contract commencement date of 1 October 2015 and has received all payments in respect of 2015 and 2016.</p>  <p>  All GLAS claims must clear validation checks before payment can be made. My Department is working proactively to complete the checks required to allow for the issue of payments. Once this case clears the validations successfully the 2017 advance payment can be processed. GLAS payments are issuing on a weekly basis.</p></reply>

There was a very positive reaction by farmers, including tillage farmers, to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.  The &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Loan Scheme&rdquo; has provided a template for access to finance schemes, including the recently announced &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; for SMEs.  I am also considering the development of a potential Brexit response loan scheme for farmers, fishermen and for longer-term capital financing for food businesses; for which my Department has secured &euro;25 million of funding in 2018.</p>  <p>  As a further support to tillage farmers I introduced the Tillage Capital Investment Scheme under TAMS II which opened for online applications on the 8 March 2017.  The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.  There has been a significant level of interest in investments by the tillage sector, with a total number of 796 applications received so far and 639 approvals.  Over &euro;1.38m has now issued in respect of 126 payment claims. Payments will continue on an ongoing basis.  This is the latest of the Targeted Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  The Scheme is co-funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD)</p>  <p>  While the challenges facing the sector at this point in time are real, in Ireland we can grow cereals with the highest yields in the world and this is an advantage we must press home and look to exploit other areas under our own control, for example, my Department provides a high quality official crop seed certification scheme to the industry in addition to an extensive national crop variety evaluation programme.  I would also encourage tillage growers to fully implement the advice and research provided by Teagasc in relation to efficient and sustainable production of crops.  I remain committed to assisting all involved in the sector to optimise efficiency and sustainability.  Notwithstanding the range of its current supports my Department will continue to closely engage with the tillage sector particularly through the Tillage Stakeholders Group.</p>  <p>  Finally in regard to the Weather Related Crop Loss Support measure I introduced in July 2017; this was a one-off targeted measure in response to the exceptionally challenging harvest conditions of September 2016 and confined to addressing that issue.</p></reply>

Following detailed analysis and public consultation at the formation of the programme, it was concluded that because of its geographic position Ireland is not generally prone to suffering from natural disasters and that pre-existing nationally funded measures are considered to be sufficient to address any possibilities.</p>  <p>  In response to the exceptionally challenging weather conditions experienced during the harvest period in 2016, I introduced a nationally funded Weather Related Crop Loss Support measure  in July 2017.

The Scheme is funded through the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014 - 2020 and it complements the range of other RDP supports available to sheep farmers under schemes such as GLAS, TAMS, Knowledge Transfer and the Areas of Natural Constraint scheme.  </p>  <p>  Advance payments of &euro;16 million at a rate of 85% under the first year of the scheme issued in November 2017.  Balancing payments at a rate of 15% will issue in 2018. This will bring the total for Year 1 of the Scheme to approximately &euro;19m.</p>  <p>  The details of the Sheep Welfare Scheme, including the amount of payment to participants, were approved by the European Commission in 2016.  The payment rates are based on the agreed costings underlying the actions to be undertaken in the scheme, and an increase in the funding allocated to existing actions would thus require changes to the actions currently being undertaken by farmers, or the addition of new actions.  Any such changes to the details of the scheme would require the agreement of the European Commission via the formal Rural Development Programme amendment process.</p></reply>

Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. Since this Government came into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband. This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection.    The specific premises referred to by the Deputy is in an AMBER area on my Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. It is therefore included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan (NBP).</p>  <p>  My Department is in a formal procurement process to engage a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.

I introduced these regulations to deal with a chronic problem with waste tyres in Ireland.  These regulations enabled me to put in place a full compliance scheme for tyre operators, operated by Repak End of Life Tyres (ELT) with a registration and reporting role for the Producer Register Limited.  Under the new regulations, all operators are obliged to provide data on the numbers of tyres coming on and off the Irish market.  This will be the first time that there will be clarity in this regard.  It is mandatory for anyone placing tyres on the market in Ireland to join the compliance scheme.</p>  <p>  The scheme carries out all regulatory functions on behalf of its members and is funded by a visible Environmental Management Charge (vEMC). Under the new Regulations anyone who places a tyre on the market in the State for the first time, including the sale of new vehicles, is obliged to charge the vEMC on these tyres. The vEMC has been set at &euro;2.80 ex VAT for car tyres and &euro;1.50 ex VAT for motorcycle tyres. Setting the vEMC rate for agricultural, construction and truck tyres has been deferred pending the gathering of further market data.</p></reply>

These OES will be subject to a set of binding security obligations and reporting requirements in relation to cyber security incidents affecting them. In addition, the State will be required to apply a new regulatory regime to Digital Service Providers (DSPs), who include cloud computing providers, search engines providers and providers of online market places. </p></reply>

The necessary regulatory steps have been put in place to give effect to this measure. </p><p>It is worth noting that this measure is not &lsquo;new&rsquo; for about half of kerbside household waste customers, who are already on an incentivised usage pricing plan, i.e., a plan which contains a per lift or weight related fee. </p><p>As announced in mid-2017, mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging is not being introduced. Allowing for a range of charging options, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste, provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. Consequently, a pure kilogramme charge for waste collection may not be selected by some households. Instead, some households may use a &lsquo;per lift&rsquo; type charge or a &lsquo;weight allowance&rsquo; collection service.  </p><p>An annual support of &euro;75 per person will be introduced as soon as possible this year and made available for persons with lifelong or long-term medical incontinence. This will help people meet the average annual cost for the disposal of medical incontinence products. My Department is in discussion with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive with a view to finalising the details and arrangements of the support as soon as possible, following further consultation with stakeholder groups.</p></reply>

A key outcome of the decision is that the charging network should not form part of the regulated asset base and therefore expansions of the network should not be funded from network charges. This is in keeping with the proposals set out by the European Commission in the Clean Energy for All Europeans package which was published in 2016. </p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities also envisages the future sale of the infrastructure by ESB Networks. However, the continued ownership of the charging network by ESB Networks for a transitional period of up to ten years is provided for. This ensures no short to medium term impact on the electric vehicle charging infrastructure and allows the ESB to continue to provide electric vehicle charging across Ireland.</p>  <p>  The decision also set out the need for the electric vehicle charging infrastructure to operate on a commercial basis. In the absence of State-led support, this is unlikely to happen in the near term.  Funding has been allocated in my Department's budget this year to support the provision of public charging, with a particular focus on increasing the number of rapid chargers on key national routes.  </p>  <p>  The Low Emissions Vehicle Taskforce, which is co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is considering a range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate the deployment of electric vehicles. A key focus of the work of the Taskforce is examining options for infrastructure, regulation and pricing in order to devise a sustainable policy framework for effective and efficient electric vehicle charging.  This includes examining options for the provision of public charging.  </p></reply>

In accordance with section 59(1) of the Waste Management Act, 1996, each local authority is responsible generally for the supervision and the enforcement of the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the holding, recovery and disposal of waste within its functional area.  Local authorities have specific powers under sections 55 and 56 of the Act to require measures to be taken, or to take measures directly, to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused or likely to be caused by the holding, recovery or disposal of waste, and to mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of any such activity.</p>  <p>  Any incidents of illegal waste activity should be reported to the local authority, who have significant powers available to them to deal with the waste.  However, placing a duty on the authorities to remove all waste from private land could encourage illegal dumping rather than tackle the problem.  People may not pay the costs of legitimate disposal if they knew they could fly-tip it in the nearest field and the local tax payer would foot the clearance bill.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware of the problems caused by illegal dumping, irrespective of the nature of the material being dumped or where it has been dumped.  Illegal dumping and littering is first and foremost a matter of individual responsibility and compliance with the law.  My Department encourages a multi-facetted approach to tackling the problem, incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education and, as such has developed an Anti-Dumping Initiative to work in partnership with local authorities and community organisations in identifying high risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations.  The 2017 Anti-Dumping Initiative saw funding of &euro;1.26 million provided by my Department which supported 229 projects.  These included clean-ups of private lands where it was apparent to the local authority that the landowners were not complicit in waste being dumped there.  This year, I am increasing the allocation to &euro;2 million to build on the momentum that has now been created and to provide for an increased focus on identifying and prosecuting illegal dumpers. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government states that an LNG facility on the island of Ireland would be a positive step, and commits to examining if there are ways to facilitate LNG on the island of Ireland, noting that the regulation of the gas market is the responsibility of the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities.    </p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government and the Government&rsquo;s Energy Policy Paper, &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Transition to a Low-carbon Energy Future, 2015-2030&rdquo;, the potential for LNG is being examined as part of the study my Department is carrying out, in conjunction with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, Gas Networks Ireland and EirGrid, on Ireland&rsquo;s resilience to a long term gas disruption.  This study will inform the formulation of future policy measures to maintain the resilience of Ireland&rsquo;s gas and electricity networks and supply.</p>  <p>  Some private sector commercial LNG projects have been proposed in Ireland recently.  The location, development and final investment decisions for these projects are ultimately the responsibility of the project promoters.

Under the Waste Management (Shipments of Waste) Regulations 2007, Dublin City Council was designated as the National Competent Authority for all waste exports and imports and the National Transfrontier Waste Shipment Office (NTFSO) was established under the auspices of Dublin City Council.  The primary aim of the Regulations is to prevent the illegal shipment of waste abroad, and to assist businesses engaged in legitimate waste export activities.</p>  <p>  The NTFSO imposes charges on its customers with the aim of fully recouping costs incurred in the performance of its duties as competent authority for the purposes of the Waste Shipments Regulations.  In March 2008, the then Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government made a payment of &euro;500,000 to Dublin City Council as a contribution towards the fit-out costs of the NTFSO, which had been established in July 2007.  The NTFSO also received payments from the Department in 2009 of &euro;560,000 and 2010 of &euro;600,000 to assist with refund payments in cases where notified shipments were cancelled or where the volumes of waste shipped were less than the notified amount due to the downturn in the economy.  The European Waste Shipments Regulation allows competent authorities to apply charges to waste notifiers in respect of the administrative costs of implementing the notification and supervision procedures and the NTFSO is now recouping its costs in full with no subvention from my Department.</p>  <p>  Since April 2012, the NTFSO has implemented a fee in respect of minor infringements of the Waste Shipments Regulations, such as incomplete documentation as an enforcement tool.  This was introduced following consultation with the Irish Waste Management Association.  The NTFSO&rsquo;s Monitoring &amp;amp; Repatriation Fee Policy details specific incidents when these fees should be applied.  A monitoring fee of &euro;350 is applied in respect of the cost of investigating cases where a breach of the regulations occurred but no prosecution was taken.  It should be noted that the NTFSO reserves the right to take legal action if it is warranted in certain circumstances, such as for repeated breaches of the Regulations or in relation to non-compliance with directions issued, and since 2009, the NTFSO has taken 31 successful prosecutions under the Waste Shipment Regulations with &euro;59,000 in fines being imposed together with &euro;92,791 in costs being awarded. </p>  <p>  As the competent authority for Ireland, Dublin City Council is responsible for implementing an enforcement regime and applying penalties for non-compliance with the Waste Shipments Regulations.  An enforcement team has been put in place for this purpose and to carry out joint inspections with various national and international organisations.  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for staffing and organisation arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.</p>  <p>  As Minister, I am precluded under Section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996 from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance, in specific cases, by a local authority of their statutory functions under the Act.  Notwithstanding, my Department is satisfied as to the efficiency of the TFS office operations and given past incidents concerning unauthorised movements of waste across the border, it is entirely appropriate that a robust system of checks and proportionate enforcement is deployed as deemed necessary by the TFS office.</p></reply>

Across the EU there is no maximum weight 'norm' for such vehicles and a lacuna in Ireland's Construction and Use of Vehicles Regulations has meant that a maximum weight limit for such vehicles has hitherto remained unstipulated.</p>  <p>  It is precisely to correct this regulatory anomaly that Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the Road Safety Authority (RSA), were tasked with analysing the pavement wear effects of this 39 tonne variant, as well as the associated vehicle standard related requirements attaching to the operation of 5 axle rigids in Ireland</p>  <p>  The results of TII's commissioned study concluded that, because of their shorter wheel base they impacted negatively on both our bridge infrastructure and pavements.  In circumstances, where in real terms, road maintenance funding has been severely cut over successive years, it was therefore recommended that the maximum regulatory weight limit for such vehicles should be set at 36 tonnes and came into effect on 1 February 2018.</p>  <p>  The 5 axle (2 axle tractor unit towing a 3 axle semi-trailer) articulated vehicles experienced a derogation permitting a maximum weight laden limit of 42 tonnes which expired on 30 June 2017.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I must have regard to the overarching need to maintain national transport infrastructure in as cost effective manner as possible.  It is primarily for this reason, as well as the time given to the industry to adjust, that the previous derogation has not been renewed.</p>  <p>  I have no proposals to revisit the present situation in respect of either 5 axle articulated or 5 axle non-articulated vehicles.</p></reply>

With the Green Line now extended to Broombridge, and providing interchange with the Red Line and greater connectivity to rail services, those numbers are likely to grow substantially again in 2018.  While it is welcomed that so many new customers are using the extended Green Line, it has meant that, at certain times of the day, some trams are operating at capacity. </p>  <p>  The Luas Cross City project included the purchase of seven additional new trams which, at 55 metre length, have a higher passenger capacity than existing trams, carrying up to 379 passengers per tram and increasing overall capacity on the Green Line.  The first of these additional trams very recently came into service.  Two more are currently in Ireland undergoing final testing and commissioning.  One of these is expected to go into passenger service by the end of this week with the second to go into service about a week or so later, at the start of March.  The remaining four trams - following the necessary final testing and commissioning - will be put into service progressively over the coming weeks during March, April and May.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Green Line Capacity Enhancement project was recently approved by Government.  The purpose of the project is to further increase capacity at peak hours on the Luas Green Line and to cater for future demands along the line.  The project is proposed in the National Transport Authority's (NTA) Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035.  It includes the lengthening of the 26 existing Green line trams from 43 metres to 55 metres and the purchase of a further 8 new 55 metre-long trams which will greatly increase the passenger capacity of the fleet now and to meet future passenger demand.  The capacity increases at peak periods provided by the project will assist in reducing crowding on the Green Line and enhance accessibility for mobility and sensory impaired users during these periods.  A necessary complementary investment project, known as the Green Line Infrastructure Upgrade - an investment project to lengthen the platforms at the existing Green Line stations - was completed towards the end of last year and enables the use of the new, longer trams.  </p>  <p>  With regard to planning and managing the impact of Luas on other traffic, the Deputy may recall that Dublin City Council and the NTA jointly published the Dublin City Centre Transport Study in 2015 which sets out the various measures proposed for Dublin's city centre to ensure the efficient functioning of transport within the city centre and that also took into account the introduction of the Luas Cross City Project. </p>  <p>  A number of changes have been made throughout the city centre over the last six months to accommodate the operation of the new Luas Cross City line.  The most significant changes were the introduction of the additional bus lanes along the North and South Quays last August.  In addition, there has been a host of other junction and traffic signal changes implemented in advance of the Luas Cross City becoming operational.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore it was recognised that the College Green area would be unable to cater for the same number of vehicles as it had previously, following the introduction of the Luas trams.  Addressing this, a separate proposal for a civic plaza at College Green was developed by the City Council, and this proposal also provides for revised traffic arrangements through this area.  The College Green civic plaza proposal is currently with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for determination and, if approved, would remove a lot of the conflicting traffic movements that currently exist in College Green. </p>  <p>  In advance of a rescheduled Oral Hearing, the NTA, in collaboration with Dublin Bus and Dublin City Council, have proceeded to reduce bus vehicle volumes passing through the area, which would allow the junctions and signals to function more effectively.  The combined effect of these changes has been to reduce the volume of buses passing through the College Green and College Street area, by about 20% in order to reduce the delay issues arising in this area.</p>  <p>  I am advised that these parties continue to keep the situation under review. </p></reply>

In addition, the Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to proceed with the metro scheme.</p>  <p>  The recently published Project Ireland 2040 now proposes to take forward a Metro Link scheme to run from Swords, via Dublin Airport to Dublin&rsquo;s south city centre (operating in tunnel under the city centre) and onwards to Sandyford using the existing Luas Green Line to ensure that growth along this corridor can be accommodated.  This will provide Dublin with a high capacity, high-frequency cross-city rail corridor serving critical destinations such as Swords, Dublin Airport, Dublin City University, Ballymun, the Mater Hospital and existing destinations along the Luas Green Line to Sandyford.  Metro Link will provide faster reliable journey times to and from these key destinations while offering interchange with other rail, DART Expansion, light rail and bus services. </p>  <p>  The next steps are that the details of the Metro Link scheme (Swords to Sandyford) will put out to public consultation in the coming weeks, with construction expected to commence in 2021 with a view to delivering the project by 2027.</p></reply>

Early years and school age childcare services may apply for funding to create new childcare places under Strand 1 and Strand 4 of the 2018 Capital programmes respectively.</p>  <p>  Early Years Strand 1 provides for a maximum of &euro;50,000 in grant funding, while School Age Strand 2 provides for a maximum of &euro;20,000. Services may apply for either or both strands, provided that they meet the basic eligibility requirements &mdash; including minimum additional new places created under the respective programmes &mdash; for each. </p>  <p>  Services may apply for funding for capital projects for which costs exceed the maximum grant allowable. As stated in the applicant guidelines published on 1 February 2018, applicants must provide evidence of having the additional funds to pay for the total cost of the project where the cost is greater than the amount of grant applied for under this strand. For example, bank statements verifying the additional funds or a letter of offer of funding or contract from another funder or loan agreement. In doing so, applicants demonstrate the overall viability of the project concerned. </p>  <p>  I can assure you also that the representation made on behalf the childcare organisation in question is being dealt with by officials in my Department at present, and a written response will be issued as soon as is possible.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work involving approximately 1,400 youth work staff  working in youth services and communities throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  In 2018, &euro;58.9 m has been allocated in current funding to support the provision of youth services, an increase of &euro;7m on 2016.

This will provide an opportunity to identify need and to focus funding on young people most in need of intervention.  Last year, I approved funding for the establishment of new youth projects and for the augmentation of a small number of existing youth services to meet new challenges arising from population increases. </p>  <p>  Each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards, including Cork ETB, was invited to nominate locations within their catchment areas for the establishment of new services and to nominate a project or service to be considered for augmentation. In total twenty-eight applications for new services were received.  Subsequently  I approved the establishment of nine new targeted youth services across the country and the expansion of a further seven to respond to new demand from increased population and needs of young people which included a new service in Mitchelstown and an augmented service in Midleton.</p>  <p>  Future development and investment in youth services will be informed by the mapping exercise completed last year which mapped youth service provision across the State. This mapping will assist the Department and the relevant ETB in developing a detailed social demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels.  My Department is committed to working with Cork ETB to identify need and explore ways to address this need where it emerges.</p></reply>

The landholders receive modest payments for maintenance work undertaken, in line with agreed work plans. </p>  <p>  The scheme currently covers 39 trails, with payments made to approximately 1,900 landholders to maintain those trails.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government and the Action Plan for Rural Development include a commitment to increase the number of trails covered by the Walks Scheme and my officials are working towards this objective.

This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities now being asked to map local black spots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage.</p>  <p>  This work will continue in 2018 and has been included as an action in this year's work programme of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Group.</p>  <p>  In addition, ComReg will shortly launch a scheme for the use of mobile phone repeaters, which will allow householders and businesses to boost signals into their premises, and bring immediate improvements in mobile phone coverage.</p></reply>

This includes any supports, including financial, that are required by either the foster parents or the foster children that specifically relate to fostering.</p><p>Under the current social welfare legislation in order to qualify for payment of OFP, an applicant must be a qualified parent of at least one relevant child who is ordinarily resident in the State, is not detained in a children detention school, and has not attained the relevant age.  The relevant age is currently 7 years of age.  There are special provisions for OFP recipients who have a child on Domiciliary Care Allowance, are on the half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or are on the Blind Pension that extend payment until the youngest child reaches 16 years of age.  There is also a &lsquo;recently bereaved&rsquo; special provision that extends payment for up to 2 years of until the youngest child is 18 whichever occurs first.  Additional scheme conditions also apply.</p><p>A qualified parent is: </p><p>(a) a widow, </p><p>(b) a widower, </p><p>(c) a separated spouse, </p><p>(d) an unmarried person, </p><p>(e) a person whose spouse or civil partner has been committed in custody to a prison or place of detention for not less than 6 months, or </p><p>(f) a surviving civil partner,</p><p>(g) a civil partner who is not living with the other civil partner of the civil partnership, or</p><p>(h) a person who is not a party to a civil partnership. </p><p>who is the parent, step-parent, adoptive parent, or legal guardian of at least one relevant child, who normally resides with that person.  Additional qualifying conditions also apply.</p><p>To be a qualified parent the applicant must therefore be legally defined as either the parent or guardian of the relevant child.  A foster parent is not the legal parent or guardian of the foster child and as such is not a qualified parent and cannot qualify for OFP with the foster child as the relevant child.</p><p>Lone foster parents are treated in the same manner as all lone parents in terms of the social welfare income support payments that are available to them from this Department &ndash; assuring, in the process, equal treatment for all lone parents.  All lone parents must satisfy the conditionality requirements of the OFP scheme.</p><p>While there are no specific provisions for foster children in the legislation relating the OFP scheme, provision is effectively made for foster children on the basis of the legislation covering the payment of increases for qualified children (IQCs).  This legislation provides that, where the relevant conditions are met, all qualified children &ndash; including foster children &ndash; will be paid as a child dependent on these schemes.  On that basis, foster children are treated in the same manner as the recipient&rsquo;s own children, once the recipient has an underlying entitlement to the scheme.  For example, if a foster parent has children of his/her own one of whom is under 7 years of age, and meets the other conditions of the OFP scheme, s/he can qualify for OFP and will be paid an IQC for his/her own children and the foster child.</p><p>In addition foster care allowances from Tusla are not taken into account in the means test for social welfare payments.  Where a child has been placed in foster care by Tusla and the child has been in the continuous care of the foster parent(s) for 6 months, Child Benefit may then transfer to the foster parent(s).</p><p>I do not currently have plans to include a foster parent in the definition of a qualified parent for the purposes of determining eligibility for one-parent family payment (OFP).</p></reply>

The interdepartmental group considered a range of approaches across relevant Departments to deliver on this commitment and made 24 recommendations under the broad headings of: reconfiguring the system of supports to ensure that work pays; promoting early intervention; communicating effectively that work pays and future proofing.  The report provides time frames for the various recommendations extending up to the first quarter of 2019.</p><p>Recommendation number 24 provides that the Department of Justice and Equality undertake an annual review of the delivery of actions recommended in the MWP report and a report by my Department will be prepared in that context.  In the meantime, the table below provides the status of recommendations assigned to my department particularly for those with a timeframe to end 2017.

This reform plan will detail measures to reform both our State and supplementary pension systems.</p>  <p>  Perhaps the two most fundamental reform measures contained within this plan will relate to the introduction of the &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; for the State pension contributory from 2020 and the development of a new automatic enrolment retirement savings system for employees without supplementary pensions coverage.</p>  <p>  It is proposed that the &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; (TCA) will replace the current &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system from 2020.  This will make the level of pension more directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life, with significant pension credits granted to people who have taken time out of the workplace to perform caring duties.  The TCA will eliminate the anomalies inherent in the current averaging system whereby a person can qualify for a full pension based on a small number of years of payments (currently as little as 10 years' contributions) provided they have no gaps in their record, whereas a person with more than 10 years contributions but with a significant gap in their record might be paid a reduced rate.</p>  <p>  Automatic enrolment would see a transition from the current and purely voluntary supplementary pension system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  It is planned that this reform, where the saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt out, will include employer and State financial incentives to encourage long term saving and asset accumulation amongst those who may otherwise suffer a reduction in living standards at retirement.  It will increase the wellbeing, financial security, and independence of future retirees.</p>  <p>  It is intended that following publication of the reform plan, two separate public consultation processes will be launched on the &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; and automatic enrolment.  The purpose of both of these consultations will be to inform the design of both systems.  The details and timeframe of them will be confirmed subsequent to the publication of the reform plan although I can say it is my intention to begin them by Q2 of this year.</p>  <p>  With regard to the second part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the wind-up options in section 48 of the Pensions Act 1990, as amended, are contingent on the requirement that the scheme&rsquo;s policies or contracts are approved by the Revenue Commissioners under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended.  The Pensions Act sets out the circumstances in which retirement benefit schemes are approved by the Revenue Commissioners for tax purposes.  In other words, transfers from the scheme being wound up must be made into schemes or products approved by the Revenue Commissioners and which, therefore, comply with Revenue rules.  Section 772 of the Taxes Consolidation Act allows for flexible options on retirement, i.e., the Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) option.  The purchase of an ARF is not available to members of defined benefit schemes, subject to certain exceptions.  Legislation and policy on taxes and access to ARFs are a matter for the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

According to the records of my Department, the person concerned has a social insurance record of 1,133 reckonable paid and credited contributions, from 1965 to 2014 giving them a yearly average of 28.  In arriving at this yearly average, disregards for homemaking periods were applied. This entitled the person concerned to a reduced rate pension entitlement. </p>  <p>  However, the spouse of the person concerned qualified for an increase for qualified adult at a higher rate.  As this was more financially advantageous, the increase for qualified adult in respect of the person concerned was awarded and paid.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government recently announced proposals that pensioners who qualified for state pension (contributory) since September 2012, and whose rate of entitlement was impacted by the 2012 rate band change, may apply for a review to have their entitlement considered under a new Total Contribution Approach (TCA).  It will take some time to draft and pass the necessary legislation, and then develop the systems and procedures necessary to administer the new pension entitlement option.

My Department will spend approximately &euro;237 million this year on the household benefits package for over 435,000 customers.  </p><p>Disability related payments that are qualifying payments for HHB include:</p><p>- Invalidity Pension</p><p>- Disability Allowance</p><p>- Blind Person's Pension</p><p>- Incapacity Supplement or Workmen's Compensation, with Disablement Pension, for at least 12 months</p><p>- a Social Security Invalidity Pension/Benefit (from a foreign Social Security Agency) or equivalent payment for at least 12 months, from a country covered by EC Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement.</p><p>- Disability Living Allowance with Severe Disablement Allowance (from the United Kingdom) for at least 12 month </p><p>My Department pays a bulk payment to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment for the free television licence element of the HHB package.  Customers entitled to this element of the HHB package do not receive any cash payment. </p><p>I have no plans at this time to expand entitlement for receipt of HHB to include people with disabilities who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment from my Department or to introduce a scheme that will provide payment to persons with a disability to pay their TV licence.  Any decision to do so would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

There are robust arrangements in place for dealing with complaints of bogus self-employment.  Social welfare inspectors inspect a wide range of businesses, as part of their on-going compliance operations. Inspections are also undertaken jointly with other agencies including the Revenue Commissioners and Workplace Relations Commission.  Where evidence of non-compliance is detected, this will be pursued. </p>  <p>  While there have been no targeted investigations of the film industry, officials investigate specific cases referred to my Department&rsquo;s Scope section.  This section determines employment status and the correct class of pay-related social insurance (PRSI).  Where misclassification of workers as self-employed is detected, the correct status and class is determined and social insurance arrears are collected as required.  Under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, there are specific offences in relation to employment contributions.  On conviction, fines and or imprisonment can ultimately be imposed. </p>  <p>  In 2009 the Revenue Commissioners issued a Guidance Note, &ldquo;Taxation of individuals engaged in the Irish film industry&rdquo; which provided advice on the issue of self-employment, including the type of occupations that could be considered to be self-employments in the context of that industry.</p>  <p>  All employers, including those in the film industry, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment and social welfare law.  Any worker who has concerns about their employment and PRSI status should contact my Department and the matter will be investigated. This can only happen with the cooperation of the worker.</p></reply>

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay PRSI Class A at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.85% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.85% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;376 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 8.6%).</p><p>Self-employed workers who become ill may access social insurance supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as disability allowance.  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings. </p><p>Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person&rsquo;s income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for disability allowance, the means of spouse, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p><p>There is also a Voluntary Contribution Scheme which allows those who are no longer working or who otherwise are not paying PRSI, to protect their PRSI entitlement to certain social insurance benefit, including state pension.  A person can apply to join the scheme from 1 year to 5 years from the end of the year in which contributions were last paid, as an employee or as a self-employed worker. </p><p>Voluntary Contributions (VCs) are designed to facilitate employees and self-employed individuals, who are no longer paying PRSI, to pay contributions directly to the Department on a voluntary basis, to protect their future state pension contributory, widow(er)&rsquo;s contributory pension and guardian&rsquo;s contributory pension entitlements.  </p><p>The scheme is most frequently used by employees who have retired early, or by self-employed individuals who are not required to pay PRSI Class S because their annual income falls below the annual &euro;5,000 liability threshold.  To become a voluntary contributor an individual must have paid at least 520 weeks of compulsory PRSI from either employment or self-employment prior to application.  <b></b></p><p>Budget 2017 introduced a range of improvements for the self-employed.  Since March 2017, self-employed people now have access to the Treatment Benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental exams, and contributions towards the cost of hearings aids.  Treatment benefit entitlements was also extended in October 2017 so as to provide further Dental and Optical Benefits for both the self-employed and employees.  </p><p>Self-employed workers are also eligible for the Invalidity Pension from December 2017.  This is a major reform as, for the first time, self-employed people have access to the safety-net of State income supports, without having to go through a means test, if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability.</p></reply>

First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through Pathways to Work, to ensure that as many as possible of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register, including young people. </p><p>Under the Government&rsquo;s policies to support the young unemployed, the first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  There is monthly engagement with all young jobseekers by a case officer, and a Personal Progression Plan is developed to chart the steps to be taken to facilitate a return to employment, which may include further education and training or other opportunities. </p><p>For those who do not find employment, through the process just described, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes/workplace based interventions such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s and First Steps; or in subsidies to employers, through JobsPlus Youth.  Long-term unemployed jobseekers under-25 are also referred to JobPath, a contracted, payment-by-results employment services that provides additional resources and supports to those long-term unemployed.</p><p>The strategy document<i>Pathways to Work 2016 to 2020</i>includes some additional actions in relation to addressing youth unemployment:</p><p>1) increase the relative share of workplace-based interventions (Gateway, T&Uacute;S, Positive to Work etc.) for youth unemployed;</p><p>2) ensure the frequency of engagement with all young unemployed people is a minimum of one case officer meeting per month;</p><p>3) restructure the First Steps programme for young unemployed people to improve take-up by offering a higher level of support to jobseekers and employers</p><p>4) implement the Defence Forces Skills for Life employment support programme.  </p><p>Each of these actions is either ongoing or has been completed.</p><p>Later this year I will be introducing a new work experience programme targeted specifically at young jobseekers who are long-term unemployed or who face significant barriers to gaining employment.  The new Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) will provide them with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement.  Operational details are currently being finalised and I hope to launch the Scheme during Quarter 2 this year.</p><p>Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall with a rate of 13.7% (34,300 persons) in January 2018 estimated by CSO, as compared to 14.6% (42,100 persons) in January 2017 and a peak rate of almost 32% in 2012.  (The actual number of young people unemployed is estimated to have peaked at 97,800 persons in late 2010.) </p><p>Eurostat figures indicate that the number of young people in full-time employment has grown from 84,000 in mid-2012 to 138,000 in mid-2017. </p><p>I am satisfied that the current policy approach, together with an improving labour market, will continue to address youth unemployment and support further improvements in the labour market situation for young people.</p></reply>

Each scheme area is continuously monitored and reviewed to ensure customers are responded to as quickly as possible, and their applications are processed as expeditiously as possible.  </p><p>All applications are registered promptly. In some schemes, this is done through the scanning of claim documents onto the system while, in other schemes, this involves an officer inputting data.

Delays can also arise where information is required from social security organisations in other jurisdictions and where additional information has been requested from the applicant but remains outstanding.  </p><p>This means that processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria. For example, in January 2018, it took on average 1 week to award a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment, which is based on social insurance contributions, while it took 2 weeks to award a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment, which is means-tested.</p><p>In the same month, it took on average:</p><p>- 10 weeks to award an application for carer&rsquo;s benefit, which is based on a medical assessment of care requirements, an assessment of the level of care being provided and social insurance contributions; while</p><p>- an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance took 18 weeks to award, which has similar medical and care provision conditionality but it is also means-tested.</p><p>As part of the Department&rsquo;s programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised. </p><p>The staffing needs for all areas within my Department are continuously reviewed, taking account of workloads, management priorities and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  This is done with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department. </p><p>The table sets out the average time to award for the principal schemes operated by my Department in January 2018.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p><p><b>Average time to award for principal DEASP schemes, January 2018</b><table><tr><th>Schemes</th><th>Average time to award (weeks)</th></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>One-Parent Family Payment</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension Contributory (Domestic)</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Widow, Widower&rsquo;s and Surviving Civil Partners Contributory Pension </td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Widowed Parent Grant</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension Non-Contributory</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Household Benefits</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Free Travel</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare Allowance</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit (Domestic &amp;amp; FRA)</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit (Over 16)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit (Additional Child)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Paternity Benefit</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Carer's Allowance</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Carer's Benefit</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td>6</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Department may make an urgent needs payment (UNP) to a person who may not normally qualify for SWA but who has an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or an alternative is not available at that time.  The Government has provided over &euro;36.4 million for ENPs and UNPs in 2018. </p>  <p>  The ENP scheme is demand led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance. </p>  <p>  The legislation does not confer a statutory right or entitlement to ENPs.  The guidelines issued to staff administering the ENP scheme assist them in the decision making process.  The principal consideration in making a payment under the ENP scheme is to address a particular once-off and exceptional need.  The guidelines do not affect the discretion available to officers in issuing an ENP to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise, so that the payments target those most in need of assistance.</p>  <p>  Statistics are maintained relating to payments under the ENP and UNP schemes, however they are not maintained on the number of applications or the outcome of those applications.  There were over 103,000 ENPs and UNPs issued under the scheme in 2017. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy has concerns in respect of a particular case he should bring it to the attention of the Department. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

For illness benefit claims made in 2018, the governing contribution year is 2016.  Where the average weekly earnings are &euro;300 or more the personal rate of payment is &euro;193 weekly (this will increase to &euro;198 per week, from the 26<sup>th</sup>of March 2018). </p><p>The table outlines the current graduated rates payable. These rates will all proportionately increase as a result of Budget 2018 from the last week of March 2018.<table><tr><th>Average weekly earnings </th><th>Personal rate </th></tr><tr><td>Less than &euro;150.00</td><td>&euro;86.70</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;150.00 and less than &euro;220.00</td><td>&euro;124.60</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;220.00 and less than &euro;300.00</td><td>&euro;151.20</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;300.00 or more</td><td>&euro;193.00</td></tr></table></p><p>Graduated rates were introduced in 1993 with the extension of full social insurance cover to part-time workers from April 1991.  In the absence of graduated rates, a situation would exist whereby part-time workers on low incomes would have access to weekly social welfare payments in excess of their income from employment.  For instance, someone earning &euro;38 a week or more is liable for PRSI Class A contributions.  Given that the maximum personal rate of these schemes is currently &euro;193 a week, without graduated rates, the social welfare benefits available would be more than five times the level of income from employment for some people. </p><p>It should be noted that a recipient of a graduated rate of illness benefit with limited means can claim Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) as a &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; payment if the rate of illness benefit is below the maximum rate of SWA, subject to meeting the scheme criteria.  Application may be made to the Community Welfare Services at the local Intreo Centre.</p><p>If a recipient of a graduated rate of illness benefit is medically assessed as being incapable of work for the next 12 months and satisfies the PRSI contribution requirements, he or she can apply for the Invalidity Pension scheme, which has a higher rate of payment than Illness Benefit.  </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Overall, 59.2% of the 23,220 appeals which were finalised in 2016 had a favourable outcome for the appellant, i.e. were either allowed in full or in part, or resolved by way of a revised decision by a Deciding Officer/Designated Person.  60.1% of the 18,980 appeals finalised in 2017 had a favourable outcome for the appellant. </p><p>Of the 16,990 appeals which were finalised by Appeals Officers in 2016, 6,527 (38.4%) were determined following an oral hearing.  4,251 (65.1%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.  Of the 13,556 appeals finalised by Appeals Officers in 2017, 5,412 (39.9%) were determined following an oral hearing.  3,444 (63.6%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.</p><p>There are a number of reasons why a decision which was refused at first instance might be successful on appeal and it is not necessarily the case that the first decision was wrong. </p><p>Where new evidence is provided with an appeal the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person as was the case in some 37 per cent of favourable appeal outcomes in both 2016 and 2017.  Where the decision was not revised in the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds and in addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at the oral hearing which may influence the outcome of the appeal.</p><p>Decisions concerning entitlement to a social welfare payment or insurability of employment often require a high level of judgment and may involve complex legal questions.  The Courts have found that decision makers are required to be free and unrestricted in discharging their functions.</p><p>Where an appellant requests an oral hearing, the request is generally granted unless the Appeals Officer is of the opinion that the appeal can be allowed on a summary basis, or where there is clearly nothing to be gained by granting an oral hearing, for example where the appeal question relates to contribution conditions or means and the underlying PRSI contribution figures or means are not disputed.  Social Welfare legislation provides that an Appeals Officer may determine an appeal without an oral hearing where s/he is of the opinion that it can be determined fairly on the basis of the documentary evidence provided.  In general, where there is a conflict in the documentary evidence presented, an Appeals Officer will convene an oral hearing in order to explore the evidence and seek to resolve any conflict.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b><font color="#2F2F2F">ppeal Receipts 2016 &ndash;

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-20a.1508.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022000089#WRFF02000"><p>Self-employed workers who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year, are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.  This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.</p>  <p>  This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the PRSI Class A rate of 4%.  In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.   </p>  <p>  The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published in October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.</p>  <p>  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure. In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers were to be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the actuarial review&rsquo;s findings.</p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.</p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for PRSI Class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  </p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the Class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.</p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension contributory.  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.</p>  <p>  The findings of the Review will play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the SIF in the years ahead, including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.</p></reply>

Irish youth unemployment has thus fallen from well above the EU average in 2012 (23%) to well below the current figure EU figure of 19.1%.  The long-term unemployment rate for young people has fallen from over 15% at peak to below 4% in the third quarter of 2017. </p>  <p>  Youth unemployment figures can be expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecast fall in overall unemployment.  Additionally, Ireland is on course to bring youth unemployment below 12% and long-term unemployment below 2.5% in accordance with Pathways to Work targets for 2020.</p>  <p>  These trends indicate that together with improvements in the labour market and economic recovery, our approach to youth employment, which focuses in the first instance on enhancing processes and policies for assisting young unemployed people to find and secure sustainable jobs, has been relatively successful.</p>  <p>  Under the Youth Guarantee process case officers engage with unemployed young people, on a monthly basis, to prepare and implement personal progression plans for employment.  Where young people do not find work quickly, additional supports are offered through places on employment and training schemes. </p>  <p>  As part of this range of opportunities, later this year I will be introducing a new work experience programme targeted exclusively at young jobseekers who are long-term unemployed and face a significant barrier to gaining employment.</p>  <p>  The Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) will provide young job seekers with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement. Host Organisations will be encouraged to hire participants who have performed well and will qualify for a financial subsidy under JobsPlus Youth.  YESS will compliment other initiatives such as the expanded range of Apprenticeships and Career Traineeships.  Operational details are currently being finalised and I hope to launch the Scheme in Q.2, 2018.  </p>  <p>  I am confident that these measures, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in youth unemployment and add to the substantial improvements that have already been seen over the last few years. </p></reply>

First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through Pathways to Work to ensure that as many of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register, and in particular the long-term unemployed. </p>  <p>  To date, these policies have been effective in reducing long-term unemployment.  For example, the most recent data show that the rate of long-term unemployment in Ireland has fallen from a peak of 9.5% in 2012 to 2.8%. in Q3, 2017.  This downward trend indicates that Ireland is well on course to bring long-term unemployment below 2.5% in accordance with Pathways to Work   targets for 2020, and maybe even improve on it.</p>  <p>  Policy continues to focus on support for the long-term unemployed.  For example, the Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy prioritises long-term unemployed people &ndash; most notably through the roll-out of JobPath to engage more systematically with this group; through targeted wage subsidies under JobsPlus; and through reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on employment and training programmes.  </p>  <p>  I am confident these measures, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in long-term unemployment and add to the substantial improvements that have already been seen over the last few years.</p></reply>

Where the decision was not revised in the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds and in addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at oral hearing which may influence the outcome of the appeal.</p><p>Decisions concerning entitlement to a social welfare payment or insurability of employment often require a high level of judgment and may involve complex legal questions.

In this regard, it is a matter for the Chief Executive of Dublin City Council to ensure that the correct procedures are applied to starting pay on recruitment from open competitions.</p>  <p>  In January 2011, my Department conveyed instructions through Circular 02/2011, set out below, to all local authorities in relation to a Government decision, that starting pay on recruitment from open competitions should be at the minimum point of the relevant scale.  It is open to a Chief Executive to make a business case to my Department should they feel a candidate's experience warrants a higher placing on a pay scale; however this is something that is only used in exceptional cases. </p>  <p>  In 2015, my Department conveyed an instruction to local authorities through Circular 05/2016, also below, with regard to the scenario where a public servant moving from one public sector organisation to another retains their salary level if they are moving to a post that is analogous to the one they are moving from.  However, from the details supplied, this scenario does not apply given it involves a downward grade move i.e. from Senior Quantity Surveyor to the grade below that, Executive Quantity Surveyor.  The fact that the candidate is first on the panel bears no relevance or entitlement to their placing on an incremental scale; the same rules apply regardless of a candidate's position on a panel.</p>  <p>  In this instance, it would appear that Dublin City Council has correctly applied the rules relating to starting pay.</p></reply>

Meath which resulted in a water use ban affecting some 1,200 persons being imposed on 7 February 2018.  I understand that following the successful resolution of the matter, normal water service was restored to the homes concerned on 8 February 2018.</p>  <p>  Chlorine is the most commonly used disinfectant in water treatment in Ireland.  It is added at the water treatment plant and for larger networks may require boosting at key locations including reservoirs and pumping stations to ensure the correct levels of chlorine are maintained throughout the entire network. </p>  <p>  I understand that Irish Water is currently undertaking a national programme of works to improve the quality of drinking water and increase water quality compliance levels across the country.  As part of this programme over &euro;40 million is to be invested in the upgrade and standardisation of disinfection systems currently installed in over 830 public drinking water treatment plants. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Irish Water that the Disinfection Programme is being carried out in two phases.  Phase 1 involves the assessment of the condition and performance of the existing disinfection systems at water treatment plants across the country.  This will determine the works required to ensure that the treatment plant disinfection process meets the specified requirements.  Phase 2 then involves carrying out any necessary upgrade works.  Such works may include upgrade of chemical storage and treatment processing infrastructure, upgrade of ultraviolet (UV) disinfection systems, upgrade of monitoring systems and generation of Critical Process Alarms.</p>  <p>  Irish Water is currently identifying and planning the appropriate mitigation measures to be carried out at water treatment plants throughout the country to achieve water quality compliance.  To date, Irish Water has assessed over 450 sites and commenced upgrades to over 130 water treatment plants.</p>  <p>  Chlorine levels in drinking water are monitored primarily via a rigorous sampling programme which tests the levels of chlorine in the water at various points from the treatment plant to the customer&rsquo;s tap.  Any changes to chlorine levels are fully investigated and any necessary actions agreed.  This monitoring programme is supplemented by alarms which can alert to issues often associated with the point at which chlorine is added.  To ensure a fully robust system all points of chlorine addition will be considered over time including the boosting points along a network.  Irish Water has begun this process, which will take some time to complete given the vast amount of assets to be audited and adjusted when reservoirs, pumping stations and boosting points within a network are included. </p></reply>

The local authority MPI scheme has applied to all house purchase loans approved by local authorities after 1 July 1986 including the new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan introduced on 1 February 2018. </p>  <p>  The Consumer Credit Act 1995 applied conditions on lenders which applied to local authorities as well as commercial lenders.  Under section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 the lender is legally required to ensure that a prospective borrower has mortgage protection insurance in place before drawing down a mortgage.  Where a lender offers a particular policy sub-section 2(d) of section 126 of the Act provides that the borrower can source an alternative policy to suit their needs.  However, sub-section 2(d) does not apply to local authorities. </p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme.  Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers.  The group policy is a commercial insurance product which is procured in accordance with EU procurement rules.  A local authority housing loan applicant who is not eligible for the local authority MPI scheme must source a suitable comparable individual MPI policy from the market. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the local authority MPI scheme covers disability as well as death and that the disability cover is for the full period of the disability and not just 12 months as is the case in the majority of MPI policies available. </p>  <p>  Standard MPI products are individually priced based on a member's age, amongst other factors, whereas the local authority MPI scheme is a group arrangement offering a single group rate per &euro;1,000 sum assured to all participants in the scheme.  Aside from the difference between an individual and a group rate, the following factors have the main influence on determining the price of the local authority MPI scheme:</p>  <p>  - standard mortality and morbidity factors based on population actuarial statistics;</p>  <p>  - the local authority borrowers&rsquo; risk profile;</p>  <p>  - the terms and conditions of the local authority MPI scheme and, in particular, the fact that all local authority housing loan borrowers are accepted without medical evidence; </p>  <p>  - the claims experience of the local authority MPI scheme.</p>  <p>  In determining the rate for the local authority MPI scheme, consideration was given to all of the above factors, and the procurement process that was undertaken reflected those requirements.  It is important to also point out that there are a number of additional features of the local authority MPI scheme as follows:</p>  <p>  - in the event of a claim, the insurance covers the amount of the mortgage repayable on death which is similar to standard MPI; </p>  <p>  - the member&rsquo;s mortgage repayments are covered if there is a claim as a result of disability and not death; this additional feature is not included in standard MPI products;</p>  <p>  - an extra cover of &euro;3,000 is also provided in the event of a member&rsquo;s death, which is not included in standard MPI products; </p>  <p>  - the local authority MPI scheme covers members to age 75 for death, while ordinary MPI is usually based on a ceasing age of 65 unless an older age is agreed and priced. </p>  <p>  The Mortgage Protection Committee which oversees the scheme endeavours to achieve a balance between the most economic rate to be charged for the scheme and the benefits provided. </p></reply>

The local authority MPI scheme has applied to all house purchase loans approved by local authorities after 1 July 1986. </p>  <p>  The Consumer Credit Act 1995 applied conditions on lenders which applied to local authorities as well as commercial lenders.  Under section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 the lender is legally required to ensure that a prospective borrower has mortgage protection insurance in place before drawing down a mortgage.  Where a lender offers a particular policy sub-section 2(d) of section 126 of the Act provides that the borrower can source an alternative policy to suit their needs.  However, subsection 2(d) does not apply to local authorities. </p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme.  Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers.  The group policy is a commercial insurance product which is procured in accordance with EU procurement rules.  A local authority housing loan applicant who is not eligible for the local authority MPI scheme must source a suitable comparable individual MPI policy from the market. </p>  <p>  It is not possible to compare standard mortgage protection insurance (MPI) products commercially available with the local authority MPI product.  It is important to note that the local authority MPI scheme covers disability as well as death and that the disability cover is for the full period of the disability and not just 12 months as is the case in the majority of MPI policies available. </p>  <p>  Standard MPI products are individually priced based on a member's age, amongst other factors, whereas the local authority MPI scheme is a group arrangement offering a single group rate per &euro;1,000 sum assured to all participants in the scheme.  As a result, it would not be valid to attribute the difference in cost between this scheme and standard MPI to any one issue as this is not comparing like with like.  Aside from the difference between an individual and a group rate, the following factors have the main influence on determining the price of the local authority MPI scheme:</p>  <p>  - standard mortality and morbidity factors based on population actuarial statistics;</p>  <p>  - the local authority borrowers&rsquo; risk profile;</p>  <p>  - the terms and conditions of the local authority MPI scheme and, in particular, the fact that all local authority housing loan borrowers are accepted without medical evidence; </p>  <p>  - the claims experience of the local authority MPI scheme.</p>  <p>  In determining the rate for the local authority MPI scheme, consideration was given to all of the above factors, and the procurement process undertaken reflected those requirements.  It is important to also point out that there are a number of additional features of the local authority MPI scheme, including:</p>  <p>  - in the event of a claim, the insurance covers the amount of the mortgage repayable on death which is similar to standard MPI; </p>  <p>  - the member&rsquo;s mortgage repayments are covered if there is a claim as a result of disability and not death; this additional feature is not included in standard MPI products;</p>  <p>  - an extra cover of &euro;3,000 is also provided in the event of a member&rsquo;s death, which is not included in standard MPI products; </p>  <p>  - the local authority MPI scheme covers members to age 75 for death, while ordinary MPI is usually based on a ceasing age of 65 unless an older age is agreed and priced. </p>  <p>  The Mortgage Protection Committee which oversees the scheme endeavours to achieve a balance between the most economic rate to be charged for the scheme and the benefits provided. </p></reply>

Once a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household in the administrative area of that local authority.  This function also includes determining when it is appropriate to refer a household for Homeless HAP Place Finder services. </p>  <p>  The Homeless HAP supports and Place Finder Service have been operational since February 2015, across the four housing authorities in the Dublin Region, and are being implemented through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE).  The focus of the interventions remains the transitioning of qualified households from emergency accommodation, including hotels, into private rented tenancies.  To qualify for these specific additional supports available to homeless households, a household must have been determined by the relevant local authority to be homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988.  The operation of local homeless services, including the Place Finder Service is a matter for each local authority.</p></reply>

Section 32 of the 2007 Act sets out responsibilities in respect of general water services functions and includes the installation and maintenance of meters.</p>  <p>  Irish Water has produced Standard Details and a Code of Practice which outlines acceptable design and construction practices for contractors which must be adhered to, to connect to Irish Water infrastructure.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Irish Water that according to this Code of Practice all new housing developments that are currently being completed by contractors are required to have a meter-ready boundary box installed.  Before the establishment of Irish Water, local authorities also applied this requirement.  This applies to new houses; houses where the refurbishment requires planning permission; and apartment blocks which will be fitted with bulk meters.  These pre-installed meter-ready boundary boxes will enable Irish Water to fit meters in developments in a planned programme of works, consistent with recommendations made in the 2017 Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Water Services (JOCFFDWS), to allow for effective leak detection and conservation.</p>  <p>  The Report of the JOCFFDWS, which was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas, includes a number of recommendations in relation to the continued use of metering to support water conservation, to reduce leakages and to ensure compliance with the Water Framework Directive.  My Department continues to work with Irish Water and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities to ensure that effective water conservation arrangements are reflected in investment plans and connection policies.</p>  <p>  In respect of non-domestic properties, local authorities previously had responsibility for the installation of water meters, and they continue to do so on behalf of Irish Water.</p></reply>

Aside from the difference between an individual and a group rate, the following factors have the main influence on determining the price of the local authority MPI scheme:</p>  <p>  - standard mortality and morbidity factors based on population actuarial statistics;</p>  <p>  - the local authority borrowers&rsquo; risk profile;</p>  <p>  - the terms and conditions of the local authority MPI scheme and, in particular, the fact that all local authority housing loan borrowers are accepted without medical evidence; </p>  <p>  - the claims experience of the local authority MPI scheme.</p>  <p>  In determining the rate for the local authority MPI scheme, consideration was given to all of the above factors, and the procurement process undertaken reflected that.  It is important to also point out that there are a number of additional features of the local authority MPI scheme as follows:</p>  <p>  - in the event of a claim, the insurance covers the amount of the mortgage repayable on death which is similar to standard MPI; </p>  <p>  - the member&rsquo;s mortgage repayments are covered if there is a claim as a result of disability and not death; this additional feature is not included in standard MPI products;</p>  <p>  - an extra cover of &euro;3,000 is also provided in the event of a member&rsquo;s death, which is not included in standard MPI products; </p>  <p>  - the local authority MPI scheme covers members to age 75 for death, while ordinary MPI is usually based on a ceasing age of 65 unless an older age is agreed and priced. </p>  <p>  The Mortgage Protection Committee which oversees the scheme endeavours to achieve a balance between the most economic rate to be charged for the scheme and the benefits provided.</p></reply>

Management of the lists of qualified households awaiting accommodation, including the allocation and transfer of tenancies, is a matter for the relevant housing authority in accordance with Sections 20 and 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated Social Housing Assessment and Allocation Regulations, respectively.</p>  <p>  For the purpose of assessing households under the income eligibility criteria, the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 (as amended) prescribe the maximum net income limits that can be set for each housing authority to be applied in assessing an applicant&rsquo;s eligibility for social housing support. </p>  <p>  Income is assessed under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all housing authorities.   Under the policy, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge.  The policy provides for a range of income disregards, and housing authorities also have discretion to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off.  </p>  <p>  The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended, prescribe maximum net income limits for each housing authority, in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard household means policy.  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.</p>  <p>  I understand that many local authorities have internal complaints and appeals systems which may be used to appeal cases.  However, the 2011 Regulations do not provide housing authorities with any discretion to exceed the thresholds that apply to their administrative areas.</p></reply>

The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, <i>www.pyriteboard.ie</i>. </p><p>The scheme is applicable to dwellings, which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established, in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the board must be accompanied by a building condition assessment with a damage condition rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a damage condition rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave.I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion.</p><p>As matters currently stand, the position is that the scheme is based on the information that was available to the Board at the time of its adoption in February 2014 and having regard to the detail set out in the Report of the Pyrite Panel (July 2012).  </p><p>The panel undertook a desktop study, in conjunction with a stakeholder consultation, to establish certain facts in relation to the potential exposure of pyrite in dwellings.  The information was gathered from a number of sources including local authorities, structural guarantee providers, representatives of homeowners, private builders, construction professionals and public representatives and was cross referenced to verify, as far as practicable, its validity.</p><p>Seventy four estates were identified to the Pyrite Panel, as possibly having pyrite.At that time all of these estates were located in the five local authority areas of Dublin City, Fingal, Kildare, Meath and Offaly, although the scheme was subsequently amended in February 2015 in the light of relevant information that emerged in the local authority areas of Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown and South Dublin with regard to pyritic heave in a small number of housing developments, i.e. one development in each of the two local authority areas.</p><p>Any proposal to amend the scheme is, in the first instance, a matter for the pyrite resolution board and any such proposal would require detailed consideration of the evidence.  The recommendations of the pyrite panel, which informed the establishment of the pyrite remediation scheme, were premised on a number of pertinent factors.I would support the view that similar factors would need to be examined by the Pyrite Resolution Board in advance of extending the scheme to other areas, given the scheme is ultimately one of last resort.</p><p>As a minimum, in order to consider the appropriateness or otherwise of amending the scheme, I understand that the Board would require a report addressing the following information: - </p><p>- the extent and severity of damage to dwellings in the local authority area caused by pyritic heave in the subfloor hardcore; </p><p>- verification, if available, that the damage has been caused by pyrite; </p><p>- the background to the occurrence of the damage;</p><p>- details of any structural warranty policies for the dwellings;</p><p>- the history of the estate&rsquo;s construction, numbers, type of dwellings etc;</p><p>- the source of the hardcore supplied to dwellings in the estate; and </p><p>- any supporting geological assessments.</p><p>In addition to the above, the board may also make such further enquiries as it considers necessary in order to assist it in considering the matter.In this regard, it would be advisable for the residents to confirm the nature of the pyrite problems in the area, i.e. do the problems stem from reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material which is giving rise to pyritic heave and consequential significant pyritic damage.  </p><p>The Board may be contacted by phone at Lo call 1890 252842 or by email to info@pyriteboard.ie or alternatively at oireachtasinfo@pyriteboard.ie</p></reply>

As part of its regular on-going management operations, the Department carries out localised annual deer counts on State lands, when appropriate.</p>  <p>  Deer have the potential to impact significantly on woodlands, including the iconic yew, oak and also wet woodlands, within the Park, e.g. by bark stripping of mature trees and preventing regeneration. </p>  <p>  The Department commissioned a comprehensive survey and report in the winter of 2016 on the distribution, population density and population structure of red deer and sika deer in KNP.  The study found that the total estimated red deer density over the entire study area of 13.64km2 was some 708 deer.  </p>  <p>  A further census of areas of the park was commissioned by NPWS Southern Division and conducted in spring 2017.</p>  <p>  As part of the Department&rsquo;s ongoing proactive management of the habitats and species in Killarney National Park, during 2018 it is proposed to conduct a Killarney National Park Deer Census.  This work will be undertaken by external specialists.  It is hoped to initiate this process shortly.</p></reply>

Of my Department&rsquo;s total staff, I understand that some 330 work in the area of natural heritage through the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department.  In addition, my Department takes on in the region of 70 seasonal staff during the year to assist the NPWS. Frontline conservation Rangers are deployed through a regional structure and assignments are determined in light of Departmental business needs and priorities. </p><p>Staffing levels across my Department are kept under regular review in line with emerging business needs and Government policy on public sector pay and staffing as advised by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.Within this staffing context, in addition to conservation management work such as the activities mentioned by the Deputy, officials of my Department carry out scientific research, survey work and monitor compliance with national and European law in relation to nature conservation across the country. They conduct patrols and site visits to enforce the various provisions of national and EU legislation, as required, and many of these officers carry out work in more than one county.  They also investigate, for example, reports of breaches of legislation including illegal snaring or &lsquo;digging out&rsquo; of badgers, as well monitoring compliance at coursing events etc. </p><p>With specific regard to the issues of  rhododendron and  deer management raised by the Deputy, my Department is committed to addressing such activities and has robust management programmes in place. Killarney National Park is managed on an ongoing and proactive basis by experienced NPWS regional management, in line with IUCN principles, the Wildlife Act and EU Law with regard to habitats and species.  </p><p>My Department has for many years pursued a very vigorous multi-faceted approach to the control of Rhododendron in Killarney National Park.  The strategy and programmes forming our approach to tackling this invasive species are based upon sound science and are subject to monitoring, periodic review and adaptation.

There is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure that deer populations occupying the same land resources are managed at sustainable levels, and in a responsible and ethical manner.  Ultimately, however, where deer species are increasing in range and numbers, depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats (especially woodland), culls need to be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.  The Deputy will be aware my Department&rsquo;s regional NPWS staff have conducted several such culls in recent years.</p></reply>

While this vessel is, indeed, older than the one currently used on the service, it is currently undergoing a full refit, in consultation with the Marine Survey Office (MSO) of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport which has statutory responsibility for the safety of passenger vessels in Ireland.</p><p>Once in operation, the new service will be a considerable improvement on that currently provided:</p><p>- The vessel will have a newly installed lift for passengers with impaired mobility.</p><p>- The vessel will be faster than the current vessel and carry more passengers</p><p>- A dedicated bus service will be provided between An Bun Beag and Machaire Rabhartaigh on days when it cannot dock at the latter pier.  Previously, islanders had to arrange taxis from An Bun Beag to Machaire Rabhartaigh.</p><p>- The operator will provide additional cargo services as part of the contract.</p><p>The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has long recognised that Toraigh is unique among the offshore islands.  In addition to ferry services, in 2016, the Department agreed to fund additional winter time helicopter services to Toraigh, moving from a fortnightly to a weekly service.  <b></b></p><p>There has been continuous contact between myself, my Department and representatives of Comharchumann Thora&iacute; in relation to this issue. I have met with representatives from the island on a number of occasions - September 2017, at a public meeting in Toraigh on 12 January 2018, again on 2 February, to discuss the commencement of the contract and islanders&rsquo; concerns. </p><p>Recognising the concerns expressed by islanders, my Department has offered a number of options for future ferry services to Toraigh.  These include:</p><p>- The building of a new vessel to service the island, or the purchase of a new vessel</p><p>- Development of the pier at Machaire Rabhartaigh in order to accommodate any new ves.</p><p>Subsidising the provision of a separate fast ferry service for the island to supplement the new service scheduled to commence on 1<sup>st</sup>April 2018, its existing heavy cargo service and the island&rsquo;s weekly winter air service.  This fast ferry service would require a small boat with a capacity of between 12 and 20 passengers, operating alongside the main service and the island&rsquo;s subsidised weekly winter air service.</p><p>These options have been presented to the representatives from the co-op, who have agreed to consider them and revert to my Department in due course.  </p><p>At every stage of this process, I have reiterated my commitment to pursuing these options.  I would point out that with the exception of the complementary fast ferry service, the options of a newly built, or a newly purchased vessel, and the associated developments at Machaire Rabhartaigh pier will take time to progress.  The Deputy will also be pleased to learn that the development of the pier at Machaire Rabhartaigh and the provision of a new passenger vessel for the island has been included in the new National Development Plan, Project Ireland 2040, announced last week.</p><p>In the meantime, the Department has in place a legal contract to commence the new ferry service provided by R&eacute;alt na Maidne Teo on 1 April 2018.</p></reply>
